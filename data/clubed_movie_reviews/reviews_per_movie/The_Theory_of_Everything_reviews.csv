Your glasses are always dirty.,One might think that this movie would be about esoteric theories that are beyond the capacity for most people.You would be so wrong!This was probably the best love story I have ever seen. I was on the edge of my seat watching Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones) as she did more and more amazing acts of love for Stephan Hawking (Eddie Redmayne). I cannot imagine anyone that fits the definition of love more than she did.Redmayne was brilliant as Hawking.Anthony McCarten took Jane Hawing's book and wrote a screenplay that was a thrill to watch.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"The Theory of Everything - While there is life, there is hope.","""There should be no boundary between human endeavour,"" Stephen Hawking explains during a press conference. It is this line that strikes a chord at the very centre of James Marsh's incredible biopic on one of the most brilliant scientists of our time. The Theory of Everything is not just a story about the science behind the beginnings of our universe, but the science of love; and how life's challenges that we face everyday, shape who we are and what we achieve. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones turn in phenomenal performances as the revolutionary Stephen Hawking and his former wife Jane Wilde. Eddie's mentally and physically challenging role, displaying Hawkings brilliance and motor neuron disease, are extremely commendable and impressive (a sure fire for a Best Actor nomination at next year's Oscars). On the more sensitive side, Felecity displays the endless love and powerful fight Jane brought to the Hawking household. As the years pass, their lives are changed tremendously in very profound and heart-wrenching ways. The movie does not shy away from making Hawking a complex character, as well as Jane, showing both their positive and negative sides. I really liked that the movie was able to shape them into fully well-rounded characters despite the ""romance"" aspect of it. The score for the film is tremendous.. absolutely outstanding! It hits all the right marks, brings upon emotions right when you are on the verge of tears, leaves you in awe after a beautiful monologue, and finishes with a melancholy but very fitting tone. The script and directing were top-notch.. right up there with the best... and the cinematography? give that guy an award already! A masterpiece to watch. While some critics may be quick to judge how the film focuses more on the romance rather than the science that made Hawking so renowned, I believe that the love is what made him who he is today. Human endeavour is endless... Stephen never gave up hope, nor did Jane... and though their lives ended up in different places, it was their years together that displayed to us how a little bit of hope can go a very, very long way.Verdict: A beautiful story that shows how time and love are limitless... no beginning, no end (despite his earlier hypothesis). *****In Theatres: November 7th, 2014 (USA), January 2, 2015 (UK)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are a match made in heaven in James Marsh's biopic...,"Encompassing all the best parts of films like A Beautiful Mind by Ron Howard but creating its own signature and style to the biopic genre, James Marsh's gorgeous and beautifully compelling The Theory of Everything, the true story of Stephen and Jane Hawking, is a sensitive piece of filmmaking that stands as one of the finest movie efforts of the year. Starring Eddie Redmayne as Stephen and Felicity Jones as Jane, the two develop a masterful and sonorous dynamic that behaves as a naturalistic relationship that inhabits qualities of both love and sadness. They're a match made in heaven. Also acting as a morality tale, screenwriter Anthony McCarten puts forth intriguing questions regarding love in the shadow of someone's disability. Do you really know what is asked of you when you vow to love someone in sickness and in health? What happens when disability doesn't allow you to love the way you want? Are you better off just breaking free if you have the chance?The film acts as a moving oil painting. Benoît Delhomme shoots to utter perfection. Intimate in scenes requiring the viewer's undivided attention, and taking the liberty to capture the essence of the time where the innocence of love offers many possibilities. The scenes ultimately feel as if we're in a dream sequence, sleeping silently as these two lives play out in our minds.You don't get any tears or moving feelings without the bravura score of Jóhann Jóhannsson. Criminally overlooked last year in the grand scheme of things for his work on Prisoners, the composer orchestrates his best score of his career. Very likely not just my favorite score of the year so far but one of mine in the last few years. From the opening credits, Jóhannsson puts his stamp with heavy violins and beautiful piano playing. In the end credits, you can sit and marvel as the names cross the screen with the music that accompanies it.When it comes to biopics, people tend to automatically give credit to makeup and body language when talking about a performer. Past winners like Jamie Foxx in Ray have always felt empty as a performance but people were so tied in with the mannerisms that he brought to the role, which he often did in his stand up comedy routines. In Eddie Redmayne, we get a fully realized and tender performance. The first twenty minutes of the film, prior to the diagnosis of Hawking's disease, Redmayne utilizes all the quick wit and charm to show what his Stephen loved the most of his work and his woman. Obviously going through the physical transformation must be rewarded. Contorting his body and learning the physical tics that Stephen Hawking has displayed in real life all ring true. Since his breakout work in Les Miserables, a role that should have landed him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, I was wary to believe I'd revisit a praising session with the young actor so soon. It's one of the best things offered this year.When it comes to Felicity Jones, the emotional backbone of the entire process has to be awarded to her. With stunning works in Like Crazy under her belt, Jones takes upon a daunting and heavily emotional character, never afraid to have the audience dislike or be disappointed in what she's doing. Marsh directs her to astonishing resolve. As a leading lady, Jones ignites such fiery and compelling questions not necessarily asked before in a biopic such as this. Complex and staggering in the way she decides to portray the brave Jane, Jones allows her character to grow, and both live and learn inside of her. What's most remarkable about Jones is she makes everything seem so effortless. She's not faking anything, she's really feeling and becoming Jane. She locates all the emotions required of her to execute successfully. It's a turn I wouldn't be surprised to see runaway with the Academy Award for Best Actress.The supporting players are no shortage of talent, though secondary to this type of story. Charlie Cox was just as good in his screen time. As Jonathan, Cox lays it all out on the table, heart on sleeve, and soul bared for all of us to see. David Thewlis, Emily Watson, and Simon McBurney are all solid but brief.Production Designer John Paul Kelly and Costume Designer Steven Noble should be commended for their meticulous craft in bringing the time period to the screen. An Oxford University dormitory along with a dozen outfits worn by all the characters can easily be taken for granted in a film like this.Screenwriter Anthony McCarten adapts his script from the book ""Travelling to Infinity: My life with Stephen"" which was written by Jane Hawking. Audiences like their fair share of love stories, but some of them, rather most of them, don't like the ugly that goes with it. In real life, people make mistakes, and do things that can make some cringe. I believe some of the more questionable and controversial things during the Hawkings marriage was merely glossed over to not paint them negatively, even though the world is well aware of what went on. I'll be honest, I knew next to nothing about Stephen Hawking and his work prior to sitting for the movie. I knew the robot voice and that's where it about ended. If anything, the film inspires me to learn more about Stephen's work and theories presented. All of those things are definitely given a back seat to a film that doesn't really require them. The Theory of Everything is not about the equations or the mathematics. It's essentially about us. It's about love, and not just in the form of marriage. We as humans learn to love ourselves, our families, and our children. They are placed in our lives but I'm not sure how much we realize what goes into maintaining those relationships. The movie makes you think of those things.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Astounding Oscar worthy performance from Eddie Redmayne,"We are all familiar with the story and with Steven Hawking. His groundbreaking work 'A brief History of Time' and devastating disabilities propelled him irrevocably into the public consciousness and immortal fame.But few of us could understand the complexities of his personal life and the shocking divorce in 1990 from his long sacrificing wife of more than 25 years. Indeed that episode served to darken his reputation in the minds of many, including myself, who felt ill at ease with anyone who could leave a partner who had done so much for him just at the long awaited moment when international fame and recognition finally arrived.This wonderful production, so well scripted and paced throughout, serves to explain that vital anomaly in Hawking's life. And it is made all the more poignant as it is based upon the account written by his wife who has borne so much.But it is the breathtaking performance of Eddie Redmayne as Hawking that simply blasted this film into an extraordinary level. It is difficult enough to mimic so famous a person as Hawking and it is even more difficult to portray so accurately the debilitating and gradually increasing effects of Motor Neuron Disease. But to transmit so clearly the profound emotions and inner suffering that Hawking must have experienced in his agonizing journey was a performance that left me quite speechless and at times in uncontrollable tears.It would be a travesty of the industry if Eddie Redmayne is not nominated for an Oscar after this performance. And to my mind it was a work of art that simply cannot be equaled let alone beaten.Have a good handkerchief ready to hand.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A brief review on this most wonderful time of a film,"What a wonderful accomplishment of a film by James Marsh (Man on Wire) who brings such depth and beauty to the life/love story of Stephen and Jane Hawking. The film is adapted from her novel on their life and brings forth much of the love and tenacity necessary to care for and love someone going through great physical struggles over time. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones give fantastic and intimate portrayals of Stephen and Jane during their courtship and lives together. My vote for best film at this year's Toronto International Film Festival. In Q&A after film James Marsh told a great story about Stephen Hawking's reaction to the film where he gave the response that it was in ""largely genuine""... and Eddie Redmayne said that Stephen Hawking after viewing the film allowed them to use his actual ""voice"" instead of their approximation for the film that they had produced. The most touching was that Hawking had tears to be wiped away after viewing which will give to you a sense of how genuine this film is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Redmayne and Jones are excellent in this heartbreaking love story.,"The Theory of Everything tells the uphill struggle that world renowned genius Stephen Hawking went through when dealing with his, now, infamous disease and trying to maintain his relationship with his loving wife, Jane. The strengths of this film rely solely on Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. These two actors are absolutely, one hundred percent, PHENOMENAL in these two roles. Stephen Hawking is the role that Redmayne was born to play. Hawking is portrayed as a charming and intellectually superior individual that behaves just like any one else. After a bit, we start to wonder what was every so amazing about him...then the heartbreak starts. Jane Hawking is a sweet, loving and determined person that will go to the lengths of the universe to make sure her husband, Stephen can survive. I get chills just thinking about certain scenes, some of which will most definitely be requiring a large box of Kleenex. The truth is, anything that I say here about these performances, no matter what it is, is still criminally underselling the sheer brilliance of them. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are simply incredible and I'd be even willing to go to the extreme to say that both actors will not only be nominated, but I'd be surprised if they didn't win the Oscar gold. Now, with that being said, this film's structural issues are severely hampering this film's chances at being a classic. I wasn't completely sold on the structural integrity of the film. It showed enough of the relationship aspect behind Stephen and Jane but it very briefly touched base on Hawking's intellectual discoveries and I thought that if it was a bit more balanced in that respect, it would be a near perfect film. One plot point that I did find utterly enthralling is the idea that Hawking struggles throughout the film to do simple things. These scenes are, by far, the most heart wrenching scenes to watch. James Marsh directs his actors effortlessly and can evoke the type of emotional response out of his audience through them, but when left with telling a story, Marsh falters. Marsh, known for 2012 IRA drama, Shadow Dancer proves that he is an actor's director. He cares about human drama over anything in a tangible sense, which benefits this film greatly but also harms it in the way of progression. Despite these minor infractions, The Theory of Everything is a film that everyone can enjoy and turns into a real audience movie. It is a film that will have you laughing one minute and crying the next, no easy feat for any film, and this one does it effortlessly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Proof Positive,"This film is highly recommended.You can certainly tell it's Oscar time when all the more dignified and personal projects inundate the movie houses in hopes of capturing the gold. For most of the other nine months, we get lesser efforts and big blockbuster spectacles to fill-in until late October arrives. Then, it's time to get serious about our cinema choices. The Theory of Everything is one such film. It carries its pedigree with style and class, even if it is a rather conventional biopic in disguise, with its main character suffering through a debilitating disease while finding the stamina to go on.With a very literate screenplay by Anthony McCarten and accomplished direction by James Marsh, the film tells the story of famed scientist Stephen Hawking and his battle with ALS. It also concentrates on his relationship with his supportive and loving wife, Jane.Love will conquer all. Or so it should. But the horrors of this disease and the hardships they face seem unsurmountable. We see the couple meet, fall in love, marry, have children, and grow weary of each other. Stephen achieves adoration, fame, and fortune while Jane takes a back seat to her caregiver role and bringing up the family, amid the tears and frustration they face on a daily basis. One immediately empathizes with these characters due to their tragic situations.The two leads are splendid and their acting is peerless. Felicity Jones plays Jane. Her role may be less showy and far more understated, but the actress is perfect at showing Jane's endurance and strength in the subtlest of ways. Eddie Redmayne is Stephen Hawking and his performance is literally trans-formative. (He must have learned his craft from tons of research about Hawking and creative influence from Daniel Day Lewis.) This is an impressive physical performance, from his black horn rimmed glasses to his walking cane and distorted posture. Both will receive well-earned accolades for their memorable work. Fine supporting work by Charlie Cox as Jonathan, their loyal friend, and Simon McBurney as Stephen's father add more clarity to the film.As with most biographical films, one sees the rise and fall of the protagonist before it arrives. This film follows that tries-and-true formula. But Marsh's direction compensates for the linear structure and predictability of the story. The director relies heavily on his actors' subtle actions to tell more about their characters than the mere words they speak. He also wisely shows Hawking's point of view by angling the camera range from a lower stance or keeping it stationary to reinforce the characters' immobility. The final scene, recapping Hawking's life in reverse, beautifully sums up Stephen's life full circle in the most visual of terms.But The Theory of Everything is foremost a love story. The film desperately wants to be a crowd-pleaser with an uplifting message of inspiration, even when the reality and truth of their actual lives is bleaker than it appears on screen. The film glosses over some factual content to play up the human drama of this pair of young lovers. It skillfully manipulates its audience to wallow in the heartbreak. Director Marsh successfully capture the pangs of young love and bittersweet romance in this emotionally involving film.The Theory of Everything is an immensely satisfying film with stand-out acting and skilled direction. The proof is right there on the screen, even if the facts are slightly askew.

"A safe, standard-issue biopic","Acclaimed physicist and cosmologist Dr. Stephen Hawking has devoted his life to the study of space-time, black holes, and the origin of the universe. Whether the universe is ultimately knowable through a series of mathematical equations is as yet undetermined, but it forms the basis of his lifelong goal of finding what he calls ""the theory of everything."" Written by Anthony McCarten and based on the book by Jane Hawking, James Marsh's film, also titled The Theory of Everything, traces Hawking's life from his days at Cambridge University in the 1960s, his lifelong struggle with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and the ups and downs of his marriage to Jane Wilde.The Theory of Everything begins with Hawking, in a masterful physical performance by Eddie Redmayne, as a young university physics student who impresses his professor, Dennis Sciama (David Thewlis) and meets a more artistically-inclined student Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones), who is studying medieval Spanish poetry. We learn fairly quickly that they have a fundamental disagreement. She is religious while he is an atheist who tells her ""I have a problem with the celestial dictator premise,"" though his atheism, for the most part, is glossed over in the film. Before their courtship gets off the ground, however, Hawking's problem with coordination becomes more and more obvious.When he loses his balance and collapses on the pavement, he is taken to the hospital where he is told that he is suffering from a motor neuron disease, known as Lou Gehrig's disease, which will become progressively worse to the point where he will no longer be able to speak, swallow, function on his own, and even breathe. Despite his failing vision and the fact that he is given only two years to live, Hawking sets his mind to his doctoral thesis on the question of ""Time"" and receives his PhD while still in his twenties. Meanwhile his illness progresses to the point where he has to receive a tracheotomy to stay alive, even though it means he can no longer speak.The worsening of his physical condition, however, only makes Jane's commitment to him that much stronger and they are soon married, a marriage that will last thirty years and produce three children. Fortunately, a computer program called Equalizer designed by Walter Woltosz, allows Hawking to ""talk"" by use of a speech synthesizer. Though he is now confined to a wheel chair and his body movements are almost completely constricted, he is able to deliver lectures on subjects he has devoted his life to with the use of the speech device.Jane remains steadfast in her love and support over the years, but the burden of care eventually takes its toll and she is drawn to Jonathan (Charlie Cox), the director of the church choir, while Hawking develops a growing relationship with his nurse Elaine (Maxine Peake). Hawking's intellectual achievements are enormous given his physical condition, yet The Theory of Everything hardly lives up to his inspiration, maintaining a bland level of niceness throughout and providing only a superficial understanding of the main characters. It is a safe, standard-issue biopic that does not probe very deeply, smooths over conflicts and unpopular ideas, and stays away from any form of unpleasantness.While the film covers a considerable length of time, the characters do not seem to age and the stresses and strains that led to the unraveling of Hawking's marriage are not depicted or explained. The film also glorifies the scientific model without questioning whether or not a so-called theory of everything can tell us anything about the underlying nature of reality. Though Redmayne disappears into his character, and captures Hawking's facial expressions and physical disabilities with amazing skill, Marsh's banal, worshipful biopic leaves a black hole where satisfaction ought to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The Theory of Everything,"Before going into and seeing, The Theory of Everything, I really did not know too much about Stephen Hawking. I of course knew who he was and that he was a famous physicist for his work on black holes and other such matters and I had also seen video clips and photos of him, but really knew otherwise next to nothing about him and I have never actually read any of his books, but after seeing the film I am a little tempted and curious to do so, even if the subject matter does go over my head a bit (I both did poorly and did not enjoy high school physics class). On the other hand, those who go into The Theory of Everything, looking for an elaborate account of Hawking's work and his science and the method behind his work, then those people may be in for a bit of a letdown as this story while it does focus on Hawking's life, it mostly focuses on his long marriage and relationship with his wife, Jane, who wrote the book on which the film is based on. The film focuses heavily on the relationship between Stephen and his wife, Jane and the hardships they had to deal with due to his various health problems that he developed when they first become interested in each other till the present time. Eddie Redmayne, who plays Hawking, does a phenomenal job here. He starts out as a shy, somewhat bookish and nerdy student who has a fair bit of humour to him and also has a love of education and finding out the big questions and answers of the world. As his illness develops and progresses over the years, we see how hard it is for him to move, speak and just do everyday things whereas he is eventually confined to a wheelchair and has to speak through a computer. Redmayne's performance is so believable and must have been really hard to pull off as we see him struggle to eat, walk, speak and just how he twists his face and muscles and how much physical difficulty and pain is involved in this as well as his strong desire to succeed and to achieve more and more each day is evident in Redmayne's wonderful performance which must have been exhausting and difficult to play, but he does an excellent job here in what I think is one of the year's best performances. Equally good here is Felicity Jones, who plays Jane. While the role is not as demanding physically, it is more demanding emotionally as we see her totally devote herself to all of Stephen's every waking needs and how she went out of her way to both care and love for him. At times it was certainly difficult and I am sure she just wanted to give up, but we also as in him, see her determination to make things work and she is an incredibly strong person and character and you can see that everything she does has her full best and wonderful intentions. Her performance is an emotional one and is beautifully and brilliantly portrayed as well and is also one of the year's best performances. When the film first started out, I thought it would be a fairly safe and by the numbers biopic, but it really took me by surprise at how interesting I found these characters, their lives and the situations they found themselves in. Again because of the brilliant performances and masterful script and direction we can both care for and have empathy for these characters as well as personally cheer them on and wish all the best for them as we are sitting quietly in our theatre screens glued to the screen with captivation and interest. The film has an excellent pace to it and works well as a biographical film, but works even better as a story of love and the difficulties and sacrifices it took to make it work and just how strong both Stephen and his wife are at the end of this film after all they have gone through. It really is an inspirational and feel good film when you think about it after all they accomplished and went through. Sure there are moments of heartache and when we see them suffer, but it is not all grim. We also see moments of happiness and how these two, from the second they met, really do love each other and had a marriage full of trust and devotion to one another. The film is doing well in limited release and expanded wider in theatres this week and I feel very privileged to have been able to see it on the big screen. It is thoroughly fascinating from start to finish and features two of this year's most believable and best performances and also gives us hope and encouragement while we may be not exactly in their same circumstances, but for other things as well. The Theory of Everything, is a real triumph and one of the best films of 2014.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Totally cliché, though also totally inoffensive","A biopic of Stephen Hawking, mostly focused on his relationship with his first wife, Jane (the film is based on her own autobiography). It has little interest in what Stephen Hawking is about, except for very cursorily. I guess that's not a huge problem, but, frankly, I don't know that much about Hawking and wished I had gotten to learn more from this movie. It does deal a lot with his disease and health struggles, which I suppose many are more interested in. The film will surely be most notable for its two lead performances. Eddie Redmayne certainly nails the physical side of Hawking and projects a very clear character. Felicity Jones, though, does better work as the woman who has to work very hard to make their lives work. No one else really registers much (though David Thewlis and Emma Watson, among many others, are featured), but that doesn't really matter. The filmmaking is competent but not notable. James Marsh, best known for his documentaries Man on Wire and Project Nim, has done good work in feature filmmaking before with the underrated The King. Here he doesn't get much to register. My favorite thing besides the lead performances was the very pleasant score, by Johan Johansson. Probably worth seeing on video, but don't go out of your way.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Great romantic movie about a brilliant man, ironically very little science","But it does tell an inspiring story about Stephen Hawking's personal struggle with his illness that's very uplifting.The story of Stephen Hawking and his then wife Jane, apparently based on a book she wrote about it, which probability explains why there was not much science in the movie, not that I'm complaining, as it was a well played film about a difficult relationship.I didn't known Stephen and his wife actually met around the same time as he began to suffer from Lou Gehrig's Disease. Makes the whole concept that Hawking has three kids with this woman more interesting (something was working). Felicity Jones did a great job playing such a strong, patient, and compassionate woman, all well narrated in this movie. The difficulty Jane Hawking had being with a man getting trapped in his own body, played by Eddie Redmayne.I have herd of Hawking's surprisingly positive personality, not because of his condition, but because I expected his condition would make it hard to express any emotion. Redmayne did his research to express the struggle of Hawking on camera nicely (I keep forgetting The Hawking is a Brit).This movie turned out to be a great one about the time span of a relationship. Done more romantically than borderline soft-core flicks like Blue is the warmest color and 9 songs, and it was not as depressing as Blue Valentine. it was just a true take on a complex relationship taking it's toll, well performed by some brilliant actors.If your looking to watch this movie to hear some science talk, that's not what the movie is really about, unless ironically convincing the world of his theories on time was really as easy as the movie makes it out for Hawking. Overall very enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The Theory of Almost Everything,"Saw 'The Theory of Everything' as someone who like biographical dramas (even if a lot play liberties with the truth), especially the inspiring ones that have a lot of emotional impact (and there are plenty of those out there), and who was interested in both the subject matter and Stephen Hawking himself. The trailer was also appetising and then there was the awards attention.After finally seeing it, after it being on my long ""to see"" list that got bigger and bigger, as my music and course commitments grew, for a while, found 'The Theory of Everything' a good film with several superb elements that could have better considering the subject. While critically praised, audience reaction leans towards the more positive but more divisive for reasons that are understandable, being someone who agrees with a few of the criticisms if not all.There is the agreement that 'The Theory of Everything', being based on his first wife's memoir meaning there is a lot of his personal life, could have focused more on what made Hawking so brilliant as a scientist/cosmologist, how he contributed to the subject with his theories, his importance to it and how he was perceived, there wasn't enough of that.Another criticism that is shared by me is the rushed and jumpy nature of the narrative as a result of trying to cram a lot and there is the sense that in doing that that it tried to do too much.However, 'The Theory of Everything' is photographed and designed beautifully, while it's sensitively directed, by someone who clearly had a passion and sympathy for what was focused on, and hauntingly scored.It is a thoughtfully written film and explores his heavily-focused on personal life with delicacy, little one-sidedness and a lot of charm and emotional power (motor neurone disease is a horrific condition to suffer from and that was handled heart-wrenchingly). Also found myself inspired and learning a good deal.Eddie Redmayne gave one of that year's best performances, a truly poignant and powerful performance and a career best thus far. His make-up is remarkable. Felicity Jones is the emotional back-bone of the story in a way and it is just as much about her as it is with him, and her acting is subtle and warm while showing Jane as having as as many flaws as she did strengths. The chemistry between them has a lot of heart.Charlie Cox, David Thewlis and Maxine Peake are strong support but it's the two leads' show all the way.All in all, good film that could have been a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Prepare to disappear into a black hole of emotion,"The Theory of Everything is an extremely moving love story concerning the brilliant British scientist Stephen Hawking and his first marriage. Whilst you may need a PhD in Physics to understand the intricacies of Hawking's theories (which by coincidence I have and – no – it's not enough) the lack of any sort of Physics knowledge is not a barrier to enjoying this movie.Starting in 1963 when Hawking is starting his PhD studies in Cambridge University, the story picks up with the geeky and socially inadequate Hawking as he sparks a (rather unlikely) relationship with the extremely attractive Jane (Felicity Jones from ""The Invisible Woman""). If this segment of the film had a hashtag it would be #punchingabovehisweight. Greatly encouraged by his mentor Dennis Sciama – generally seen as the father of modern cosmology and played by the ever reliable David Thewlis – Hawking develops his extraordinary theories (and counter-theories) in the hot-house of a 1960's Cambridge. Fate cruelly steps in though with Hawking developing the Motor Neuron Disease with which he is now famously associated. Given he was given just 2 years to live, he clearly has a private black hole somewhere to have warped time for the last 60+ years! As biopics go, this is an exceptionally good one. Eddie Redmayne's Hawking is just mesmeric. Hawking himself, on being given the opportunity to see the film before its world premiere, commented that at times he thought he was watching himself. The depths of physical and emotional acting Redmayne displays with this performance has to be seen to be believed, and I will personally eat my hat if Redmayne does not get at least an Oscar nomination for this part. (And who wouldn't want to see Hawking himself roll out to announce an award at the Kodak theatre!).Felicity Jones is also outstanding in the role of Jane. The film is based on Jane Hawking's own book although screenwriter Anthony McCarten has taken a few liberties with the life story for dramatic effect. As referenced above, Hawking has seen the film and he was reportedly so moved that he shed a tear and then offered the use of the actual audio from his speech synthesizer for the film. So in this sense, Hawking narrates his own dialogue in the latter half of the film, which is quite a coup.Supporting actor parts are also great from an ensemble cast with Simon McBurney (""Magic in the Moonlight"", TV's ""Rev"") as Hawking's father, Harry Lloyd as Hawking's university friend Brian and Charlie Cox as the 'family friend' Jonathan being particularly effective.The director is James Marsh, best known for his gripping documentaries ""Man on Wire"" and ""Project Nim"", and the cinematographer Benoît Delhomme (""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"") realising a wonderfully nostalgic vision of 60's Cambridge. Also notable is the beautifully fitting music by Islandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson - I fully expected this in the credits to be the omni-present Alexandre Desplat, but for once I was wrong! So a 'must see' in the run up to the Oscar season, but one to take lots of tissues to if you are affected by emotional films: this one seemed to be particularly impactful on the females in the audience - perhaps because it tells the love story from the perspective of Jane - with my wife virtually in tears throughout! (Or maybe that's just because the realisation has finally struck that she's been married to a PhD physicist for 30 years??!).(If you enjoyed this review please see my archive of other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and subscribe to receive more).",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A wonderful Biography of a wonderful man,"The life of a young, brilliant student gets thrown apart when he finds out that he has about two years left, as a result of a terrible, regressive disease.

Although encountering many problems along the way, especially when talking about his health, he continues to amaze the world with his research, so many people come to bring him hope or even technical help, which will allow him to communicate and ultimately aid him in his pursuit of finding an unique and simple equation which will solve everything.It's a dramatic biography of one of the most brilliant minds the world has ever seen, filled with suspense, love, friendship, struggle but also relief and success.

Theory of Nothing: highly overrated generic tripe,"This is 2014's most overrated film of the year. While Eddie Redmayne is good as Stephen Hawking, it's really just a performance that deceives the viewer and critic. He looks like Hawking. His hair and clothes look like Hawking. He does the 'Hawking' smile and weird thinking stare face and frowns. Yes, he does a believable Hawking. Well done. But it's just a glorified impersonation. There's no actual great acting or stretch of a transformation or method or scenes that Redmayne is tested as an actor nor Hawking's character development. The dialogue and interactions, aside from using actual Hawking quotes from speeches and writings, are awful and boring and redundant and derivative. The whole performance is mild and plain, and the story is weak. The story has generally been done before. There are no significant scenes or moments that go above and beyond anything generic, nor anything for Redmayne to truly bite into to 'perform.' Even the accident and fall portion of the film is mild and never really becomes that emotional at all. Mostly, the film fails miserably in exploring Hawking's internal thoughts, imagination, rituals, and inspirations.It plays like a T.V. movie. And quite frankly i'm tired of these Hollywood films doing biopics about an ENTIRE life, using montage and generic moments that aren't specific or significant enough. Biopics that are focused on a period on a life is more interesting than trying to do a whole life in two hours. There's no sense of Hawking and his children in his life. Births are fast-tracked, montage child play and smiles. The film gives you an impression of just Jane, his wife, being a vessel for children. There's no sense of Hawkings personal life, interests, time spent, or anything underpinning the vast ideas he develops. We see him on a beach or being pushed in a wheelchair by family as piano plays. The film is devoid of politics or popular culture and changing times of each decade other than clothes as lazy indicators, and the exception of pointing out Penthouse a few times as some recurring wink wink joke to convey Hawking as some sexual guy. This 'sexualized' Hawking happens throughout the film in various ways...""so Stephen, do some things still 'work.'"" The movie mostly follows Jane and her torn affair with some choir priest. In fact, Jane is in more scenes and gets more to act on screen than Stephen Hawking (and Redmayne for that matter). The story is more focused on tripe romance and affair rather than Hawking. And even when departing, a montage is set in again. No emotional development is organic. And, perhaps, maybe as brilliant as Hawking is and as tragic as his condition is, maybe he's just a boring guy and not much can be that interesting in terms of a character on film in scenes other than a guy sitting in a wheelchair mumbling and smiling and frowning. The film would've done a better job with Hawking's imagination and space interpreted in shots, as well as the times he was living in and absorbing and watching as opposed to generic renderings of his domestic life (which was still mild and safe compared to the actual reality) and Jane's struggle and perspective. Everything is furthered by cued dramatic music and montage and shots of faces occasionally. By trying to cram in broad strokes in writing the film into a corner with Jane's story, the theory of everything becomes theory of nothing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Excellent, but not Cliff Notes on Quantum Mechanics","I've read scientists are turned off by this film for its omissions, simplifications, falsities, and other failures to explain Prof. Hawking's theories. I can understand that, being a law specialist who can't watch law dramas. But if you're not a cosmologist or a physicist you should not be discouraged by the film's failure to give you enough detail for a two credit course. It's a good drama of people, a bit schmaltzy as befits the facts, and in that regard I understand it's pretty accurate, and is definitely well acted and directed. Also a nice glimpse of what Oxbridge life was like in the 1950s. As they say, the male lead is Oscar bait.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Worth watching,"A melodrama about the life of Stephen Hawking. It's exactly what you can expect from a movie like that, but it's pretty well done. the movie focuses on the disease and the family relationships, while touching the science aspect once in a while, explaining it to the layman.Eddie Redmayne is very good in his role, convincingly playing Hawking and making the performance very believable. His looks is very to Hawking himself, so that helps too. Felicity Jones is OK in her role.Good low-key score by Johann Johannsson.I haven't checked how accurate the movie is, but it's based on a book written by his wife and according to IMDb's trivia, Stephen Hawking liked it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Engaging in parts,"I have watched a couple of documentaries on Dr. Stephen Hawking which made me a bit skeptical about The Theory of Everything as Hollywood tends to change historical facts for dramatic impact, while The theory of everything is guilty of this cardinal sin as well it's still a decent experience if you approach it as a film about two young persons in love and a disease which threatens it. The theory of everything is a romantic film and not a biographical and a scientific one which luckily works out in it's favour, there is less focus on the works of Dr. Hawking and more focus towards the relationship he shared with his wife Jane Wilde Hawking.The film does get predictable often but the films pulls through due to the earnest performance by the two leads and hits some satisfying emotional highs. Eddie Redmayne has never played a lead in any film but when he gets a chance in this, he hits a homerun, the amount of research and effort he has put into this role net him an Oscar nomination and who knows maybe even a win. Felicity Jones is incredible herself as Jane, she is the backbone for the Hawking family, she takes care of the house, the children, helps Stephen with his books and research. However this is the second time I have seen Felicity Jones aging on screen improperly, while every character ages normally Felicity Jones doesn't look that old compared to her co-stars, her make up isn't up to the mark and she always looks young, this was prevalent in another film of hers- The Invisible Woman. Lastly, if you take out the good acting out of the film you aren't left with much but it's still a decent watch because it provides some very strong emotional highs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Great Movie But Not Focused on Science,"Going into the movie I was expecting to look at a great piece of cinema as well as learn about the life of Stephen Hawking and his scientific ideas. I was quite disappointed in the lack of information presented. When there was scientific theories presented or the ideas of Hawking himself they were briefly covered and not in depth at all. I learned very little (and this is coming from someone who has about average education in the field) and was rather disappointed in this aspect. The acting in this movie was phenomenal. It was very, very good, and I was truly impressed. Personally, the cinematic quality is not nearly as important as the overall content, which I felt was lacking. I am not into a lot of romance movies and I can very easily see how someone would have a different opinion, but I wish that it had more scientific ideas attached to it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Totally Disappointing,"This type of movie must be factually correct above everything else. Instead it is a hodgepodge of 50% theatrics, 49% personal life drama and 1% science and even that of questionable accuracy.For example, it seems to imply that the theory of singularity was developed by Hawking and it was immediately hailed by the scientific world which is totally at odds with the account given by Hawking himself in his own book.The theory of stellar collapse was developed by Subrahmanyam Chandrasekhar on board a ship on his way to England for higher studies at Cambridge. It was based on his flash of insight that while Pauli Exclusion Principle is limited by Relativity, Gravity is not and therefore when a star above a certain mass (later named Chandrasekhar Limit) begins to collapse, it completely disappears into a mathematical abstraction called singularity. This shockingly alien concept was hotly contested by the scientific orthodoxy and ferociously attacked by his supervisor Sir Arthur Eddington and opposed by Einstein himself even though the mathematics was irrefutable (""A Brief History of Time"", P. 83-85).In fact, Eddington's hostility was so vicious that Chandrasekhar had to switch his field of study although it later formed the foundation of the theory of Black Holes which was built upon by others like Oppenheimer. Arthur I. Miller's ""Empire of the Stars"" gives a detailed account of Chandrasekhar's scientific career and his rivalry with Eddington.Hawking is unquestionably one of the most brilliant minds of our time but to credit him with the achievement of another brilliant mind and to totally distort history does grave injustice to both of them and misguides the viewers.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

A magicians trick but ...,".. arguably a very good one.A small hat is presented to the audience. The magician turns it inside out and shows there is nothing there.He lays it down. Waves his hand over it.

This is the sort of film that Ron Howard usually makes, but nonetheless the audience is in capable hands.Redmayne is superb, the illusion is greater because he LOOKS like Hawking. Astonishing.Jones is centre of the film. Every film needs a centre and you could do worse than than beautiful and magical Felicity Jones.Her astonishing beauty (a perfectly symmetrical face and oversize eyes) depends for impact on getting just the right camera angle. This allows the director, by picking the angles, to use her beauty like a weapon with which to harpoon the viewer in key scenes.

Beautiful,"The theory of everything is probably one of the best movies I've seen so far this year. Everything about and around it has its own right space. The story is more about Jane (Felicity Jones) rather than professor Hawking - in fact it's an adaptation of the book ""Traveling to Infinity: my life with Stephen"" by Jane Hawking. It's her fight for her love for Stephen first, and then against his disease. She is the strongest character, even though the public easily sympathizes with everyone. They are people who have encountered difficulties in their lives and they feel extremely pure. The script is well written: the fact that it is focused more on the personal life of Stephen Hawking makes it easier to follow, although dealing a little more with his professional research would have made it deeper and maybe more philosophical. The cast simply does a great job and Eddie Redmayne's performance is superb and outstanding - hopefully it will bring him a Best Leading Actor Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

EVERYTHING!!!.....EVERYTHING????....Well......ALMOST!!!!,"FIRST: Let us FOCUS on the Title´s Content and Context.....Quite Literally.... Expecations are EVERYTHING! And I must say that mine were SKY HIGH... Before viewing!And although I tried my very best to keep them in check, when I sat down to watch this, unfortunately, my expectations were just like what I mentioned earlier! Perhaps, just a tad TOO high...PLEASE Don't get me wrong! EVERYTHING is both an exquisitely well-made film and a rather delicious, interesting and quite entertaining experience! Here, I will make my very best effort to explain exactly why this is the case.EVERYTHING jump starts itself by introducing us to a rather soft-spoken, nerdy (what else?) young Physics doctoral
candidate: One Stephen Hawking! Within minutes, we are inserted into the stop-motion bloom of Stephen and Jane's
surprisingly intense and, yes, sweet relationship!In its early minutes, we also get some foreshadowing of Stephen's ominous deteriorating health, which, obviously, in and of itself, will not prove to be the least bit surprising to anyone watching the film. EVERYTHING is clearly Stephen Hawking from his first wife, Jane's perspective. Considering that the movie is based on her book, could it have been anything else? As a logical result, what we get here is a focus on Stephen Hawking the man, the husband; his private persona, much more than his public and professional persona!Will this emphasis on his relationship with Jane and his prolonged struggle with ALS and its debilitating effects, leave some people feeling somewhat shortchanged? Undoubtedly, there will be some. EVERYTHING isn't completely devoid of moments that underscore Hawking's scientific mindset and insight, however...They're just not nearly as many as one might expect, particularly in light of exactly who he is and what he has done to achieve fame! I prefer not to go into any more detail, because we wouldn't want any SP**LERS.... now would we?An interesting personal anecdote in relation to Mr. Hawking: For many years, I naturally assumed that he was an American...Why? Well, as I'm sure perhaps millions of you have noticed, when he speaks, using what has come to be considered his trademark computerized voice, he clearly speaks with an American accent! To my chagrin, just a few years back, did I discover that it was simply a case of AMERICAN technology determining to use its own voice!EVERYTHING's only real shortcoming? Quite honestly, the movie seems to do a lot of ""Reelin In the Years!"" during its last three-quarters of an hour, or so. To clarify that a bit, the movie constantly skips forward a few years at a time, briefly shows us a new son or daughter, for example, in a couple scenes, then jumps forward a couple years and repeats this process! Perhaps the sheer volume of detailed events in Hawking's life would have been better served by presenting them in a four or six hour mini-series? Just a parting opinion!8********....

Genius There Behind the Scenes,"I really enjoyed the wonderful acting in this film. Both leads and a couple of the supporting cast are top notch. What occurred to me after seeing it and reveling in the characterization is that while it's a nice love story, it could have been about almost any talented person who hooks up with an amazing, loyal woman. What I am saying is it is more a story of triumph than a story about Stephen Hawking and what he truly is. We see his day to day existence and his conquest of strife, but we know little of the professional man other than the rewards he receives and the controversy he engenders. Of course, he is the representation of modern physics and cosmology, but that is left for us to read for ourselves. There are documentaries exploring his life as a physicist and some are superior to this. Nevertheless, the love story where one gives all one has for another is hard to dismiss. I found out that Eddie Redmayne spent time with the great genius in order to capture his essence. He spoke of Hawking's great sense of humor and what an incredible labor it is to be him. This will probably be nominated for some Oscars, but beyond the acting categories I don't see much else.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Your average docu-movie,"Its premise starts off with a similar vein as movies like a beautiful mind and imitation game, although with varying degrees of difference. I would say the main issue with the movie is that it was archetypal, the audience could guess what would happen next. So how do you portray a movie with an expected outcome? You focus on the mood and the journey instead, and that's what the movie did. With some expressive scenes although I felt some were over dramatized, but overall it worked, it was entertaining. That is why I justify a 6, not a bad movie in its own way but one that doesn't merit much originilaty. Good camera work and scene layouts though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"A story about illness, almost no science","This movie completely misses the mark. The world is interested in Stephen Hawking for his scientific contributions to the world. The fact he has a horrible illness is incidental. This movie drags the viewer through the weeds of Hawking's pain and suffering and never let's up until the final minutes of the movie. It was exhausting to watch and leaves the viewer with no real answers to the questions they came to better understand, explore and enjoy.For example, questions like these never get addressed what exactly are Hawking's contributions? How have they shaped thinking and helped develop a better understanding of the universe? Why was Hawking's PhD thought to be so magnificent and why did Hawking later seek to disprove his original theory? Did he disprove the original theory? How has Hawking been able to live so long despite a two year prognosis given in 1963? What lead Hawking to consider the existence of god?Hawking is played by Eddie Redmayne who does a fabulous job making you feel as though you are watching Hawking himself.This movie is about a man with a horrible illness who happens to be a magnificent scientist.

Hawking Deserves Better,"Disappointing, by-the-book biopic of Stephen Hawking, who certainly deserves better!

The cinematography is all over the map, switching from one color scheme to the next throughout, as if the cinematographer just couldn't decide what to go with.But, there is little science mentioned or discussed, and when it is, it is done as unimaginatively as possible. Biopics often run the risk of just hitting the same biography notes time after time. And, that's what happens here.

more like Theory of Nothing,"I was hugely disappointed by this film after all the hype.First niggle was seeing Jane Hawking played by a model actress. That made her attraction to the awkward and frankly not very charming young version of Stephen Hawking difficult to believe.A major problem throughout was over use of soft focus, it made the whole thing feel very unreal.It hardly touched on Stephen's work at all. All it seemed to say was he got praise for one idea and then got praise for another idea that contradicted his first. Hardly portraying the work of a genius, which Stephen undoubtedly is.So OK it's supposed to be a love story then. What love story? I felt no real chemistry between the two leads at all.Then there is the chocolate box representation of middle England and the stereotypical characters in it, again all in soft blinking focus.As for Eddie Redmayne's performance it was OK but I did not find it at all engaging. It was a good physical impression of Stephen Hawking but where was the passion, where was the angst? Sadly missing for me.One final niggle, there is a scene towards the end where Stephen is supposed to be conversing with Jane and it is absolutely clear that there is no way he could be creating the text on his computer in the speed required to produce the conversation we see.I watched it with my wife on Valentine's day eve and she was equally unimpressed.How this film can be considered for any Oscars is a total mystery to me.

Grand Performance by Redmayne,"The Theory of Everything (2014)*** (out of 4)Tender drama about the trying relationship between Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and wife Jane (Felicity Jones) as tragedy strikes their lives early when Stephen is diagnosed with a neurological disease that will soon take away his ability to move and talk. Stephen is given two years to live but plans on using his mind to get as much done as possible with the assistance of his wife.THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is a story that a lot of people are going to know very well but I will admit that I knew very little about the subject, his life or his work. I pretty much went into the film not knowing what to expect in terms of the story and there's no question that the work this man has done is quite remarkable. Not only is his work remarkable but the fact that he's overcome all of these obstacles is something amazing.As far as the film goes, I thought there were certainly some flaws along the way but there's no doubt that it features some of the greatest performances of the year including Redmayne who turns in one of the most memorable performances in decades.While watching Redmayne, I couldn't help but think of silent star Lon Chaney. Chaney was known for not only his make-up effects but the various ways that he could deform his body and play a wide range of characters. Watching Redmayne pretty much cripple himself from one scene to the next was amazing to watch. In fact, it's hard to take your eyes off of him with the various twitches in his body and the way the actor pulls it off.There's no a single frame here where you feel like you're watching an actor. It really does seem as if you're watching someone battle this disease. Once the character loses the ability to speak, there's a sequence where Hawkings breaks down and it's an incredibly powerful sequence. Jones is also extremely good in her supporting, not-as- flashy role. She perfectly brings a certain toughness to her character that obviously she would need to survive the entire ordeal. Emily Watson, David Thewlis and Charlie Cox all add wonderful support.The film also contains some great cinematography and a very strong, emotional score.As I said earlier, there were certainly some flaws in the film including the opening twenty-minutes, which I thought were rather weak. It really took me a while before I warmed up to the characters and the story but things certainly pick up once the illness hits. THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING still features one of the strongest performances you're going to see and that's reason enough to check the movie out.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
An (Ironically) Uninspired Effort,"Despite not being a total genius like Stephen Hawking, everyone should take pleasure in living during a time when they have their own Einstein or Edison. The Theory of Everything tells the tragic, yet inspiring, story of Hawking from his youthful Cambridge years to the miserable deterioration of his body through the following decades by ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). A brilliant mind, this man has birthed a totally new path for quantum theory/mechanics that is so crucial to our understanding of the universe—his ceaseless search for the answers or just that single convenient explanation of what this largely enigmatic world truly is and how it came to be. Are the answers simply derived from our perceptions of time and space? There's no denying that Hawking is an ingenious and fairly eccentric individual, but does his life exactly warrant another Oscar bait of a biopic? Or rather, does it translate well?Well, without even any attempt at establishing an authentic and aesthetically distinct atmosphere, The Theory of Everything rushes us right into the romance as soon as it commences. Main character attends a crowded party with his more enthusiastic friend. He sights a beautiful girl. Girl, out of miraculous coincidence, notices him with a fancy as well and learns his name. Boom, they meet there and then. Storytelling can't get any lazier and more formulaic than that. Moreover, that concisely introduces us to the tone and style the rest of the film will assume. The screenplay is simplistically boiled down to please crowds with every inspirational platitude and heartwarming comment. As a deliberate tearjerker through and through, it will oftentimes slip in a brief humorous exchange of dialogue to calm the weepers down. Fundamentally, the script is highly predictable in its structure and manner—something you would expect a traditional mindset to adore, which includes the Academy. Bless its heart, the film is so naïve and overly optimistic that its complementary visual appearance/cinematography turns out so bright and unremarkable that might suit it more for a BBC show.This is exactly the result I expected from another entry in the period piece/biographic genre that follows an extraordinary human being but tries too hard to make him sympathetic and relatable to audiences. We witness a very saintly portrait of Stephen Hawking—never losing temper or making moral mistakes. Even when touching on the more controversial aspects of Hawking's beliefs like his attitude towards religion and the ""Creator,"" the picture executes this all in a way that appeases everyone once again and sweeps any atheistic ideas under the rug quickly, surely believing that such material might prove to be too condescending or alienating for its viewers.On the other hand, the majestically melodic score by Jóhann Jóhannsson remains one of the film's greatest elements, but the sheer exhibition of acting talent here is definitely what takes the spotlight. Of course, there's the showy, but very effective, performance from Eddie Redmayne, which is juxtaposed with a much more subtle and nuanced performance from Felicity Jones who wears the mien of utter exhaustion and deep concern with her throughout a depressing, albeit very admirable and encouraging, life that's spent nurturing her ""companion."" It's these two wonderful performances that provoke wild emotion from moviegoers and essentially take the movie beyond the level of generic fodder that it occasionally comes frighteningly close to. At the end of the day, if you're one to allow sentimentality to take over and thus excuse a transparent lack of inspired, brave artistry, then The Theory of Everything might very well win you over. Otherwise, this is the kind of film that might possibly be included in numerous discussions during awards season and then placed into the group of forgettable made-for-Oscars biopics a year later.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The Theory of Everything,"""One: remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two: never give up work. Work gives you meaning, purpose and life is simply empty without it. Three: if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away.""""However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope.""Stephen HawkingThe Theory of Everything deals with the life of the famous physicist Stephen Hawking. If you don't know who he is: he's arguably the most brilliant mind alive today; and his life from school to when he gets this disease and if you also don't know what it is: it's pretty much why you dumped a bucket of ice on your head last summer. In this movie Eddie Redmayne gives a really impressive performance embodying this physicist; performance which grants him an Oscar nomination for best actor in a leading role. In fact, as it is a progressive disease, every stage of this disease is like a completely new performance for him. You witnessed how he has to adapt and communicate in certain way. All this process of learning how to cope with this terrible disease, how how his family's relations change throughout the film and his romance is very interesting. Undeniably Felicity Jones is an absolute revelation, she is incredible, and totally deserves her Oscar nomination for best actress in a leading role. They both brilliantly portrayed good people in a shitty situation. Above all this film is about all Stephen Hawking's life aspects: from schooling, his theory, his disease and his relationships. However the film is not really showcasing and focusing mainly on his theory but on his life journey. The little chunks of science are really accessible though, as Stephen Hawking is explaining his theory such as everyone can get it. Finally, there are twists and turns that surprised me at times. Now I really hope Jupiter Ascending is good because otherwise it will ruin Eddie Redmayne' career and I am going to be really really sad.Overall The Theory of Everything fully deserves its Oscar nomination for best picture, it is really good. It is an engaging, romantic and touching movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A different take on Hawking's work and life,"This movie is based on the book written by Hawking's first wife Jane Wilde. It covers the period from 1963 to 1997. If you are interested to hear about Stephen Hawking's theories in great detail you better watch The 2013 BBC documentary/movie ""Hawking"" currently on Netflix. This movie does take into account Hawking's theories but the focus is on his personal and family life.And it does a very good job at portraying his first marriage and the love and devotion of his devout wife through the course of Hawking ALS disease. Some have slighted this movie for not covering Hawking's theories in too much detail, but there is already a good BBC film on the scientific discoveries of Hawking, so a rehash of the same territory would have been a waste of time and effort.The movie focuses on Hawking's first marriage. It covers how he and Jane Wilde fell in love and married despite Hawking ALS diagnosis and a prognosis of death within 2 years. It is presented with humor and grace and tenderness. It traces Hawking's gradual deterioration from walking with difficulty with canes, to crawling up the stairs, to getting wheelchair bound, to losing his voice and yet surviving and not succumbing to the disease in 2 years as was the prognosis. The movie shows the toll the disease took on Hawking's wife that led finally to the separation and finally divorce.The acting in this movie is very good, played with understatement and sincerity. The humor is endearing. It is not the definitive film on Hawking, but restores a balance that was missing in the BBC documentary/movie.

The Love of a Woman,"The Theory of Everything well everyone thought the main scope is about how Sir Stephen Hawking develop the Space time Singularities and the Hawking Radiation, but is not entirely, The main inspirational source is from Sir Hawking Ex-Wife Jane Wilde memoir, Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen. This story told us that Love will inspire, it is love that makes people keep moving, and it is Love that giving us something to move on. Jane's love and sacrifice her passion made Sir Hawking move on and developed the most beautiful formula with a single theorem that explain the whole Universe. Without love, how worthless this world will be. Redmayne and Jones is tremendous in the plot, I love every part for Jones her expression is one of the best and I can feel the love she had given in the film. You will feel sad for the disease Sir Hawking that has, you will feel sorry for Jane, but you will discover the beauty of the story.

Don't be fooled by the hype,"How does the mind of an Oscar voter work? What do they think makes a good movie? That is a question even Stephen Hawking, one of the smartest men on the planet, couldn't answer. Every year the Academy states manipulative and boring message movies, conventional true stories and occasionally something that actually deserves to be nominated before us and claim they are the best films of the year. The Oscars are a joke. The latest evidence for that is The Theory of Everything. It's an awards bait movie so they lapped up its true story about a man who overcomes difficult circumstances. They can never resist that. Still, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones deserved the award nominations. Jones is the emotional backbone of the movie and has to carry a lot of it, while Redmayne's performance is not only emotionally involving, it's an incredible physical performance too. Still, the true story of Stephen Hawking and his wife leaves out 2 key things: Firstly Stephen Hawking is a scientist and this has barely any science. Secondly, they sugar-coat the romance which really wasn't the fairy tale it's depicted as.TTOE is well directed up to a point and has various emotional moments. You can't help but get caught up in it occasionally and it does move you, although how a film about a man with Motor Neurone Disease is rarely ever harrowing is a baffling mystery. It's well done technically, so what's letting it down is the writing. There's no narrative arc and there's no true inspirational message. Mainly what it's about are various clips from Hawking's life punctuated by montages. Basically, the cinematic equivalent of a family photo album. I thought this was about a scientist? It's too soft and it's too long. When a movie is nominated for so many awards I expect something that deserves them. I don't expect to have my head dunked in syrup but that's what I get. Still, I've seen Crash and various other weak Oscar films so maybe I should have known. A very average movie only lifted into the 6/10 category by its 2 leads. It's got its impressive moments but if it had won Best Picture it would have been the new Crash.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

In short, the incredibly touching back story of Hawking is presented hereless science, more humanityand it is absolutely beautiful.However, Redmayne completely steals the show as Mr. Hawking in an utterly pitch-perfect, transformative performance that will most likely nab him his first Oscar nominationwith a win looking pretty darn good as well as he goes from upright man to wheelchair-bound.Redmayne is mesmerizing.As is this whole incredibly beautiful film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Soulful, moving, and impeccably crafted; lifted to the heights by exhilarating performances from both Redmayne and Jones","The Theory of Everything is a 2014 British biopic romantic drama film directed by James Marsh, written by Anthony McCarten and was inspired by the memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen by Jane Wilde Hawking. It stars Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones with Charlie Cox, Emily Watson, Simon McBurney, and David Thewlis featured in supporting roles.The Theory of Everything might seem a formulaic biopic for most, the type of film that is released by the end of every year to garner significant buzz coming this awards season. And now they featured a phenomenal scientist, Stephen Hawking,(Oscar buzz!), and his supportive wife, Jane Hawking, (More Oscar buzz!). But this isn't a sole biopic that shoves down our throats the fascinating-but-esoteric theories of this well-known scientist, but it's a restrained love story about Jane and Stephen overcoming their adversities as a couple, as Stephen heartbreakingly shatters with his disease. It almost serves as a character study, looking how well-directed, written, and acted the characters are, principally the two leads.Bolstered by an adroit, subdued direction from Marsh--from the ravishing, finely-tuned score and cinematography to sensitive care with each characters--and adept, profound writing from McCarten, who dived into the characters and layered them with unfeigned emotions. The supporting cast also did a great job, specifically Charlie Cox in a sympathetic role.But the real winning turns are Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, who gave contrasting flairs but still found common emotional footing. Redmayne is a revelation in his role, as he strips down into his immaculate form. A performance that could leave a mark in our hearts and in the history of cinema, a monumental transformation, he captured Stephen Hawking not only physically but his whole soul--he is the film's emotional core. Equally stellar is Jones, who in a less showy role, proves her full acting capabilities that once has been shown in ""Like Crazy"". If his co-star is the core, then she is the emotional spine. Without her, Stephen will fall, the whole film will shatter into pieces, I honestly believe that she is even more essential than his co-star. A subtle, transcendent work that shows a different side of a ""supportive wife"", facing the truth of being a human--we all have our limits--and she did that with deep ardency and valor even if the love wasn't genuine anymore.All these fundamental elements mashed together and formed something that is incandescent. The Theory of Everything doesn't seek for an answer on how the universe came to place, nor it pound by pound follows disease-driven dramas. But it's a story about love that was once genuine vanished in the air like tiny particles--it's utterly heart-piercing and vehement. As the final scene rolls, you will be eviscerated with tears.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
An Unremarkable Film with Fetching Assets,"BY RYAN C. SHOWERSEvery year there are one or two films that score major nominations throughout award season that are not particularly special, and they manage their accolade success by appealing to older voters and not taking many risks. Usually, films of that nature can be appreciated for style, performances, and consistency. ""The Theory of Everything"" is ""that"" film this year, but it's not as easy to appreciate as typical period piece Oscar films.""The Theory of Everything"" is most notable for its beautiful cinematography. It pleases our eyes with strong, radiant colors such as blues, golds, greens, and browns. There is also a fine texture to the photography, as if a painter swiped gloss across the lens, which produces a beautiful, faded look. To put sound with the visual, the charming musical score composed for ""The Theory of Everything"" is an invaluable component in the film's areas of success. Without it, the film would fall flatter than it occasionally does. In addition, Director James Marsh envisions the project on a smaller scale, as if he was holding all the components in his hands when he filmed it. The directing makes the screenplay's lacking scope excusable. Marsh makes everything fit nicely as one commodity.On paper and at first glance, this looks like a role of a lifetime for Eddie Redmayne, and even though the writing does not allow this to be an overwhelming performance, Redmayne fades into Hawking's fight. Assertive in the beginning and subtly crushing in the later scenes, Redmayne uses his physicality and emotions to play the part as ably. Felicity Jones is his leading co-star, and she's splendid but, like Redmayne, nothing to note in the history books.Simple and harmless, the surface is the limit in ""The Theory of Everything"". It has a subject matter and a pretense of something emotionally draining and three-dimensional, but the opposite could not be more true of the film in front of you. The film fails to affect the slightest bit of emotion onto its audience, and the awkward part is the numerous moments where the film thinks it is being absorbing and engaging and it's not. The characters begin to weep, waiting for us to join in with them, and we end up just uncomfortably staring at the frame. Instead of grabbing our emotions, the misfortunes of the characters instead grab our distanced, unemotional sympathy.Though the directing should be looked at with blame for this, the script is even more responsible for the film's troubles in this area and for its general problems. The dialogue is unorganized, the ideas decides not to reach farther than what would be appropriate for junior high school audiences, and the screenplay tells this story in the most basic way possible. In fact, the best scenes in ""The Theory of Everything"" are the montages where we just watch the characters be instead of listening to poorly written dialogue. (The montages rely on the acting, musical score, and directing more than anything which is why they work so agreeably.)An unremarkable film with some fetching assets.Grade: B",,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
the life but not the mind....,"Watched #TheTheoryOfEverything....The movie is a biography about the life of Steven Hawkins.

Awesome biography,"An amazing movie - Eddie Redmayne's performance is so real that you forget he is an actor - he is Stephan Hawking. The preparation he must have done for this part has to have been gruesome - the changes in his facial features, the things the disease did to his body - so well portrayed. I forgot he was an actor - he is Hawking. The story is important for many reasons. The focus on the disease and its progression, the affects of it on their marriage, and the genius of his mind was not affected. Felicity Jones is just as good as his wife - never knowing the course the marriage would have to go through - she was devoted to him through it all - even though she was loosing the sense of herself. In reality, you wonder how she was able to raise three kids and take care of Stephan and always be there for him.

To imagine one of the most brilliant minds of our time had to go through all that is saddening.
I just wish it had a better direction and writing. Not that it's bad but could've been better.
Most of the run time shows how Jane support and struggles through their marriage. Now that I think about it, I'm glad they focused on the marriage. Everyone knows who Professor Hawking is.

"Through the stars and cosmos, comes the romance of Stephen Hawking and Jane Hawking in the surpassingly good The Theory of Everything.","The understanding of us is a pursuit that great minds like Newton, Galileo and Einstein have gone after for generations. Their the ones that always asked ""How did the universe begin?"" and ""Is there an ending or a boundary for the universe?"". They are seen as people the people that can take mankind into the next steps through science to get a better understanding of life. They also face controversy as some of their ideas contradict religious beliefs and even the existence of God. I don't see much of an issue myself as I'm a Christian and I see much of the ideas as searching how the universe works and not the universe itself, therefore allowing my belief in God to be justified.One such person to be recognized in the field of physics is Stephen Hawking. His bestseller A Brief History of Time has opened up the door of complicated mathematics and ideas of the cosmos to the mainstream public. What people love about this guy is that even with the complication of a motor neuron disease, he has been able to continue with his scientific journey and that he remains an active lecturer. His early life and romances are revealed in The Theory of Everything.While a young man, Stephen Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne) is a very intelligent student who is taking his steps into earning his doctorate at Cambridge in England. He is also socially awkward and likes to shut himself in his room as he studies. That changes when he meets Jane Wilde (played by Felicity Jones) who takes a liking to the young man despite their academic and religious differences. Hawking is a cosmologist while Jane is a literature student. Hawking is agnostic while Jane is a Christian. The two still manage to enjoy their time with each other and start a relationship.A fall at his school sends him to the hospital where it's revealed that he has Lou Gehrig's disease and that he only has about two years to live. Jane decides that she loves him enough that she will stay with and care for him. they marry and they have three children together. As Hawking's condition deteriorates further into a wheelchair, he finally allows more help. This results in a man Jonathan Jones (played by Charlie Cox) into becoming a caretaker as Jane struggles with her feeling towards him and her love and beliefs for Hawking,When I saw the first preview for The Theory of Everything, I thought that the movie was going to be too schmaltzy. It's clear that this is a romance and not a full biopic. So in a way, its probably more romanticized then it was before. But as stories go, this one isn't bad. The Theory of Everything rationalizes that true love is always sticking with your partner and with both of it's leads being very likable, I can see that working.Eddie Redmayne fires away one of the best acting performances of the year as Stephen Hawking. He portrays him as a ambitious scientist and even a bit selfish in his later years, but still make him relatable when it comes to sticking with his principle. He really wants to be seen not as a cripple who succeeds, but as a great mind who triumphs. Felicity Jones is also great, giving us a young woman who may be peaceful with her mind, but no nonsense with her actions. She's the only one that can get through to her husband, even against doctors and other scientists.I'll give this eight and a half A Brief History of Time books out of ten. This one is more of an acting piece then a great story, but this is what I would have liked to have seen from last years August: Osage County.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A wonderful movie in every sense,"Few years back I was mesmerized by the story of John Nash beautifully played by Russel Crowe and well-supported by Jennifer Connelly who plays his wife. Come 2014, The Theory Of Everything belongs to similar genre diving deep into the relationship of a well-known personality with his better half.As we look into personal life of the famous Physicist, Stephen Hawking, we are also shown about his work while fighting against the rare disease which keeps him on wheel chair for the entire life.Famous for making documentary "" Man On Wire"", James Marsh adapts the book of same name based on the life of legendary Stephen Hawkings and written by Jane Hawking. The reason I brought A beautiful Mind comparison as it dealt with mysterious life of well-known educated professor. The movie begins with evolution of a scientist and how he meets Jane. A small incident changes his life but he does not lose hope. Jane is his pillar of support and helps him keep motivated. The screenplay falters little bit but bounces back with nice climax. The background score with gorgeous cinematography adds on extra charm to the film. Full marks should be given to Eddie Redmayne for fitting the role of Stephen Hawking.

The Theory of Everything was one of the most touching of true-life love stories,"Before this movie, I only knew Stephen Hawking through his appearances on shows like ""The Big Bang Theory"" or some news clips showcasing him speaking through his communicating apparatus on his electric wheelchair. So seeing him depicted before his disease took hold and having a relationship with a pretty woman named Jane and their marriage and eventual three offspring was something of a revelation to me and Mom. Also, how touchingly devoted she was to him even with all the ravages of his health coming into effect through the years. The way they grew gradually apart was also sensitively done as well as who their next partners would become as they got introduced later in the narrative. In summary, The Theory of Everything was one of the most touching films from last year. Glad for Eddie Redmayne's Oscar win and Felicity Jones' nomination. So, yes, that's a recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Accessible Drama Woven around Key Facts,"The Theory of Everything is an enjoyable flick that simply ticks off key occurrences in Hawkings's life, embedding them in decently paced and storyboarded exposition.And I know that sounds like damning with faint praise. As I watched ""Everything"", I simply couldn't stop wondering whether it would measure up to the Errol Morris work, ""A Brief History of Time"".I think, in the end, that Morris's work sort of obviates this new treatment, which felt like a recasting of ""Brief"" as straight-up film storytelling.Wow. I realize that I need to cut to the chase, here: I'm torn because ""Everything"" is obviously a labor of love, and a paean to a contemporary secular saint. Ergo, I would be a stick-in-the-mud not to respect and enjoy it. But this doesn't change the fact that the treatment just rubbed me the wrong way. Something about the whole idea of minting a standard, groomed/greenlit feature film about Hawking bugs me.But it's a nice flick, as I said quite enjoyable, and my stylistic remonstrance only knocked my rating down a couple of notches.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The love life and deteriorating health of theoretical physicist  Stephen Hawking...pretty gummy at times,"Two British students at Cambridge University in 1962 fall in love: he's studying astrophysics and develops the controversial theory that a black hole created the universe; she hopes to get a degree in Medieval Spanish poetry, is charmed by him and desires to be his wife, despite his recent diagnosis with motor neuron disease. The life of ""A Brief History in Time"" author Stephen Hawking, with a screenplay adapted from Jane Hawking's book ""Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,"" is glossy and professionally-assembled, right down to the romantic blue light that bathes the young lovers at the dance where they first meet. As Stephen Hawking, Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne is puckish and charming; it's a masterful performance that must carry the movie emotionally for quite a stretch, yet Redmayne is equal to the challenge. Playing his seemingly tireless spouse (who bore three of Stephen's children even while his muscles were rapidly failing), Felicity Jones has to play a saint, a daunting task. Jones is not required to show joy or splendor because, apparently, Jane Hawking was too busy being a nursemaid/wife/mother to be truly happy; the one sequence where Jones is allowed to brighten a bit is when Stephen, an atheist, first references God in his manuscript and shares the moment with her. The film isn't full of pomp and prestige--it's entertaining and moving--but the notion that Stephen is just a delightful, wily genius in a wheelchair is rather tough to swallow. ""The Theory of Everything"" isn't a puff piece on the physicist and author, but neither is it a probing investigation of the man behind those theories. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Should have focused more on Hawking's passions for science and discovery!,"'THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING': Four Stars (Out of Five)The Oscar contender biopic about renowned physicist Stephen Hawking and his relationship with his wife, Jane Wilde Hawking. It's based on Jane's memoir 'Traveling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen' and focuses more on her point of view; of their lives together. The film stars Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking and Felicity Jones as his wife Jane. It costars Charlie Cox, Emily Watson, Simon McBurney and David Thewlis. It was directed by James Marsh and written by Anthony McCarten. Hawking approved of the film's production (and the finished product) and even provided his Equalizer computerized voice, for his character in the movie. I found the film to be pretty well made, and somewhat interesting, but also a tad too slow and uninvolving (in places).The story begins when Jane Wilde (Jones) first met Stephen Hawking (Redmayne) and follows their relationship, as he first finds out he has motor neuron disease. She stays with him, through the hard times, and accepts his proposal for marriage. The two have a family together as Hawking continues to pursue his dreams in physics, and eventually becomes one of the most famous physicists of all-time. The story stays focused on the couple's love for each other and doesn't stray too much into the details of Hawking's groundbreaking scientific discoveries.As a love story I thought the film was very sweet and touching; I especially like how it shows the ways in which Stephen and Jane made things work, despite their troubles; especially the ones brought about by Stephen being an atheist and Jane being a faithful Christian. Still I'm not a big fan of biopics and I had hoped a movie about one of the greatest geniuses of all-time would have focused more on his passions for science and discovery, rather than just being another routine relationship study. The performances are good though and the directing is decent. It's definitely a movie worth seeing, even if it doesn't quite deserve all of it's hype and possible (upcoming) awards recognition.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chY2PeSnCng",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Everyone who is only a little bit aware of our main character in this movie, know where this is going to go.So while we know where this is going, it's still crushing, because we get to see the before, we get to see the person, that many have forgotten when they watch what he has become now (chair and voice and all). Maybe we can relate to that, but we certainly can relate to a human being watching and feeling pain, unable to do something about it. Still not giving up though ...

Brilliant performances and emotional storyline! 7/10,"Review: I quite enjoyed this emotional drama about Stephen Hawking and his rise to fame whilst suffering with a rare slow-progressing form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease or Lou Gehrig's disease, that has gradually paralysed him over the decades. The movie also concentrates on his relationship between him and his wife, Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) and it shows how she struggled to care for Hawking whilst bringing up there three children and studying for a PHD in medieval Spanish Poetry, whatever that is. Hawking also produced a best selling book called A Brief History Of Time which has sold more than 10 million copies and at 72 years of age, after getting told that he only had 2 years to live, he still continues to seek the theory of everything. This is truly a remarkable story about a man who, against all odds, is a scientific genius. It really does prove that you can achieve your dreams, no matter what obstacles come in your way. The performance from Eddie Redmayne is unbelievable and it must have been hard to perform because Hawking was on set while he was making the film. Felicity Jones also put in a great performance and the director told his story extremely well. Before I had seen this film, I never knew anything about his life so it was good to see him as an ordinary intelligent student before he came down with the terrible disease. The gradual decline in his abilities to do things, was sad to watch, but he still had his sense of humour and the ability to achieve his dreams. The love story was quite sad but they are still close friends and they have 3 grandchildren so it wasn't a sad ending. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and Eddie Redmayne really did deserve the many awards that he received for this role. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Like many others that have seen this movie, I really didn't know that Stephen Hawking was English. Maybe that's because his computer voice is American! I didn't understand why he turned down his knighthood from the Queen but I'm sure he had his personal reasons to do so. I couldn't help feeling that his wife was being a little bit of a bitch throughout the movie and she didn't show that much sympathy for Hawkings situation after a while. I'm glad that Hawking finally let her go so they both could find true happiness in there life's, because it made them closer as friends. Anyway, I have seen Hawking in a few TV series and he has made a couple of special appearance in a few programs and he still hasn't lost his sense of humour. That's what makes this a truly remarkable story and I couldn't help feeling emotional through it. This has boosted Eddie Redmayne straight into the limelight after starring in movies like Les Miserables and My Week With Marilyn. His next film starring Channing Tatum called Jupiter Ascending, has blockbuster written all over it so there no turning back for this 33 year old actor.Budget: $15million Worldwide Gross: $121.2millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biopics about the remarkable life of Stephen Hawking and his rocky relationship with his wife. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Here is a PROVED theory, this film is very fine","Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a brilliant doctoral physics student at Cambridge. When a professor gives the class ten ""impossible"" questions to answer, Stephen apologizes for only getting nine of them. No one else is even close. A bit shy, he spies a beautiful fellow student, Jane (Felicity Jones) at a campus party one night and they have a great conversation. Before long, Stephen is asking her to a special dance, even though he can't cut a rug himself! There is one huge difference in their lives, however. Jane is a devout Christian while Stephen is a professed atheist, only trusting in science. Suddenly, the courtship is on hold. This is due to a terrible fall Stephen has on a sidewalk and the subsequent, very sobering diagnosis of motor neuron disease, similar to ALS. Naturally, Stephen is disheartened and holes up in his room. Only Felicity, arriving to see what has occurred, restores hope to him, with her declaration of love. They are married, they soon have a son. But, the progression of the disease is awful while the doctors give him two years to live. Meanwhile, theories of the creation of the universe and other ""small"" topics keep his mind focused away from his doomed future. But, is it so? The couple has two more children and, despite being reduced to a wheelchair, Stephen lives on. What exactly does the future of S and J hold? This very fine film chronicles the life of the brilliant British scientist, Hawking, and his physical and emotional struggles. Also told is the lesser known tale of his first wife, Jane. As the physicist, Redmayne is superb, making Hawking's descent into anatomical deterioration very, very real. Jones is likewise wonderful and the rest of the cast, including Emily Watson, a great collection of performances as well. All movie amenities, from sets to costumes, script, and direction are of the highest caliber as well. No, its not a happily ever after story, in many ways, but it is an extremely well done tale of the courage and determination of the human spirit.

Lighter Portrait,"The Theory of Everything is a biopic of Stephen Hawking, which seems more focused on his relationship with his wife, Jane Wilde, and the chronicle of how he deals with Lou Gehrig's disease. The movie takes an easy drama within these events, by simply just watching how Hawking can still move forward on his research and with his family, despite of his condition. Even with a terrific performance from its lead actor, the movie just walks from one time to another, hardly examining anything else complex within the story other than the basic summary on screen. It can still feel engaging, but it's impossible to think how else compelling this movie could have been.The story juggles with many issues; it is about Hawking's study of his theories, it is a love story that is slowly fading its romance and it is a sad drama of the scientist's fight of his illness. The film doesn't have an exact focus on its story, it keeps trading from one conflict to another, but doesn't necessarily lead to any remarkable buildup. Maybe at the parts where Hawking's body is falling apart, the movie becomes completely compelling, but at the other subplots: the scientific side is likely used to define his career, but it only hints a more interesting topic. The love story, which happens to be the most important part since it aims to be the core of the entirety, is mostly displayed for a typical drama that doesn't go beyond showcasing the tragedy and some important information of each time.The direction is at least decent, it settles with the characters nicely, and also picks some random style when it comes to the cinematography. It all looks stunningly bright, making it visually pretty. But there's nothing else memorable in the filmmaking other than that. The acting however is the best thing to merit, specifically Eddie Redmayne. People would be more focused on his portrayal of the physical struggle because that clearly is what makes it truly affecting and that is one tough thing to achieve in this role and he's done it terrifically while still capturing a personality. The rest of the acting are all pretty natural enough to keep things entertaining on screen.The Theory of Everything is alright, but it felt like there's something more to explore in this biopic. It does work at being an easy inspirational drama that pictures the unfortunate moments of his life, leading to an eventual triumph. It's often gripping, but it would have been even more if it digs deeper at the themes that are filled in outside the bitterness. It's pretty hard to argue that it's bad, it's competently crafted and wondrously acted, but it still leaves a lot of intriguing questions that are only partially answered around the bright images.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Not worth locating a black hole to drop it into.,"It was sad to see a film take such a wonderful subject as the life and ambitions of Mr. Hawkins and attempt,dismally, to create it for nothing more than a contender in the awards 'game'. This is the kind of tripe which is accepted all too readily as biopic material and offers little or nothing of the person or their skills other than to show off as a proffered mating ritual. Mr. Redmaynes painstaking efforts are the only reason I gave it any rating at all. With all the facts and wonder we have have at our disposal about the man, why is it that there is little or nothing involving his deep, driving demand for 'the answer' and all that is entailed in his studies. Rather we are given still another sexist portrayal of two people battling impossible odds to finally give in to their bases needs, with others. Not only old fare but out of place and cheapening to the real story line. I could only try to dissuade others from subjecting themselves to this demeaning film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Elegant.,"The Theory of Everything chronicles the life of Stephen Hawkings - world renowned British theoretical physicist and probably the most famous scientist in the world.Starting in 1953, when Hawkings (Eddie Redmayne) is attending Cambridge University as a PhD candidate right through to present day, the film is an elegy not just to his incredibly successful career, but also to his triumphs in his personal life with his wife, Jane (Velocity Jones).With its primary source based on Jane's memoir, 'Travelling to Infinity: My life with Stephen', the entirety of his and her lives are detailed in fine-tune, from the moment they meet in a party a connection was made. She was studying Medieval Spanish Poetry, and he was studying time-travel cosmology. Through the hard-ships of his life as his body failed him, Jane is not scared away, but instead stays, marries him, has a family and cares for him. Fair to say, it is as much Jane's story as it is his, from where it is shared and melodramatic.From the beginning scenes of the film, Oscar-winning director James Marsh makes a point in showing that Stephen has a problem. Beginning subtly, but slowly deteriorating, Stephen is diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease, or ALS. Given two years to life he is soon unable to walk, then after an emergency tracheotomy, he is unable to also talk.Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Hawkings is undeniably incredible, and adds much gravitas to the performance as he slowly transforms. In the later scenes, now unable to walk or talk, he is restricting to a wheelchair; hunched, hands cramped, face distorted and only able to communicate with his eyes and a computerized voice. Redmayne's resemblance to Hawking is uncanny and authentic as he dips into front-runner Oscar-bait. Upon viewing the film, the real Stephen Hawkings even admitted that it was like he was watching himself.The science of the film, which are the fundamentals behind Christopher Nolan's Interstellar are often complex to understand; but quantum physics, black holes and relativity are all expertise subjects to Hawkings, which led to his famous accolades going world- wide from his book 'A Brief History of Time'.Of course, the theories are quite difficult to comprehend if you are not a mastermind scientist. But that is okay, as on the screen we merely see Hawking's in front of chalkboards with long equations, big words and hypothesis' as others either proclaim his work as 'Brilliant!' or 'Rubbish!'The Theory of Everything certainly holds a treasure chest of rich material. Too much for one film to squeeze in perhaps, with the massive subject of who is Stephen Hawkings? But Marsh's vision is poignant and precise as nothing is rushed or missed out as it condenses into the tidy two-hours running time.Set in a similar style to Ron Howard's A Beautiful Mind, the film is elegantly crafted from the beautiful cinematography to the sensitive performances. It's masterful, triumphant, and will surely prosper in every category possible at this year's Academy Awards as one man's struggle provides the point that 'there is no limit to human endeavour'.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"""The Theory of Everything"" is propelled forward by its fantastic story and leads. In that order.","If you want a film that is going to inspire you, not with fictional stories, but instead with the use of a true one grounded in reality than ""The Theory of Everything"" is what you should go out and see right now. It is, simply put, a fantastic, life-affirming film that is propelled forward by its story and its leading roles. In that order. And the rest of the film is pretty good too. But ""The Theory of Everything"" isn't all about Stephen Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne) and how incredible his story is. Instead the film is ""part biopic, part love story"" with the latter telling us about the imperfect marriage between Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde (played by Felicity Jones).Eddie Redmayne is fantastic as Stephen Hawking and what is best at how he portrays Hawking getting worse in regards to his Motor Neurone Disease (/ALS). Redmayne starts the film as a young Hawking and we can tell this guy is clever. But it is as the film goes on that Redmayne's performance gets better. Halfway through the film we are looking at a slouched Redmayne, slurring his words and occasionally smiling and by the end of the film we are looking at Redmayne playing Hawking as he is now. In testament to this the real-life Stephen Hawking commented, on seeing the film, that he felt he was sometimes looking back in time at himself. I'm with him. His performance is again, incredible, as incredible as the story he has the privilege to tell. If I don't see him in the running for the Best Actor Oscar come February then I will be surprised.Felicity Jones performance as Jane Wilde is magnificent too. Although on the surface she doesn't seemingly require the various skills that Redmayne has to delve into, she again does the story and her real- life counterpart justice. Although she starts the film as a student, we come to see her having to raise 3 children as well as look after her husband and you feel that she really is going through all this. Again, the real-life Jane Wilde was impressed with Jones' performance. When I think about Best Actress potential this year, she should also be in the running for the appropriate Oscar.Harry Lloyd is brilliant as Stephen's university friend Brian too. Although Brian is a mere composite character, he is a brilliant one at that. His attitude is drawn from Jane's descriptions of ""Stephen's fellow lodgers and research students"" at Cambridge: ""They talked to him in his own intellectual terms, sometimes caustically sarcastic, sometimes crushingly critical, always humorous. In personal terms, however, they treated him with a gentle consideration which was almost loving."" He could also be in for an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.But it is the story that really propels ""The Theory of Everything"" forward and it provides for half the reason as to why the films leads are fantastic. The film itself is based on Jane Wilde's 2008 autobiography ""Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen"", a flattering account of their initial marriage and a significantly different, revised edition of the 1999 autobiography ""Music to Move the Stars: My Life with Stephen"", a less flattering account of their marriage, sparked when Hawking left Wilde for his nurse Elaine Mason in 1990. (It's worth noting they quietly divorced in 2006 following a 5 year period of rumours over whether Mason abused Hawking, apparently hitting him, throwing him around and even leaving him in the sun to burn for several hours.) The revised edition was sparked by her and Hawking managing to develop a good working relationship with Wilde.The story of ""The Theory of Everything"", as I said earlier, is ""part biopic, part love story"". We learn in the film of how clever Hawking was and how he refused to let his disability stop him from being great, initially managing to overcome the 2 years he was given to live and ultimately managing to become a household name. But this isn't what ""The Theory of Everything"" is really about. Although the film does give Hawking his due, it's not as if Eddie Redmayne has a bigger role than Felicity Jones. Their roles are coequal and the film thus focuses on Stephen and Jane's relationship, in particular how Wilde had to cope with raising 3 children whilst looking after her husband.""The Theory of Everything"" is a fantastic film with a fantastic story and two fantastic leads. The only problem I had with the film, and it's always there for me when I watch this kind of film, is although it is never boring, you do find yourself occasionally wondering how long is left. But this is not the final thought I want to leave you with. Instead, let me remind you that ""The Theory of Everything"" is again, a fantastic film and worth seeing if you get the chance. It tells you something that apparently a nurse wiped a tear from Hawking's eye when he first saw the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The minutiae of a great man's domestic life,"This film seems to be a simple adaptation of Jane Wilde Hawking's memoir of her 25 years of marriage to Hawking. So it starts with their meeting and ends with their separation.The film centres itself almost exclusively on the minutiae of their married life and coping with Stephen's disability. As such it is a real tear jerker and at times their lives together seem to be an unremitting tragedy.I found the acting impeccable from the stars and supporting characters and the film evokes life in and around Cambridge university during the Sixties and Seventies well, quite nostalgically.Jane's religious faith compared to Stephen's atheism is a thread throughout which I felt added nothing to the plot, yet what is really uplifting in the film is the story of the simple heroism required in dealing with such an awful disability, whether you are one of the human race's greatest minds or not.There is little in the story to help us understand why Hawking is such a shining star in the world of science and I felt this was the movie's weak point. It is simply a given that we already know and accept he is one of the greats and for that reason we will be content to view the emotional details of his domestic life. That said the film often feels warm and intimate, that you have been invited in, like a talk through two decades of a family's photo albums given by them in their sitting room.Jane and Stephen come across as absolute heroes and it is their example and the feeling of being invited into a life which made the film worthwhile for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
An excellent film with an astonishingly good transformative lead performance,"There was one little moment in 'The Theory Of Everything' that I really didn't like – while on stage in his wheelchair, Stephen Hawkins imagines himself standing up, picking up a pencil off the floor and placing it on a table. It's an odd fantasy sequence in a film that does so much to ground itself in the utmost reality, and I'm taken out of the moment. But why do I start this review straight off with a criticism? Because I figured I should probably note ONE criticism, considering that these thirty uncharacteristic seconds are preceded by two hours of exceptional cinema.For those who don't know, 'The Theory Of Everything' is the biopic of legendary physicist Stephen Hawking. Told chronologically starting with his time at Cambridge University, the film recounts both the young man's rise to bona fide genius and the physical deterioration caused by Motor Neurone Disease. At the centre of it all is his wife Jane (who's memoir the film is adapted from), the rock that meant Hawking never stopped fulfilling his potential. As much as the film is about Stephen and his extraordinary life, it is just as much about her extraordinary resolve. And, above all, it's about the strength of their love (which is, yes, extraordinary).I'll admit, I had my doubts about the casting of this film. Both Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are undoubtedly very talented, but I wasn't sure they could pull off such complex characters. Man, was I wrong! The two actors are astonishingly good, and have a fantastic chemistry on screen. Even their scenes as young lovers, before the tough stuff, is great. We really believe that they were made for each other, despite the obvious faith and science conflict, and it's beautiful to watch. But it's when that tough stuff starts, when Hawking begins to break down physically, that the chemistry is electric.As Jane, Felicity Jones proves a revelation. Her transformation from sweet young girl to steely-souled wife is brilliant, as she battles to keep herself together. Even when she finally breaks, we don't hate her – quite the opposite, in fact. Screenwriter Anthony McCarten makes sure to never paint her as a bad person – instead, she comes across as a woman who has reached the end of her tether, justifying her eventual decisions. Jones, to her credit, expresses that brilliantly. It's what she doesn't say that is most striking about her performance, with those tired eyes and awkward silences.But let's cut to the chase; the real star of this movie is Eddie Redmayne. I should probably explain why I didn't like those thirty second at the end of the movie. Such is the magnificence of Redmayne's transformation that I forget it's him. At no point does it feel like I'm watching an actor play a role – this is Stephen Hawking – until he picks up the pencil and looks like Redmayne again. There is an everyman quality about Redmayne which makes him perfect for the character – yes, Hawking was a genius, but it never corrupted him. He was humble, charming, funny, innocent in his own way, and Redmayne captures that with his goofy grins and cheeky wry smiles. Even when he is at the point that he can't talk or move his body, when almost everything has shut down, he never stops trying. There is a wonderful scene where he meets his new nurse (Maxine Peake in a small but excellent cameo), which is both laugh-out-loud funny and tragic at the same time. Hawking is a man who had to fight everything - literally death itself – to achieve his potential. And he does. When you look back on previous Oscar winners – Charlize Theron in 'Monster', for example – the awards lot like to see those physical transformations. Well, you might not get a better one than Eddie Redmayne this time round.Kudos also needs to be given to director James Marsh. Well, he got those performance out of the leads, so the plaudits are obvious, but he also does wonders with a strong supporting cast that includes David Thewlis, Harry Lloyd and a really lively Charlie Cox (though Emily Watson, a personal favourite of mine, is in it for what seems like a cup of coffee!). But his method of direction is brilliant. The film's style reflects Hawking's state – the first third is a lot of quick cuts and moving shots, almost overemphasising the natural agility and physical prowess Hawking had. Then, once he is diagnosed, the cinematography changes. The camera moves closer to the characters, right up close to Hawking's face and his body, almost unnervingly. It's a great tool, solidly executed.A word commonly being thrown about when people talk about this film is celebration. I wish I could be original and think of something else, but a celebration is exactly what 'The Theory Of Everything' is. A celebration of humanity, of faith, of science, of love, of life. The fact that Stephen Hawking is still alive today, after having been given just two years left to live, is a testament to his greatness. If you don't want to watch it for how inspirational it is, though, just watch it for Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones' transformative performances. They deserve it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A Romance Movie that Shouldn't Have Been.,"The Theory of Everything is by no means a masterpiece of filmmaking and not even a great film compared to the very best of the year of it's release. That being said it is a rather good movie with some very touching moments that may pull at your heartstrings.First off i wanted to get the obvious out of the way. I found the way they showed Stephen's illness to be rather great at times whilst poor at others. Both the early and late stages honestly had points that are both positive and negative in nature when it comes to the filmmaking specifically. I do believe that it is easily serviceable as a product however i always felt like something was missing when depicting his illness. I think that it's more difficult for me to criticize when the movie is trying to portray real events as supposed to complete fiction (even if that fiction is based in reality). I saw the Professor say he liked the movie thus me criticizing parts of the movie may seem rather silly in nature. That being said i watched this movie and cannot help but find parts i though weren't done to the best of their ability. One part i didn't like way that fact that i believe that they didn't show Stephen's worst moments that i believed he sadly may have suffered in life. Think about all the moments he must have been staring at the wall or ceiling having thoughts that he struggled to get across. Or the moments when nobody came too his aid. This movie i believe shows too much success and brightness when i feel it would hit home more if it showed the utterly horrific struggles with the illness. I believe the illness was a mere backdrop to the story and although that may have been what they were going for, to show his illness is not the only thing that makes him interesting. I would have liked to have been more inspired by the absolute torture this man must have endured throughout his lifetime. This is despite the fact i (and many others) may never have ALS (Motor Neuron Disease).The story overall was one that i would say was fine in nature. I do not know how much is accurate to the real like of Professor Hawking. That being said as a pure watching experience i found it focused far too much on the relationship between Jane and Stephen. I understand that is a huge part of his story. But after coming away from the movie that is all i take away from it. The ending was marvelously done but i only got to know Stephens relationship with his former partner. I would like to know more the others around him not just his ex. Also his science (that he is famous for) is easily secondary and besides a single scene his workings and thought process isn't greatly shown. This all doesn't sound too bad if you're reading this without watching the movie but if you have seen it i believe you my share my belief's. The movie is a romance plain and simple. It nothing scientific and nothing that has a deeper meaning in my eyes (although it tries too towards the end). Maye i feel this way as i am not a huge lover of the romance genre. Although even for a romance it isn't spectacular in that department either. It is good though and easily enjoyable if you're looking for romance. That being said i do not believe it should go down as a great in this department. Romance is the only thing the movies does very well in my eyes but tht fact it's not amazing tells me the movies story is rather lacking in many aspects.All that negativity aside there are some really great scenes throughout the runtime of the film. Some that i do not want too say of fear of spoiler. However these scenes (and on in particular for myself) may stay in your mind for awhile after watching. They are shot well and make the movie a far better watching experience that they would have been without. These moments are the thing that makes the movie above an average watch, but there are only a smattering throughout the entire movie. The rest of the movie is simply average.I will say that i do not believe that even the less interesting parts are bad however. Even without the very well done scenes of the film, the movie would still be a average watch and by no means bad let alone terrible.The acting in this movie was brilliant. The was Redmayne portrayed Hawking i thought was simply astounding. It didn't look overly played or even goofy for the most part and was very well done in my eyes. His brilliance is especially noticeable in the scenes were the disease takes full control. Although i wished they showed more with the illness the actor was simply following the script and did his job excellently. Felicity Jones, Charlie Cox and others all played their parts very well too i must say. I do believe the story makes the acting look weaker that i actually is, but i feel i can see past this and look at just what a great job they all did. The acting is the best part of the movie for me personally.Overall a movie i would recommend watching, but unless you adore romance movies won't be anything close to a masterpiece.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Oscar Worthy Performances,"It took me a little while before I wanted to see this movie - a movie about the genius Stephen Hawking suffering from ALS, but boy am I glad I did. We all know how this movie ends, after all, Hawking is still alive today. His journey, however, holds many surprising twists and turns which give one an even greater appreciation for this great man and his incredulous story. Eddie Redmayne (Hawking) will surely get an Oscar nomination, and if he wins, it would be well-deserved. He was magnificent; you never felt as though he was acting which made his performance utterly heartbreaking. Felicity Jones, as his wife, Jane Wilde, was also superb. If the actual Jane was anything like the one Jones portrayed, then Ms. Wilde deserves the title ""Saint."" This film certainly gives a wikipedia type summary of Hawking's life, and there are some moments of slowness in the film (hence an 8 out of 10), but the message of this film is 10+. What resonates the most is the theme of the movie, which for me, is that living a life filled with hope and positivity takes courage, sometimes to heroic heights. Perhaps Hawking's genius goes even beyond his aptitude in science, but rather lies in his attitude toward life. The manner in which he's lived and continues to live sums up the Theory of absolutely Everything.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Life,Hope and selfless Devotion","First of all,i am just astounded after watching this movie...it really presents the most complex aspects of Stephen Hawking's life in most simplified way...what a piece of master's craft..i should say.So,basically this movie is all about the personal life of this great scientist who is known worldwide...he has gathered worldwide repute through his theories and is very famous so we common people just tend to make a picture of his life in our mind as charming,glamorous and simple.But,what answer would we get if we ever ask Jane Hawking about his everyday life..Yes,here's your point....how Jane and Stephen spent almost 25 years of their marriage altogether..Selfless devotion,i would say if i have to sum up every thing in just one word...How Jane did it for Stephen is not just amazing but just can't be described in words....Her selfless love,devotion and dedication is endless..This movie concentrates on both positive and negative aspects of both Jane and Stephen..and is probably mostly ""Truth"".They married when Jane was aware of all horrifying facts about Stephen. but there is this word called Hope which kept them together and I would say that back in 1965,if Jane would not have had married him...then he surely would have been dead after some years....It was Jane who gave him hope and look forward to some thing in life..Stephen himself has said that his marriage gave him hope to live..This movie sums up the divine love...both of them loved each other intensely...how Jane looked after him loved him for 25 years of her life is epic..and this becomes more epic when you realize that Stephen was not able to give her any thing in return...she kissed him but he was not able to kiss her back..He should have kind of worshiped her for so great sacrifice. But,when we say we are humans than humans do commit mistakes.The couple also made some mistakes in the course of their life which led to their divorce..that was most heartbreaking moment for me in the movie.i personally think this was more of Stephen's mistake of divorcing her because he decided of separation.He must have realized how much she had to sacrifice for him ..any how the movie was too good...The acting was flawless...",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
the beautiful theory!!,"The buzz around ""The Theory of Everything"" is in full swing, thanks to the various nominations including the Oscars it garnered this awards season. I wouldn't have dared to bet on the movie having any chance to come this far when I first saw it, courtesy the screener copy (hate to reveal being a pirate :P), none whatsoever except Eddie Redmayne for his portrayal as Stephen Hawking in the movie. Well here it is, standing tall with handful of nominations this awards seasons with 5 nominations in the Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor, Actress and Original Score. I just watched it a second time in cinema, this time falling more in love with the movie.The story about Stephen hawking, the world renowned physicist and cosmologist wouldn't have been unheard of, there being lot of movies, documentaries and TV shows on his life and works. This movie though is shown from Jane Wilde Hawking's perspective who was Stephen Hawking's wife. The plot is not purely biopic as such but the movie takes us through the hard life Stephen Hawking had to go through after he was diagnosed with motor neuron disease and how his wife backed him throughout the tough times before eventually parting their ways. It would be an instant love affair if you happened to be a Stephen Hawking fan and for others you would appreciate the heart breaking drama which never goes over the top melodramatic. I loved the ending very much, a fitting climax drawn parallel to his work ""A brief history of time"".The lead cast terrific and deservingly front runners in acting categories this awards season. I have had seen Felicity Jones (who played Jane Wilde Hawking) earlier and this without doubt is a breakthrough performance from her. The surprise package comes in form of a relatively unknown Eddie Redmayne who nearly nails it to perfection as Stephen Hawking, the kind of performance which reminds us of Daniel Day Lewis in ""My Left Foot"". Music by Johnson Johanson deserves a mention too for rendering an emotional texture to the frames. I, for one, loved the pace of the movie barring the lagging scenes somewhere in the middle, it kind of felt like dragging the movie into a heartfelt climax. :) To conclude, ""The Theory of Everything"" isn't the type of movie for casual movie goers who are looking for some time off the park. I would recommend it to serious movie buffs or for those wondering what the Oscars buzz is all about!! Not the perfect biopic yet a must watch. My rating 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Marvelous,"I will not write what it is about, mostly any one who will see this will know what it is about and why they've seen it.

The ending is the most beautiful I've seen in cinema history. To sum it up, ""The Theory of Everything"" could not have been made better, in any way. It is both heartbreaking and inspiring, and ALL performances are elite and dare I say:PERFECT. Do yourself a favor, and see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Fooled Me,"This film displays many aspects of superb acting, But that most of Eddie Redmayne who for the entire film had me convinced he was actually Stephen Hawking. The physical acting in this picture was amazing. The closest comparison is that of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) in Wolf of Wall Street whilst on drugs.Eddie Redmayne truly entered a submissive body with no control in this film and the emotion is purely through facial expressions in the second half of the film. The slightest eyebrow lift can change the entire setting of a scene and it is done perfectly.Recommend this film to all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Well done, lacks depth","Based on a book written by Hawking's first wife Jane this is a straightforward telling of her relationship with Steven Hawking from their first meeting to their parting. There is no need to worry about getting bogged down with cosmological arcana, since there are few details given as to what Hawking's fame as a scientist rests on. Some mention of black holes being mathematical singularities, that they may emit radiation and ultimately disappear, that maybe the creation of our universe could possibly be traced back to a singularity. I suppose this level of detail is appropriate for a movie targeting a general audience--those wanting more can attempt to read Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time.""In popular culture Hawking is more well known for his decades long struggle with ALS than for his contributions to cosmology. The first part of the movie detailing the initial relationship between Steven and Jane is affecting, accentuated by the knowledge of what is to come. As well done as it is this prelude doesn't break much new ground--the story of two attractive young people falling in love is not a neglected topic.The main thrust of the movie concentrates on Hawking's disease and how that was handled by him and Jane as the disease progressed. I have to give Redmayne credit for his impressive performance, I hope he did not suffer any permanent physical damage from the contortions required by the part.Hawking has himself said that the movie gets things right, in the main. I just wish that it could have delved a little deeper. For example, touching on Hawking's thoughts on politics, religion, culture, and issues faced by the disabled, would have made this more interesting. Hawking's atheism was pretty much whitewashed. I suppose citing his quote that heaven is a myth for those afraid of the dark would have been out of place in the guarded approach taken here. There were some odd scenes like the one that has Hawking on stage later in life getting out of his wheelchair to pick up a pen that a woman in the audience had dropped. Whose fantasy was that? To what end was it in there?This is a polished production, maybe too polished. I had the feeling that, like dark matter, we didn't see a lot of details that we know must be there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Utterly charming,"Within the first 5 minutes of THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING, I realized that I was thoroughly charmed by the two lead characters. With that knowledge firmly in mind, I sat back to enjoy the love story that was set to unfold.And unfold it did...very well, indeed.TOE tells the story of the relationship between famed Physicist Stephen Hawking and his wife, Jane. As portrayed by Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones (both Oscar nominated) these two people are charming, loving, selfish, angry, happy, sad. In other words, they are HUMANS.Redmayne, in particular, does a remarkable job of creating a real person despite the handicap of not being able to use much physicality in his role. What Redmayne is able to convey with his eyes is astonishing and I would be just fine with him winning the Oscar this year. The movie is, in essence, a ""two-hander"" and Jones more than holds her own as Hawking's wife Jane, and it was gratifying to watch two strong performances on the screen together.The story is told strongly by Director James Marsh while the cinematography brings strong, interesting visuals to a picture that could have been bland. It was a welcome addition to a good story.I cannot leave this review without mention of Professor Lupin himself, David Thewlis as Hawking's mentor, Dennis Sciama. It is always welcome to see Thewlis on the screen but I was distracted at the first moments of seeing him in his Professor's robes at an old London University. I had Harry Potter flashbacks.But I digress...If you're looking for a bang, bang action flick - check out one of the myriad of Liam Neeson flicks, if you want to watch good acting, good direction and a strong love story about two charming people, check out THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A Respectfully done Biopic,"In the Theory of Everything Eddie Redmayne plays the brilliant scientist Stephen Hawking. The story follows Hawking from his early days at Cambridge, where he meets Jane (Felicity Jones). From there the movie chronicles their life together as well has his crippling battle with Lou Gehrig's disease. The movie gives and intimate inside look at one of the world's most brilliant minds on space and time. The key ingredient to The Theory of Everything is Eddie Redmayne. His portrayal of Hawking is unforgettable; a respectfully done work of brilliance. I don't know what is harder, playing a living legend or playing a dead one. With the deceased you have this air of an omnipotent beings that have a life beyond the grave, any flaw in performance will be deeply criticized by fans as blasphemy. Whereas with the living you risk of insulting someone to their face. Out of the 5 actors nominated for best actor this year 4 of them are playing real people. Redmayne is the only one who had to answer to living. From what I read Hawking is happy with Redmayne's performance. Felicity Jones is up against an actress playing a real character, Reese Weatherspoon's Cheryl Strayed from Wild (2014) in the best actress category. Both well received by their real life counterparts, yet neither are the front runner to win the Oscar. I was not blown away by this movie. Hawking's is a very inspiriting story of overcoming adversity, I just didn't walk away inspired. It was more about the love story between Hawking and his wife, who are now in fact separated. When this movie and Imitation Game (2014) were nominated for Best Picture, I mentally prepped myself to be bored by both of these, due to my own ignorance. Imitation game was amazing, painfully moving and super inspirational, this one left a lot to be desired. The director James Marsa is known more for documentaries. This I think is obvious in watching the movie. He does a lot with visual camera tricks and dream like transitions to add more without manipulating the story in anyway. There are a lot of odd, and somewhat confusing elements to Hawking's life that are treated very delicately. I will not spoil it so as not to ruin anything. I think a director with more fictional film experience would have been better. There is a reason why his name is left off the Best Directing category. If you are a fan of Dr. Hawking's work then this film is worth a look. It's always interesting to get the back story on the greats. It does have a few good chuckles and some very touching moments. But if pure entertainment is your quest, pick something else. Unlike Dr. Hawking's book, even at 123 minutes, this film does not feel like a BRIEF history of time.If you enjoyed this review, please check out my blog at yourturntopick.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A brief history of Stephen Hawking,"The Theory of Everything tells the story of one of the most respected living scientists, Stephen Hawking, from his days as a young, brilliant physics student to his struggle with Lou Gehrig's Disease, and becoming the man we know today, with the mechanical voice.As a person who admires but doesn't fully understand science, or the real-life Hawking's contribution to it, I liked that this film attempted to explore his work a little, in lay man's terms. The film brings up God's role in the universe a lot, effectively dramatizing the science- Hawking is into the big questions. But The Theory of Everything is mostly a personal story, his trying to cope with being a brilliant scientist losing all voluntary physical movement and speech. It's frustrating to see him trying to explain his theories, but gratifying when the Soviet scientist announces the little man has done it. It mainly follows his family life and the difficult situation he and his wife Jane are in, and essentially makes Jane out to be a saint.Eddie Redmayne, who plays Hawking, deserves real credit for being able to portray a character from a young, able-bodied (but still shaky) man, to a man struggling to speak, to wheelchair-bound and speechless. His triumph- or Hawking's- is inspirational.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Redmayne murders it,"Redmayne first delivers, then destroys and finally murders the role by completely enveloping himself in the character of Stephen Hawking.The violence was subdued, but the tension palpable throughout especially culminating in one final touching scene that I shalleth not giveth away.I was watching it with my Mom, with whom I incidentally watched My Left Foot, and we don't watch movies too often for all you insecure kids out there, but she kept saying it reminded her of that flick.While Daniel Day Lewis's character will remain a classic, but I think with this movie, Redmayne might have just not only have climbed acting's Everest being one of my all time Greats as favorite actors, but just have pulled out the heist of the century.Question is not why he deserves an Oscar but why not. Did you for instance know that to capture the nuances Redmayne took dance lessons and Stephen Hawking felt he was staring at a mirror? While Cumberbatch's role was dynamic and original, this one was hyperrealistic to a different level.The name says it all.Edward John David Redmayne, ladies and gentlemen, is a cold blooded murderer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Where's the 'Brief'?,"I don't know how much research has gone into making The Theory Of Everything. I don't know whether the walls and indoor decoration of Hawking's home were not only of the same time period but also pat to the last detail. Maybe the children of Hawking, in the movie, resembled the real Hawking's children. Maybe not. The point is, in this case, it doesn't matter how accurate the film was. That is because there is no real underside or revisionism or whitewashing, or cherry picking, in the very fabric itself of the Universe, er, I mean of Hawking's life. Everything is above board. Because of the lack of seediness in Hawking's life, the film comes across as quite authentic. Because most audience can know, they maybe can't all of the time, but they can know when they are being thought of as idiots. The Theory Of Everything respects its audience.It was a fine decision to omit the early years of Hawking's life. Hawking might have had a normal childhood, but being insanely precocious, he must have been lonely. But given that most biopics want to include a duality of the man in private and the public figure, Hawking's childhood isn't relevant. To compare, The Imitation Game did correctly to show us young Turing's childhood problems and his abortive romance with Christopher. Like the 1982 movie Gandhi, The Theory Of Everything shows us the defining moments of Hawking and his triumph as a physicist.These days the Oscar nominated movies have been gaining quite good soundtrack music. In these very average times, this is the one bright spot. The movie itself didn't move me. I don't know what the director could have done more. I think every shot was well calibrated and there must have been much thought and deliberation behind each decision. But one thing's the pity is that the physics, the subject matter and the touchy subject of atheism were not given more than a superficial whirl. The strongest scene was when Hawking is struggling in putting his sweater on and he has this epiphany that helps with his work. Such moments were rare. I must also say that the guy who plays Jonathan missed a chance to shine in a prominent role. He was not a very good actor. The performances could have made this movie better, but it was not to be.

The first film to make me cry,"I watch a lot of films, but for some reason they don't make me cry. I've sat through Schindler's list, The Pianist, Forrest Gump, One flew over the cuckoos nest, Green Mile etc. and never shed a tear.The Theory of Everything had me welling up in about three places, and I came out an emotional wreck. I'm not quite sure why, but something about the mix between horrendous tragedy and incredible inspiration which go hand in hand in this movie, and in Stephen Hawking's life, is just incredibly moving. It captures the essence of being human; the constant tension between calamity and euphoria which touches all our lives in one way or another. The two lead actors (playing Stephen and Jane Hawking) were simply phenomenal. An amazing emotional roller-coaster through the highs and lows of human experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Good but could be better,"A heart wrenching tale that while beautiful is not what it should be. To say I have conflicting feelings about this movie would be an understatement.It is a good movie with brilliant acting. I still believe that Bradley Cooper deserved the Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role Oscar for his part as Chris Kyle in ""American Sniper"" but Eddie Redmayne performance as Stephan Hawking in this film is a close second in my book and I can understand how others would chose Redmayne over Cooper. Felitcity Jones as usual had a great performance with a great range of emotions. On the ten star scale I give it a seven. I do not regret watching it and I would recommend it to others and potentially watch it again. However, despite the positives I cannot help but think of the negatives.I have two major issues with this movie. One the color grading is horrendous. I believe it was intentional and is meant to be part of the visual story telling. Sadly, it fails at providing this as a story element. The color grading ends up just distracting from the film. Blown out shots, overly grainy scenes, unbalanced and unrealistic color pallets will take you out of the movie and remind you are looking at a screen. My second problem is the focus of the story. There was a clear lack of focus on the breakthrough science of Hawkings. It was more focused on the building and failing of his relationship with wife and eventual ex-wife Jane. This alters the film from a celebration of a man's genius to a focus of the betray and betraying that he experiences in his life. I do not believe this was the best use of the time. I wanted more science and less drama.But as I said before I don't regret watching it. You should try watching it yourself. My issues might not bother you like they did me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Really good movie, not my cup of tea.",I will first say that I did not find The Theory of Everything very engaging and that this could very well at it's core be because of my lack of experience in the field of romance.Nonetheless The Theory of Everything is a well written and very well directed film that also features terrific acting from the two leads.Eddie Redmayne really managed to portray both the physical limitations of his character and the emotions buried inside of him. And Felicity Jones portrayed a great sensitivity and the emotional toll her character had to endure.The Theory of Everything was a pleasant surprise because it manages to be a strong dramatic biopic without falling into the pitfalls of the genre.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A story necessary to tell,"Normally sappy love stories aren't my cup of tea, but once you introduce one of the greatest and most profound scientists of the 20th century into the mix, then you've caught my attention. That plus the healthy dose of awards hype made The Theory of Everything a must see.That great and profound scientist I mentioned is none other than Stephen Hawking, and this film tells the story of his search for the beginning of time and the answers to the universe, chronicling how as his mind grew his body deteriorated due to Lou Gherig's disease or ALS. The film is actually based on the novel that Jane Hawking, Stephen Hawking's wife, wrote and it details her struggles in caring for such an incredible mind whose body had become hardly self- sufficient. It's a timeless love story that celebrates the triumphs of such a brilliant mind, and how Hawking learned to live with the disease, never letting it stop him from answering the questions he wanted answered.The Theory of Everything tells a powerful and captivating story, albeit the execution is a bit dull. Stephen Hawking's story is obviously an insurmountably important one, and one that deserves to be immortalized in film, thus this film is doing a great service to the artistic and scientific communities. The extent of his triumphs are captured very well in this film, while also capturing the very human story at the center of all the scientific jargon. And so, despite any shortcomings of this film, it is still a very important one, and one that absolutely needed to be made.My main issue with The Theory of Everything were its reservations. This film plays every conflict so close to the chest, never really capturing the struggle until the third act. Obviously the central conflict here is Hawking's battle with ALS and his trying to cope with the disease as it breaks down his body bit by bit. But this central conflict doesn't feel like much of a conflict because when one thing becomes an issue it seems to be resolved in the very next scene. It's a film that doesn't take any risks, and there is a severe lack of tension throughout, and it's honestly pretty boring for the majority of its two hour runtime. Not painfully boring, but dull.The film definitely does get better as it goes along, though, and by the end I was left satisfied and a little more well informed about one of the most important scientific minds who ever lived. It transitions from sappy love story to compelling human drama, even if it takes a while to get there. From start to finish, though, this is a beautiful film with gorgeous cinematography and stellar performances. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Hawking is shockingly accurate and the resemblance is uncanny. Felicity Jones gives it her all in her portrayal of Jane Hawking, and the two form an unbelievably adorable couple.Overall I think I just wanted more from The Theory of Everything. The film centers around a lot of things, and it never devotes quite enough time to any one aspect. Major parts of Hawking's scientific advancements are glossed over. The conflict between Hawking and his wife never really picks up either. It's constantly a factor driving the story but the film shy's away from delving too deep into the conflict, and there seemed to be a resolution just when I thought things were really about to get going. But between the beautiful shots, fantastic performances, and incredibly significant subject matter I would say that The Theory of Everything is a great little work of art about one of science's most inspiring figures.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The Theory of Everything and its brilliance,"Unabashedly sweet and gentle, ""The Theory of Everything"" casts a warm glow on the personal life of physicist Stephen Hawking.From what I've read about Stephen and his marriage to Jane Wilde, some of what actually occurred may be softened quite a bit here. Still, the movie glows with passion and sympathy for its characters, and it has a phenomenal performance by Eddie Redmayne (""Les Misérables""). The screenplay is based on Jane's book ""Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen.""""The Theory of Everything"" is a great parallel between Stephen Hawking's declining health, his success as an author, lecturer, and scientist,and his marriage to Jane Wilde.Eddie Redmayne, who has recently won an Oscar for his brilliance in ""The Theory of Everything"", from the beginning exhibits the early on comings of ALS long before he is diagnosed formally. His ability to mimic and imitate these on comings enable Redmayne to display his incredible ability to portray such a brilliant mind such as Hawking.""The Theory of Everything"" has such a great parallelism, heart, and emotion as both Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones portray the brilliant mind of Stephen Hawking and his wife and caretaker, Jane Wilde.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Brief History of Hawking's Time,"Diagnosed with an incurable debilitating disease, British scientist Stephen Hawking defies odds and continues his important research, even after losing the ability to speak, in this biographical drama from acclaimed documentarian James Marsh. Credibly capturing Hawking's gradually declining health, Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for his performance, but it is actually co-star Felicity Jones who has the film's best moments as his wife, struggling to remain strong and not cave into a desire for normality. She has a particularly touching part in which she tries to get her resistant husband to use a 'spelling board'. Given that the film is based on Jane Hawking's autobiographical account of her time with her ex-husband, it is unsurprising that Jones is given such a juicy character and so much focus; the film is equally about her as Hawking. And yet, Marsh's attempts to balance the film being about both leads to it falling short as an insight into the mind of the scientific genius. Hawking's theories are often pushed into the background compared to something like 'A Beautiful Mind' which had plenty of scenes dedicated to John Nash's thought processes. Supported by an excellent Jóhann Jóhannsson score and detailed sets and costumes, this is certainly a handsome production, but those interested in a film more about Stephen than Jane Hawking may need to look elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"love is the theory behind everything, not time, not space, not God, only love","Personally I have been suffering from a certain degree of biopic fatigue, those annual staples blatantly pandering to academy recognition are often dazzling with Oscar-baity performances, but its narrative structure and skill usually are all laboriously conventional and monotonous. James Marsh's THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is the quintessential archetype of this sort and it is going to give Eddie Redmayne the coveted Oscar for such a taxing mission to imitate Stephen Hawking, the still alive-and-kicking bigwig cosmologist. However, Marsh conducts the film with a fluid pace and it wondrously invigorated by its technical crew, particularly Jóhann Jóhannsson's engrossing soundtrack and the ever- pervasive subdued light from lighting department.So, as a result, the film itself is a pretty good biopic, or more specifically, a good (even great) hagiography, since it is adapted from Jane Hawking's autobiography, she is Hawking's first wife and their marriage lasted for 30 years (1965-1995). Hence Jane (Jones) is not just a supportive wife who lives through all the ups-and-downs with Hawking, but completely overshadowed by his achievement and put aside in the corner as we might expect from any standard biopic of great man, instead, Jane is as much in center both in this picture and the un-common relationship as her renowned husband, it is their love story that touches, impresses and melts our hearts, so if you are going to this film harboring a false hope to witness Hawking's extraordinary academic path, you are destined to feel disappointed. On the other hand, the script excruciatingly whitewashes Jane and Stephen's extramarital affairs to offer both a mutual more high ground of looking good, their ménage- à-trois period with sweet widower Jonathan (Cox) is overwhelmingly in rapport, Jane's repressed feelings towards Jonathan never dare to overstep the social boundary, the most explicit indication is Jane's night visit of Jonathan's tent during a camping, then, that is it, it is always a safe card to leave the rest to audience's imagination, as far as the next morning they are not shown together walking out of the same tent, it is safe! As for Stephen's dallying with Elaine (Peake), goes a little bit more explicitly, using Penthouse magazine as the catalyst, but no further familial conflict is presented, the ugly side is well-preserved in the memories of those who are involved firsthand, audience's voyeuristic curiosity again is quenched mercilessly by the tacit agreement of the filmmakers and the insiders.No one should depreciate Redmayne's performance, even for the most sharp-tongued disparager, he is absolutely par excellence, when you grab such a once-in-a-lifetime chance and pull off a role with such sublime verisimilitude and imposing elbow-grease, Oscar is in your pocket, even a revered veteran's belated comeback stunner cannot take it away from you (sorry, Michael Keaton). Felicity Jones, is equally excellent, but without a physical-transformation edge to secure a win and one disadvantage is that she is hampered by the default of a hagiography, there is something emotive wanting. Nevertheless, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is a cohesively-orchestrated eulogy of the power of love, love is the theory behind everything, not time, not space, not God, only love, even it has decomposed into a past tense, the feeling of its once authentic presence will still be dauntless enough to encourage us to strive in this world of infinity, that's why we should thank this movie for giving us the blessing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Just peanuts for space,"It would be lovely to have A Theory of Everything, a lovely tuning in equation that can explain and predict the movement of celestial and atomic bodies in a vacuum (if there is such) of space. Anyone even vaguely interested in science would discard such thought- science and a theory that explains everything- all the factors that seem to contradict each other and are impossible to replicate- in a field that over a span of month new theory can resurface and rewrite our current knowledge. That what makes most of scientists bonkers, it is impossible to ever be right, and this statement is underlining (because at some aspects right can be right no matter what). And now it became abstractly confusing and I am not sure what I am- review- yes- I was supposed to review, not, em, confuse with random ideological thesis.I can securely state that over a good percentage of the globe is capable of recognizing name Stephen Hawking, or image of the crippled, old man with computer on a wheelchair. No wonder, this is now the name we use to describe genius. Even when many quoting Einstein or Hawking cannot place finger on the exact thing those figures have discovered. It has, after all, little to do with us- in other words- causing Apple to fall on the ground is not a form of demonstration. It requires abstract thinking, something that our mind does not need. Hawking a publisher of worldwide bestseller A Brief History of Time: From Big Bang to Black Holes, like title suggests is a quite brief historical account that explains notion of space/time, and it begins with explosion of arguably nothing that caused creation of everything and is possibly going to end in a bing crunch. Don't worry, you have millennium of time- you may think that going down to the groceries is a lot, but that's just peanuts to space.Oh- Ah- I should be reviewing a movie. Yes, this high scorer in categories varying from acting to music, is a second critically acclaimed biopic of a revolutionary Cambridge graduate. Now, I preferred the previous one, here meaning The Imitation Game. Even when from a personal point of view I prefer Hawking over Turing, that arrogant sense of humor, I am to judge movie not person.Recorded in an unorthodox way, with extreme close ups and vintage coloring board. Playing with light and not bothering to polish the inequalities- the camera work was unique- and kept me distracted from the narrative. Which is not a thing camera work should do. Yet I loved the time lapses and reverse edit at the end, and one shot that made me feel Hawkings frustration over the table. Score, much like in most of biopics was this idyllic combination of calm piano notes. The acting, although the supporting cast was passable and widely ranged, all the focus goes to young Eddie Redmeye- who throughout the movie feels like authentic Stephen Hawking- and shows a wide palette of talent, when tacking the scientist during different stages of the illness. I did have no problems with pacing, but at times the story seemed to drag. I did not really feel sympathetic to the characters, not surely why, I cannot place my finger on it (much like on a single electron). I disliked Jane, maybe she was supposed to be like this, but the movie did not keep me interested to see how her fate would unfold. I didn't feel like being part of the event, not sure if I am the observer, or if i am to step into shoes (or wheels) of the man. Cinematographically, a waste of potential- so much more could be done to show the anger and confusion and struggle, also, there was a chance of graphically explaining the abstract theories, which I was waiting for, quite blankly. There was no ""wow"" moment in which the plot, camera and music come into a wonderful crescendo and unison and your mind goes ""this is it"".Concluding, it is a good, insightful watch. With great, ambitious lead and interesting presentation, which unfortunately also brings movie to a ""uncomfortable"" style of narrative, that instead adding to fluidity slows it down. A good watch, but not a must see- recommendation.Summarising:Direction 5/10Script 7/10Pacing 6/10Originality 5/10 (there is another biopic, that funnily enough, is played by other this years award nominee)Artistic attributes 7/10 (here meaning costumes, set, score)Acting 7/10Loyalty to the source 8/10Personal 18/30Makes-you-think-or-feel 7/10Memorability 7/10 (it won't leave my mind anytime soon)Watchability 7/10 (I would eagerly put it back on) Overall 66/100 66%",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Almost everything is great,"Quickie Review:A young scientist named Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), is in search of finding a single unifying theory that explains everything about the universe. As ambitious as that sounds, it is made more challenging when he is diagnosed with motor neuron disease that will slowly take away his ability to move or speak. Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane (Felicity Jones) decide to fight the disease together, naive to the difficult journey that lies ahead. Based on the life of Stephen Hawking, The Theory of Everything showcases acting of impeccable quality. An inspirational story of a man that overcomes his disability to pursue his passion. At the same time a moving story about human flaws. Definitely one of the finer films of 2014 that must be seen.Full Review:Stephen Hawking is one of the most renowned scientist living today. Considering how he was able to continue his research despite the motor neuron disease makes his contributions all the more impressive. Such an inspirational man, and yet many (including myself) probably are not aware of his personal story. I had high expectations for this film, and now that I've seen it I agree that The Theory of Everything deserves all the Oscars attention it has been getting.This is a wonderfully acted film by both Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. The movie covers Hawking's life from the 60's to the early 00's, so you get to see the disease progressively get worse. The way Redmayne shows the gradual effects over time was flawless. I'm not sure how he got his body and face to contort so accurately, but there were times where it felt like the real Stephen Hawking himself was on screen. The real brilliance of Redmayne's performance was not how he looked, but how he was able to emote through the limited range of movement and speech. He was able to show the vulnerability and the humor of Hawking convincingly even in the later stages of the disease. Felicity Jones' performance as Jane Hawking was crucial because her relationship with Stephen Hawking was the emotional crux for the entire film. Felicity Jones absolutely delivered, the emotional transformation that Jones' character goes through is just as impressive as Redmayne's physical change.On the top of the acting caliber, I liked how the script handled the characters. After being together for decades, of course the disease starts to affect the marriage. The script and the director could've easily made the relationship problems seem one-sided, painting one of the two as being wrong. Instead the film treats Stephen and Jane Hawking as real human beings. A couple that was naive and flawed as any young couples are. Both are neither guilty nor innocent, but make very understandable and human mistakes. This ultimately made the film delightfully relatable and emotionally impactful. I have to mention how beautiful the soundtrack for the film was. Instantly from the opening scene the evocative music brought goosebumps to my skin. I have loved Johann Johannsson's music in the past and this might be some of his best work yet. I am glad he is getting the recognition he deserves.All in all, I highly recommend The Theory of Everything. Some people are bothered that it is not a completely accurate story, to those people may I mention that Stephen Hawking himself has said it's ""broadly true"" and reacted positively overall. So the film also got a seal of approval from Hawking. In the end movies are meant for entertainment and not a high-school textbook. In that sense not only was The Theory of Everything entertaining, it was a deeply moving.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Positives and Negatives...,"First thing, the lead performances are alone worth a watch. As everybody else says, Eddie Redmayne has nailed the character. The thing I liked the most is the way the characters will make you empathize with them. My only complaint is the that film is only as much about Stephen Hawking as it is about a person with Motor Neuron disease.That being said, the movie have a lot of potential if only we could get to see a little more of Stephen Hawking as a scientist than a family man. The narrative could get a little predictable and boring, not that I expect any suspense, but I think a little more science could have benefited the movie.The background score is pretty good.

Interesting by Default,"""The Theory of Everything"" is the kind of standard-issue biopic that breezes through the life of whoever is its subject (in this case Stephen Hawking), hitting all the highlights while glossing tidily over all of the complexities that would actually exist and surely did in real life.At least this one isn't afraid of addressing the less flattering elements of its protagonist, namely the fact that Hawking dumped his devoted wife for his nurse after his wife had spent years caring for his every need. Eddie Redmayne gives an impressive physical performance as Hawking (it's no wonder he won the Oscar -- the Academy loves performances like these), while Felicity Jones suffers nobly, as wives always do in biopics like this. She is really the more interesting character, or would be if the film allowed her to be, instead of treating her as an assemblage of personality traits it can use to move the plot forward. All of the dramatic conflicts in the film are treated equally, and none of them seem to carry much significance. Hawking's announcement that he's leaving his wife, for example, is handled by the actors as if he's told her he just spotted a mouse in the basement.The film does a good job of recreating its time period, which is something another Oscar-bait period piece from the same year, ""The Imitation Game,"" didn't do. Still, the film manages to look like a magazine ad, everything bathed in a glossy glow.The story of Stephen Hawking is so interesting and the movie is competently enough made that it ends up by default as being interesting itself. But is it too much to ask that a biopic once in a while do something, anything, surprising or daring?Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Not so brief,"I had high hopes for The Theory Of Everything. The trailer looked phenomenal, and judging from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb scores the critical reception was positive. Over All-I was expecting moreThe film follows the life of Stephen Hawkings, from his Oxford days to his offered knighthood.There are good things in this film. Eddie Redmayne's performance as Hawking was phenomenal. Every mannerism was perfect and I look forward to see more from him. Phenomenal portrayed Hawkings as somewhat arrogant, but with great charm, curiosity and a good heart. The score for the film is fantastic also. Johan Johannsson produces some wonderful piano pieces,and the score makes the film worthwhile. There other good things in the film, none that stand out as much as these two though. I laughed ,smiled, and got invested in the story in multiple occasions.But it wasn't enough. For a film that explores time so much, it has some serious pacing issues. The film slows down too much, and never quite refunds it's pace. It moves forwards and backward, pace wise, and that makes the 2 running time seem like 2 and a half. I found it hard to get invested in Hawkings' wife. Felicity Jones portrays her as uptight, and somewhat cold, although I didn't doubt her love for Hawkings for a second. The film does a great job of showcasing the effects that degenerate diseases have in both the sufferer and those around them. Some characters, like hawking's school friends and lecturer seemed 2 dimensional and boring.Emily Watson and Charlie Cox both appear and give solid performances, but nothing more can really be said. The film appears to be by a young, inexperienced director, who has potential to grow into a great one, however James Marsh has a good few films under his belt(none of which I have seen.) I'd definitely see what else he has to offer, but I hope his timing improves, as it was detrimental to the films success as a narrative.In short, the film has a great central performance, an amazing score, but its pacing and Ack of interesting characters drags it down.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Not worthy of the hype,"I was compelled to watch this movie after hearing how Eddie Redmayne gave the performance of a life time, thus becoming the hands-down favorite to win the Oscar for Best Actor. I was disappointed.The story lacked direction and purpose. It had potential to be a great character piece like Raging Bull, but that was lost in the parts of the movie that focused on science and Stephen Hawking's ailment. It also failed to be a truly good scientific movie because it almost glazed over Hawking's work. I couldn't tell if the relationships, the discoveries, the fame, or the declining physical health were supposed to be the driving force of the movie.Now, I must admit the performances by the supporting cast were heartfelt and sympathetic yet not really like real people. Eddie Redmayne seemed intent on merely making Hawking seem nice and innocent and consequently one-dimensional. I was disappointed too in that his transformation into an Als patient was so revered. Yes, he looked like Stephen Hawking, but there was no depth behind it. No substance. No deeper motivation. All in all, Redmayne disappointed me.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

7/10,"A very powerful story with amazing moments and flat out stunning performance's by its leads that gets immensely toned down by some of the very mediocre filmaking that got behind it.I want to say this first because it was the think that really bugged me: the first act of this movie is a mess. Throughout the first twenty minutes I was really disappointed. Even Eddie Redmayne, who I will rave about later, was kind of bad in the start. Everything seems so offbeat, clichéd, cheesy, it really seems as it is setting itself up for failure from second one, where it starts with possibly the most clichéd and frustratingly predictable scene it could have possibly started with. It seems to be directed by a computer: ""shot here, close up here, establishing here transitional here a now to cut"" was what I heard the screen screaming to me at the start. Plus it had many laughable filmaking and storytelling techniques, which, although got less and less frequent, carried throughout the whole film. It had a number of interactions which were supposedly there to elevate the drama, but ended up making me kind of embarrassed. Moreover...man what was going on with this cinematography? It is the most uneven I have seen in my life! The shot composition isn't in anyway off, but that lighting and that color palette changed every other scene, it was so off putting!Fortunately of all those negatives the movie only carries on only the last two, after the first act. Once it gets deep into its emotional and thematic core it becomes fascinating and sometimes very hard to watch. To say Eddie Redmayne is cast perfectly would be an understatement, he carries out the gargantuan task of portraying the great Hawking, in the best way possible and succeeds in a performance that deserves all and more of the attention he got, this actor can do no wrong at this point. Equally brilliant, but unfortunately much less talked about, it Felicity Jones, who isn't definitely in as a shiny of a role, but she surely is as amazingly great as her co-lead. With subtlety she holds up the emotional core of the movie that could have really collapsed had their not been a performance of such brilliance at the center of it. Moreover I have to give recognition to a great score that elevated even more the sentiment the movie had. On the other hand, I am kind of torn on the screenplay of the film. On on side it explores some very human themes that touched me deeply and gives a brilliant portrayal of this stunning story, but on the other it gives a very, very simplistic cut to the whole scientific aspect that I would have enjoyed a lot to see, had it been there.To sum it up, ""The Theory of Everything"" is an engrossing an emotional resonant real life drama that I would recommend to see, it's only unfortunate that it could have been much more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Great performances,"What is amazing about this movie is the spectacular performances of Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. The movie does not make the clichéd portrayal of a relationship that makes it seem flawlessly perfect, it shows the harsh reality of Stephen and Jane Hawking's relationship deteriorating as they grow up, which makes the movie realistic and dramatic. Yet, the movie doesn't feel like it is about Stephen Hawking, but rather the point of view of Jane Hawking about their relationship. The movie makes a good effort to portray the struggle of Stephen's disease, but you always have to remind yourself of Stephen's achievements that the movie does not make shine, or you'll feel like you're watching the biopic of a very normal person, not one of the great minds of the century.

There is no negative point of this movie and really when I'm writing this I watched it twice to get more emotional....But I gave it 4 and half ratings... But the half rating is cut for they haven't shown us HOW HE DISCOVERED HIS THEORY. His efforts and to researches those are lacing part.. but still it's the best movie I have seen ... So i am gonna watch it again... What by you?,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Falls Just Short Of Being An Honest Biography. ♦ 70%,"As much as I dislike the title of this film for inappropriateness, I liked Eddie Redmayne's portrayal as Stephen Hawking. And the degree of both is just above average.Anthony McCarten may have had plenty of headaches while writing this romantic drama under the disguise of a biography, because how large a gimmick is the story, the same goes for director James Marsh in building the setup. They should've had gone back in time, defying their subject scientist's theory, and pondered upon how to create an adaptation of a memoir which seems partly biographical and mostly a novella. I haven't read the memoir and nor do intend to, but the main problem with this apparently inspiring film is that it focuses more on the personal lives of Professor Hawking and his ex-wife. While that be it, the thing that fuels this problem into a wildfire is that the audience think of it as just not a romantic drama (like the synopsis suggests), but actually an upright biography about the cosmologist.To an extent, even director James Marsh (whose Oscar-winning doc Man On Wire, about Philippe Petit's daredevil act, failed to gather traction, so Robert Zemeckis is making a film) tries to sweep it off as a romantic drama. The ounces of insights into the professor's study and his theories can be found only in the background, thus nullifying the whole shindig. As a romantic drama, I started loathing few characters, which if I disclose who may cause you to loathe me as well; characters who can be found in a string of romantic dramas over the past decades.As a biography, which it sometimes pretends to be, The Theory of Everything shuns science which is ironic. Eddie Redmayne is fabulous, although he may slip by with only an Oscar nod, maybe. Felicity Jones is sweet and so were the supporting characters, who would have had bigger roles to act if this were not a genre confusing tide.The cinematography is fine, and so is the music, the latter of which tries to support the apparent inspiration inducing characteristic I was talking about. All said and done, the film never quite bores you, always engaging us with short sequences that describe as to what really happened since 1963. Had they exploited 5 minutes of the 120 minute narration to explain his disease, I would have jumped up in my chair.BOTTOM LINE: The Theory of Everything is a non-self-deprecating drama that takes its viewers on a canoe-ride into the lives of the great Stephen Hawking and second-rate Jane Hawking. A drama so good and a biography so bad that if I wanted to learn about the scientist's theories, I would reread his books.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

An astonishing 'bore de force'.,"This is the dullest film I have seen in the last 10 years, probably even longer. I think the main problem is that most people know who SH is and how disabled he is, so wasting time on his illness and SH's deterioration over time was stupid. There was no drama here - he has motor neurone disease and you don't get better, surprise, surprise. So instead the film could have explored the characters in much more depth but sadly, the characterisation is so shallow there is nothing to applaud here. For the actor portraying SH to get the Oscar for Best Actor is laughable. Save your money by not going to see this film and instead use it to buy 'Untouchable' (Intouchables) by Olivier Nakache & Eric Toledano if you want to see a beautiful film about a disabled person.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The powerful story of a much missed Genius.,"The story of the incredible and much missed figure if Stephen Hawking, a genius and public personality, from his university days, to later life.Foolishly, I thought this was going to be a heavy going, high brow movie, I wasn't expecting what followed, it's an intensely moving and powerful story of love and adversity.It is very bright and romantic early on, it does of course change once he gets his diagnosis, you will learn and understand a little more about motor neurones disease. It is incredibly well realised and portrayed.The incredible relationship between Stephen and his wife Jane is explored in detail, the effect his illness had on her, and the incredible love between them.You get a true picture of the man, and his wonderful sense of humour, he truly is much missed.Eddie Redmayne, no other words, he is phenomenal here, but then if you've watched this film, you don't need my word for it, such a versatile actor, he must have put so much work into this role, the entire cast put in first rate performances.The Cinematography is fantastic, it's a beautiful looking movie, the period details are exquisitely captured, both visually and musically, it is a film that provides for all of the senses.A quite wonderful film, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
My Rating: 7,"Despite the relatively low valuation that we put to this headline writing about this film is worthwhile. At the moment when the cliché of the young scientist with comprehensive bizarre but brilliant intellect was broken by explaining the personality of the protagonist (like who he was in fact), the film makes sense, albeit seriously reminds us of a previous title on the same topic.It is important to note the film because of the history it represents. Because of the strength of the protagonist to live with the hope that it will deal with every obstacle which he will face. Because of the love that is able to give such power and to multiply the good. Truly understanding that life is a struggle and that the more you fight, the more you distance yourself from the bad and the possibilities of failure is a state of mind typical of big and powerful people. Although they might not look exactly like this. The constant effort to reach the wave in the end leads you in the dock of a lake placid waters of happiness. And there is where all your previous existence gets its meaning.Therefore, we will counteract the physical forces and not let ourselves be sucked in by a black hole. We will strive to expand the universe and we hope that you will follow us in your personal example.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.fr/",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The Theory of a love story 8/10,"I believe this is the best romance movie that is based on a true story. James Marsh the director did a marvelous job, the score composed by Johann Johannsson is remarkably beautiful. Eddie Redmayne gives the performance of his life as Stephen Hawking. Felicity Jones is incredibly talented as Jane Wlide. The movie's tone is beautiful and well made, I got attached within the first 20 minutes of the film. There are many other movies based on a true story that have a romance between two characters, in which one of the characters suffers from a disease: 'Breath"", ""I Still Believe"", ""The Fault in Our Stars"" etc. But ""The Theory Of Everything"" tops everyone because of the chemistry between the characters and how their emotions drive the movie and make it shine.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Is best actor award justified?,"It seems certain that Eddie Redmayne will be collecting the acting gong at the Oscars in a couple of weeks, but is it deserved?Redmayne plays Stephen Hawking who is obviously very much still alive and well against the odds. It is the type of role that the production company was probably canvassing for an Oscar before filming even started! There is also the difficulty of whether it's acting or imitation. Judging from interviews with Redmayne he appears very suited for the role as he comes across as a very idiosyncratic character.The film is based on the first marriage of Hawking to Jane(Felicity Jones) who has to come to terms with the onset of Hawking's motor neurone disease. It is thoroughly engaging and the two leads are quite brilliant throughout. Having said that I still can't help thinking it's more imitation than acting, but just maybe that's why it is such brilliant acting!",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
An uplifting story about one of the most brilliant scientists who ever lived.,"The Theory of Everything is a biopic about Stephen Hawking(Eddie Redmayne) & the love story between him & his wife, Jane Hawking(Felicity Jones). Stephen Hawking is diagnosed with a life threatening disease. The film chronicles the relationship between Stephen & Jane Hawking over the years. It also shows us how Hawking made significant breakthroughs in science, despite his physical deterioration due to the disease.The Theory of Everything is an outstanding film. I loved the fact that Hawking never gave up in spite of all the difficulties he faced in his life. Jane's resolve to stay with Stephen despite his illness, moved me. The relationship between Stephen & Jane Hawking is one of the highlights of the film. Their relationship exudes positiveness, strength & undying love & dedication to each other. The main highlight of the movie are the performances. Eddie Redmayne has given the best performance of his career as Stephen Hawking. Redmayne completely embodies the character. The way Redmayne has portrayed Hawking's physical & speech deterioration is jaw-dropping & flawless. No wonder he's the front-runner to win the Oscar for Best Actor & won the Golden Globe for Best Actor. Redmayne truly deserves all the praise & awards that come his way. Felicity Jones is spectacular as Jane Hawking. Jones has also given her career's best performance. Harry Lloyd is great as Brian. David Thewlis is brilliant as Dennis Sciama. Charlie Cox is incredible as Jonathan Hellyer Jones. The supporting characters are impressive too. The music by Johann Johannsson is captivating. If I had to pick one flaw in the film, I'd say that the second half is a tad bit slow. Still, this movie deserves all the Academy Award nominations it has received. A must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A conventional biopic that tries to cover way too much territory,"""Your glasses are always dirty.""I have to admit I was a bit disappointed with James Marsh's The Theory of Everything as I found the love story a bit bland and the biopic in general very conventional and safe. It is well produced and banks on a strong lead performance from Eddie Redmayne, but there is not really much else to the story. Marsh focuses on Hawking's relationship with his wife and the battle they faced together with his illness, but there is not much more to it and by the end I didn't feel I had learned anything new about this brilliant man. Marsh has made some interesting documentaries in the past (Project Nim and the far superior Man on Wire), and in a way this film seemed liked one covering one fact after another, but it lacked personality. I never believed the romance at the beginning of the movie; it was all rushed. The film's greatest flaw is that it tries to cover too long a period in Hawking's life. It goes from one memorable event in his life to the next without digging under the surface of who this brilliant man really was. I never felt connected with these characters despite their inspirational story. I wasn't moved by scenes or events in Hawking's life that should've moved me and I think it's because Marsh was focused on trying to cover all the important moments in his life. The greatest thing about this film is Redmayne's strong performance who deserves the recognition he has received, but I don't think there is anything else to it.I'm still surprised that Anthony McCarten's adapted screenplay was nominated for the Academy Awards, because I found everything about it very conventional. The screenplay was adapted from Jane Hawking's autobiographical book, so the film focuses more on their relationship than on Stephen's accomplishments (although we still get a scene where he receives a standing ovation from his scholars). We are told the story through Jane's point of view and despite loving this man very much she gets weary of him through the years since he doesn't accept help from anyone else. Some of my personal conclusions from this film are that his family isn't portrayed too well (they don't seem to do anything to help Stephen through his illness) and Stephen himself never seems to be grateful for what Jane is doing for him. Perhaps two reasons why the marriage didn't work out in the end.If there is one reason why I would recommend this film to anyone it's for Eddie Redmayne's performance alone. It is impressive how well he manages to portray Stephen's mannerisms, his facial expressions, and his movements. It is a physically demanding performance and Redmayne actually makes you believe he is battling through ALS. It may not be my favorite performance of the year (probably because I wanted to like this character more and get to know who he really was), but it is an incredible one nonetheless. Redmayne will forever be remembered for his role here. Felicity Jones has also received a lot of praise for her performance as Jane. It isn't nearly as showy as Redmayne's performance was, but she delivers a strong role. She is a talented actress, but I think she has been better in other films and is being a bit over-hyped for her performance here. The rest of the cast only appear as characters in a series of events with very little personality so there wasn't much Harry Lloyd, David Thewlis, Emily Watson, or Simon McBurney could bring to the film. Redmayne overpowers everyone here and this becomes his movie. He is the only reason why I am recommending this movie which to be honest I found quite boring otherwise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

An Emotional Journey That Misses the Intellectual Depth,"Focus on Relationship Over AchievementsThe Theory of Everything dives deeply into the personal and emotional dynamics between Stephen Hawking and his first wife, Jane. While this brings a humanizing layer, the film overlooks Hawking's groundbreaking scientific achievements, which could have offered viewers a fuller understanding of his legacy.Deviation from the BookThose familiar with Hawking's book of the same name may find the film lacking. The book delves into the theoretical and scientific brilliance of Hawking's work, whereas the movie centers almost exclusively on the complexities of his relationship with Jane, making it feel like a different story.Missed Opportunities for Visual StorytellingThe film could have used animation or visual effects to illustrate Hawking's theories, much like Interstellar did with its visuals. Instead, the director opted to focus on the emotional aspects, which, while touching, felt like a ""safe choice"" that sometimes reduced the renowned scientist to domestic struggles.Pacing and ScreenplayThe screenplay felt drawn out, with limited substantive content to hold the viewer's attention. Some scenes seemed to drag on, making the film's pace sluggish.Strong Acting and Simple Sound DesignThe performances, particularly from the lead actors, were superb and carried much of the film's emotional weight. The sound design was understated, effectively supporting the film's tone without overwhelming it.CastingThe casting choices were well-executed, with actors who convincingly portrayed the real-life figures they were based on.Overall ImpressionThe Theory of Everything is a heartfelt portrayal of Stephen Hawking's personal life but falls short in celebrating the intellectual achievements that made him a global icon. Viewers looking for a deeper dive into his theories might find this focus disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
An emotional and interesting telling of the life of Stephen Hawking,"The Theory of Everything is an emotional biopic on the life of Stephen Hawking that shows a lot of the struggles that he had to overcome in his tough life. Now initially upon hearing this you may think that it is going to be a much more serious film strictly documenting the key events in life of Stephen Hawking. Now although it does include these events, the film has a large focus on the relationship between himself and Jane and therefore does play out as more of a romantic film like a love story. This is what made the film a lot more engaging and interesting as it really captures the joy in Stephen's life at a time that many people would think was full of pain.The performance of Eddie Redmayne is one of the best of 2014 if not the best as he captures the looks, personality and attributes of Stephen Hawking which has to be one of the toughest roles to portray. He does all this so well that he stands out above the rest and really puts him in the race for Best Actor. The film at times did feel like it was getting a little predictable but that is kind of expected when dealing with a story that is very real and people may be somewhat familiar with. In summary this film was not the greatest film of the year and is certainly not for everyone, but if you enjoy romantic dramas or want to learn more about the life of Stephen Hawking; this may be a film you will enjoy - 7.9",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The Theory of Life,"This vibrant portrait of Stephen Hawking is not a lecture on astrophysics (we do not learn much about the Cosmos) but a lesson of life.A brilliant and promising student is diagnosed with Charcot disease while he has not defended his thesis yet. This neurological disease is going to attack everything : his motricity, his elocution... but will not undermine his motivation. His determination and his humor (derision spirit) remain intact. His family experiences periods of doubt but his brave, strong, devoted wife, Jane, is an example of courage.Through his life, by his shaken experience, by his scientific work, Hawking understands the concept of time. This movie shows that time is running out, life is a chance and love is our great resource. This film is food for thoughts. As Hawking says ""Where there is life, there is hope."" or, I would say, where there is life, there is love.I would like to salute the great performance of young actor Eddie Redmayne.

Cliché but elegant,"I will say that Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones really does knocks it out of the park. They really do bring this movie to life, which is a Biography on the relationship between Stephen Hawking and his wife. I will admit the movie did get boring at times for me which I sort of feel guilty about. Since it's about a man that has a brilliant mind but deals with a illness that paralyzes his body. And tries to cope with the situation while having a relationship and coming up with theory on time and existence. The cinematography is beautifully shot and the music really fits into the environment. What I thought that was lacking was a bit more substance and less cliché. Also the lack of science and how Hawking came up with his theory could disappoint some audiences. Although the actor was spot on playing Stephen Hawking but more focus on his thought process and answering to why and how of certain areas of the character would have made it better in my own opinion. Oh and also I don't know all about the whole relationship situation between Hawking and his first wife, but his first wife was a sacrificial saint. So yeah, it's a elegantly crafted movie that might come off a bit too cliché to some audiences including myself.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Beautiful Performance,"Dear god, this was a beautiful performance.

Amazing story rendered in an outstanding film,"Over the past two and a half decades, I have read three books by theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and a biography of him, as well as attending his famous 1995 lecture at the Royal Albert Hall in London (the last physicist to fill that venue was Albert Einstein in 1933). Furthermore I was very aware of the buzz around this film and especially the plaudits for the performance by Eddie Redmayne in the central role. So there was no way I was going to miss this movie and I was not disappointed. Redmayne is simply brilliant and totally inhabits the role, but I was also impressed by newcomer Felicity Jones as Hawking's first wife Jane.At one point in the film, Jane briefly explains the nature of the theory of everything: an attempt to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics. But like CMB - the cosmic radiation that is regarded as proof of the big bang theory - the science is in the background. In the foreground is the relationship between Stephen and Jane and indeed the film is based on her 1999 memoir, ""Music To Move The Stars"" which was republished in a revised version in 2007 as ""Travelling To Infinity, My Life with Stephen"".Life married to a self-centred genius would never have been easy but, when one adds the impact of progressive motor neurone disease plus the fame that went with the former and the support staff that went with the latter, it is a testimony to Jane's humanity that the marriage lasted so long, although the later years were characterised by an open relationship on both sides. The towering performance by Redmayne, movingly displaying the physical deterioration over time, plus family scenes shot as if with a home movie camera, makes the film look more like a documentary than an artistic creation. Indeed brilliant British director James Marsh has more experience with documentaries (""Man On Wire"") than films (""Shadow Dancer"") and this skill has paid off enormously with this splendid film that is bound to win many awards.The most moving lines are when Stephen and Jane decide to part and when they are joined by their three children at Buckingham Palace and the final scenes - a flashback through time - offers a clever and apposite conclusion to the film but not the story (Hawking - given two years to live when first diagnosed with MND - is amazingly now 72).",,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Sorry But It's Not As Good As Many People Claim,"In a recent review of a Christian propaganda film I did state that there's a danger of elevating Professor Stephen Hawking as the greatest scientist in the history of humanity . According to other scientists this simply isn't true , he's not on a par with the likes of Albert Einstein or Ernest Rutherford or many scientists of the 20th Century . He is of course what is known as a celebrity scientist who along with the abrasive love him or hate him biologist Richard Dawkins and uber-geek boy Brian Cox someone who can make the intricate , mind boggling and often incomprehensible topic of science understandable and fascinating for a mainstream layman audience . Much of Hawking's celebrity comes from the very sad fact that he has spent the majority of his life trapped inside a useless body due to motor neuron disease . He is - and I hope no one picks me up wrong - the good human form of the pop culture sci-fi view of the alien genius villain who is all brain and no body such as The Mekon and Davros .I'm saying this because I've got the instinctive feeling that THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING might be getting rewarded for the subject rather than the content and is a film I found difficult to take toThe story starts in 1963 with young able bodied intellectual future scientist Stephen Hawking meeting young literature student Jane Wilde at Cambridge University . I've no idea what the young Jane Wilde looked like in reality but played by the beautiful Felicity Jones she is an absolute stunner and by far the best moments of the film are in the early stages when romance blooms between this unlikely couple . Unfortunately adversity is on the horizon and unfortunately for the audience we then get the Oscar baiting type aspect that the film has its eyes onDirector James Marsh made a rather reserved drama about the troubles called SHADOW DANCER which while treating the subject matter with non sensationalist respect brought a rather slow paced and poetic feel to the film which I wasn't too keen on and I found myself wishing he'd done something a bit more risky and dynamic with this film which has that look of a light hearted one off drama you see on Sunday nights on ITV . Despite the absolute liberties taken with facts at least in A BEAUTIFUL MIND director Ron Howard did bring a great visual panache to a rather talkative film . Here however there's little in the way of cinematic feel and revolves around love in the face of adversity . Ask yourself this: If THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING wasn't about real characters in a film based on a true life story would it have picked up so many rewards or nominations ? I rest my case",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Turning the Tide,"Greetings again from the darkness. Stephen Hawking would most certainly make anyone's list of the most fascinating people to have overcome severe obstacles in life to achieve greatness. Even today, at age 72, Hawking remains one of the foremost physicists and cosmologists. His extraordinary mind now 50+ years trapped inside a body that failed him, and as we learn, should have killed him by the time he was 23.Director James Marsh is known for his work on two documentaries: Project Nim, and Man On Wire. His flair with reality in those two films is mostly kept in check with this conventional biopic. Based on Jane Hawking's book ""Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen"", the film does a nice job of showing us the stages of his motor neuron disease, while never digging too deep into the resulting hardships for Stephen or Jane (his wife).Eddie Redmayne (Les Miserable, My Week with Marilyn) delivers the type of performance that often results in awards. His physical contortions capture the Hawking we have all seen, yet he also emotes the charm and wry humor that accompanies his genius. Jane is played by Felicity Jones (so terrific in Like Crazy) and since it's based on her book, we are provided a glimpse into her strength and tenacity as she refuses to give up on Hawking or their relationship.Some basic science is touched upon here - mostly through beer foam on a table or the glowing embers from a fireplace, but it's highly recommended that you read Hawking's best selling book ""A Brief History of Time"" if you have not already done so. It's written using language so clear and concise, that even I almost understood it! Much more than science, this film is about the tenacity of Jane and her ability to keep Stephen moving forward while still pursuing her own studies and raising their three kids.The evolution of their relationship is deftly handled, even as they each drift away towards others. When the break eventually occurs, it is the one moment in the film where heartfelt emotion is on full display. Oddly enough, it's more relief for both parties than disappointment. In light of the doctor's original estimate of two years to live, this moment is quite poignant.Excellent support work comes courtesy of David Thewlis as Hawking's professor and mentor, Emily Watson as Jane's mother, Simon McBurney as Stephen's dad, Charlie Cox as Jonathan (Jane's second husband), and Maxine Peake as Elaine (Stephen's second wife). Also of note, Harry Lloyd plays Stephen's classmate and friend Brian. Mr. Lloyd is the great, great, great grandson of Charles Dickens.You can see this one without being intimidated by the science, and instead get a glimpse at Hawking's challenges and the strength of Jane.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

It has everything.,"""I have a slight problem with the whole celestial-dictator premise."" Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne)The Theory of Everything has everything a Hollywood melodrama requires: attractive people fighting big odds and loving happily ever after. Except that this is the story of the rock star of cosmologists, Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), stricken in his twenties with motor neuron disease, related to ALS and Lou Gehrig, and predicted to claim his life within 3 years.Only it doesn't, and this heroic, brilliant professor spends his life thinking and writing, most notably his best-selling book, A Brief History of Time. Because this screenplay is an adaptation of his wife, Jane's (Felicity Jones) memoir, Traveling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen, the film is largely about their romance, which is nicely done, and their three children (a bit of a drag), and a brief episode or two of his actually lecturing about his theories of black holes, time, and the super question about the existence of God, whom Stephen makes a part of his argument..But if it has to be an emphasis on the challenges of their marriage and divorce, writer/director James Marsh has done well keeping the maudlin at bay and showing a sincere love between the principals. Eddie Redmayne should be nominated for an Oscar—he gets all the Hawking tics down remarkably well, going beyond Daniel Day-Lewis's virtuoso performance in My Left Foot.Add to all this-- good movie-making: D.P.

What I don't want to do is see some generic family drama where protagonist X deals with obstacle Y and receives bittersweet ending Z.This is Hollywood at its worst, instead of trying to step up to Stephen Hawking's level and actually make an inspiring film about physics and the universe (in the spirit of Carl Sagan), they have taken him down to their level so that he makes sense to the average man on the street. You may not realize it but this movie spits on Stephen Hawking's accomplishment as a theoretical physicist.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne,"""Where there's life, there's hope""The Theory of Everything is one of my favourite biopics I've seen.
The very well written story in combination with the amazing acting is wonderful.
Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones really rocked this film, just stunning performances from both of them.
They made you feel all the emotions they're feeling at every moment.The Theory of Everything is funny, it's sad...it's life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Magnificent.,"One of the greatest biopic films I've ever seen, this is a deeply moving account of Stephen Hawking's remarkable life. Eddie Redmayne's performance is up there with the best of all time. A truly phenomenal, Oscar-winning piece of physical acting.It is packed full of memorable and emotionally charged scenes, the standout being Stephen and Jane's heartbreakingly sad separation which, with very few words, carries such magnitude.The film certainly focuses more on Stephen's family life than his academic successes, but that is not a flaw. His life story was very much a tale of love.While Stephen's life was one of immense adversity, his stubborn, pragmatic approach and wonderful sense of humour were his survival kit.The beautiful soundtrack by Jòhann Jòhannsson is a perfectly fitting accompaniment to the story.Without a fault in my opinion, this movie is as wondrous as Stephen's theories.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Felicity Jones gives some very strong work,"There could've definitely been a better film made out of this story. I'm sure any way you spin it, you would've come out with a film that feels like formula all the way through, but I do think that the script could've been better in actually giving the arcs more emotional power. As it is, it sort of just goes through the motions, while still highlighting its sentimentality in a really obvious and sometimes overbearing way (and some of this is also due to the direction). And yet despite that, it's such an easy film to like. I enjoyed it, and I think the two leads definitely give it its effectiveness. As good as I thought Redmayne was, he wasn't particularly surprising. If you've seen the trailer or any clip, you sort of get the idea. There's just no other way a role like this could be played, technically. The thing is, Redmayne does everything he needs to and yet I wasn't particularly affected by him on an emotional level. Despite how showy the role looks on the surface, he's just sort of there. Felicity Jones is who I really loved. Without any hint of artificiality or trying to chew up the scenery, she's just so effective and has such a warm presence. It's with her that I felt the heart and soul of the film, not Redmayne, and I think she should totally be in line for an Oscar nomination. Definitely the best thing about the film",,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Beautiful movie,"Simply a beautiful movie that is a must watch. The movie did a great job at displaying the life of Hawking, with all his struggles and humour included.

"When There is Life, There Will Be Hope","It's not a film full with science, massive actions and stunning visual effects, it's just a simple story narrating the life of a noble scientist. Not knowing of how true is the screenwriters adapting Stephen Hawking's life to the big screen, but the moderate pacing does not upset the audiences as it fills with a lot of interesting theoretic dialogues which some might be funny and the special yet specific cinematography has successfully crafted a beautiful life full of love. A big applause for Eddie Redmayne who has worked hard to portray a character with motor neuron disease that looks extremely real, nature yet pitiful; while Felicity Jones is doing great to support by building up a charming and emotional chemistry. With amazing and calm scores from Jóhann Jóhannsson to enhance the overall tone of the film, the biopic inspires us that when there is life, there will be hope and so, to be courageous, to be strong in overcoming challenges, it will still be successful in achieving dreams. It also ends impressively and audiences would have stunt for a moment thinking on what we have made so far in our life.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"A wonderful dramatization, if a little uninvolving","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAt Cambridge University in 1963, young physicist Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is on the road to greatness, and despite his social awkwardness, has even managed to attract the attention of Jane (Felicity Jones), a young female student. Then he is suddenly stricken down with Motor Neurone Disease, leaving him a paralyzed, invalid wreck. The doctors tell him he only has a few years to live, but he and Jane fight the odds and defeat them head on, with Stephen living a full and brilliant life, and becoming one of the most celebrated physicists of all time.Here I am, a year after it came out, finally reviewing the film that may well serve as Redmayne's Taxi Driver, while he's kicked off this year with another film released on New Year's Day, where he's played a trans-gendering artist. A biopic of well known professor Stephen Hawking was a very interesting idea for a film dramatization, given the place he's managed to secure in popular culture over the years for someone from such an unshow-business background (I honestly thought he was genuinely American, given his voice box.)Yet somehow, despite some impressive acting and sweeping production values, The Theory of Everything fails to really sweep you up in the account of Hawking's life. Something...is just missing from the script, some kind of oompth or gravitas that gives the drama the real motivating kick that it needs to be really amazing. Somehow, you're just not as embroiled in the trials and tribulations of his life as you could have been. It's one of those films where everything is aesthetically fine, but no real magic spins off.Still, Redmayne deserves his recognition, and it could have been a far worse attempt to document this most unique and amazing of men. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Eddie Redmayne is extraordinary.,"It's not often, but every now and then a part in a film is perfectly cast. Marlon Brando as Don Corleone, Heath Ledger as the Joker and Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito in Goodfellas come to mind. Although I don't think this film is of the same calibre as The Godfather, The Dark Knight or Goodfellas, Redmayne's casting and performance is certainly on par with these great casting choices. The film itself is devastating, offering the viewer an insight into the world of a genius hindered by a horrific physical disease. More so than his intelligence, Hawking is shown to be something so much more important: inspiring.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Wanted more science,"But, as a life tragedy film, this was better than most. A Ron Howard-type, 1940s-style emotion-seeker using Dr. Hawking's sad illness for a center point, this story was very little about what made the man great in his field, and almost all about what made him such a force of mind and will while enduring a physical illness that felled most others with it early on. Living on for decades beyond expectations showed the results of that great will along with the long-suffering, loving care his wife showered upon him for all those years of indignity and degenerative insult. To show his brutal struggle's accomplishments as well as the film showed them was grand and very encouraging to behold, but I truly wish the film had shown more of what made him so heroic in his field as well as in his illness. Thus, the film failed in that for me.Eddie Redmayne as Hawking was outstanding, as his amazing physical similarities were only overshadowed by his uncanny ability to portray Hawking's illness's effect on his body and face as he declined. Felicity Jones as his loving and caring and so enduring wife, was also outstanding, as the fierce will and love she showed in her role was surely as strong as Mrs. Hawking showed in real life.Don't expect much of Hawking's science in this film, as it has just enough in it to engage us about Hawking's life mission, which is the title of the film. He is still working on it, and I am sure that is what is keeping him alive for the rest of us to someday benefit.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
An unexpected triumph,"""The Theory of Everything"" is an apt title; James Marsh's film certainly encompasses much. It's both biopic and love story, you might say in equal measure. As a biopic it's much less sentimental than I had expected, given its subject, (Professor Stephen Hawking), and for most of the time, as a love story, it eschews sentimentality, too. Of course, the love story at the centre and which takes up a good deal of the film, is that between Hawking and his first wife Jane, on whose book the film is based. On a lesser level it's also a film about science and about an illness, Motor Neuron Disease. It tells us little about either but that's hardly a fault. It is a film about human beings and not about molecules and I have to confess I was surprised at just how good it was.I had expected something tantamount to a Masterpiece Theatre production and while it's certainly cosy at times and very British, it's also extremely intelligent, (Anthony McCarten's screenplay is first-rate), and it never dwells for longer than is necessary on any issue once its point has been made. Consequently, it never feels anything like two hours in a cinema. The director, James Marsh, has proved his pedigree in the past in the field of documentary (""Man on Wire"", ""Project Nim"") but that earlier work doesn't really prepare you for something on this scale. The film feels epic and intimate at the same time.It's also superbly played. Redmayne, surely, has to be the one to beat when it comes to handing out prizes. His performance is not only a brilliant physical transformation but he somehow seems to get inside the mind of Hawking as well. I'm not saying it's easy to play someone who is severely physically handicapped but I think it must be harder to convince us when you're doing very little or nothing at all and it's in these quiet moments that Redmayne is at his best.As Jane, Felicity Jones, (she was Dickens' mistress in ""The Invisible Woman""), is also superb. She gives Jane a much steelier edge than may have been expected. Jane sacrifices almost everything but is the first to pull the plug on the marriage. A host of outstanding character actors give us various parents, colleagues and carers without ever lapsing into caricature. Charlie Cox's almost too-good-to-be-true choir master is a case in point. The character may be the dashing white knight who comes to Jane's rescue but manages to give us a glimpse into the soul of the man. There's also a lovely supporting turn from David Thewlis as Stephen's professor at Cambridge. It's not totally perfect; one or two of the romantic moments tend towards the mawkish but these are fleeting. All in all, this is something a triumph and a rather unexpected one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Not enough science but incredibly moving!,"If you love Stephen hawking purely because of his contribute to science, this film is not for you. As it says in the synopsis, this is purely a look at him and his wife .and that is it. Don't get me wrong, it is moving in so many ways, and anyone reading this knows how incredible he is, but as a huge fan of him, his work, and the universe, it is probably not what you would expect. However, the story behind him and his wife and information we never would have known is incredibly moving. Just to look at what his life was like before any of us even knew of his existence is mind blowing in itself. This man is a true hero, and I'm sure many people reading this would agree. Anyone who is a fan of him, or his beliefs, should definitely give it a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Blatant Oscar-porn but Redmayne and Jones save the furniture,"Within six minutes I had suspicions that The Theory of Everything was the most blatantly Oscar-baiting biopic I've ever seen, and the rest of the film didn't do much to change my mind. The whole film is rather tedious and unremarkable, which is a tragedy considering its subject matter is one of the most remarkable men in history. Life and reality is glossed up to a fine sheen, which makes for some nice viewing if you don't dig too deep into what really happened.It is criminal that its screenplay has been nominated for an Oscar over more deserving screenplays in Pride, A Most Wanted Man and Gone Girl. Just when I thought the film was about to excel into something special, it hit a biopic cliché or a scene that felt exactly like it was written for the trailer. The montages were my least favourite part - cliché arrangements of key events that prevented the lazy filmmakers from having to put much effort into developing the story. More laziness is shown when no effort is made to make Jones look older as time passes - when she's meant to be in her 40s she still looks like she did at University. A new hairstyle doesn't mark the passage of time.Most of the cast are completely forgettable, but Redmayne and Jones save the film and push it just above ""waste of time"" status, but its a shame they didn't have as strong a chemistry as one might hope. Felicity Jones is absolutely adorable and she puts on a beautiful performance as the long-suffering and miserable wife Jane. In spite of the hype, Eddie Redmayne kills time for the first twenty minutes or so until he gets into the illness stage. Here is where we see something special - I honestly forgot i was watching an actor, and I found myself saying ""whats the big deal"" until I caught myself. He is a remarkable transformation throughout the movie, playing the part respectfully but convincingly. The ""I have tried"" scene towards the end of the film is easily the best moment for each actor and was the closest the film came to having an emotional impact. However, whilst The Theory of Everything is a fairly good film, it could have been something very special if it was in more daring and experienced hands.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
great performances in sepia tone biopic,"In 1963 Cambridge, Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) meets Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) at an university party. Professor Dennis Sciama (David Thewlis) tries to push him. Then he takes a fall. He's diagnosed with Lou Gehrigs disease and given 2 years to live. She marries him anyways and they have 3 children. She brings in music teacher Jonathan (Charlie Cox) to help.This is a fairly simple inspirational story but it's done very well. It allows for simple scenes like the wheelchair scene to breathe and exist. There's also the tremendous work done by Redmayne. Felicity Jones gets the less flashy role but just as impressive of a performance. The science is explained simply. The personal story is touching and surprisingly deep. The movie is a little light and a bit sepia tone. It could have been harder-hitting but this version of biopic works well enough.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A good film that mostly works because of two perfect leads,"The Theory of Everything is a James Marsh's movie about the life, struggles and greatest discovery of today's greatest physic Stephen Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne). The movie starts when Stephen - a Cambridge science student meets Jane, his future wife, an arts student and leads to the point where they divorce and Mr. Hawking becomes widely acknowledged scientist for his black hole theory. Anthony McCarten's screenplay tells the whole story in between, how those two fought against motor neuron disease, Stephen was diagnosed while attending Cambridge.This movie caught my attention from the very first trailer, which gave a brilliant idea about masterful acting of Eddie. It's always fancy to watch an actor playing someone living in the same decade as you, a person you have admired, read about, watched and especially, if that person has such some kind of disability - it definitely makes acting work a lot harder. So, I was very much wanting to know how Redmayne, who I'd loved for Les Miserables, dealt with it. Accordingly, it would be fair if I start with performances and especially him.Eddie Redmayne would not necessarily be an obvious choice for this role. He has not done much before it and in the beginning, I could not fully get the idea of him playing such an important person in today's science. But then I watched The Theory of Everything and I was assured. I think he is good in every sense he could have been and especially in the second part of the film, where motor neuron disease takes over his life.To begin with, shooting of the film has not been as successive as events in the film, they had to shoot parts from the beginning and the end the same time and Eddie had to switch form ""healthy"" Stephen to ""disabled"" one. Surprisingly, he nails both part of his job. In the beginning he is a shy, nerdy student, having his own world and visions, meeting a girl of his dreams and falling in love. As the story evolves, Hawking becomes more attacked by his disease and his physical capabilities become more limited. Eddie perfectly captures both emotional and physical condition of persons having the same problems. On the one hand, he is a scientist who wants to live just become he has something to prove and other other hand, he is a person in love who want to live because of a woman in his life.However, his good acting is mostly defined by complexity of physical work, rather than emotional. But this struggle never goes away without mental stress and I think Eddie manages to bring the whole pack of feelings on the surface.Felicity Jones received raving reviews - good ones and bad ones. I think mine would be more positive, than negative, because I really liked her. She was not extraordinary, or did she neither have some big emotional moments. To the contrary, her character is a quiet act, a person behind everything and still invisible. She comforts every her scene in the movie and masterfully captures the devotion Jane Hawking had towards her husband.The rest of cast is not memorable at all, not in a good way, not in a bad way. They just were there, doing their job and I honestly don't remember most, even though I watched the film a week ago or so.Anthony McCarten adopted Jane Hawking's book and transformed it in quite a good piece of screenplay. I would not dare to say that it was brilliant, or something, but it had some witty dialogues, with a lot quotable lines. My favorite is this one: - I study marriage of space and time - A perfect coupleIt's somehow weirdly romantic, isn't it?So, the reason I only remember only romantic lines is far too obvious, this is where director and writer took it. I don't want to believe that biography of Stephen Hawking does not go further than his relationship with wife or children. I am sure there have been quite many ups and downs in his career or scientific works and telling a story about him, without actually showing Hawking working on something that made Stephen known, is just stupid. The only think I understand is that they filmed an award-bait movie, mostly focused on two leads and giving them anything that can grab couple of honors.The Theory of Everything was visually well built with some quality production and costume design, good camera shots (the one pictures above) and impressive makeups. Most importantly, music was very good. Jóhann Jóhannsson created a romantic music that perfectly accompanied film's dramatic sequence and helped to tell the story a lot. I found myself pausing and rewinding the movie just to listen to specific track.To briefly say, The Theory of Everything is a good movie in the sense of two lead acts, who very much will be remembered this award season and I am sure, at least, Eddie gets a lot attention. I honestly hope for Felicity's big chances, but you can never be sure if such a quiet role gets huge feedback.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
An inconsistent painful bore,"The Theory of Everything is a misleading title. However, that's not the most misleading thing about this film. The cinematography and score give the impression you are about to watch a heart-felt, inspirational tale where love conquers all. If we didn't already know we were about to watch a film based on the life of Stephen Hawking, we might think we were watching a romantic comedy set in a fantasy world.When it's revealed the main character has motor neurone disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the look and tone of the film stay bright and uplifting, despite the dark and depressing things we are watching unfold on-screen. Scenes shift between painfully heart-wrenching to light, fluffy melodrama better suited for a daytime soap. The Oscar bait clichés are at an all-time high here, you start to wonder if during the credits they will resort to bloopers. At this point, the whole idea of the film seems in bad taste.While The Theory of Everything has some great performances, the look and execution are more suited for an A&E movie of the week. It's more interested in romanticizing a failed marriage rather than celebrating the work of a man with a brilliant mind. The result is an inconsistent, uninspired, painful bore.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Stephen Hawing is one of the greatest scientists of all time and his struggles and achievements are replicated pretty decently.

Eddie Redmayne fails to save simplistic and formulaic biopic,"At the heart of The Theory of Everything is a standout performance by Eddie Redmayne. While Redmayne has been rightfully nominated for an Oscar, and gives audiences plenty to marvel at and weep about, ultimately this film is too simplistic and formulaic a vehicle to justify him winning Best Actor. Running over two hours, the film is slow-paced, sentimental and sugar coated throughout. The action centres on Stephen Hawking's marriage with Jane Wilde, and was based on Wilde's book. This is probably the central weakness of the film. Hawking's affliction with motor neurone disease, and Wilde's heroic efforts to hold Hawking and his family together, provide much of the dramatic interest. However, we are never privileged with a revealing account of the marriage and developments later in Hawking's personal life are left unexplained. You get the sense that the writers are simply not willing to share these details, and the film's direction is either too hamstrung or unimaginative to suggest what might be going on in other ways.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

The origins of the great genius.,"Stephen Hawking: ""There should be no boundaries to human endeavor. However bad life may seem, while there is"".The movie tells the origins of the great genius today Stephen Hawking. He falls deeply in love with fellow Cambridge student Jane Wilde. Once a healthy, active young man, Hawking received an earth- shattering diagnosis at 21 years of age. With Jane fighting tirelessly by his side, Stephen embarks on his most ambitious scientific work, studying the very thing he now has precious little of - time. Together, they defy impossible odds, breaking new ground in medicine and science, and achieving more than they could ever have dreamed.I have seen many actors in the past taking on roles where their play people based on real life with have a serious disease or a disability which involves a lot of training to get the body movement and the speaking spot on, many actors nailed that and so dose Eddie Redmayne.Theory of Everything is a movie that get's straight to the point and doesn't waste your time with scenes that could have felt unneeded or filler like the TV show The Walking Dead dose all the time.Eddie Redmayne did the most spectacular, flawlessly brilliant performance I've seen in him in... well in small roles really, this is his actually big role and I hear some Oscar buzz about his performance and I wouldn't be surprise if he get's nominated because he was fantastic in this movie. He got the look, the movement and the speaking like Hawking.If I had to compare the score to this movie it would be The King's Speech, you know the piano music that so relaxing and peaceful to listen to. Music like that for some strange reason makes my feel more life inside of me, and the people who did the music I give them two thumbs up for that.But what the movie dose lack on is that they didn't really sell the fact that Hawking is a genius, and we know that he is but in this movie everybody didn't really seem all that filled with his mind blowing work, everybody was all like ""Yeah great job man, that's some good stuff"". but really they should be losing their sh't over how smart Hawking was.Theory of Everything is a well made Biography movie with fantastic performers from Eddie and Felicity, excellent directing and a pretty nice score.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The Theory of Filmmaking,"Sigh, another biopic of an extremely brilliant man. Is there any point? Can we understand the scientific genius Stephen Hawking? Actually, as it turns out we can. Going into this film I was excited but somewhat sceptical. Biopics can be eye-opening; however we must be firmly grounded with the character at its core. If we lose focus, then a film may as well stop as far as I am concerned. What 'The Theory of Everything' chiefly gets right is that we are always engaged and care about the life of Stephen Hawking, which is no small task, especially when one considers how brainy the man is.We enter the swinging sixties where a healthy Hawking studies Cosmology at Cambridge; he shares a room with Brian played by Harry Lloyd who has a perfect relationship with him, one that works off of the thoughts and excellence of the other. Eddie Redmayne plays the eccentric Hawking and gives a performance which will (and must) win him an Oscar. When you view the film you will find it hard to disagree. He is truly a breakthrough and does the man justice – yes he looks the part, but do not fear this man can act.He meets the determined Jane played by Felicity Jones who manages to be one of the better female roles captured on film. Many may remember the cringe worthy performance supplied by the pretty but not reliable Keira Knightley in 'The Imitation Game', which is another biopic worthy of mention. Jones outshines her effortlessly and seems secure in the role. As Hawking's physical well-being deteriorates she remains strong and powerful in a role many may have swept to the side. That is harder to do, when you see what she manages to achieve. When we learn that his life will never be the same again, the film veers dangerously off course, prompting tears but not much of anything worthy of substance. Don't worry this is a small bump in an otherwise smooth journey.As Hawking loses control of his muscles we are presented with an astonishing scene – one that will resonate throughout film history. As he prepares to leave the table from dinner he finds it difficult to walk up the stairs. As his legs give way he is forced to use his arms as his sole means of reaching his destination. As he looks up he sees his child whom is crawling on all fours without effort. This is a poignant parallel where Hawking sees what he has become, a small infant like child, one who is now dependent on others for his well-being.Over two hours in length, the film's grip lets go in the last third. Consider this necessary as up to this point it has been breath-taking. The film after all had to give us room to breathe. 'The Theory of Everything' is a biopic that gets almost (well) everything right. The two leads are strong, the love story is believable. But, most importantly we always understand and never lose sight of Stephen Hawking. 'The Theory of Everything' passes with honours.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

"Simply brilliant, just like its principal subject matter","Great Britain's Professor Stephen Hawking - What hasn't been said about the greatest living thinker on the planet right now?I've known about Professor Hawking for a long time now and have long admired him, but just two years ago I finally read his 1988 best-seller ""A Brief History of Time"" and loved it - even if much of Hawking's theories (involving the search for the true beginnings of the universe and so-called ""Hawking radiation"") went way over my head, despite his attempts to actually simplify his work for the lay person.James Marsh's new 2014 biopic ""The Theory of Everything"" is about 25 years in Hawking's early life, from 1963 to 1988, much of it based off his ex-wife Jane Hawking's book ""Traveling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen."" The film itself is more about their relationship than it is Hawking's ground-breaking work in theoretical physics. He's played here to perfection by Eddie Redmayne (who I'm convinced spent a lot of time with the real-life Professor Hawking and copied his mannerisms almost exactly), while Jane is played by Felicity Jones, and it is just as much her story as it is his; her attempts to understand and love him are almost vicarious for the experience of the audience. ""The Theory of Everything"" of course also includes his crippling diagnosis of motor neuron disease (ALS), which left him with a life expectancy of just two years - but he's obviously still here more than half a century after receiving that life-changing diagnosis.""The Theory of Everything"" is a beautiful, marvelous film - so much better than the usual Hollywood stuff, even though this film is very much so-called ""Oscar bait."" But damn it, I loved it. I've always wondered what a screen adaptation of Professor Hawking's life would look like, and now we have it. I guess a more straight-forward look at his career would have to wait, or we can just continue reading his books (of which there are several). But if we want to get an idea of who he is as a person, look no further than ""The Theory of Everything.""10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Stephen Hawking Bio-Pic Fun, Warm, and Challenging","I know almost nothing about Stephen Hawking's real life, so I have no comparison between that and the movie. However, I thought the transformation the actors underwent was breathtaking. Eddie Redmayne WAS Stephen Hawking in this movie (and has already been nominated for a 2015 Golden Gold award for best actor). Hawking is adorable and charming only to discover he has a disease that will cease muscle function. The true scientist, he asks if it affects his brain (no, it doesn't). Redmayne changes from a bit clumsy to nearly completely immobile in an electric wheelchair with a computer to speak for him. If you compare pictures of the actor and the physicist, they are amazingly same.Hawking had already been courting a young woman named Jane (played by Felicity Jones) when he learns he has 2 years to live. When she hears what will happen to him, Jane says she loves him. The two are married, and while Hawking's muscles stop working, the family grows (the couple have 2 children; there are no muscles in the penis, of course). Hawking, though almost completely immobile, is shown as funny, loving, and a good father. I watched as Felicity Jones changed from a bright, strong young woman working toward a degree in Literature to a woman who was so strong that it was often difficult to tell if she was struggling; she seems to know what Hawking wants before he can ask for it.Jane is struggling to care for Hawking and 2 kids. The film suggests she doesn't want to seem a failure because she is working so hard, but how can she not face difficulty? Not only are there physical issues and typical family problems, but Hawking is invited to lecture and travel, too. When Jane joins the choir at church (at the suggestion of her mother), she meets the director, Jonathan (Charlie Cox), a man who is handsome, widowed, and helpful. One can't help but wonder if the mother knew Jonathan had all those qualities, which was the motive behind her suggestion. You want to hate Jonathan because you know he's going to encroach on Hawking's family, but watch as Jonathan actually does help the family. Hawking is friends with Jonathan, who is ever the gentleman. Really, it felt ingenious of the director to choose Cox; he was the lovable, adorable Tristan in Stardust. It would almost be too much to believe Cox was capable of hurting the Hawking family. However, once a 3rd baby is born, the couple's families want to know if the baby's father is Jonathan or Hawking. Jane says there is no way the baby could belong to Jonathan, and Jones makes you believe her with her steely gaze and stern mouth.Eventually, the Hawkings must accept help from a nurse, and this is when Elaine Mason (Maxine Peake) is hired to care for Hawking. After meeting him, Elaine tells Jane that Hawking is brilliant and the model patient, and that Jane is lucky. After years as his personal nurse, this is not what Jane wants to hear from the new lady. Elaine seems to ""get"" Hawking's non-scientific side in a way that makes Jane seem impatient. When a copy of a pornographic magazine arrives, Hawking types into his speaking machine, ""That is for a friend."" The scene shows Hawking's humor, and Elaine, also amusing, puts the magazine for him on a music stand and asks when he wants the pages turned. Peake is delightful as Elaine Mason, but I've read that a nurse accused Peake of abusing Hawking, so I felt suspicious of the woman in the movie (even though the film depicts her so that we like her).Ultimately, time tells us that Hawking marries Elaine, and that Jane marries Jonathan, though Jane and Hawking remain good friends.The film is based on Jane Hawking's book Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen Hawking. If you look on Goodreads, the book has 100+ reviews, meaning it's not well-read (in comparison, Fifty Shades of Gray has 965,000+). The film might change that. She also has a number of 1- star reviews, and readers confess they felt Jane knew what she was getting into when she married Hawking, so why ""complain"" (to me, this is unbelievably cold).However, there are noble moments in the movie that would contradict what readers claim: when Jane is offered the chance to turn off Hawking's life support after he can no longer breathe on his own (yes, it is presented as a ""chance""—doctors can see that caring for Hawking is the horribly difficult and draining his young wife), she doesn't think about it for a second. Also, the movie implies that Jane possibly cheated on Hawking only after the couple realizes they aren't going to make it together. Jane remains a strong figure in Hawking's life, and never once did I dislike her in the movie. Of course she struggling; anyone who rubs that in her face (either after reading the book or watching the movie) is pretty unforgiving.The pacing of the movie is steady, indicating time has passed by showing the children growing or Hawking faring worse (physically). We also see stores stocking Hawking's writings. The story begins and ends in the fashion that Americans love: happy. Hawking says, ""Look what we did"" as he and Jane watch their children play together.Overall, The Theory of Everything was worth the watch. The cast was strong and carefully chosen, and the story was contained in the right amount of time, and an interesting look into the romantic, personal side of a world-famous physicist.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"This is a work of fiction, not a biography","Let me state the good things about ""The Theory Of Everything"". First, Eddie Redmayne does an excellent job of conveying the progressive degeneration of Stephen Hawking's condition. Felicity Jones is good, if a touch too saintly, as Jane Hawking. Secondly, the storyline of the film is formulaic but competent. This makes ""The Theory Of Everything"" pleasant, occasionally funny and occasionally emotionally involving.It is neither Redmayne's nor Jones' fault that that their parts bear only a passing similarity to the people they are depicting. However, it is wholly the writers' fault that the story departs grossly from Jane Hawking's book, upon which the film is said to be based, in several places. Characters are invented, scenes that never took place are interpolated into the story and some real events are shifted in time for purely dramatic effect in a way for which not even Stephen Hawking could provide a proof! In short, ""The Theory Of Everything"" has to be taken as mostly a fictional representation of the lives of the Hawkings.If you go to see this film simply to be entertained and don't mind whether or not what you see is accurate, then you will be entertained. However, if like me you dislike wondering whether or not one scene is reasonably true to the facts but the next one is an invention - or vice versa, or that both are true, or that both are fictional - you may be irritated.I find it troubling that so many films purporting to depict the lives of real people or historical events distort the truth with a total disregard for the consequences of spreading what, in effect, are lies. ""The Theory Of Everything"" falls squarely into this unedifying category.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
An absolutely astonishing movie!,"2015 is definitely off to a good start with ""The theory of everything"" and ""The imitation game""If you go to watch ""The theory of everything"" expecting to see expecting to see a sugarcoated love story you are off to a disappointment. Despite being advertised as one, this film is so much more than a typical romantic movie. It makes you think about the unexpected things in life and the hard decisions we sometimes have to make. This is also not a typical biographic movie. It portraits a side of the personal life of one of the most brilliant people ever lived. The main focus here are not Hawking's scientific achievements, neither are his illness or the love for his wife. The movie centers around the incredible strength of both, Stephen and Jane, and the way they managed to make the most of their life, despite the difficulties. The performance of Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking was incredible; I honestly don't think they could have chosen a better actor for this role. This, in addition to the beautiful cinematography made the film an absolutely pleasant experience, despite it being a little bit slow paced.I would recommend ""The theory of everything"" to everyone.I apologize for any mistakes as English is not my native language.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Quite Lovely,"The Theory of Everything is a movie about the much talked about Theoretical Physicist, Cosmologist and Author, Stephen Hawking. The movie only briefly touches on the science that's made him what he is today. Instead, concentrating, on his former wife Jane Hawking's book: Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen.The movie opens at a party, where Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), meets Jane (Felicity Jones), who's a friend of his sister They strike up a conversation and find a real connection, so much so that Jane, scribbles down her number on a sheet of paper and hands it to Hawking before leaving. His relationship with Jane blossoms and they soon begin to spend more and more time together. However, he soon begins to find that simple tasks are becoming difficult and following an accident, tests confirm that he has motor neurone disease. He subsequently shuts himself away, as the condition begins to take hold and spends most of his time alone, that is until Jane begins to talk him round.The Theory of Everything is a beautiful peace of movie making, with Redmayne's performance quite outstanding. You see Hawking the loving Father, caring Husband and a man who likes to make people laugh. A quite memorable movie that I am so pleased to have seen as it has made me see Stephen Hawking in a completely different light.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"A brilliant mind and a broken body: More life and love, than religion and science.","A 'Universal' film. Btw, is the 'Universal' logo getting even more impressive in recent years?'The Theory of Everything', 12A, 123mins, is a film about the life of the renowned scientist Dr Stephen Hawking, played by Eddie Redmayne, and his wife Jane Hawking, played by Felicity Jones. Both stars give superb performances. Mr Redmayne has rightly just won an award for his role.The film, based on the book by Jane Hawking, focuses on the relationship of the couple. They meet at university but their relationship is quickly dominated by Dr Hawking's illness and physical decline.The early university scenes authentically capture the period. The later scenes of illness brutally capture that reality too. The resilience of the human spirit over adversity is a major theme.This film is a good companion piece to the other recent 'genius' film, 'The Imitation Game', starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Alan Turing, the breaker of the Enigma code, and the father of computers. Mr Redmayne beat Mr Cumberbatch to an award. Both acted well, however the character of Dr Hawking is a much more human and warm character, than that of the colder, less human, and less sympathetic Dr Turing.'The Theory of Everything' also beats 'The Imitation Game' in one important respect, namely that 'Theory' is almost completely chronological, whereas 'Imitation' moves back and forth in a very disjointed way. 'Imitation' would have been so much better set out chronologically. 'Theory' Director James Marsh, however, is not slavishly devoted to chronology. Time is a central part of the film, and the science in the film, and Director Marsh cleverly tweaks his chronology for this reason.The science in 'Theory', like in 'Imitation', is dealt with in a way that is simply explained, and easily followed. Fans of 'The Big Bang Theory' know that the science never gets in the way of the story, and this is true also of 'The Theory' film. 'Big Bang' fans also know that intellectual struggle can easily be portrayed by holding a piece of chalk in front of a black-board. So too in this film. Incidentally, Dr Stephen Hawking, in real-life, has made several guest-appearances on 'Big Bang', playing himself.Simon McBurney, in a small part, gives good support.While this film is about a scientist, science does not dominate the film. As the film is about a man who suffered problems with his mobility and his physical condition, from an early age, it is necessarily a slow film.In this film we learn a little bit about our universe and Dr Hawking's contribution to our understanding of it. We learn also about the man, and his wife. We learn too about life and love.In essence this is a story about love. 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Great performances, cinematography and score - but the way it skims over everything leaves it feeling superficial.","Since the beginning of time, a Stephen Hawking biopic was inevitable. And we also knew that it would take a hell of a performance to back it up, something in the region of Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot commitment. On a physicality level, Eddie Redmayne delivers, a star shining since 2012's Les Miserables. Unfortunately The Theory of Everything's script is so stripped down and skimmed across that it doesn't offer enough insights to satisfy intrigue. The film takes a very sentimental approach to Hawking's life from his early university days to being offered a Knighthood. It's a tough focus to have on a doomed romance. What is it trying to say? It is trying to exemplify resilience in the face of hardship? Can't be, they broke up. It's not exactly a matter-of-fact approach either with its expressive cinematography and sweeping score. Director James Marsh is known for a heightened experience with his dramatic and intense Oscar winning documentary Man On Wire.Granted, despite lacking an arc to speak of, Redmayne is thoroughly impressive. To imagine him getting up everyday then sitting in that chair and getting under Hawking's skin takes some skill. He works on a transformative basis, but that has limited value when the material is limited. It's the way that his chemistry with Felicity Jones works. I've liked Jones since Cemetery Junction and I'm glad she's getting some mainstream attention but since the warmth of Junction, she's worked best and most confidently in her icy mode. Her acclaim is justified here, but it's sporadic. She's not consistent, every scene she needs to built to a crescendo rather than holding it throughout the film. When she's engaged as a woman struggling under the weight on her shoulders, she's great, meeting Redmayne's match. But the way that all the actors are working together, including notable supporting performances from Charlie Cox and David Thewlis, they internalize their emotions to the point that only superficialities remain.You can see that they minimise dialogue to let the moment speak for itself, but it's overdone, relied on too much, and the dialogue that gets let out is too often a piece of trite. If it wasn't for the honesty of the performances, it would drag the whole film down. Nevertheless, I defend that it's not a 'standard' biopic, if for its creative visuals with the frames drowned in coloured lights and wide lenses distorting the frame. There's clearly a lot of effort put into every scene, even if it's slightly misguided emotionally. The highlight is absolutely Johann Johannson's beautiful score, the antithesis of his ambient work for Prisoners. It does half the work to capture its beautiful moments, of which the film has a few, but none that successful jerk enough sincere tears. If only The Theory of Everything gave itself enough room to breathe so I could get emotionally invested, but there will be inevitable Oscar nominations in near future. It's great to see Marsh's whole-hearted attempt at fiction, but hopefully he'll take on something perhaps less ambitious and just as intimate on take 2.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
To begin with,"Dear, Mr. DeSanto, Javier Bardem never performed in ""My Left Foot"", it was another English actor: Daniel Day-Lewis who made that film. This clarified lets go to: ""The Theory of Everything"".Well done for having based the main script in the book written by Jane Hawking. I cannot imagine a whole movie where us -the public- would have to strive trying to understand Dr. Hawking's Cosmologyc theories spoken in his, then, poor English skills, doe to the disintegration of his muscles.Therefore as it is, is pure perfection, for us to comprehend the heartbreaking situation that everyone -including himself- around him went through. And I speak with the validation of my own experience, being an artist and now, invalid.As for the movie by itself... there are no words to describe how marvellously well accomplished it is, from directing, to acting. No doubt next Oscar will go to Eddie Redmayne -bravo Eddie, for again I find myself in him- because he has captured the intensity of the emotional, the physical and the moral state of a soul that being brilliant, never-the-less, has become opaque.There is a series made by the BBC and acted by Dr. Hawking on his theories, if anyone is interested on this side of his achievements.Blessings!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The Theory of Everything,"'The Theory of Everything' is James Marsh's biopic of scientific genius Stephen Hawking. Eddie Redmayne plays Hawking as we learn about his early days at university, his diagnosis of motor neuron disease, and the rise to his now iconic status. Marsh's direction is very good and he uses many point of view shots to create a huge sense of empathy for the main character. Marsh uses stunning visual effects in order to express Hawking's inner feelings and torment whilst highlighting his genius. The choice of music is also uplifting and echoes the key themes throughout the film.The screenplay is a really interesting piece of work and tells the story in a funny yet intriguing way. However, it does seem to lack a certain something as it tries to alter the source material in order to create some very conventional scenes.The performances in 'The Theory of Everything' are truly exceptional. Eddie Redmayne plays Stephen Hawking in a transformational and moving manner. You can barely recognise him as he highlights his illness with complete sincerity and plausibility. Felicity Jones plays his wife, Jane Wilde. I thought her role would be a simple one as she would work off of the powerhouse performance from Redmayne but the way she shows her strength and compassion is very moving and she does an excellent job.Overall, 'The Theory of Everything' is a fascinating film about a genius as he deals with his dibilitating illness. The maturity of everyone involved in this make it a remarkable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

But a major part of this is Hawking's health as he succumbs to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, rendering him immobile. Through thick and thin, Jane did what she could to support him.Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones both perform their roles flawlessly. The movie makes clear that there has always been a human side to this hero of geeks and nerds.

The picture with many missing parts,"It was obvious that this will be mostly about their romance, marriage, and not about Stephen Hawking's work, ideas. And that was good for me. Beginning was good, not great. What irritated me was that almost constant yellow shine, blurred picture - it should increase idealistic atmosphere, or what ? Anyway, they felt in love, then came horrible news about disease, and Jane proved saying: 'after every successful man, there is a woman' . It was in fast pace, marriage, children came fast, but that was basically a must - when you want to present almost whole life of someone.
Thing became bad after that: 'That was most English thing ...' I don't know how it came - there are choirs in other countries, with plenty of women in . But it sounded well, indeed. So, some other people jumped in their lives, and that was just presented poorly. I was not aware until end text, that they divorced. Whole alienation of couple was not presented well. I guess, they just avoided that unpleasant part. Then was that celebration interview in USA, not really good climax. 
Why he refused knighthood ? - And that was very last text of movie (refusement). Maybe that was because he felt not deserving it because of broken marriage ?

"Well done, but tough to watch","-The Theory Of Everything is the new biopic that follows Stephen Hawking from college through the beginning of his permanent disablement due to motor neuron disease. It focuses on his career, but most importantly, the relationship between he and his wife.-The film is a biopic, so it is limited with what they really could have done with it, but they did the best with what they could! -The story itself is focused very well. The characters are what makes the movie and they are very deep and full of emotion. It's not an easy movie.-I'll go ahead and talk about the thing I should as a Christian before I continue though. Stephen Hawking is an atheist. The subject is brought up a few times, seeing as he marries Jane, who belongs to the Church of England. However, 1. They really could not have avoided the topic. He's a physicist. 2. It doesn't seem biased that much. Sure it kinda does support the character, but it doesn't push an atheistic agenda or really say much against God. Actually one of the things I found interesting was that he starts out not believing in God because he thinks he can't believe in God, and then he does because his own theory demands that there is a God. He is asked about it in an interview and has trouble answering. I think it was probably a big conflict in his life at the time, and I liked seeing that! Back to the review! -The pace is good, but it's not a fast paced movie. It's just not boring.-The tone is pretty depressing because it's a man and his family dealing with a life-changing disease.-The acting is A+ work. Both leads will get Oscar nominations. They killed it, especially Eddie Redmayne as Hawking.-The music is beautiful Oscar stuff.-Content: It's PG-13 for the disease and its physical and emotional effects really. A few references and some mild language, but it's tough because of the condition.-So the Theory Of Everything is an excellently made and acted, emotional movie, with a theme that does make it hard to enjoy. I would still say that The Theory Of Everything is worth seeing, but it's in limited release, so I would totally buy it at full price. Strong 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Behind every great man (mind) is an even greater woman (heart),"Not one to seek out romance, but a good one is so romantic :-) Early in The Theory of Everything, the student Stephen Hawking strides across the grounds at Cambridge University in the 1960s, his face dreamy. He is lost in thought about the nature of time. A pivotal incident early in the film triggers the battery of tests and the prediction that he had only two years to live.The rest of the film follows that grim forecast. It dramatizes how he achieved renown within physics because of his ground-breaking 1970s work on black holes. As he's grown older, Hawking has become progressively weaker as his condition wasted his muscles, but his brilliant mind continued to whir. In the process, a dominant myth took shape around him, a myth that presented to wider society a misleading view of the physicist and his research. The myth was best articulated by Hélène Mialet in her book Hawking Incorporated. She noted that the cosmologist is overwhelmingly presented in popular culture as an intellect ""liberated from his body and seemingly emancipated from everything that clutters the mundane mind (such as emotions, values, and prejudices)."" But his film debunks this myth. By showing Hawking cracking his head on the concrete, it inverts the central idea of the myth: Hawking's mind is not free of his body, but is instead bound inextricably to it. Moreover, the film makes Hawking's support systems visible and vivid. His wife Jane Hawking dresses him, feeds him and cares for him. She and, later, nurse Elaine Mason teach him to communicate after a tracheotomy takes away his ability to speak. A system of technology then grants him a new, robotic voice. With these systems, his science has flourished. Anyway without revealing anymore, my only disappointment was the lack of a little more exposition of Hawking's inventive mind",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Perfection.,"If Benedict Cumberbatch had been up for an Oscar in any other year, for his masterful performance in The Imitation Game, he doubtless would have won it. But sadly for him, he was up against Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything, and the result was inevitable.Redmayne's portrayal of Professor Stephen Hawking is mesmerising. He fully and completely inhabits every aspect of the character, with not a trace of his original self evident at any stage. With minimal help from the makeup department, he perfectly metamorphoses into the famously twisted shape of Hawkins, and the resemblance is uncanny. His facial ticks and mannerisms are also spot-on, and he perfectly captures the wicked twinkle in Hawkins' eyes; the eyes of a brilliant man who despite being trapped in a useless body never lost his fine sense of humour.And although Redmayne's performance is one of the greatest displays of acting skill you could hope to see, it does not eclipse the quality of the film itself, which is beautiful, touching, fascinating, funny, heart-warming, and life-affirming. It would be very hard indeed to find a better all-round piece of cinema. Every aspect of it is finely crafted perfection, from screenplay, to direction, to cinematography, to performance, to editing, to music... it is a cinematic feast; for the eyes, for the mind, and for the soul.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Another genius on the screen,"This year is in fashion to show the hard story of the modern genius. After The imitation game, telling about the story of Alan Turing and his machine, I have watched ""The theory of everything"" and the comparison is absolutely inevitable. I start saying that I found both of the movies a bit overrated. I have already talked about the first one in the related review, so I'll talk only about the second. The theory of everything is an enjoyable film, with a very good cast. I found it more truthful than The imitation game, less ad hoc constructed: the acting is less superficial, the dialog are more natural. I liked very much the two main characters, inevitably the male one most. Some scenes are full of emotion but not many as I expect by a drama like this.

"A Romance of God, Science, and a Physically Stricken Genius","Basically it is about the relationship between the physicist Stephen Hawking and his wife. It is based on Jane Hawking's book. For this I was disappointed. I wanted more his intuitiveness concerning the structure of the universe than his domestic life.However, some of his philosophical perspectives are brought to light. He believes that an equation linking quantum mechanics with relativity can reveal the mind of God - perhaps, but such is purely speculative. Also, his assertion that belief or disbelief in God is inconsequential for legitimate scientific inquiry reveals his scientific/theological perspective, and it is one in which I agree.At the heart of the film is the story of an absolute genius stricken with a catastrophic disease. A scene in the film brilliantly displays his rationale concerning a question given to him regarding the existence of God.The Holy Roman Church promoted scientific inquiry hoping to substantiate scripture, or more precisely a interpretation of scripture. Data didn't substantiate a geocentric universe so to hell with science. Centuries later, Christianity still demonstrates the arrogance of humanity by relying on science (creation science) to prove the existence of God. This, while they decry scientific findings that are contrary to, once again, a interpretation.Atheists are no less biased regarding science and theology. My philosophy suggests that if man, through his own reason, can prove or disprove the existence of God through science, then God isn't enough of a mystery to even consider.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

The Spectacular Story of a Spectacular Man,"The story of Stephen Hawking is truly remarkable. Overcoming such adversity to continue to be one of the finest scientific minds on earth is extraordinary. The main focus of the film is Stephen's relationship with his wife Jane, which is beautifully and tragically depicted. As much a story of humanity and life as it is science, The Theory of Everything is poignant and heart warming.My first thought after finishing this film was... God what a performance from Felicity Jones. Redmayne was great, a superb physical performance but the emotion and power from Jones was just something else. Spectacular. The love, admiration and care that she showed Redmayne in the film was marvellous. It was such a raw performance and really got to me. She was captivating throughout and really stole the show for me. As mentioned Redmayne was also superb, managing to bring so much to the performance.The story is very well presented, covering the beginning of Stephen and Jane's relationship, through to Stephen's illness and the subsequent adaption to their new lives. It's very well paced and covers a lot of their lives in the space of the film. Inspiring and impactful in equal measure, The Theory of Everything will stay with you for a while.One criticism of the film is the colouration. It seemed to be filmed with alternately a sepia or blueish tint, the reason for which I'm not quite sure. It certainly didn't add anything for me and was a bit off putting at times. Other than that the artistic choices were great, with solid direction and a magical soundtrack.Definitely a must watch film and worth watching for Felicity Jones's performance alone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

ALS is NOT a disease to make fun of, or dump a bucket full of ice and laugh!! It makes you lose control of your muscles and even makes you stop breathing and choke. It doesn't affect your brain so you know what's ahead. Eddie Redmayne made a perfect job of reflecting the hard stages of ALS. Steven Hawking sacrifices his own needs, loves his wife and loved back. His wife takes care of him all these hard years. So Theory Of Everything is a movie about love, sacrifice, intelligence and in my opinion, asks this question: WOULD YOU GO BACK IN TIME? DOES IT WORTH IT?",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
An ordinary biopic of an extraordinary life,"The story of Stephen Hawking, a man who overcome extraordinary physical disadvantages to become both a preeminent scientist and a best-selling author of popular science books is remarkable; but it's a difficult one to capture in a dramatic film. In that sense, 'The Theory of Everything' merely recounts what you might already have known about Hawking and has the same inherent weaknesses as most biopics. A strength is the very convincing portrait of Hawking's deteriorating physical condition; I wouldn't exactly call it a tour-de-force of acting per se (given Hawking's decreasing ability to directly convey his own emotional state), but the overall depiction is very good. Perhaps because his professional work was so complex, the film concentrates mostly on his emotional life, and that of his wife, Jane. Her story is told as one of quietly plucky Englishness; in places, one feels the film might have shied away from truly telling things how they were. Overall, it's nicely done, but unlikely to be revelatory for anyone already familiar with the material.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A Great film!,"A biopic of Stephen Hawking, in my opinion, was always bound to be of good quality due to his amazing achievements in the evolution of science. This film, from it's inception, just pulled me in. The way in which the characters were professionally played, its touching on 1963 Cambridge, and its overall style was a real pleasure to witness. What firmly sat my bottom to the seat though was how the film makers made the film believable in almost all aspects of the movie; its characters, theme, language, education, success and portrayal of Stephen's failures, It felt as if each stage of the film was its own mini-series gradually developing into one complete element of great film making. Well Done!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Enchanting, intriguing and one of the year's best.","Despite being about uber-genius Stephen Hawking, there's nothing incredibly complex about this biopic; it's just a good ol' fashion relationship drama that concentrates on character and storytelling. That it does this so incredibly well, though, is why it is the first five star movie of 2015. With a life as amazing as Hawking's it would've been pretty easy to focus on either his scientific brilliance or his medical condition as the core story, however the film's success lies in its choice to primarily explore his partnership with wife Jane. Meeting before he is crippled with motor neuron disease and struggling together through the seemingly impossible, Stephen and Jane, as played by Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, are two of the most interesting lovers you will see on screen this year. In the early stages their chemistry is intoxicating – their brainy youthfulness making for a tremendously sweet romance – but as the years progress their bond simultaneously becomes trickier and more profound. Whilst his physical transformation throughout proceedings is astounding, there's more to Redmayne's Golden Globe-winning performance as the famed physicist. He brings a charm and sly wit to Hawking that makes him grounded, relatable and infinitely fascinating. Yet it wouldn't have mattered how good Redmayne was if Jones wasn't just as absorbing in the more emotionally complex, if less ""flashy"", role as Jane. She is deeply enthralling as a woman who balances love, family, personal growth and responsibility, despite continuously battling against the odds on all fronts. This really is the Redmayne-Jones show, and as wonderful as the score, cinematography and James Marsh's direction is, you get the feeling that with these two talented actors on centre stage this true life tale would be enchanting regardless of what occurred around them. A dramatic tour de force that is worthy of all the praise heaped upon it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Nice but not great.,"Very well crafted for Oscars. It's not unentertaining to watch, but it also gives you nothing other than ""Geez, that guy can do a really good imitation of Hawking"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Uplifting biopic with star performances,"This uplifting Stephen Hawking biopic is well worth seeing. The basic outlines of the story are well known. In his student days at Cambridge, Hawking developed a neuromotor disease that affects the body, not the brain, and was given two years to live. Such a diagnosis would end the ambitions of most people, but he survived to become preeminent in the fields of theoretical physics and cosmology with numerous British and international honors, including a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S. civilian honor.Hawking also has tried to make the complexities of the physical sciences accessible for non-scientists, and his book, A Brief History of Time, has sold more than 10 million copies. I have the Illustrated edition, and I've read it, picture captions and all. (So, I actually know what the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is: let's see, you can know the speed of an object or its location, but you cannot know both at the same time. Please, no questions.) Eddie Redmayne is superlative as Hawking, and Felicity Jones convincing as his devoted first wife, Jane. The film avoids the typical mawkishness traps, in large part because, as Rene Rodriguez says in the Miami Herald, ""Redmayne keeps you focused on the soul of a man trapped inside a malfunctioning body."" The supporting cast is singularly excellent too.The movie is based on a book written by Jane, whom Hawking met at Cambridge shortly before the neurological problems began to surface. The couple have three children, and he is portrayed as a loving father. It ends some 25 years later, in the late 1980s.There's only a smattering of science and mathematics in the movie; in general, it's about coping against greater odds than a person might be expected to overcome. The movie suggests, not unreasonably, that Jane's determination was a significant factor in keeping him alive. Not just surviving, thriving.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A fine film about the more obscure aspects of a famous physicist's life,"If you know a bit about Stephen Hawking, you would be pleasantly surprised how close this picture comes to describe him. The film leaves out the obvious parts of him, and dwells on the obscure, mainly his wife Jane. The duo give a glowing performance. Having seen other biopics like 'A Beautiful Mind', this film follows a similar pattern about a protagonist faced with challenges coming to terms with his place in the world. Stephen Hawking's research is hardly mentioned, and his overflowing humour a major part of the film. Eddie Redmayne has impressed me again after 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'. Overall a fine film with great performances by the lead characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Terrible,"The Theory of Everything is a terrible movie, which is a shame because it had the potential to be much better but due to poor directing, screenplay, acting (with one exception), and cinematography it falls way short.This movie takes absolutely no risks or chances. They could have shown Stephen Hawking and Jane trying to have sex despite his disability, and the resulting scene could have been both tragic and powerful if done correctly. But they don't attempt this. All sexual encounters in this movie are implied. Look, I don't go to movies to watch sex scenes, but would it have killed the director to try and show something a bit risqué? Is Hollywood not ready to show a person with disabilities making love? They completely shy away from the basic humanistic aspects of their portrayal of Dr. Hawking and simply show the most formulaic of love story plots.The movie focuses almost exclusively on the ""love"" story between Jane and Stephen Hawking. However, the two main actors Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones have very little on-screen chemistry and the entire fabrication of their cinema relationship is artificial to the core. Regarding the overall acting, a special mention needs to be said about Felicity Jones' poor acting skills in this movie. She seems to handle most scenes with a cheeky, almost irritated delivery of her lines as if everything about being with Stephen Hawking seems to bother her. She never seems to show happiness at all in the movie (or any emotions, really). However, Eddie Redmayne's acting is significantly better. He's able to convey a decent amount of emotion sometimes without saying anything and using only facial expressions. I think that takes a lot of skill and that is the main reason why I don't give this movie a 1/10. However, the poor screenplay and scriptwriting leaves Redmayne with very little to work with other than mimicking Stephen Hawking. This is a shame because a better script could have flexed his acting muscles to portray some more raw emotion such as anger and frustration over his disability.As for the directing, the movie shows the steady degeneration of Stephen Hawking as he goes from a normal young man to someone with severe disabilities, yet many scenes appeared to be shot out of order because sometimes his condition seems to have suddenly improved versus the scene before. For example, in one scene he is hardly able to talk without a lot of difficulty and slurring of his speech, but in the next he speaks to his father at an almost normal pace. To me, this inconsistency demonstrates poor directing and/or editing. Also, there is a very strange progression of time in this movie. His kids seem almost born out of nothing. Another scene, another baby. Speaking of his kids, they seem to be absent from a vast majority of scenes and play almost no role in the movie. I understand the movie his not about their kids, but would it have killed them to put in even a single line that shows how they feel about having a father like Stephen Hawking?The cinematography is truly basic, especially for a movie nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award (thankfully not nominated for best cinematography.) The camera work is very uninspired and boring and mostly sticks to showing the characters in each scene. Very little thought is put into framing or lighting with very basic themes like ""bright morning scenes for happy moments"" and ""dark evening scenes for sad moments"". How very boring. There are only two good moments of cinematography in the entire film which last about 10 and 5 seconds respectively, and that is pretty sad for a 2 hour movie.Finally, one of my biggest gripes with the movie was how it dealt with the aspect of Stephen Hawking being an atheist. The script seemed to antagonize this fact, making it appear that Stephen's atheistic views were wrong and his wife's views were virtuous. I'm sorry, but please refrain from injecting your own religious biases into a film. There are already enough Christian-centric movies coming out of Hollywood each year, we don't need another one tooting God's horn.Overall 2/10 simply for the quality of Eddie Redmayne's portrayal and nothing else.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
An Incredible man and an Amazing woman!,Stephen Hawkins life is a tour de force of mind over matter what he achieved and how he fought through such a deliberating illness that doctors gave a 2 year life span for him to continue for more than 50 yrs is nothing short of a miracle of the spirit. I do not think this could have been achieved without the immense love and support of his amazing wife Jane their love story was so beautiful to watch. Eddie Redmaynes portrayal was a Symphony of outstanding excellence and worthy of many accolades. Great movie great acting a pleasure and privalaged to watch!,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Interesting perspective on a genius' life,"For starters it should be said that the movie is by far much more about Hawking's personal life than about his academic career and contribution. However, one will get some minor insights in what he was doing (I'm not an expert myself, you might judge differently in case you are).In my perspective the movie shows in a vivid manner how ALS affected Hawking's life and makes one think about how such dramatic disease would affect everyone's life. This also made me think about how much more difficult it must have been for Hawking to write books in comparison to a healthy person (the actual act of writing). So I really liked the movie for making me think about those kind of things.In my opinion, the actors did quite a good job, especially Redmayne managed to play Hawking convincingly and also to convey Hawking's feelings in a probable mannerMy major point of critique is that the movie is quite slow and during some scenes my attention slipped away as the movie was a bit boring to me at times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Focuses on the humour, resilience and love of the expertly portrayed protagonist and his strongest relationship.","'The Theory Of Everything (2014) is a rather sweet film, the focus never on anything other than the humour, resilience and underlying love of both the expertly portrayed protagonist and his strongest relationship. This makes the watch an uplifting and generally pleasant one, even though the piece does dip into the darker moments of Hawking's degenerative disease. It's a brilliantly made flick, though the cinematography is consistently dream-like in a slightly distracting way, and it resonates deeply without pushing itself too forcefully upon its audience, finding its footing early on and never making a misstep in telling the remarkable life-story of a remarkable man and the remarkable woman who helped him through it all. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

A compelling and educational love story drama that's a restrain but loving romance.,"I for one was never no math geek or a big book worm, still I thought it would be good to check out the Stephen Hawking biography, and I was glad I did as ""The Theory of Everything"" it's a fine romance drama of patience and love. It tells of Stephen's early days of him trying to prove the black hole theory and it starts with his meeting of the cute and bright Jane the woman who would later become his wife. Mostly the film shows a lot about the work and times of accomplishment of the famous physicist, yet it's most touching and hard to take scenes are showing how the motor neuron disease destroys and cripples the body of one Stephen. I must say the role of Stephen Hawking is played just wonderful by Eddie Redmayne his speech restrain and movement scenes in his bound wheelchair though tough to watch are played to near perfection by Eddie and the performance from Felicity Jones as Jane from her girlfriend to wife days are just adorable. This is a film that shows life is full of unexpected things from the mind to the function or dysfunction of the body, yet still it can't destroy love, relationship, or thought.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Good film,"Good film. Eddie Redmayne plays Stephen Hawking brilliantly; delivering a performance that is, at times, so very delicate and at other times fueled with confidence. The wit characteristic of Hawking is presented perfectly and his disease, including the gradual loss of his ability to speak, is handled with respect. Not once is there a moment of overacting, and we are reminded that there is a fully functioning and genius mind within a debilitated body. Felicity Jones plays Jane Wilde beautifully, showing us the strong commitment and inevitable weariness faced by someone in her position. Ultimately, it is Redmayne that steals the show. The most glaring issue the movie faces is time. It's understandable and perhaps even a little ironic given the subject matter of the movie. To faithfully and honestly tell the story of their long marriage is a gargantuan task, and we often find ourselves skipping through massive periods of time without warning. Stephen is almost fully paralyzed about half an hour into the movie and the two characters are well into a marriage with their first child. There is little time to believe that they are actually falling in love until we are thrown headlong into their lives. Still, the story is as honest as it can be. Jane and Stephen are two caring, loving, and normal people who have to deal with impossibly difficult circumstances. After the initial bullet-train ride through their first years, I spent the rest of the movie actually caring about their relationship. Unfortunately, there is no sense of urgency or some larger than life goal, only their onwards struggle and perseverance. It provides the movie with a direction-less quality. As we watch his body degenerate, his drive is an intellectual one and we are promised that he is working diligently on his unified theory of everything behind the scenes of the movie.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Maybe reading Mrs. Hawking's book is a better investment than watching this film,"This film took an incredible amount of dedication to get through; I even had to break it up between two days. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal did such a good job of showing the 'silverspooned' flippancy, and associated arrogance of anyone lucky enough to get into Cambridge, that half way through you're almost glad that Hawking's ego was tempered by fate and ALS. Guy gets into boys' club, Guy gets into aristocracy, Guy gets pretty girl, and it's all about the Guy, with very little science thrown in.Certainly the script was gleamed from the first Mrs. Hawking's work, but after some thought at the film's end, you wonder if Hawking's ALS was the single most deciding factor that provided the 'thinking man' time to think himself to greatness. After all, great men come from great sacrifice, and Mr. Hawking's great sacrifice was that he no longer could experience life the way the rest of humanity experiences it. The film certainly had an air of 'Cambridge guy does film about another Cambridge guy' love only a fellow Cambridge guy and the old boys' club would appreciate., The rest of the 99.9% of us are left with less than a real look into the source as to why Hawking was famous (as was the compelling root of similar films like Russell Crowe's ""A Beautiful Mind""). Even after desperately waiting for Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) to share some much needed humility we're even grasping for deeper development of Dennis Sciama, PhD. But after trudging through the fiction that was Alan Touring's re-telling, it's not hard to believe that Cumberbatch and Redmayne are friends, as they are more apt to tell the story as they see it, as opposed to the way the story was as history experienced it.To quote Kirk Lazarus from ""Tropic Thunder"": 'Everybody knows you never go full retard.' Eddie Redmayne certainly took that advice to heart, supposedly almost to the point of experiencing his own spinal damage in the making of this dull film. You'd certainly get a better return, and a heck of a lot more ""Stephen Hawking"" watching television's ""Big Bang Theory"" than you could from Redmayne's the theory of making a very boorish film. For every intellectual movie-goer out there who already knows Hawking's disabilities, you'll get nothing more than what you already knew from Redmayne's portrayal, and for those searching to know Hawking more, well then you just may not like Hawking after Eddie Redmayne's rendition of him.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Extraordinary,"I went into the cinema tonight with great expectations of Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of groundbreaking physicist Stephen Hawking. The award season that has really taken off now gave me the impression that Redmayne's acting would be of an immense quality. He didn't disappoint me.Redmayne delivers an outstanding piece of art. The way he moves as the movie progresses, the way his voice breaks down as we watch him suffer but mostly his face that shows pure emotional mayhem. There aren't a lot of actors who can pull of such an amazing feat by just using their face. This was of impeccable quality. This performance reminded me of Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Christy Brown. I never thought anyone could get remotely close to his portrayal, but Redmayne certainly does it. He is without doubt up there with the great performers. His win at the Golden Globes is very well- deserved. I will await with great patience to see if he wins the Oscar for this role, which I think he truly deserves.Furthermore, the rest of the cast adds to the story in a way that's just right. Felicity Jones' Jane makes a perfect counterpart for Eddie Redmayne's Stephen. Charlie Cox, who I had not yet heard of, does a marvelous job at portraying Jonathan and so does David Thewlis as the professor at Cambridge and Stephens push in the back.The scenery is great and takes you right to the story where it feels like your there and the music made by Jóhan Jóhansson is extremely moving. All in all, one hell of a movie that I hope will never be forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Time,"Another film dealing with black holes and the many theories on time. To start, I can appreciate the simplicity involved with the writing of the film. I'm glad they didn't try and complicate things too much. Instead these theories are presented to us at a high school level so basically everyone can understand. But that's not the bulk of the story or why we went to the theaters. We went to see the beautiful and difficult relationship between Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane.Now it is based off of Jane's book about her life with Stephen before and after he was diagnosed with motor neuron disease. Sure the way they meet in the film is a bit clichéd but it didn't matter because of how great their chemistry was on screen. Felicity Jones was wonderful. I had only seen her in Spiderman before this so I had my doubts but her and Eddie Redmayne are close to locks for Oscars, even in this packed acting year. My favorite moments from the film involved them and just how effortlessly their chemistry seemed. It reminded me a lot of one of my all-time favorite films A Beautiful Mind in that sense. Living with someone with this disease and knowing the expected life span is not long had to be extremely difficult and Jones portrayed that perfectly. Redmayne gave us so many sides to his character without being able to do much was very impressive. He also had several emotional scenes with his family and friends that were just heartbreaking. They were beautifully mixed with Johann Johannsson score which will probably also get nominated come February.As much as I loved the relationship aspects of the film I wish we got a little more insight into just how much of a genius he was. We see him fight through this terrible disease but we don't see him fight previous theories or challenge the grain as much as I thought. We hear him talk about it briefly here and there but I cant say I remember each thing he accomplished. It did make me interested to read up on some of that going forward. It also made me appreciate Interstellar even more with some of his theories being implicated into the making of that film. So if you're a sucker for romance films you will love this story. In particular just how great the performances were.

Worth seeing for Eddie Redmayne's performance alone,"THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING has everything you'd expect from the typical Hollywood biopic, and as such is rather predictable. Not only that, but its subject is still alive (and very famous) which robs it of a lot of dramatic tension. Still, Eddie Redmayne gives an extraordinary, transformative performance as Stephen Hawking, as does Felicity Jones as his long-suffering first wife Jane. The story starts with Hawking's years at Cambridge and up through the publication of ""A Brief History of Time."" Instead of focusing on the accomplishments, the film is really about the relationship between him and his first wife, as the book is based on her memoir. The romance kind of comes out of nowhere, but after spending two hours with them you really begin to feel for them, especially Jane, who ended up having to put in overtime as her husband's caregiver (until help was brought in). The scenes which show the gradual progress of Hawking's condition (Motor Neuron Disease/ALS) were quite moving as well, but only in the most general sense. It also ""helped"" that the score hinted at just the right moments when you were supposed to be emotionally affected. So, while the film is sure to stir up emotion and possibly provoke tears at certain points, nothing the film does with those moments is that special in and of itself. What really makes this film worth seeing is for Eddie Redmayne's performance, which deservedly won him the Best Actor Oscar this year. Of course, the rest of the cast, which includes Emily Watson, Charlie Cox and David Thewlis, does outstanding work as well. Overall, it's not particularly groundbreaking in terms of the biopic and romance formula, or in its execution, but Eddie Redmayne takes it to another level with his portrayal of one of the world's greatest living minds.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Also, we can see character development through the film. their characters change gradually but still very noticeable and make the audience become emotional and make them want to keep up with the story and support these two people. The casting was perfectly matching with real person even trivial details of the characters, such as personality, the way they act or even clothes.

An example to show what one can achieve with the right attitude.,"Jane : What are you ?Stephen : I'm a cosmologistJane : What's that ?Stephen : It's a kind of religion for intelligent atheists.I must admit that I've seen this film a few weeks ago. Probably the fact that Eddie Redmayne was nominated for an Oscar, prompted me to see if he was a worthy contender for the coveted golden statuette. And the only thing I can say is that he totally deserved to win with his magnificent performance. I love to watch a biographical movie now and then. The only drawback is that I'm always a little bit disappointed about the subject covered in such a biopic and that the emphasis lies on something I wasn't looking for. In ""jOBS"" I missed the philosophy this visionary had about the Apple phenomenon and the development of the applied interface (which is currently perfectly normal for everybody). The clash between Jobs and Gates was cited as a fait divers, whereas that interested me. Also in ""The Theory of Everything"" the focus was on other facets of Hawking's life. What applies to both these films is the fact that the protagonists physically look an awful lot like the corresponding character. It's creepy to see how they both manage not only to capture the emotional part, but also to match the characteristics and physical traits of these famous people. ""The Imitation Game"" is obviously also a biopic which, however, had a more adventurous twist rather than being a purely biographical sketch.You must admit that the performance of Eddie Redmayne is simply magnificent. Both excerpts from the college years, where he's still healthy,lively and the way he finishes his studies in a nonchalant manner, as the portrayal of a genius who's struck by a muscle disease, are brilliant and striking. A series of events wonderfully visualized using a variety of intense colors at certain times. The university professor who looks surprised at the solutions scribbled on the back of a timetable (10 math assignments which are almost impossible to solve I suppose, of which Stephen could ONLY solve 9). A family dinner Jane was invited to and where you already can get a sense of the intellectual atmosphere. The contradictions between Jane and Stephen when it's about religion. Hawking who excludes everyone after hearing the terrible verdict and the determination of Jane. These fragments stayed with me and made it a fascinating film.Which theories the brilliant mind of Hawking produced in that cripple body, isn't explained in detail. Here and there black holes, big bangs and the concept of time is mentioned, but eventually I was wondering what exactly Stephen Hawking's ultimate contribution was to mankind. What Jobs achieved you can discover in any computer shop. And from Turing we know that he has broken the Enigma code. But what abstract evidence Hawking delivered, wasn't clear to me. From one moment to the other he's a celebrity and a much sought-after guest speaker. That a woman who lives together with a paralyzed person can't really enjoy a thrilling,romantic life and that she's actually the person who's responsible for all practical matters in a marriage, is of course obvious. And that's the central theme of this biopic: a loving relationship slowly falling apart because of a fatal disease, the awareness of limitations and the danger to seek solace in someone else's arms. So it's mainly a biopic about the wife of Hawking, instead of about Hawking himself. An insight into the life of mathematical genius, who could explain the mystery of the origin of the universe by using his phenomenal intellectual brain, is thus transformed into an ordinary dime novel about an unhappy woman who feels abandoned by her ever loving husband. And that's something I wasn't waiting for.Despite the romantic approach, I think it's an admirable film. The situation Hawking is facing during his life, ensured that other qualities came up : humor and willpower. These two qualities are subtly incorporated into this film. Even the choice Hawking made at an older age about his marriage, took me by surprise (actually it wasn't much I knew about the life of Hawking). Once again this proves that he sees himself as a normal functioning man. ""The Theory of Everything"" is a beautiful film that actually moved me and should serve as an example to show what one can achieve with the right attitude and a big portion of perseverance.More reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Mind-blowing performance!!,"This biopic is just brilliant and the performance of Eddy is simply superb. No wonder he was awarded the Oscar.

A Tale of Inspiration and Triumph,"Actor Eddie Redmayne portrays renowned cosmologist Stephen Hawking in this biopic showing his transition from physically normal to a state of devastating debilitation. Redmayne's performance is nothing less than Oscar-worthy, and he is well supported by the entire cast, especially Felicity Jones as his dedicated, but ultimately troubled wife. Some may feel the film is too sentimental or cloying, even though sentimentality has its place in films and our lives; but the bottom line in The Theory of Everything is that it's so incredibly inspirational. And who would argue the point that all of us have odds to overcome (odds likely to be much less severe than Hawking faced), and to face those odds, we need inspiration.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Powerful, Moving And Emotional","5 January 2015 film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Theory of Everything. based on the book written by Jane Hawking about her life with her husband, this film is a poignant, touching and powerful tale of the earlier years of one of the world's most brilliant minds. Eddie Redmayne brought something special to this role. His portrayal of Professor Hawking was nothing short of genius. He had the audience captivated from the start. I felt all the emotions he was feeling especially the frustration as his body began to fail him. This is true acting and a great example of someone excelling at his chosen career, and I hope the establishment rewards him for it, come awards season. I recently heard an interview with Eddie Redmayne who told of meeting Stephen Hawking and how funny he was, this is how he came over in the film at times and highlights how savage this disease is and how a perfectly functioning mind be trapped in the prison of a wasting body.

"""The Theory of Everything--A Brief History of Love""","This is a lyrical and magnificent film, adapted from a literary source (a memoir by Jane Hawking). Rich in character and dialogue, ""The Theory of Everything"" is primarily a romance wrapped around a chronicle of a brilliant and beautiful mind trapped in a malfunctioning body. This film is a narrative of heartbreak, marital and emotional distance, with jagged edges and torn souls portrayed with great subtlety and craft. Using fireworks and cinematographic images of the star-filled sky to suggest Hawking's brilliant astrophysics theories , the viewer is given a glimpse of his theoretical physics, a quest for a single elegant mathematical theorem to express the system of the universe in all its glory, from inception to black holes and the beginning of time. A very light touch is given to his theories on cosmology.The poignancy and painful irony of observing a consummate mathematics genius, who theorizes about the infinity of space and time, crammed into a very confining capsule, wheelchair-bound, is portrayed without pity.

"Brilliant performance in an ""OK"" film","First and foremost, this is an incredible performance by Redmayne; he well earned the Oscar..and Jones was a wothy co-star. But I thought the film itself had a kind of by-the-numbers feel, propped up mostly by Redmayne's performance. There were numerous scenes where a meatier dialogue could have made a huge difference. (Side note: once again we get Hollywood's gross foot fetish shoved in our face, with numerous pointless shots of his feet. ?? They really need to get a grip on that; it's vulgar and disgusting) Overall, though, the movie is worth watching, mostly for Redmayne's performance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Simply A Great Film.,"I knew who Stephen Hawking was but I never knew his life was like this. I really enjoyed this film. It showed the complex and complicated love life of Stephen Hawking. Besides the drama it reminded me of ""The Imitation Game"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"", powerful films that illustrated people with great minds but corrupted lives. What I like about this film is the conflict that came between the two main characters. Here, a conflict that came between Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and his wife, Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), was that he didn't believe in GOD but she did. Several times in the film he would say some scientific things to disprove the existence of GOD, in which I felt that's what the writers of this film was was trying to put forth, but his wife would say different. As this film moves on more troubling conflicts seep their way into their relationship. Since I love physical science I did enjoy listening to the theories Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and his colleagues were discussing, but other than that it was simply a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Sorry Eddie, but I thought Keaton's and other nominees performance were more deserving for the Best Actor award","I sometimes just don't get the Oscars voting procedure and periodically a winner is announced that I just sit there dumb founded and say What The? The Theory of Everything is a biography on the life and challenges of Stephen Hawking, the Theoretical Physicist who was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's (ALS) disease and told he was not expected to live for any more than two years upon his diagnosis at age 21 in 1963. Eddie Redmayne is a good actor who this year walked away and won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance of Stephen Hawking but I really did not see how his performance was anything more than a cheaper imitation of John Hurt's performance in the Elephant Man. John Hurt did not win the 1981 Oscar that he was nominated for as the crippling and deformed figure of John Merrick.I understand the difficulty in crumpling up your body for a disease that gradually eats away at the central nervous system and still being able to live a full life. But watching Eddie crawl up a flight of stairs with his debilitating disease does not warrant beating out fellow Oscar nominees Keaton, Cumberbatch, Carell or even Cooper for that matter does it? This is not an enjoyable film, nor in my opinion did it capture the known historical events in Stephen Hawking's life (so far). But what I really don't understand is how Redmayne was honored with the Best Actor award for his performance over so many other superior performances by the other 2015 Oscar nominees. In my opinion the Oscar voters have lowered the bar much lower than it has ever gone in the past for warranting the Best Actor award.I have one question for the Oscar academy of voters. Did you actually see the other nominees performances? I give the film a 5 out of 10. As for the Best Actor award going to Eddie Redmayne for his performance?

A Solid British film led by strong performances,"Make no mistake, The Theory of Everything should not be dubbed the Stephen Hawking Biopic or anything similar for that matter. In fact it is quite the opposite; it is a love story between two people, one of whom later is struck down by a crippling condition, and how their love was prolonged in light of such a factor. For that matter, praise must be lauded on the writers for taking a chance with the story by placing the achievements of Dr Hawking to one side, instead focusing on an unfamiliarly emotional side of his character.My initial thoughts about the Theory of Everything appear to be my only concern with it; it has a Sunday afternoon made for TV feel to it, and whilst this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it does suggest that the production team have tried to create that particular effect, a homely, warm story of love and defiance - and it works.If anything, it is the brilliant acting of the leads, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, that help the film garner the appraisals it has generated; and rightly so. Redmayne appears to have taken a page out of Daniel Day Lewis' book (see 1989's My Left Foot), with a performance so committed yet credible, its no surprise he took home the Academy Award for his portrayal. Whilst I am tempted to proclaim his performance as one of the best of the decade, I still feel that the actor is consumed by a stereotypical bubble of being cast as the Nice Upper Class English Gentleman; it would be interesting to see how Redmayne's career pans out from this performance - especially so as he has now etched himself in award history. Credit must be given where credit is due and make no mistake, the acting is phenomenal.In light of Redmayne's physical commitment to the role, its easy to forget the grounded albeit more restrained performance Felicity Jones gives as Jane Hawking. If anything we are made to feel a closer association with her character than Dr Hawking's as she ultimately represents the notions of pain and hardship in a way that is completely relatable.This is a solid film; one which is given real flavour with its central performances; highly recommended just for the acting alone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Brilliant man and the marvelous woman behind him yields Brilliant Film,"The Theory of Everything is heartbreaking and inspiring story of Stephen Hawking told through his wife Jane's relationship with the intellectual.The Theory of Everything is the film adaptation of the biographical memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen.The story of the life of Stephen Hawking, one of the most famous modern physicists told from his youth to adulthood through his discovery of love and relationship with Jane Wilde.To portray someone who is still living is a daunting and unnerving task. Eddie Redmayne takes on the insurmountable effort and immerses himself into the person both physically and emotionally transforming himself into the role of the real life world-renowned Stephen Hawking. Felicity Jones perhaps has the more difficult responsibility of portraying Jane Wilde, the famed theoretical physicist's paramour, wife and eventual caretaker. Jane Wilde, later Jane Wilde-Hawking, is a far less well known persona. Yet, Jones relies upon pure assured confidence in her character and is able to relay a compelling and engaging complementary counter-figure to audiences.Together Jones and Redmayne help to tell the dramatic true love story of Hawking and Wilde in The Theory of Everything. The beauty and magic of the film and story is primarily told when focusing on Hawking in the beginning, prior to the onset of symptoms from the neurodegenerative disease while at Cambridge. It is here that director James Marsh makes for some absolutely breathtakingly beautiful shots.Once the symptoms of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) also known as Lou Gehrig's disease advances The Theory of Everything slowly changes focus through the eyes of Jane. Marsh's direction of this subtle and slow transition is marvelous with mildly distorted fishbowl effects through the point of view of Hawking. Marsh expertly captures the overwhelmingly frustrating, emotional, and detaching impact of the disease silently and effectively.Unfortunately as it becomes increasingly more difficult to understand Hawking as the disease progresses it also becomes harder to stay engaged with the film. And the story loses steam through the second act of The Theory of Everything.The Theory of Everything is an honest and un-exaggerated look at the real story of a man who has transformed how the world looks at science and the universe. Though as it can be said, behind every great man is a great woman, and audiences become privy to the seemingly untold story of the woman behind the man.For more full reviews of recent releases, please check out our WEBSITE.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Brilliantly acted but questionable direction,"'The Theory of Everything', a biographical film about British genius Stephen Hawking, doesn't do a lot wrong in a technical sense. It's very well written and produced with an excellent performance from Eddie Redmayne as Hawking. The film details the early years of Stephen's life, from his diagnosis with ALS disease to the complex relationship he has with his wife.My only query - and it is more of a query than criticism - is why there was so little time given for Hawking's actual thoughts and theories. We probably learn more about Hawking's wife and what she's thinking than Hawking himself, which is disappointing. After all, the film is titled 'The Theory of Everything', so one would have expected there to be a lot more focus on Hawking's actual theory.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

The story accompanied with Eddie Redmaynes, in my opinion, magnificent acting made me really like the movie and I am sure it will in a way please a lot of others as well.Don't be discouraged if you wanted a movie solely about his work, chances are you will be pleasantly surprised with the actual movie.

"The Theory of Everything - Magnificent Acting and Intriguing Story - But Oh, that monotonous score","Herb Blank Head, Business Development and Managing Director, ESG Solutions Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones are nothing short of remarkable in the Theory of Everything. The supporting cast, cinematographic innovations, and costuming were all excellent. I learned a lot and recommend it fairly highly.However, the tedious piano score, relentless throughout, really started alternatively putting me to sleep and getting on my nerves. I know many of today's young filmmakers and critics have a disdain for overly dramatic scores. I don't personally but either way - this was truly the other extreme!The only other nit I'll pick I recognize as representative of the fact that I am from a prior generation. I found the dialog overly spartan and a lot of story blanks deliberately unexplained. To me and I daresay others from my generation, this creates distance and makes personal emotional involvement difficult. That said, I am aware enough of both the subject matter and today's artistic and industry standards to believe that was exactly what James Marsh had in mind.I've often heard today's highly regarded filmmakers and ""experts"" express disdain for verbal storytelling insisting that really talented directors should emphasize imagery and the visuality of the medium over story exposition. For those people in the reviews I've read, the DIrector didn't go far enough in that direction so I should be grateful - and I am. There also is a marvelous scene where Jane tells her mother (who inadvertently starts the new Chapter in Jane's life with the choirmaster) that ""She's never heard anything so English in her life."" So indeed, the lack of outward emotion expressed on film and the economic and sterile dialog is quite illustrative of a very English family background and Cambridge-educated gentry. It also is consistent with the recurrent subtext of the film contrasting Jane's C-of-E morality and natural proclivity toward adherence to standards of decorum with Hawking's personal immaturity (dictated by circumstances), unconventionality and unrepentant atheism. So the understatement is quite appropriate especially from Jane's lens which is how we get to view most of what unfolds. In short, I have to recognize that James Marsh did a superb job of conveying in cinema the subtext of the film.So, I conclude that most of IMDb will appreciate what I found detracted just a bit from my personal enjoyment. But that's quite trivial overall. I enjoyed the movie and think most will as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The Theory of Everything,"Based around the honest, touching and frequently heart-rending book by Jane Hawking (here played very well by Felicity Jones), this is essentially a story of love and dedication - with one hell of a lot of frustration thrown in too. Eddie Redmayne is superb as the now acclaimed, flawed and often rather unpleasant scientist whose brain was years ahead of it's time; and the drama marries his dedication to his work with his devotion to himself, his family and, of course, to everyone's handling of the increasingly debilitating disease that ultimately denied him just about every aspect of his physical being. It's not a science lesson - never fear, our neurones are left pretty much unchallenged. It is a love story. Not a romance, either - but a depiction of a relationship that thrived, struggled, rose and - ultimately - fell. The intimacies of the photography almost immerse us in their lives as both take a rather stoic, but not always enjoyable, approach to the difficulties faced by all concerned. It is well scripted, the dialogue is sensitive and plausible - and Jóhann Jóhannsson's score augments the visuals aptly too. As biopics go, it comes across as far less speculative; it has an integrity to it that coupled with with two actors at the top of the bill who clearly enjoyed working with each other, gives us a superior drama about two people who were genuinely interested in each other, and who are genuinely of interest to the audience. The supporting efforts from the likes of David Thewlis and Harry Lloyd and from the myriad of actors who portray the couple as they grow up from childhood add well to the overall richness of this - and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Hawking's wife: She had it rough too!,"Without any cynicism, I know, it must have been hard to take care of Hawking. I'm sure it was a difficult marriage. Jane Wilde have our respect, humanity salutes you, and so on. BUT. This is a movie about Stephen Hawking, the world famous physicist. I don't wanna be rude, but we ""wanna see"" his story, his feelings, his struggles, his hardships, his fight with the neurodegenerative disease, and the achievements he made despite all that. I kinda understand the lack of science and the focus shift to drama, but lets not forget: it's still a movie about Stephen Hawking. Sidetracking time: I'd love to link a Guardian article here, in which Jane (only half year after the death of her ex-husband) complains about her depiction in the Theory of Everything. She thinks in a movie about Stephen Hawking (I can't stress it enough!), they should've shown the unspeakable difficulties of packing for the family, driving, organising...etc. Let me give you a little bit of St. Paul: ,,Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude."" If it was so selfless and altruistic of Jane to take care of Stephen, maybe she should be happy about the recognition instead of arguing for more. I'm sure Hawking's grave is a comfortable hump to stand on, but... can you please not, maam? She doesn't realize that even this recognition has already happened to Hawking's detriment. For her part, a more detailed depiction of the difficulties of daily care was cut short. And in comparison, they cut out pretty much Hawking's entire scientific career. You can decide which is more important. In a movie about Hawking...I agree that the presentation of their relationship was sketchy at best, but I don't think the solution would be to further swell her role. Hawking is lost in his own movie. It only contains traces if him. We don't get to know why he was a special person, a one in a hundred million. Time... time is not enough! And if you need more time-time, then make more time-time! Make it longer!Replace the Hawking in the movie with a similarly sick person and basically nothing will change. In vain did Eddie Redmayne played his soul out in this role if the script pushed the physicist's genius into the background because of commercial consumability, along with him, making space for the female lead we honestly don't care about. This is not your movie, Jane! Not your tragedy, not your success story!Again, I understand the no science policy, but if you wanna make it more personal: where is Hawking's childhood? The relationship with his children? Or the surprisingly intimate relationship with the priest? Where is the deep seated depression of his? The ruler of England honors him? No time...time. No time to be scientific, no time to be humane, no time to be experientially emotional... so what's the point, then?",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

A poignant depiction of the life of a genius,"The life of the most famous physicist of our time, Professor Stephen Hawking, is given the biopic treatment in the poignant and outstandingly acted 'The Theory of Everything' which won Eddie Redmayne an Oscar in 2015.Detailing Hawking's physical decline upon diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease and his struggle to maintain a marriage, career and legacy, this film is a touching but occasionally difficult to watch portrayal of a genius defying the odds.The acting on show from the cast is truly outstanding and Redmayne's interpretation of Hawking at the various stages of his life is extraordinary and worthy of his Oscar recognition. The wide eyed wonder he portrays when finding love with Jane (a brilliant Felicity Jones) feels as genuine as his physical acting performance in dramatizing Hawking's diagnosis and subsequent collapse with his illness. It is a multi-layered performance that captures a range of emotions in a way that can engender feelings of empathy and repulsion in the audience.The biopic seeks to walk a tightrope between the personal drama and the context of the cosmology theories and interplay between characters in the University of Cambridge setting. The complexity of the scientific interplay is not particularly accessible to the uninitiated and the opening acts are somewhat difficult to wade through. However, Hawking's personal journey is a compelling narrative that takes a raw and honest look at the issue of disability and its impact on a person and their loved ones.Particularly praiseworthy is the depiction of Hawking's wife's flirtation with an affair and the moral quandary this places her in whilst the Professor's physical condition deteriorates and his relationship with his carer grows increasingly complex. The result of both scenarios is depicted in such a way that the film negates judgement on the rights and wrongs of the situation. The final scene of the movie between Hawking and his wife is genuinely beautiful and wraps up the drama with a moment of reflection on the human experience, rather than cosmological science, of time and creation.The Theory of Everything is not likely to be top of any date movie lists but it is a compelling drama featuring a cast delivering outstanding performances, none more so than Eddie Redmayne. The film does have a whiff of Oscar-bait in both its script and cinematography but there is much substance to admire in the production and it is well worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

It was theoritcally possible for this to be a good film,"I have discovered a pun hole where all punvolution originated. OK, so I am no Dr. Stephen Hawking, but I can write a cheesy pun review on a movie about him. ""The Theory of Everything"" is an emotional movie about the life of Dr. Stephen Hawking, the renowned physicist who presented theoretical predictions including the one that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set forth a cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. Hawking also achieved success with works of popular science in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general; his ""Brief History of Time"" stayed on the British Sunday Times best-sellers list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. While my ""Not so Brief History of Puns"" was not even published! Anyways, what made this so courageous and commendable, is that Hawking was able to accomplish all these great feats living with the debilitating ALS disease. All of this is depicted in ""The Theory of Everything"", but Director James Marsh decided to march to the beat of a different drum by highlighting Hawking's longtime relationship with his first wife Jane Hawking. So, ""The Theory of Everything"" is mostly a love story about overcoming insurmountable odds and having profound resiliency to produce a marriage and a family. Stephen had three kids with Jane. There was hardly any Marsh Madness in the direction of the picture, so I give a passing grade to the film's orchestration. I thought that Anthony McCarten's screenplay was a tad weak; and it might have been the film's only minor drawback. However, the greatest force of ""The Theory of Everything"" was the powerful performances from Eddie Redmayne as Stephen and Felicity Jones as Jane; my theory is that they will be both get nominated for Oscars, and yes I did not kill any brain cells figuring that one out.

Story of Stephen Hawking,"THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is a well-shot, well-told love story with comedic moments woven throughout to keep the movie engaging as well as inspiring. There is a very strong positivistic scientism worldview in the movie as Stephen holds to the theory that everything in existence can be explained and proven by science. Eddie Redmayne really portrayed Late Stephen Hawking's character so well that it felt totally realistic. His body movements, expressions and they way he spoke omg it was just crazy amazing! The was he transitioned from healthy to being sick was acted by him so well that it made me highly sympathetic at those scenes and I just wish I could meet late Stephen Hawking and tell him how much of an inspiration he is to me! Despite his health issues he went on for 55 years to explore and educate us about the universe and this really motivates me to educate myself better.

An Eloquent Screenplay,"Screenwriter Anthony McCarten figures out what he wants to say towards the end, and even if his conclusions are somewhat literal, it helps immeasurably to bring ""The Theory Of Everything"" to its warm conclusion. McCarten's eloquent screenplay (based on Jane Hawking's book) and director James Marsh seem to want to match Stephen Hawking's theories about time's beginnings and, at the end, by running the films's main events in reverse, they cleverly compare the relationship between Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and his first wife, Jane (Felicity Jones) to the big bang theory. McCarten's most interesting topic is perhaps the oddest when it comes to a biography of Stephen Hawking--sexual infidelity--and though he answers his questions about it childishly (he equates unfaithfulness with deathly illness in order to lay on the guilt), it's somewhat refreshing to find a film that eschews the traditional hagiographic view of romance when icons are involved. Redmayne and Jones are good enough, though you get the sense that there's no real degree of difficulty in their acting; in fact, as far as Redmayne is concerned, there's the distinct feel that acting is all he's doing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
An extraordinary film for an extraordinary story,"The Theory of Everything: A reviewOh, dear... Where do I even start? While watching the movie, I was already thinking about what I would write about it. There were too many things that surprised me all at once. It started and I felt, this would be one of those films I could rave on and on about...I was right.The first thing that I noticed was the beautiful music, written by the composer Jóhann Jóhannsson. Rich but simple, it guides and carries the movie. And I mean that in the best possible way, as the movie doesn't lack in the other departments.The cinematography is unique and charmingly expressive. Every frame a painting as they say. The use of color and shape, exquisite. Every scene a whole different feel and atmosphere, every shot meticulously crafted. I lost count at the times I said to myself, what an amazing shot!Then we have, of course, Mr. and Mrs. Hawking. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones portray the couple in a way that exudes a tenderness and intimacy I have never seen on screen before. They both make you fall in love with their love instantly. Their relationship is indubitably what makes this movie unforgettable. A bond that was tested by faith, sickness, and ironically; time.Felicity Jones is absolutely fantastic as Jane. We slowly see her going from an optimistic, strong, and perhaps naive young woman, to a tired and frustrated mother, trying to keep her family together. However, it is impossible not to mention Redmayne as Stephen Hawking. What a raw, genuine, phenomenal performance. You can see the enormous amounts of work he has put into this role, and seeing him portray the professor fills you up with what I say is great awe and admiration. I'd say he deserves an Oscar, but the Academy has already agreed with me! This is definitely one of the most promising actors of this generation.The story of the great Stephen Hawking is well known. Though this film has made changes to some events in his life for dramatic effect, he is still a man who has changed the world of cosmology forever, and changed the way we see the universe. An extraordinary man with an extraordinary life.Thankfully, this movie telling his story is just as extraordinary. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
I'M READY FOR A STANDING OVATION AT THE OSCARS FOR EDDIE AND JONES.,"Do you really know what is asked of you when you vow to love someone in sickness and in health? What happens when disability doesn't allow you to love the way you want? Are you better off just breaking free if you have the chance?
Obviously going through the physical transformation must be rewarded. Contorting his body and learning the physical tics that Stephen Hawking has displayed in real life all ring true. Since his breakout work in Les Miserables, a role that should have landed him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, I was wary to believe I'd revisit a praising session with the young actor so soon. It's one of the best things offered this year.
The Theory of Everything is not about the equations or the mathematics. It's essentially about us. It's about love, and not just in the form of marriage.

The movie makes you think of those things.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A typical biography with a visually brilliant display,"The theory of everything is a biographic display of the famous physicist Stephen Hawking. Even though it's just a life story which move of us already know, the direction and the visuals make the viewer look into his past life as he lived through it. Also, his surroundings, his professors, his colleagues, his family members and his interaction with them, his genetic disease- all of this is to be seen on the big screen.As we all know, his main ambition was to invent a single equation that explains everything - the birth of the universe which according to him is the ""black hole"".As the physics that we studied, there are two main theories - one the Max Plank's quantum physics that explains about the tiniest particles : atoms, protons, electrons, neutrons etc and two the general theory of relativity invented by Albert Einstein that explains the large bodies in the universe and specifically about the birth of universe which is the expanding state now.Now, Stephen's aim is to erase the difference or contradictions between these two theories and invent a single mathematical equation that explains it all. It is to be seen on the movies what happens next.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Too superficial over large parts,"'The Theory of Everything' tells part of the life story of Stephen Hawking in fast forward. The movie illuminates many facets of his life. Unfortunately, the movie does not take the necessary time to let what is shown have an effect, to give it the necessary depth. We mostly scratch the surface and connections must be opened up by oneself or you have to make assumptions. Meanwhile, the story is already moving on to the next stage of life.In a biopic about Stephen Hawking, the subject matter of his illness must not be missing. Here the movie manages to keep the balance between drama and positive/funny moments. There are well-dosed elements from both sides.On a positive note, the acting performance of Eddie Redmayne has to be highlighted. It was really good. His portrayal of Stephen Hawking was authentic and genuine throughout and never seemed forced. The increasing physical deterioration is touching and shows strength to still want to make the best of his life.The movie is interesting, well made and entertaining. Time itself is an important factor in the whole movie and time is also the movie's main problem. It does not take the time needed to tell a story. Rather, it comes across as if it were a stringing together of important life events. But the context is often not recognizable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"A Cativating Biopic, and An Intriguing Tale of Love","When I first heard that James Marsh, the director behind inspiring documentaries like 'Man on Wire' and 'Project Nim', is directing a biopic of inspirational scientist Stephen Hawking, I was quite excited and had too many expectations since the story was set to focus both on Hawking's achievements as well as his love life. Marsh doesn't disappoint at all; with the help of Anthony McCarten's screenplay (adapted from Jane Hawking's book), he gives us such a motivational and heartbreaking story of love, with all its ups and downs.When Hawking was diagnosed with ALS, he was given only two years to live. Without the support of his lover at that time, Jane, he would have gone into a world of hopelessness and loneliness, and so would any man in his situation. No matter what our goals and ambitions are in life, we human beings are quite emotionally needy; we do need someone to be with us, as a companion.No relationship is perfect, neither was this one. It was a love between two people with such different tastes and ideologies. Hawking went on with his theories, fame, books, and Jane had to take care of him, his children, and manage her studies as well. Their relationship was strained but quite moving. The inclusion of Jonathan into their lives was quite heartwarming; the string of scenes the movie shows of all them spending time together was quite beautiful. So without revealing anymore about the story, all I could say is, the characters (people) involved as well as the story-writers handled the situations quite commendably.It's the two lead actors, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, that give the characters and the story the depth it demands. Redmayne was first properly noticed in 'My Week with Marilyn'; he has come a long way from there, and has completely transformed himself to get into the shoes and wheels of the character. There are moments you think how closely he resembles the actual scientist. He is remarkable. And giving him support is the talented Miss Jones; her performance is more nuanced and subtle, but conveys the desired emotions with such impact that it's hard not to acknowledge her. She's the emotional backbone of the film.The two other big strengths of the film are: the colourful and spectacular cinematography (by Benoît Delhomme), and the breathtaking original score (by Jóhann Jóhannsson). They help us delve into the world and lives of these fascinating characters. The movie is filled with heartwarming as well as heartbreaking moments, interspersed with lines of wit and humour which are sure to make one chuckle.I agree, few of the negative aspects of their love life may have been glossed over, and few terrible aspects of Stephen's life with second wife have been excluded, but as much as they've shown, it's quite commendable. It's mainly Stephen and Jane's story, everything else is irrelevant. Ultimately, the movie isn't about physics, the universe or its theories; it's about us humans, our dreams and goals, and essentially, love, the one thing that binds all these.The last sequence, recapping the major moments of Hawking's life in reverse (synced with the mesmerising music score), was terrific, and was the perfect ending the film deserved.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Hard movie to make about Hawking,"I haven't followed Hawking's career and I only knew that he studied black holes and universe. Unfortunately this movie only told me that he had a wife and 3 kids.For dramatic value it works. The self sacrifice of the wife, beating the odds and living long life despite early prognosis of 2 years. In addition to that he wrote couple books and changed the world of physics.
Movie completely focuses on the daily struggles, the progression of his ALS and what impact did it have on him, on his family and friends.I don't know why I expected more. I probably saw too many fiction movies lately that it is hard for me to appreciate the biography of a man who never gave up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Black Holes In a Soap Opera,"Spoilers...if you don't know history.From the opening minutes of a bunch of annoying brainiacs in a prestigious college trying to pick up girls through scripted banter, I could not stop comparing this film with A Beautiful Mind. Both are sanitized biopics about troubled ivy league geniuses, both feature degenerating male leads and sympathetic female ones, both feature the same annoyingly-warm lighting, the same clichéd, harmless script, and the same overcompensating, bravado performances.The Theory of Everything tells the story of Stephen Hawking, an ambitious physicist struggling to keep a normal family life and a fertile professional career amidst his crippling motor neuron disease which eventually leaves him almost entirely paralyzed. The script sidesteps many of Hawking's most important ideas and instead focuses on his relationship with his wife Jane and the drama that inevitably ensues in a marriage strained by illness. I knew the film would go the soapy route but I didn't know to what extent. For a man with so many brilliant hypotheses, The Theory of Everything only scratches the surface and leaves the audience with a made-for-TV quality script with an unearned sense of grandiosity.Thank god for these performances! A part like Stephen Hawking is pure gold for any brave actor willing to take on the challenge, and Eddie Redmayne did the best possible job with the given material. His body movements (or lack thereof) and speech patterns are highly realistic for a man with Hawking's condition. In the second half, he becomes a silent actor and contorts his face like a seasoned pro, gathering more sympathy through facial gestures than words. Felicity Jones as Jane manages to keep up with Redmayne and cultivates quite a nice chemistry with him that endures through the hardest of times. Jonathan Jones, Jane's second husband, is probably the most charming character in the entire film, and Charlie Cox's performance is undeniably delightful.Visually, James Marsh created an admirable film with a few flashes of whimsy and creativity (excellent eye/black hole match cut and a wonderfully edited montage near the end). The score by Benoît Delhomme is predictably opulent, quaint yet overly dramatic.The Theory of Everything takes an enthralling true life story and diminishes it in the way most lives are when condensed into two hours of pure Oscar bait. Still, the story never veers into unwatchable territory and the acting talent on display is reason enough to see it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A truly excellent film,"Very rarely do I see a film I feel is genuinely worthy of being called excellent, in 2014 we had the release of both Theory of Everything and the Imitation game.Watching the theory of everything reminded me what true cinema is about. Striping away the CGI and the mess that goes along with most modern cinema.It's not action packed or anything like that. It's a real film. I love marvel and those kind of films but this and imitation game are what acting is all about.Eddie Redmayne gives a truly phenomenal performance as Hawking, one of the best performances I've ever seen. Felicity Jones gives an equally powerful performance as Jane.This may sound contrived, as this film is so hyped but sometimes the hype is real. This film really is as good as the reviews say.It's not big or flashy, it's clever, funny, moving and above all celebrates a great man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Never having read any biographies I cannot tell you how much of this is fact and how much is ""creative license,"" so to speak.It would seem that they stuck to the basic facts, however, as the story is indeed boring at times.

Oscar-baity film-making at its finest!,"""The Theory of Everything"" has everything to please the Academy, and not just in theory. Indeed, if someone tells me that James Marsh directed this movie without dreaming of the Oscars, I'll pull a Michael Corleone and say: ""now who's being naïve?""This film is a school-case; it features all the boxes to tick for the Oscars: a contemporary biopic? Check. British celebrity? Double check. A world-wide known character? Check. Intelligent? Check. Disabled? Triple-check. A dysfunctional family drama spanning three decades? A climactic discovery? An inspirational speech? The story of Stephen Hawking was begging for a movie adaptation because this is the kind of performances that will never go unnoticed, and I bet Eddie Redmayne could already choose the spot in his cupboard for the Oscar the day he signed the script.And like Sean Penn who took away Mickey Rourke's only possible shot at the Oscars, Eddie Redmayne took it from Michael Keaton. Remember when ""Birdman"" came out, it was all about Keaton until ""The Theory of Everything"" raised its little head and every Academy pundit knew it was over for Batman, 'Robin' would steal his thunder. Serves him for not playing a tragic inspirational real-life figure, that's the lesson we learned from Rourke's loss. Just look at all the winners in the past 10 years: Winston Churchill, Hugh Glass, Abraham Lincoln, George VI, Amin Dada, Truman Capote, fictional characters never really pay off.And you can't even blame the Academy, Eddie Redmayne is actually the best thing about the film, his performance really makes you believe this is Stephen Hawking resurrecting as a young freshman and then slowly descending into the condition that made him such a pop culture icon celebrated in ""The Simpsons"" and ""The Big Bang Theory"". And the film showed a fascinating aspect about Stephen: for someone who didn't believe in God, he exemplified the idea that God gives when he takes away and Lou Gehrig's disease was so great a handicap He could only compensate it by making Hawking the greatest mind of the twentieth century, second to Einstein.But I digress because the film, while celebrating Hawking' achievement, also focuses on his family life with Jane. Felicity Jones is good as the all-loving but then long-suffering wife, highlighting a sort of bipolar temptation from the film. It tries to be two things at the same time: ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""My Left Foot"", it's far better than the former which relied on misleading thrills to make Nash' life more interesting, but maybe I wished it dared a little more and could plunge us in the mind of the genius, or focus on the internal battle between his inner self (he wasn't an isolated nerd but a lazy, easygoing fellow), his struggle to understand the universe and make himself understood.That mental exploration was the kind of stunts I expect from movies about intelligent or visionary people, to make you feel more intelligent, but the treatment is rather superficial because the story is busy swinging back and forth between drama and science, to insist on the woman behind the great man. So it all comes to a simple question: are we interested? If so, to what extent? It's always nice to have the external insight but this is why I was so critical at the film's conventional aspect (it's an Oscar baity film if I ever saw one), it should have kept Jones as a supporting character and be more focused on Hawking's world, Jones was a comforting and important presence but she wasn't pivotal in his achievements.So just when we have a glimpse on his genius and the film seems to take off to some realms of intellectual celebrations, we have the domestic life back again, problem with the kids, with the family, the gossips, the gas bills... this is a man who's contemplating the universe, the big bang, time and we have to endure the peripheral aspects, it's like someone pointing out to the moon and we have to endure the finger. I didn't hate that approach, overall, the treatment was well done but it fell flat. If Marsh anted to highlight that aspect, maybe he needed an extra hour because I didn't care much for Felicity Jones.Or maybe I should retract that bit, the first parts did annoy me in the sense that the love story looked like a retread of ""A Beautiful Mind"", it became interesting when he lot the ability to speak and the marriage went downhill. However; we never feel the real transition between happy and sad Jane. So to end on a comparison, the film manages to be a sort 2010s ""Pride of the Yankees"": the man's popular then there's the illness, relatives coping with them and the final speech, of course, this time, he survives but the couple falls apart. It's all done well when it comes to biopic about such tormented characters, you expect more.It's like Redmayne was trapped in that wheelchair and could only stick to Hawking's mimics in order to guarantee his Oscar, it was his zone of comfort, Jones was the actress who went beyond the limit of a two-dimensional role and gave it a poignant aura and the film could take its way to the Oscars, it played it safe and succeeded admirably by grabbing the Best Actor Oscar.At least, ""Birdman"" tried something new and got the Best Picture. But the film seems to equate the award with a series of parameters cohabiting with harmony, I guess I can say it's a great Oscar-bait movie, it's a very limited way to look at it, but still better than being a bad Oscar one. And I just realized James Marsh had won the Oscar with ""Man On Wire"", so he's capable of making inspirational movies with a uniqueness of their own.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

"Eddie Redmayne delves into the role as Stephen Hawking with heart, soul and mannerisms","This biopic about the life and works of Stephen Hawking is a captivating study of the terrible disease ALS, and how living with and around it can be. As most people know, Hawking is well-known for being the longest ever survivor of ALS, but he's also one of the world's leading theoretical physicists, something The Theory of Everything for some reason seems a little less interested in exploring. Instead, director James Marsh (Man on Wire) structures his film as a love story between Hawking and his wife of thirty years, Jane - and the struggles they face as Hawking gets gradually more impeded by his condition. The brilliant performances by the two lead actors drive this drama forward and evokes a full spectre of emotions, and it's especially heart-rending to witness Hawking's bodily decay up-close, magnificently portrayed by Eddie Redmayne who delves into this with heart, soul and mannerisms. Despite some familiar plot structuring, the drama feels authentic, perhaps because the film enters into rather unexplored territory. Still, I had hoped from a director of Marsh's calibre that he had dared to go deeper into Hawking's mind and thinking, however theoretical it might be. The title makes that promise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

"Ten stars for the performances, five stars for the biopic bushwa","Eddie Redmayne's transformation is certainly amazing, Felicity Jones is perfect as the beleaguered Mrs. H, and the geeky Cambridge courtship scenes are charming, but it's harder to dramatize the breakdown of a marriage or the birth of a scientific theory. Director James Marsh has to resort to cinematic shorthand—Jane tries to concentrate on her thesis while Hawking zooms around in his wheelchair, surrounded by shrieking kids—and unconvincing biopic bushwa—Hawking stares at a sputtering log in the fireplace, and the theory of Hawking radiation (emitted by black holes) is born.The script's based on Jane Hawking's memoir, and the film briefly comes alive for her platonic romance with the widowed choir director (Charlie Cox) who became her second husband when Hawking took up with a vivacious nurse (Maxine Peake!).

Inspirational. Enough Said.,"Astrophysics and time theories become mildly interesting due to this biopic of the life and you would think adversity of esteemed Professor Stephen Hawking. The biopic begins in 1963 with Hawking studying at Cambridge and after a heavy fall being given the bombshell news that he has only two years to live because of debilitating muscle degeneration disease.At around the same time he falls in love with Jane Wilde. The film is based on Jane Wilde/Hawking's own book. The film shows her ever increasing struggle to care for Stephen way beyond the initial two year prognosis. They marry and have three children. Time seems to be the central theme of this story. As time goes by Jane's struggles lead to concerns about Stephens care needs. Hawking's becomes a Dr then a Professor. He eventually loses all ability to verbally communicate. His inner thoughts although not affected by the disease eventually become communicable by a computer generated verbal device. Mechanic and American sounding!Eventually Hawking's becomes detached from Jane. His care needs being helped by someone called Elaine whilst Jane remarries the local vicar. Hawking's 'Theory of Time' book has sold approximately eighty million copies the viewer is told at the end of the film. Some biopics are interesting like this, The Imitation Game (2014) film about Mathematician Robert Turing and a film I watched a few years ago, The Damned United (2009) about the football manager Brian Clough.

Adapted from a book written by Dr. Stephen Hawking's wife, it is a heart-wrenching account of their life together.Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of the advancing disease is simply dazzling. The young actor takes us through the transformation from a quirky student before he had any signs of the illness to a world renowned scientist living in the physical confines of his deteriorating disease. Even though the movie skims over some of the events and motivations of the central characters, it has told the story in a touching way. Stephen Hawking's accomplishments are not as much the focus of the story as is his humour, his stubbornness and his continued exploration of the larger questions, mixing science with philosophy. He is portrayed in a sympathetic light, perhaps at odds with the accounts of others who know him.Even if the film skews from reality, it is worth seeing.

I really enjoyed the score, and everyone acting did a great job. I really enjoyed the 2 ""Doctor Who"" references, and the theory that was used in the movie ""Interstellar."" It was amazing seeing how Stephen Hawking was suddenly diagnosed with this disease, and was expected to live for only 2 years as of the day of diagnosis, but defied those expectations and is still alive today. I really appreciate the care that the filmmakers took in making the film as accurate as possible. The real Stephen Hawking even said that at certain points of the film he thought he was watching himself.

Refreshingly chronological!,"The best thing about this biopic is that it avoids 2 things that plague modern biopics nowadays: 1. jumping back and forth in time and 2. showing just the sordid, usually later part of the subject's life. This straightforward and effective biopic about scientist Stephen Hawking focuses primarily on the effect of coping with ALS on a family and the physical and emotional difficulties they face. Because this happened in the UK there seems to be no major financial difficulty like insurance running out etc. It's sympathetic to his wife since it's based on her book. Don't quite understand his scientific contribution party but it isn't about that. The recent biopic Mr Turner was dreadfully boring and showed things no one wanted to see. Also the one about Dickens with Ralph Fiennes was pretty bad too. At least in Theory you see what you want to see. Felicity Jones as his wife is right for the role - not too pretty. Eddie Redmayne finally has found a role that suits him. He isn't handsome enough for major romantic lead roles like Les Mis. So this role is just right for him with his slightly crooked features. He looks a lot like the person he is playing, much more so than many other biopics of late. It isn't right to give an Oscar just because the actor is portraying terrible illness on screen but in this case he is pretty good.

"A better version of ""A Beautiful Mind""","The focus is more Hawking the person, than Hawking the genious, and giving the complexity of his work, I think that was a smart choice. And it's not completely forgotten. They ""dumb down"" the science and try to include it enough to show how smart this guy is, but not to go over the head of the ""not that smart"".A violent score almost force emotion on us. And it kind of works. The movie had me ""almost crying"" every 20 minutes or so. A little ""too Disney"" at moments, but typical of Hollywood bios. This time, it was effective with me. The acting from Redmayne (Hawking) and Jones (Jane Hawking) were awesome, helped by a bunch of moments to show off (some subtle, some melodramatic).In the end, cliched, with too much melodrama but all well done, the smart decision of not go too much into the absurdly complicated science, good acting and a coherent story of ""overcoming the adversities"".PD: The use of God and Hawking's perspective about it through the film, I think is particularly smart (even I don't like how present God is in the story about a scientist) and I gave an extra point for it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"OUTSTANDING! created this acct just to spread the word, MUST SEE,...","""The Theory of Everything"", the movie about Stephen Hawking, is truly inspiring, well- written & acted, will most likely make you cry (you don't stand a chance if you cried during the notebook lol), but a MUST SEE! For a Hollywood screenplay, the film authentically portrays (with minimal discrepancies) the actual lives of Stephen Hawking and his family, verified by his former wife Jane (of 30 years) and Stephen Hawking himself. It is important to see this film even though it might be difficult to watch at some points. Hopefully afterwards you might see things/life in a different perspective? Jane is the absolute epitome of devotion and fortitude as well as Stephen with his ambition to effectuate boundless achievements despite his circumstances.

Stephen Hawking,Review: I loved this movie because though it is glaringly historically inaccurate it is still a really interesting look into the life of Stephen Hawking. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. Especially by Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones who steal the show as Mr. and Mrs. Hawking.

Physics is back in business,"""The Theory of Everything"" is a captivating biographical drama film directed by James Marsh that tells the extraordinary story of renowned physicist Stephen Hawking. Based on the memoir ""Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen"" by Jane Hawking, the film offers a moving portrayal of Hawking's life, his groundbreaking work in cosmology, and his relationship with his wife Jane.One of the film's standout features is the outstanding performance by Eddie Redmayne, who portrays Stephen Hawking with remarkable depth and authenticity. Redmayne's portrayal of Hawking's physical transformation due to his battle with motor neuron disease is truly remarkable, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. He brings Hawking's struggles, intelligence, and wit to life, capturing the essence of the iconic physicist in a truly remarkable way.Felicity Jones also delivers a stellar performance as Jane Hawking, Stephen's wife. She portrays Jane's unwavering love, dedication, and sacrifices for Stephen, as well as her own struggles as his caregiver, with grace and nuance. The chemistry between Redmayne and Jones is palpable, and their performances elevate the emotional depth of the film.The film also does an excellent job of portraying the scientific aspects of Stephen Hawking's work in cosmology, making complex scientific concepts accessible to audiences who may not be familiar with them. The visual effects and cinematography used to illustrate Hawking's theories and insights are visually stunning and provide a deeper understanding of his groundbreaking work.In addition to the performances and scientific aspects, the film also delves into the complexities of Stephen and Jane's relationship. It portrays the challenges they faced, including Stephen's deteriorating health, their different beliefs, and their struggles to balance their personal lives with Stephen's demanding career. The film beautifully captures the love, resilience, and strength that kept them together despite the overwhelming obstacles they faced.The film's pacing is well done, providing a balanced mix of scientific explanations, personal struggles, and emotional moments. James Marsh's direction is skillful, capturing both the physical and emotional aspects of Stephen Hawking's life with sensitivity and authenticity. The film's score, composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson, is also noteworthy, complementing the story and performances beautifully.If there's one criticism of the film, it's that some aspects of Hawking's life and work may have been simplified or glossed over for the sake of the film's narrative. However, this is a common challenge in biographical films, and ""The Theory of Everything"" still provides a compelling and inspiring portrayal of Stephen Hawking's remarkable life and contributions to science.In conclusion, ""The Theory of Everything"" is a must-watch film for anyone interested in Stephen Hawking's life, work, and his indomitable spirit. The outstanding performances by Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, the captivating portrayal of Hawking's scientific insights, and the poignant depiction of his personal struggles make this film a truly moving and powerful experience. It is a fitting tribute to one of the greatest minds of our time and a testament to the triumph of the human spirit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Redmayne performance covers for a stifled and predictable script,"Regardless of how much you respect Hawking and don't want to showcase his family's dirty laundry too much, one has to ask: What was the point of this movie then?The story isn't nearly enough focused on his scientific achievements. As a layman, I barely understood what he even discovered about black holes that was so revolutionary. Even assuming the movie is an adaptation of Jane's experience of living with him, it has no teeth. The most predictable thing to happen in their relationship you can imagine happens to a tee, from a quietly dissatisfied wife that can't handle her husband's fame to a formal and respectful divorce with staying just friends. All this without any stimulating conflict, peppered with meaningless supporting characters I can't even name. And when, at the end, Hawking says, ""Look at what we made,"" I catch myself thinking that I completely forgot he had kids because of how inconsequential they were.Another thing that I loathed were the instances of color filters. I understand that they are supposed to convey the mood or how characters feel. There are better ways of doing that than just turning everyone into a smurf or drowning the room in red.All that said, the soundtrack is delightful, and of course, Redmayne's performance carries the movie. It is an incredible physical performance, and you can see the deterioration in movements and casual things even before the diagnosis. Even the way he holds a champagne glass deliberately shows muscle degeneration. An uncanny portrayal. Just don't expect anything else from this movie but the most lukewarm meditation on theology and hope against all odds idiom.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Easy to see why Eddy Redmayne won the best actor for this,"Well, it is easy to see why Eddy Redmayne won the best actor for this - he absolutely was Steven Hawking. The film really is first class and tells a story of Hawking's life (I say ""a story"" not ""the story"") extremely well. As a piece of story-telling it is an example to hold up to other film-makers. It is of course a crowd-pleaser and a tear-jerker, but what is wrong with that - it is what we expected after all. It keeps well clear of the ""science"" of course - again, to be expected.The main focus is on his terrible disease and the impact on his marriage. Hawking's attitude to his wife however is shameful and I suspect that the film and indeed her book glosses over some things - after all, who could be critical of a man who has suffered so much?I watched this film in an excellent VUE cinema with a 4K Sony projector, and the images shot by Benoît Delhomme on the Alexa were beautiful and very subtle. A few close-up shots suffered from poor focus and others from clumsy focus-pulling but in an average cinema I doubt anyone would notice. His colour palette and the colour grading was very clever - quite a bright sunny almost Kodachrome look which contrasted with Steven's terrible disease but fitted with his amazing smile. This is a very good film indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The theory of nothing,"This is a typical biographic film, which almost entirely focuses on the leading actor's performance, just physically trying to portray Steven Hawking, which was as exhausting for the actor as for me watching him. There is not a serious plot here, just a couple having problems concerning this serious disease. Steven Hawking's scientific brilliance was only an asterisk, as the film fails miserably to highlight the importance of his achievements, leaving people asking ""Why is this person even considered to be a ground- breaking scientist?"". Just a couple of abstract speeches and, Boom! he becomes famous all over the world and respected by his peers. The love story was very soft and even shallow because in the end both admitted not to love each other anymore and went their separate ways, which i think nobody expects in this kind of dramatic situations. I have to say, even though i hate biographical films, i was expecting to watch a good film in this one, but honestly there is NOTHING to keep.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Heavy cinema with a side of science,"As a glamorized story of perseverance saddled with romance, ""The Theory of Everything"" is a success. At the core this is a dramatization that makes for an emotional journey deliberating the weight of belief in several aspects. No one should judge this as if it ought to be a wealth of information to students of science. If you want facts, do research; don't fall back on drama. At times it was hard to watch; for me that made it more affective. Occasionally cliche, though I expected that. While I would recommend this to select people I am unlikely to revisit it myself. One only needs so much romantic drama, even if it has a few more elements to offer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Affecting story,"For many of us, Stephen Hawking is that old guy in the wheelchair, and has always been that old guy in a wheelchair, but it turns out he was once a young guy on a bicycle who fell in love and got married. And he's British, which one never realizes from his computer voice.Theory of Everything shows Hawking's brutal physical deterioration in the context of his marriage. Eddie Redmayne is impressive in expressing that deterioration while still showing the man trapped in an increasingly uncooperative body. Eventually he has little to work with as an actor besides his eyes and lips, but he does a lot with those.It's the sort of performance that always wins Oscars (Hollywood loves a good disability acting job) but honestly I was more impressed by Felicity Jones, who expressed a steely, quiet determination and, as the movie progressed, increasing frustration. Often she isn't given much more to work with than Redmayne, being asked to tell the story with her eyes, and she does so marvelously. Even though the movie is ostensibly about Hawking, it feels like it's at least as much her story as his (not surprising, since much of it is based on her book).While the story is often touching and absorbing, the writers ultimately couldn't figure out how to end it. The movie has two scenes that feel like endings, one at a Q&A and the actual ending, but both feel like they're struggling to create a profound moment out of fairly ordinary moments. For me the lackluster ending lessens the overall impact of the movie; a good ending would have made this an 8 instead of a 7.After watching the movie I read an interesting article on Slate on how accurate this was. Overall reasonably accurate, although it sounds like the real Hawkings was a bit more of a pain than the fluffy fictional one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Truly Inspiring!,"A truly mesmerising performance from Eddie Redmayne, who must have studied every detail to honour the now, late Stephen Hawking.Such an insight into his relentless attitude in the face of adversity, with humour kept intact, it truly proves into some of the most private matters of his life story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Some great performances make this run of the mill biopic stand out,"It's surprising that it's taken such a long time for a high profile cinematic version of the life and times of famed author/scientist/mathematician Stephen Hawking to be made into a feature film and thankfully the end product is a very fine telling of an aspect of Hawking's life that many would've never even considered, that of his relationship with his once long serving wife Jane. Under the assured hands of Man on Wire documentarian turned feature director James Marsh, The Theory of Everything (based on Jane Hawking's autobiography) is a fine film without being a must see one.The recipient of 5 Oscar nominations it's not hard to see why Theory has been such a success with Academy voters. From the films well designed pallet, two fantastic lead turns with a career defining one from Eddie Redmayne as Hawking and with a lovely original score from Johann Johannsson, Theory screams quality in a productions sense yet can't quite overcome it's at basis nature the feeling of a TV movie of the week production. There is nothing overly grand on display here and those looking to get an insight into the mind of man far above normal intelligence despite his psychical inhibitions should look elsewhere, as while the works of Hawking play apart here the focus remains largely on the trials and tribulations of Stephen and Jane's marriage and the strain that was heaped upon them both in many aspects from the horrible onset of ALS.James Marsh succeeds greatly in his treatment of Hawking's dealings with this inhumane disease and not once does any situation that Hawking faces with his body failing feel over the top or played for pity votes and that is largely due also to the films constrained and respectful lead performances from two of the industry's most impressive young talents.In a role that has rightfully seen him nominated in most major award ceremonies around the world Redmayne is near unrecognisable as Hawking and displays a finely tuned acting power to be able to disappear into a man we are all so well accustomed to seeing, so much so that you begin to forget this is in fact not Hawking himself. In a less noticeable but no less powerful role Felicity Jones has gone on with the strength of acting shown in lesser known films and come full circle with a matured and naturalistic turn as Jane. Jane is the one we come out of the movie feeling most for and that is in no short way due to Jones's believable and commanding turn. Stephen and Jane's love story is one that can become quite awkward and at times utterly inspiring and these two performers nail it completely.The Theory of Everything is a very watchable and at times moving experience but perhaps its greatest failings is that it's a film we knew we were seeing before we had in fact seen it. Nothing much occurs here that we can't have predicted, situations play out like the rule book set before it and everything feels a little to ""nice"" in a way that surely can't have been the case in real life. A very interesting look into the life of a man we may never have thought of as one of us and with two great lead turns, this is a movie well worth your time but I'd suspect its appearance in this year's Oscars will be an unfruitful one despite its award worthy lead turns.3 and a half magazine subscriptions out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

"The Untold Chapters of the Hawking Saga - The Complexities of Lives of Jane and Stephen Hawking Lost in the movie 'Travelling to Infinity'""","This is a movie based on a book by Jane Hawking, the wife of the famous Stephen Hawking. However, since I watched it after reading the book, I can say this movie is an easy, romantic, and cheaper construction of their lives. What they went through together is much more layered, nuanced, unbelievable, and difficult than the movie portrays. I believe three movies could be made because this movie only shallowly touched on the three main powerful stories that could be extracted from their lives.One story is, of course, that of Stephen's brilliant mind and the discoveries he achieved, regardless of his difficulty in writing, speaking, and communicating. This would be a story of one man's quest to discover one mathematical equation that describes the whole universe, and inside it would be an answer about where we come from and where we go, intertwined with the philosophy of existence and his own wife's spiritual beliefs. This could be a truly intriguing movie to watch.The other story is that of a life with disability and ignorance of national health systems, of the most severely disabled persons. This is a story not only of the lack of medical treatment when you are not rich and not having rich supporters or inaccessibility of working and living spaces but also of the closest family making a weekend house inaccessible for their son. It's about the huge painful living the disabled person goes through when the nursing systems and truthfully unwanted outsiders in the form of carers and assistants become 24h/day intruders in the house. They wouldn't be friends otherwise, but now they have an entrance into the most intimate private ways of a person or, in this case, of a whole family. They can destroy your family by manipulation, emotional blackmail, and putting themselves before everyone else in the household, just because they are necessary and in the position to do so, as if this family is there for them and not vice versa. I myself continuously experience the intrusion of persons in my life who should be of help and assistance, but at the same time, too many of them feel invited to judge my way of living and my morals. This comes from people who have questionable morals and ways of living themselves. Not to mention those who would easily steal things from the house just because they know where every single thing is. The notion that even the most famous disabled persons experience this comes to me as a terribly sad realization. Posing for photos and cameras beside me when I travel around the world for art festivals and being part of this visual documentation to be shared on social platforms and media is a way for these poor persons to grab a little attention for themselves, as if taking credit for something that a disabled person achieved. This is a reason why Stephen, when receiving accolades from the queen or different awards, even after divorce from Jane, invited her to escort him as a token that she actually deserves to be in these photos and these events recognizing his achievements.Another possible movie is, of course, about love and marriage and all the difficulties that it goes through when two people love each other but lose each other through the ways of difficulty, illness, career, social circumstances, family influence, ""carers"" manipulations, and in the end different needs and different ways of approaching saving their individual selves from insanity.So, read a book, and then watch a movie just to witness the marvelous Oscar-winning acting of Eddie Redmayne. I will not go now into the justification of choosing a non-disabled actor for this role because this is another huge topic, and it's a thin line, walking on the triangle sides of positive discrimination versus profitability versus ignoring, i.e., negative discrimination of minority groups in the art world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Life of a scientific celebrity,"The year 2014 has brought us two popular movies dedicated to the lives of prominent scientists - 'The Imitation Game' about Alan Turing and 'The Theory of Everything' about Stephen Hawking. While the impression is still fresh, there's a big temptation to compare them both to each other and look for similarities. Yet, honestly, i could hardly name two seemingly similar films that are as distinct as these two.As i wrote in a separate review for 'The Imitation Game', it generally follows the steps of 'A Beautiful Mind', in a way that the hero is doomed to struggle, and no achievements or scientific success have a chance to bring him peace or happiness. The whole life of Alan Turing is shown as a fight with everything that's around him: bullying fellow students, impatient and short-sighted bosses, hypocritical society etc.On the other hand, in 'The Theory of Everything' we are given a completely opposite picture. The main character, who looks like a hipster male model, receives nothing but praise and love from everyone around him: hot girls swoon at first sight of him, colleagues and mentors only worship him for his bold endeavors with no sign of envy or disgruntlement whatsoever, the society is ecstatic whenever he makes a public appearance, random guys lend a helping hand acting like a non-staff nurse just simply because being near Hawking gives purpose to their lives. Even the queen of England wants to see him.All this is rather cloying. The movie portrays Stephen Hawking as some sort of a superhero prodigy who's the first at everything and is never wrong. It completely obscures the truth of his life, like that several of his bold theories were outright wrong, which he was annoyed to admit, and that his main scientific achievement - the Hawking radiation - still haven't been proved to exist, while the Higgs Boson, the subatomic particle whose existence he denied, was actually found.Just as real-life Stephen Hawking, the movie image of him suffers from the celebrity status. In the movie, his father tells him that he is world-famous. ""For black holes, not for rock concerts"", Stephen replies. But still the film makes a rock star out of him, focusing only on the strong sides of his life and completely striking out the rest.The filmmakers might have thought that Hawking's disability is enough of a downside to go with it alone. Indeed, Eddie Redmayne's performance of a man gradually losing control over his own body was brilliant, and there is no doubt that he deserved the Oscar he received for this role. But at the same time i can't help thinking that the way 'The Theory of Everything' portrays the life of a person with ALS is oversweetened and even cynical. There's no doubt about Stephen Hawking's suffering from it. However, he is constantly surrounded by people who view taking care of him as a source of joy rather than a burden, who literally ""worship the ground beneath his wheels"". I'm quite certain that a life of a regular person, neither wealthy nor famous, who suffers from the same illness is infinitely more gritty and dramatic.While 'The Theory of Everything' is a decent and captivating movie, it ultimately fails to go beyond the already existing myth of Stephen Hawking and to show some less glorious sides of his life and personality. And it's just too bad, because, in an ever expanding Universe, a public image of its Master would definitely benefit from some expanding too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

A Brief History Of Stephen & Jane Hawking,"There's an image that we have of Stephen Hawking: basically, a brilliant man trapped in a useless body. To know all that he's accomplished given the obvious challenges and limitations that he faces is in itself inspiring. And, clearly, in spite of it all, he has a sense of humour. This may seem silly, but one thing that I truly admire about him is that he sometimes appears on ""The Big Bang Theory"" - surely one of the silliest (and, yes, best) shows on television. But there's a lot about Stephen Hawking that I didn't know. I, like many I've talked to, thought his disability had been from birth. I honestly never realized that he had married and had children. I found that ""The Theory Of Everything"" put a very human face to this man who seems, somehow, different than the rest of us - more limited in some ways, far superior in other ways. As a brief history of the life of the author of ""A Brief History Of Time,"" this movie worked very well.Not just brilliant, Hawking is a very complex man, with a very complicated personal history. The movie begins with him falling in love, and more or less ends with the end of his (first) marriage. The relationship between Stephen and Jane starts as a truly simple romance of two people who just find each other. It becomes a true love story as Stephen begins to decline physically and is diagnosed with ALS and given two years to live. It then becomes a story of devotion as Jane cares for him and encourages him in his work. There's then the sad and tragic end as the love Stephen and Jane have for each other isn't enough to keep them together. It is, in fact, a brief but well done account of Hawking's life and of Jane and Stephen's relationship.The lead performances from Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones as Stephen and Jane are superb. Redmayne especially seemed to capture Stephen Hawking, which must have been a difficult acting job, trying to capture the reality of Hawkings' physical decline.The only real weakness I saw in this was that it jumped into the love story too quickly. I thought we could have been offered a bit more of a glimpse of Hawking's early life, which might have made for a fuller character study. But what we do see here is fascinating. The movie is both sad and inspiring, and sometimes both at the same time - which is a rather difficult balance to achieve. ""The Theory Of Everything"" pulls that off well.

A good insight!,"Very good account of the private life of Stephen Hawking and his first wife. The pace of the story flows well. The acting depicts the era very well with the very reserved attitude towards sex by people with this type of background. Stephen Hawking is an incredible man both physically and mentally. His concepts of Physics go way over my head. But the movie doesn't concentrate too much on the scientific side, it's more about their relationship. The make up team have done an incredible job making Eddie Redmayne look like Stephen Hawking! I do have one criticism, and that is I don't feel the movie truly portrayed the difficulty his wife had to take care of him and bring up three children at the same time. Surely, she had more help than was depicted in the movie? Having worked myself with severely physically disabled people, I know just exactly how hard the work is.

A Superb Biography of Stephen Hawking,"""The Theory of Everything"" chronicles the personal life of the renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, who was diagnosed with motor neuron disease in his early age which left him paralyzed for rest of the life yet overwhelmed the world with his work. Rather than his scientific discoveries, the film is more on the personal/ family life of Stephen Hawking, based on the memoir written by his first wife. Jane Hawking, also a phd holder in literature, in her book ""Traveling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen.""The film is more on the perseverance of a wife on holding the family together pertaining to coping the disease which left her husband paralyzed aside raising her three children and carrying her own thesis. In a way the film inspires to battle against the normalcy of life. The film in its way stands an excellent reference work on a great personality. Although it feels a bit slow in its execution, it's a very well made film with excellent performances and a superb background score.

It was just a montage of clichéd moments meant to pull at your heartstrings, dripping in sentimentality and yet I had no reasons to be emotionally invested in the characters-- they were all portrayed as foolish and unkind. What an incredible story this is based on. Even just reading the Wikipedia entry about Hawking is excited. This Hollywood production, however, is another story. Luckily we were the only ones in the theatre and so we could talk aloud about how bad it was, which made it a little more bearable, a la Mystery Science Theatre. Hands down, however, the best part of the movie was when we left- halfway through.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A wonderful biographical drama,"Where do I begin? The big bang? (Just kidding). It's an inspirational film throughout. It's about a brilliant gentleman despite suffering from motor neuron disease, trying to lead a normal life through sheer determination towards his work, with a great sense of humour and a wonderful caring wife.The film is more about Dr. Hawking's personal life and love story than his professional achievements. Most of you would have heard about him, his disease and his achievements but unless you have read much about his personal life, I doubt that you would know all that he and his wife went through trying to lead a life.Eddie Redmayne rightfully deserved the Oscar he won for his performance as Dr. Hawking. You feel for the character all the time. There are quite a few moments in the film which may make you cry or at least give you goosebumps. Felicity Jones has done a wonderful job too. With each passing moment you get closer to the characters. You understand why they do what they do. The rest of the cast is also good.Never once throughout the film you will feel bored or that the story is being dragged on. It's not a thriller but it definitely manages to keep you hooked. It inspires you, makes you realize that you are capable of doing much more than what you have done and yet you have done so little (no offense to anyone). I personally felt honoured to get to know this great person through this great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A Drama Internalized,"I think Director James Marsh is successful in creating a drama out of pure internalization. Not a scene is this film that emotions are so visible. We do not see, but feel so much. This is why a film without so much plot can get away to become an art piece. What is best in this film is the sense of restraint, owing, I believe, to Mr. Marsh. He must have directed Eddy Redmayne and the rest of the cast to feel first and act later. Probably an act is not necessary, if you feel so accurately. I am always marveled by the English school of acting. Big or small screens. They do wonders with the mundane of lives in particular. While Americans look for something extraordinary, English instead eye for the normality, which always turns out to be not so normal. Professor Hawking, as well as his beloved Jane, come alive in this film. They are actually alive, and this film will ensure that they are, even after they no longer are. A scene of their breakup is amazing. Loving, painful, understanding, and heartbreaking. How can four feelings be incorporated into one scene, I still wonder? That's life, isn't it? Bittersweet at best, and always conflictual at extremes. If there is a caution for Eddy Redmayne, it is by way of being tied to the same or similar character. Felicity Jones, on the other hand, will continue to be versatile and multi-purposed. The Oscar-winning brand can also be a curse, one of which I wish all the best for our dear Mr. Redmayne.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Phenomenal acting!,"I laugh at the reviews that complain of the incorporation of ""very little science"". Have a look at the synopsis before watching the movie - it is about the relationship between Hawking and his wife. It is not about his role in science. Sure, science is sprinkled in there simply because he was a scientist, but that was not the goal for this film.Having known somebody who passed from Lou Gehrig's Disease, this was a heartbreaking movie to watch at times. Even so, it was also inspiring. Of course without significant in-depth research of his personal life and struggle with the disease, I don't know how spot-on facts are, but given Stephen Hawking's accomplishments in the field of physics, I imagine the dedication in his personal life is not far off here.Eddie Redmayne's performance was incredible - I can't imagine it is easy to capture the physical deterioration of Lou Gehrig's Disease. It is not surprising he won an Oscar for this role. If you have any interest in the field of science and/or history and appreciate phenomenal acting, this is for you - Fantastic movie! They even throw in some bits or comedy here and there.Though I do not agree with or believe in his atheism, I still enjoyed this movie because both God and science do exist, and there is something to be said about his brilliant mind (when it comes to science). This part of his life was briefly touched upon a few times in this movie.So why not a 10/10? I have a movie rating system and this simply fits the criteria of a 7 for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

"Incredible performances, and an interesting character","When you make a biopic of someone who is still alive, it is extra challenging to keep the balance what is true, and what is glorified. And when you make a movie that cover a number of years, you're going to have to make some shortcuts.The scenes in this movie that were done for exposition or explaining difficult concepts worked quite well, and while you know it's one of those aforementioned shortcuts, they do not break the flow of the movie at all, or take you out of the realism.The story is a great one, and one that needed to be told. Because of his illness and his genius, it is difficult to understand Stephen Hawking as ""just another guy"" - but this movie shows us how he struggles with the same emotions as the rest of us. And he shows a difficult relationship in a way that respects both parties.That said, I do wish they could have explained Hawking's importance in the world of physics a bit more, as the movie shows that he is talented, but does not really delve into his talent.The main attraction in this movie is the acting. Redmayne's performance seems to be spot on. You realize from the moment he moves that he is the perfect choice. Felicity Jones did a great job too, balancing the emotions of the character. The rest of the cast had good performances too, but maybe less to work with.One thing that was a bit odd was the colors. I'm not into the lingo of this, but it was almost like the whole movie had been run through an instagram filter, which was a bit jarring at times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A wonderful and emotional account of the life of an inspiring genius.,"Stephen Hawking is an inspiring figure in field of science. His perspective about the mysteries in our boundless universe have been always hugely thought provoking at least for me. But evidently here emphasis on the scientific aspect is far less compared to the drama and romance. Still watching sensational genius fight the motor-neuron disease struggling to keep up his social life was soul-stirring. Eddie Redmayne's performance is mind-blowing, both physically and sentimentally.The movie's main focus is the relationship between Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and his wife Jane (Felicity Jones). It opens up in 1963, when Stephen and Jane first meet. The romance is very refreshing, credits to the outstanding acting by both the lead plus the beautiful background score. Stephen's ultimate goal was to deduce an equation that would explain all the mysteries of the universe and its functioning which he termed as 'Theory of Everything'. His path unfortunately hits a huge bump when he is diagnosed with motor-neuron disease which slowly paralyzes his whole body. Jane still loved Stephen for the person he was, giving faith and hope to him and they both get married. Doctors had earlier predicted Stephen would only live 2 years after the onset of the disease yet Stephen determinedly outruns that time (Well at 72 today he is still devoted with science). Jane is struggling to manage their lives with Stephen's disability. After this it gets slightly overdrawn with all the drama in their married life. The science and romantic aspect of the films are highly enjoyable while the drama felt a bit bland. Fortunately it reverts back to science in the ending where Stephen is giving a talk and then following with a beautiful rewind into the his back to time he first met Jane. It was so mesmerizing.Theory of Everything is not perfect. The performances by it leads overpowers the script adapted from Jane's biography. Now I have not read the book, so I can't have a good perspective on that. Felicity Jones as Jane is very charming and lovely, some may find the decisions she took a bit faulty but one must try to understand about the situation she was in. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Stephen Hawking is definitely going down as one of best performances in recent times.Wow such great acting seen in 2014. Will be tough-fight at the awards. The lovely score consisting mostly of piano is simplistic still engrossing. The many moments where Stephen struggles with his disability were tear inducing. Even if I wished there was more science stuff included, I would say enjoyed it more considering it as romantic story. This films romance is much better than many romance films we get in recent times. Not forgetting its flaws, The Theory of Everything may not be the best films of the year. It definitely was a wonderful,emotional and inspiring experience.RATING: [3.5/5]",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
No Deeper than a Shallow Weeper,"Eddie Redmayne arguably Deserved the Oscar for Portraying Stephen Hawking in the Film, but that is where the Applauding Stops. This is one of the most Disappointing Films of Recent Years.The Movie of the Week Story, is so Familiar because it has been Done so Many Times it's a Staple of the Inspirational, Highly Emotional, and Touching Stories of a Handicapped Person that Overcomes all the Odds and Survives and Flourishes Despite Overwhelming Obstacles.But the Twist here is that this Person is a Genius and one of the Best Minds of Our Time. But His Particular Gift is in Physics and Cosmology and We get very Little Exploration of the Brilliance that made Hawking the Talk of the Scientific Community.It's like a Tarzan Movie that Focuses on Jane and tells of Her Trials of being In Love with an Anomaly. OK, but it Ignores the Elephant in the Room.So Ignoring the Elephant, the Film is a somewhat Interesting Love Story, but the Movie Decides it is the Only Story to be Told about this Brilliant Man and the Wife that Stood by His Wheelchair Until She Didn't. The Movie is a Deceit and Never Tries to get into Stephen's Head, and that's where the Gold is.So We don't Discover much about His Treasured Intellect or His Work and its Effect on His Peers and Scientific Community in General, or Why He is so Revered as an Innovator of Thought. His Breakthroughs are so Glossed Over that the Filmmakers must have Thought it was Beyond the Comprehension of Us Average Humans.How are We Seekers going to Learn about Complex Things if They are Withheld like some sort of Sacred Fruit Fit Only for the Gods. The Audience is Given a Glimpse of the Apple but are Never Allowed Close Enough to Take a Bite.Overall, it s basically a Bio-Pic-Chick-Flick and a Family Friendly Foray that is a Weeper, Withdrawn, and Frustrating the way it Hints at One Thing and Shows Us Another. For a Movie about a Deep Thinker, this one Turns Out to be a Shallow Stinker.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
One of the best acting of all I've watched,"To be honest, I'm not much of a fan of a biographical film. The narrative tends to be linear and simple. Without strong writing, it will be a collection of small episodes over long span of lifetime. In addition, 'The Theory of Everything' is about one of the world's best scientists, so it will talk about science to some extent even though it puts more weight on his degrading health condition, romance & marriage, and family. However, imagification of science in the movies helps audience understand the concept Hawking tries to explain. Stephen and Jane holding hands and spinning, cream swirling into the center of the cup of tea, and flames burning in the fireplace through the holes of the sweater all illustrate the black hole. It is the difficult concept, but viewers can draw images of what it is after the movie. Jane citing the Genesis is a great analogy to Hawking's concept of time. He wanted to find the beginning of the time as well.I cannot compliment enough the performance of two protagonists. Felicity Jones expresses Jane Hawking's loyalty, love, dedication to family, and faith so well and so delicately. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Stephen Hawking well deserved Oscar, one of the best performances in the whole films. He is Stephen Hawking himself on the screen for sure, expressing longing and desire for good health and not losing humor amidst struggles.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

"It's no rocket science, its love story & story that inspires!","The movie more than achievements of Stephen hawking is about his personnel life. How he got into wheel chair, his love life and his children. His first wife was a woman who had Faith. Hawking on the other hand was an Athiest. It takes faith and commitment to last this long. I mean till the time their marriage lasted.Hawking was a great person as well. When life threw a bouncer at him in 1963 (diagnosed with degenerative nerve disorder ALS) when he was 21 years old he fought with it. Doctors gave him a few months but he fought till his death in 1918 when he was 76 years old. He inspires a lot of us via that.He wrote a few books and was said to be greatest scientist of his - our time.

The story is very dramatic, but never lets you be bored, or gets dull. The music really plays on the scene and triggers all of your emotions for you to really feel the characters journey.This film has also done what many and i really mean most fail, and that is show the struggle and emotional ride that we call love. When watching the film you sorry for Jane and even understand her want and desire to still be loved and touched, and for some reason when you see the connection with Jonathon, you almost want it to happen. There is nothing awful or ""Cheat"" or cheap about it, and most films when trying to show the whole ""Burning candle"" of love from when it is lit-ten to when it is blown out, always makes one person seem cheap, or dirty or bad and make you hate them.

Interesting Depiction of Hawking's LIFE,"As a love story and depiction of the personal life of Stephen Hawking, it works very well, but if you are looking for the story of Hawking's work, this is not the movie for you. Although some of this is depicted in the movie, the majority of it focuses on Hawking's disability and the difficulty of his marriage. But the movie does succeed in the fact that I was entertained throughout and the story is very well told. Definitely Oscar-worthy performances by Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, too. And I think I might just be in love with Felicity Jones OMG she is gorgeous. There are also some scenes that could actually make you cry, man. Stuff gets intense pretty quickly. In the end I will say The Theory of Everything succeeds at what it sets out to do and is a pretty good time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Reel Look: 'The Theory of Everything',"""There should be no boundaries to human endeavor. We are all different. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope."" From British director James Marsh's definitive storytelling (Man on Wire) and from former wife of Hawking's Jane Wilde's book 'Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen' unfolds the beautiful, bittersweet tale of an extraordinary human being with an extraordinary mind of whom would revolutionize the world of theoretical physiology and cosmology as we know it and of whom cherished life's most precious gift: time itself. Does time play a main character in and of itself as does Redmayne Dr. Hawking? Let's take a look.Dr. Stephen Hawking is played to a demanding, poignant and nuanced perfection by a bravura performance delivered by Eddie Redmayne (Les Misérables). From prestigious beginnings at Cambridge University in the early 1960's, to falling in love with the beautiful church-going Jane Wilde played by Felicity Jones (The Amazing Spider-Man 2) to encountering Lou Gehrig's disease later on, he earns his doctorate in cosmetology, marries and becomes a father, only being told by a doctor he had two years left to live. Through this, we with Hawking begin to see and sense the world as he does for the two hours we spend with him: we laugh, we emote concern and get a lump in our throats when we see this unshakable human being embrace his fate and choose to live even more so than ever before. His wife also chooses to love him despite what is going to take over his body, but raising children and taking care of his personal needs grows wearisome. Help comes in the form of a church choir leader named Jonathan Hellyer Jones(Charlie Cox), a kindly man of whom lost his wife to leukemia a year prior. Eventually he becomes as one of the members of the Hawking family, teaching the children piano to sharing a holiday on the beach through a voyeur's eye of a Super 8 lens. Though permanently confined in a wheelchair with his condition worsening, and with only an American computer to speak for him after his voice is lost due to muscle tissue damage in the throat, Hawking decides to write his bestseller A Brief History of Time. He goes to America with his personal nurse Elaine,leaving Jane to stay with Jonathan, of which they started showing mutual feelings towards each other and would prefer the children have a new father who will help Jane with her tasks in parenthood as well. Despite all the fame and fortune one could ever receive in a lifetime, no one can ever buy back the untouchable, vast entity that is time. We either have too much or either too little. It is invisible yet all around us at every waking moment. Though we can never touch or grab more in our clutches and store it away in a vault for the future, through the bespectacled ""always dirty"" but rose-colored glasses, Hawking can smile despite his disease and accepts it for what it is, as we do when we watch him conjugate ineffable theoretic notions of galaxies and black holes while also keeping an edge of humor to nourish and enlighten the lives and souls of those and around him. In this bittersweet story of love, loss and life itself, time does indeed have its way of changing the world and people around us, but is never able to penetrate the will of appreciating every moment for what it is truly worth. So...'A Beautiful Mind' meets 'My Left Foot'? Maybe, maybe not. For me, spending two hours in a theater watching the life a paralyzed genius unfold was a very brief history in time indeed, but a truly memorable one spent at that, and, at age 73, the life of Dr. Hawking still continues to go onward even still.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"This is your film if you said ""Stephen Who?""","I had such high hopes for this film, yet somehow managed a few years without watching it. Definitely not worth the buildup.I wanted to see more about his mind, his theories... how he worked, where he struggled, whom he interacted with, etc... Yes, I'm a physicist and I realize that a lot of it would have to be simplified for lay people, but to resort to Hollywood tropes of genius, fancy impressive equations on a chalkboard. It was like nails on a ... well, you know. The content of his life and work took a backstage to such a ridiculously diluted version of the relationships that it made me wonder why in the galaxy did they bother.Don't come for the bulk of the screen time (about Jane Hawking) or you'll be disappointed, too. The film reduced her massive care-taking role to one scene of exhaustion. The rest of the relationship - and others - are diluted to the point of misrepresentation if not near-fiction. Every emotional conflict follows the script of ""now weep with love in your eyes."" There's no dimension, no nuance, just caricatured human tolerance.I gave it 3 stars instead of fewer because Theory was a watchable movie while I did cardio in the gym. (Don't let that fool you into thinking I did 2 hours of cardio; it was easy to walk away from and start again the next day.) The acting itself wasn't painful and if I could pretend it was a fiction it was decent. I think I also clung onto hope it could get better. Sadly, the juice never came out of the squeeze.This is Hollywood loving itself, using famous people to do it... good looking famous people, of course...",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

While there is life there is hope,"In 2014 a new film ""The theory of everything"" came out. It was directed by James Marsh and if only I didn't watch this film, maybe I haven't ever hear about him. The main roles were played by Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking and Felicity Jones as his wife Jane. This film is based on the Jane's novel ""Traveling to Infinity:My life with Stephen"". You know, Jane refused for three years to screen her book. In this film we can see first Jane's and Stephen's meeting and evolution of their love. In my opinion this film is full of feelings. Some people like to compare this film and another with Benedict Cumberbutch, but I think it is silly, because ""Hawking"" (2004) is about science. I think, the main point in this film is Stephen's discovery about black holes, little time is allotted for Jane. And another situation in this film is that Jane is the main character, after Stephen of course. James Marsh's movie allows us to look at family life. Eddie Redmayen is a good actor. His reincarnation into the famous physicist is worthy to see: his mimics, his actions. You must see this. The camera-work was sometimes fantastic, but another moment are not so good. In some scenes you can feel the whole tragedy or importance of actions. Some moment were funny and some - sad. Also there are some minuses in this film. For example: the camera-work or actors works, in some moments. In conclusion I want to say, that I like this film and I will watch it again.P. S. Costumes are great! Time rules are complied.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Perfect Casting.,"The Theory of Everything is a perfect example for perfect casting. Eddie Redmayne as well as Felicity Jones, Charlie Cox and David Thewlis (for me the most important actors in this movie), play overwhelmingly perfect and natural. Throughout the whole movie, you have the feeling of watching family tapes of the Hawkings family. The film also creates a wonderful, emotional atmosphere which makes it even more compelling. Another reason why i gave 10/10 points, is the breathtaking score by the Icelandic Johann Johannsson. Especially ""Arrival of the Birds"" will give you chills. So all in all a very well deserved Oscar win for Eddie Redmayne who portrayed Mr. Hawking perfectly good and made a job, which may seem impossible, perfectly good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Fine performances in a good biopic that can't match the brilliance of its subject.,"Arriving amongst much fanfare and hype surrounding possible Oscar nominations and a predicted avalanche of gold, The Theory of Everything set a lofty benchmark for itself and expectations were incredibly high prior to the screening.So did it meet those expectations? The short answer is ""No"", but that doesn't mean it is a poor film, only that those anticipating perfection and something truly outstanding will feel a little disappointed.There are few in the western world who are not aware of Professor Stephen Hawking and the impact he had on the scientific world with his multi-million-selling book, A Brief History of Time, even if they know little about his own history or that of his wife and support, Jane. If nothing else, Professor Hawking has touched the lives of the ignorant masses (and I count myself amongst them) through his omnipresence in contemporary entertainment such as Pink Floyd's Keep Talking, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Futurama, The Big Bang Theory, The SimpsonsThe Theory of Everything is a classic biopic précising the remarkable life of a modern genius from his academic career at Cambridge, through the onset and development of his life-defining motor neuron disease (or more specifically, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis aka Lou Gehrig's disease) and his personal relationships with Mary, their children and the staff and students at Cambridge.A glance through Hawking's achievements makes it abundantly clear that a detailed analysis of his life would be both too long and excruciatingly dull for most of us, and so director James Marsh (Man on Wire, Project Nim) has sifted the sparkling elements to forge a film that enthralls and delights whilst, apparently, remaining largely faithful for the source material, Jane Hawking's book, Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen.The two central performances are, indeed, outstanding. Eddie Redmayne is on a career high as Hawking with an empathetic turn that pours anguish and steely determination onto the screen filtered through a gauze of classic 'Englishness'. It is a performance that it is impossible not to admire for the control and subtlety in portraying such a pronounced disability and if 2011's My Week with Marilyn suggested stardom, The Theory of Everything pretty much confirms it.As his wife, Mary, Felicity Jones is equally absorbing and commands the screen every bit as much as Redmayne. Come award season, though both may land Oscar nominations, I predict a greater chance of success for Jones in the Best Supporting Actress category than for Redmayne as he, surely, jostles with Michael Keaton and Steve Carell.Though The Theory of Everything is an extremely good film with some fine performances throughout, there is nothing remarkable, nothing that grabs the viewer by the throat, forces tears or leaves one wanting more or repeat viewings. It is another very good film that, come year's end, the viewer will vaguely recall seeing and enjoying but about which is unable to remember specifics. There is nothing really obvious to point at and say ""Oh dear"" about; it's just that there isn't enough, it lacks that extra fire in its belly that the fanfare promised.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Stephen and Jane,"Most negative comments on The Theory of Everything are based on a misunderstanding. The movie's point is not to present Stephen Hawking as a scientist, that would be rather dull and difficult to follow except for a very specific target group. Its interest lies in Stephen Hawking as a human being, how his disease affected his life and especially his relationship/marriage with Jane. At its core, it's a romance. If that's not what you are looking for, that's ok - it's not my favourite genre either - but don't expect something different or you will be disappointed.The scenes where we watch the disease progress and the symptoms worsen are nicely done, they are painful to watch but they don't overdo it and it's more effective this way.The main reason this movie works is the two leads. One simply can't deny the brilliant performance by Eddie Redmayne who becomes Stephen Hawking, a well-deserved Oscar win. Felicity Jones also does a great job as Jane Hawking.The Theory of Everything excels in the artistic department, too. It's visually striking, a prime example would be the scene where Stephen takes Jane to the ball. The colous, the lights, the fireworks, it's a delight.The music is also really emotional.If there's a complaint to be made, it's one from which many biographies suffer, namely that they try to cover too much ground in too little time. As a result, some events are rushed and not given enough detail or depth, such as the gradual collapse of their marriage, though it's possible they didn't want to paint either of them with excessively negative colours and decided to play it safe instead, only hinting at the bad stuff. Also, the viewer loses the sense of time -the irony- as it's hard to tell in which year the depicted events take place.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"Good, but surprisingly bland","Unfortunately, I'm not sure what The Theory of Everything is about. It ventures many places but arrives nowhere. Everything seems to be in place. The acting is some of the best I've ever seen and the musical score is fitting. Nothing comes across to me as sappy in the entire running time of the film. Still, I am left empty.Maybe the blandness of the film is derived from the fact that Hawking is not yet dead. Maybe, if he was it would be easier to pinpoint exactly what his life was about. Instead, we are left with a film about theories and scientific discoveries but are also left absolutely clueless as to what they are about. Personally, I do not know much about Hawking, but this film did not succeed in making me any more interested in researching him.Don't get me wrong. This is a very good film. It takes the viewer on a real journey and gently presses you to feel. Can we live with ourselves? If we had to carefully select our words, as Hawking does, would we have anything to say? I believe each of us would live much differently if we were truly grateful for what we have. I don't think anyone realizes this as much as Dr. Hawking.Overall, a well-deserved Oscar for Redmayne.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Two against the odds,"A filmed biography of Stephen Hawking was inevitable. A genius of cosmology and quantum gravity, he was one of the rare scientists to have acquired great public notoriety. Knowing moreover with which valor this exceptional being, supported by his loving wife, resisted the ravages of Lou Gehrig's disease, the novelistic side was guaranteed. It resulted in James Marsh's « The Theory of Everything"", not an exceedingly original work but quite a satisfying one for all that. It certainly deals only superficially with hard sciences, but could it be otherwise in a work intended for the general public? Inspired by Jane Hawking's book, the screenwriter Anthony McCracken has chosen - and rightly so - the only possible angle, that of the personal story of Stephen and Jane, closely united as they were in their struggle against an adverse fate. Thus considered, this ""The Theory of Everything"" proves to be as edifying as touching, thanks in particular to its two actors, Eddie Redmayne, amazing in his evocation of the physical deterioration of his character, and Felicity Jones, knowing how to ally the energy of the fighter to the expression of the unconditional love. Overall, not too much pathos, and even some humor. With such a potentially lachrymal subject, the finished product could have been worse, much worse.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"For Hawking, everything has its theory, but love does not.","The focus of the film is not Hawking's scientific achievements, but his life and emotions.

Personal story of Stephen Hawking,The depiction of Stephen Hawking was very detailed and authentic in this film. It is a very personal film and covers many time periods of his life rather than particular events or achievements. The acting was great and the story was emotional.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Perfect!,"The film offers a profound exploration of Stephen Hawking's life. Eddie Redmayne's compelling performance captures both his scientific genius and his relentless battle with ALS. The story delicately balances Hawking's revolutionary contributions to theoretical physics with his personal relationships, inviting viewers to explore the boundaries of science and the human spirit. Director James Marsh handles the challenges and triumphs of Hawking's life with sincerity.

It has its own humor as well so it's not all sadness.Even Stephen Hawkings voice was used for the speech parts.A must watch.

How an atheist can get you thinking about God and creation,"""There should be no boundaries to human endeavour. We are all different. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope."" - Stephen HawkingWho is Stephen Hawking? If you have to ask, you have not been paying attention for the past few decades. He is the world renowned physicist, cosmologist and author of A Brief History of Time and The Theory of Everything. Yet, what makes his life fascinating to those outside of the scientific world is that he contracted motor neurone disease (Lou Gehrig's Disease) at the age of 21 and was given two years to live, but has survived for many decades. His story expands beyond these components, but the film The Theory of Everything does a wonderful job of the telling of the relationship between the famous physicist and his wife, Jane. The film refers to his role and influence in the scientific world, but the primary focus of the story is their relationship and the influence they had on each others lives. The drama travels through how they met, to the awareness of his eventual handicap and their lifetime battle for his life, career and family. There might be apprehension with the documentary director, James Marsh at the helm, but it is unfounded because he manages to bring this docu-drama to life. With a central character that is restricted to a chair for the majority of the film, Marsh creatively capitalises on the character of Jane and the others that surround Hawking in his lifetime. The combination of the story and the actors masterfully playing their roles, this is a captivating film.The strengths of the film rely on the depth of the relational story and the brilliant casting. There are a multitude of characters in this tale that travels through six decades, but the heart of the story is reliant on Stephen and Jane. When their relationship is strong, the story is rich and engaging and when their relationship fails, the story suffers and brings in a necessary, but undesirable reality. This might sound strange in the realm of biopics, but the Hawking's story is appealing when they are closest and when they look outside of their relationship for comfort and solace, their gravitational appeal wains and the story loses footing. Eddie Redmayne (Les Miserables) and Felicity Jones (The Invisible Woman) are perfectly cast for the lead roles. They capture the attention and passion of the Hawking's relationship and travel through the time line with brilliant skills. The only weakness in their performance is their physical attractiveness. It is hard to imagine the actual characters were this good looking, but it does not hinder the tale. The director, James Marsh, manages to move the story through time without much difficulty. He keeps the story moving at a comfortable pace that helps to show the love and challenges that permeated the Hawking's lives. This story has the potential for the overly dramatic, or even worse, a boring narrative, but Marsh manages to keep the correct pace that is believable and engaging. Based on the commentary of the film, there are some nuances and artistic license that needed to occur to bring the story to the big screen, but none were compromising to the story or the characters.The Theory of Everything is a biopic of a world-renown physicist, but the intriguing component of the film is the philosophical and theological tracks that it travels down. Stephen is a firm believer in science and is an outspoken atheist and socialist. He is brilliant within his field, but when entering into the theological he is outside of his realm of expertise. The journey of his life portrayed in the film continually comes back to the necessity to answer the 'God' question. Jane is a Christian and their differences in belief of something beyond this world continued to be a source of conversation and study. In the attempt to define and discuss time and how the universe was created, he is continually confronted with the consideration of God and a creator. It might be easy to dismiss these considerations as part of Hawking's history, but the questions of sin, creation and God should be a consideration for anyone. The primary points of contention in the film came back to many of these universal questions that transcend time. The film is entertaining and educational, but do not be dismissive of the bigger questions that this film brings to light.Leaving the cinema... You do not need to be a scientist or a fan of The Big Bang Theory to enjoy this film. It will strengthen the fan base for Stephen Hawking, but it does humanise the man and his life. Eddie Redmayne will receive a multitude of award nominations for his portrayal of the chair- ridden physicist, but the heartbeat of the story is found in the relationship between Stephen and Jane. A film about science should challenge the brain, but who would have thought it would challenge the theological considerations of this world. This was a good film that will cause you to think more about life and God.Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. How did the world come into existence? (Genesis 1-2, Psalm 33:9, John 1:3) 2. Does God exist? (Psalm 19:1, Romans 1:20) 3. How can you define sin?

A Sort of Love Story That Becomes Sort of Tedious,"The film was interesting, particularly the first half, but, as it went on and on, it began to get tedious.The acting is all excellent as is filming etc. I think the problem is that it obviously depicts real life people and real life events.As so often with real life, there isn't a 'happy ending' or any 'triumph over adversity'or feel good factor. People just endure, learn to cope and 'go on'.Prof. Hawking obviously did 'triumph' in so many ways, just living for one, his scientific triumphs, having a family etc.But making this into a film is obviously difficult. I'm glad I watched it. However, I don't share the opinions of the rave reviewers, i would only give it a 7/10 for entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Beautiful and Inspiring,"A beautiful story has been told through the eye of the camera, the adapted novel taught me more of the fascinating life of Steven Hawking. I found it incredible to live through the believable telling of Hawkings emotional existence in the theory of everything. The equilibrium was just wonderful and I found the whole movie powerful. The reflection of Hawkings character, the source of humour and unique brilliance was excellent. The connection and understanding of a rare relationship was delivered with the highest quality. Its also important to note Eddie Redmaynes contribution to this movie, acting with complete soul and dedication. Marvellous to watch and whilst it felt like prying into this personal yet superb story, I felt inspired.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A great performance in an interesting biopic - but maybe a little too respectful.,"Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for his performance as the cruelly disabled Stephen Hawking in this film, and you can see why. He has mastered amazingly the contortions and ticks that advancing Motor Neurone Disease inflicted upon the increasingly famous cosmologist. But his depiction of Hawking's earlier days at Cambridge is also impressive, helped by careful attention to detail and also by a fairly strong physical resemblance.Sadly, though, this performance alone cannot make for a great film. The story here is not really about Hawking's scientific breakthroughs, nor about his perhaps less appreciated role in popularising science with his hugely successful books; but mainly it centres in his first marriage to Jane Wilde, played by Felicity Jones. Hers is also a bravura performance, but, as many people have noted, she does not appear to age over the decades' span of the story.The real problem though is a nagging feeling that something is missing. Many people will know already the key facts of this story, and the film, in reality, does not reveal much more. It's not just the lightness of the science, nor the way in which his earlier public appearances do not appear to figure in the story, but even the main theme of the marriage feels incomplete. Perhaps it's because the screenplay is based largely on Jane Wilde Hawking's own book, and all the major players were alive when the film was produced.Inevitable pressures in the relationship are hinted at, but what we see still seems rather sugar-coated. When Jane is challenged as to the fatherhood of their third child, we realise we've seen little of the intimacy of their marriage, but also we barely seem to have scratched the surface of Jane's other ambiguous relationship with choirmaster Jonathan Jones (played by Charlie Cox).It's a shame, because no one's about to revisit this story since there's little chance they will be able to match Redmayne's central interpretation.Still. The film is worth watching for its strong performances. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Should have played up the drama more,"First off, Stephen and Jane are both acted excellently. Stephen Hawking himself put it best when he said at times he felt like he was watching himself, and Jane perfectly portrays the difficult of raising a family with such a disabled husband.However, this movie sticks too strictly to the facts, which makes this movie feel more like a written biography rather than a big budget drama. This could be forgiven if it also showed all of Stephen's highlights, but it significantly downplays his achievements by failing to convince the audience that his ideas were truly revolutionary. Understandably, the film only touches on the actual subjects that he studied, but it also fails to convey how controversial and award worthy his discoveries were. The result is a low-drama Hollywood drama that underplays the most important parts of the biography.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Was really the movie about Hawking?,"Don't get me wrong, it's a good dramatic movie with great performances, but in the end i couldn't stop asking myself why in the middle of all that melancholia, the character that has more development is actually his wife?
She ends up having most moral dilemmas, character development and actual screentime than Stephen. It was like the movie was trying to send the message that if it weren't for her, Hawking wouldn't made it.
In fact, behind a great man there's always a great woman and vice versa, but since we were seeing a biopic about Hawking, kind of would made more sense for the argument and the camera to spend more time with him and less with his wife, particularly spending so much time around the obvious infidelity, of which we are deprived to see acomplished probably out of virtue signaling from the director.
From a ""i love you no matter what"" we come to the conclusion of ""i have loved you"", once again giving Jane almost a moral power over Hawking. Something like ""you couldn't done it if it weren't for me, so i'm free from all my sins"". It's a subversive dialogue of a woman having power over a crippled man. And it all happens when Hawking admits God exists, giving Jane a triumphant final moment. Hawking seems to come to the conclusion, that she stayed more out of stubborn faith than for love.
All these dilemmas together with stellar performances, made this movie a very gratifying watch, even if i don't agree with paths taken.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Theory behind the theory,"Stephen Hawking was an enigma. How could this extremely intelligent man continue to research whilst suffering with MND? His condition whilst extremely disabling never defined him, as he was lucky enough to have impressive support from his family and friends which allowed him to stay committed to his interests. This film shows the onset of the disease and the story of his life from the time period he was at Cambridge University researching for his PhD. I'm not going to spoil the story but it is one of highs and lows - much like everyone else's lives, but ultimately illustrates what is possible in the face of adversity. I'd have scored this higher if it hadn't become like snippets the further towards the end of the film - I know getting everything in to a standard movie length can be a challenge but I'd have liked this to be bulked out a little more. Eddie Redmayne is the greatest young talent we have these days and deserved his Academy award for Best Actor. This is a heartwarming and interesting biog and love story, but it's not in an ""in-your-face"" way.

Underwhelming and uninteresting,"I went to see The Theory of Everything with my girlfriend, expecting a biopic of Stephen Hawking with particular focus on the relationship with his first wife. That's not what we got.Instead, we got a film which couldn't decide who's story it was telling, acting by Redmayne that at points was utterly cringeworthy and uninspiring, and a repetitive soundtrack that sounded as if it was ripped straight from a charity advert.Felicity Jones, however, was utterly amazing and deserves all the awards she has been nominated for. There were a couple of excellent lines of dialogue in there, but on the whole the script felt as if it was still in the drafting process.The camera-work was above average, yet at times felt like an Instagram submission.On top of this, I now feel guilty for not enjoying a film that's supposed to be awesome. It was a huge let down and I can't see why Redmayne has been nominated for so many awards - must be because he did a questionable job at pretending to have a disability.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Short Review,"The Theory of Everything Movie​ is a biopic based on Stephen Hawking​. Rather amusingly it focuses on his relationship with his first wife. Eddie Redmayne​ is phenomenal in his role. He really makes you believe that he is Hawking, such is the extent of his performance. Specially his simulation of motor neuron disease. Felicity Jones​ is also worth mentioning in her portrayal of his wife.Definitely worth watching, but was a bit disappointed that it wasn't much about his work and science. And almost all of it is factually correct.Redmayne is definitely in the running to win an Oscar tomorrow.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Endearing and beautiful,"Stephen Hawking is a man whose deficiencies seem to have stuck with the image the public forms of this celebrated scientist. The feeling one gets from watching The Theory Of Everything is that before his illness started leaving its mark, Hawking acted like an ordinary scholar. Of course his brilliance is now very much acknowledged and the fact is that his theories would have come to light whether or not he had to battle the disease.Anyways, this movie is adapted from Jane Hawking's memoir ""Travelling To Infinity: My Life With Stephen"" and is a story about the many difficulties that their marriage had to endure as Stephen fought to live and find a way to make his life's work meaningful, and on the other end, the commitment Jane gave to her marriage, despite everything going against it. With two heavy protagonists such as these, top talent was needed and suffice to say that Redmayne and Jones were more than up to the task. Redmayne gives one of the best performances of the year as he plays three stages of the character. The transition from one stage to another is phenomenal and brings the best out of our leading man. Felicity Jones does equally well, although her role isn't as flashy. Still her charming and charismatic nature allow for a great turn, when one could expect a less than good performance.While the movie does come together beautifully through it's two leads, the filmmaking process isn't as strong with the biopic structure being very normally used. Johann Johannsson's soundtrack is a delight to hear though and along with the performances, are the best part of the film. The Theory Of Everything isn't the most brilliant film in this year's Oscars, but it certainly is worth it to see some of the best performances of the year and hear a rich score that I hope, deservedly, wins an Academy Award.Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Trinity Hall I'm so sorry,"It's a biopic. It's quintessentially British. It has every British aspect you could want in a movie apart from maybe Sheridan Smith.I feel bad for Trinity Hall College (which is the actual Cambridge college Hawking went to) but I guess it was too small to film in. It's a shame because it's a lot nicer than St. John's college, as Hawking would no doubt agree. I feel bad for the actors like Redmayne and Jones who had to film right outside Cripps Court (Google that building and you'll see what I mean).It's safe to say that Felicity Jones carries the movie. She deals with the emotional side, the unseen part of Hawking's life and the burden of having to study MML at Cambridge. I think Redmayne is good in his role but not outstanding or Oscar worthy. I've heard reviews saying his eyes were doing incredible acting when he was in the later part of the film, but I think a lot of that had to do with the hair & makeup rather than him.On the whole it's not a bad film but it's definitely Sunday afternoon viewing rather material rather than Academy Award material. It's such a shame they couldn't film in a nicer college like, I don't know, Trinity Hall, Pembroke or Magdalene for example.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Want Proof of God's Existence! Just Look at Stephen Hawking!,"Eddie Redmayne earned his Academy Award and also an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) for his services to drama. His performance of the great physicist Stephen Hawking CBE, CH, was captivating, believable, and executed with perfection. Redmayne has performed Hawking with sincerity, intelligence, and without pity. His performance is one of the year's best and perhaps the best in a long time. His character's illness slowly progresses his physical abilities but not his mental capacity. He is still a a genius and his survival defied the odds and life expectancy of only two years. He is now in his seventies and is active as ever. Despite his inabilities, he is still a brilliant genius but a human being with flaws as well. He became a husband, father, professor, author, and even speaker without his voice. The talking box conveys the only voice that most of the world is aware of Hawking. Despite his inability to speak due to a tracheotomy, he has still endured and survived. I don't know what qualifies for a miracle but Hawking is an example of one. He still is going strong. I also enjoyed the performances by Felicity Jones as his devoted wife Jane Wilde and Maxine Peake who played Elaine Mason, his nurse. Emily Watson also plays Jane's mother too. David Thewlis is remarkable as Hawking's mentor professor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Amazing what they both went through over the years and were able to bring up children throughout it all. Jane Hawking must have been extremely strong to have dealt with her husbands illness a lesser woman could not have coped. Felicity Jones' performance was amazing and both characters reduced me to tears several times. Eddie Raymayne brought emotion to a character with no voice now that is talent.

A different biopic about two great human beeings,"Many people know Stephen Hawking for his groundbreaking discoveries, such as the discovery of black holes or his theory about the Big Bang. Others know him only as the British man in a wheelchair suffering from ALS who communicates through a computer voice with an American accent. James Marsh's biopic The Theory of Everything is about much more than these unique characteristics. While his illness is a strong focus, the film is primarily concerned with the impact it has on Hawking's private life, particularly on his relationship with his first wife Jane. Jane Hawking created the basis for this film with her book My Life with Stephen Hawking: Love Has Eleven Dimensions.Eddie Redmayne is tailor-made for the leading role of Stephen Hawking. Not only does he look identical to the real person in his younger years, but the way he communicates the continual loss of his motor skills is absolutely thrilling. This is why Redmayne's performance is so highly rated, as the illness in the film does not suddenly hit rock bottom from one scene to the next. His performance is especially close when you see that he wants to, but can't. This is especially difficult to watch in the interactions with his wife Jane, played by the great Felicity Jones. The chemistry and love story of the two main characters carries the film for long stretches, in which joy and sorrow are always right next to each other. Their coexistence is also further challenged by the implementations of important supporting characters from family, friendship and care-related backgrounds as the film progresses. It is clear to see that Redmayne and Jones were closely advised and informed by Jane Hawking on the details, as their performances always seem authentic and almost eerily real.In the end, The Theory of Everything is not a pure biopic about Stephen Hawking alone, but is just as much Jane Hawking's story. This is a welcome change, as films about so-called geniuses tend to aim to explore only this and the people directly involved tend to take a back seat. There is a lot of humanity in this film, which makes the person Stephen Hawking very tangible. The respect one has for this man, but also for his wife and family, is enormous. Nevertheless, it would have been just as important to focus more on Hawking's fundamental theories and inventions and not just to address them superficially. After all, the person Stephen Hawking is by no means defined only by his illness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A very true movie and very very superb!,"The great incredible story of professor Stephen Hawking was sincerely reflected on screen through the The Theory of Everything movie. I have to start with Eddie Redmayne's performance which genuinely exceeds any other performance I have ever seen in my life and in cinema, I really thought for a whole bunch of time I was watching the professor himself especially in his advanced stages of motor neurone disease , It's that kind of performance that still no award is made for it. Felicity did a great job too and had a beautiful chemistry with Eddie. The music of the film was very beautiful and a great companion to the performances and the screenplay was beautiful and careful too. The story only focused on his suffering with a small glimpse about his extraordinary theory and his genius mind which seemed to me as a story of a person that was suffering from a rare disease and was challenging to live and came up with a tremendous theory which could fill some parts where the story was away from him focusing on his wife and how in my opinion she was as he told her in the beginning that she was unaware and taken when she offered that they marry by what she did in the movie in the end of the movie and when he lived more than two years which was so awful and a very bad ending to such a great effort done with such a great person and I would rather It showed any situation including his children and how they dealt with him and how they got used to him in that condition without deviating from his story and facing the disease and how genius he was. In the end the movie is included in the 1001 must watch movies before you die so don't miss it. 8.5/10 with a great salute.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Female protagonist is the real hero,"The life of Stephen Hawking nicely presented in front of us, much suitable for people like me who prefers visual language rather than verbal, aka watching movies over book reading.
It truly brings the life of the legendary in front of us. The protagonist did a fantastic role to portray the physical nature and the more surprising fact was about his wife who sacrificed most of her life for this person even after knowing about his conditions, it simply resembles the female protagonists' character in the Tamil film Mayakkam Enna, where the female character is portrayed so strongly than the protagonist of the film because they're the real heroes who're responsible in the making of these real heroes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
I got sidetracked early on,"Evolution has made us what we are. We get excited by the opposite sex. We instinctively chase beauty and perfection but at the same time have a sense of what is obtainable and what isn't. What I'm trying to say is that we have a tendency to love and marry within our circle. A plain looking man knows better than to chase a raving beauty and vice versa. It's possible these two opposites could fall in love after having known each other for a long time and learned to appreciate hidden virtues and beauty not readily visible to the naked eye. But attraction at a first glance by a beauty for an ordinary looking ""bookworm"" type? Not a chance in hell! So that's how early the movie lost me. And in the subsequent scenes I saw nothing that made me think Jane could fall in love for deeper reasons than physical attraction. Had this movie been made with a ""plain Jane"" heroine it would have been a lot more believable. I have not seen pictures of the real Jane Hawking but I'd bet a lot of money she's not a raving beauty like Felicity Jones.

A tour de force for Eddie Redmayne,"The Stephen Hawking bio-pic The Theory of Everything is one of the leading contenders in 2015's awards season, with Eddie Redmayne being deserving of the praise he has been receiving as the famous physicist. Based on Jane Wilde Hawking's autobiography The Theory of Everything looks at relationship between Stephen and Jane (Felicity Jones) as they fall in love and deal with Professor Hawking's motor neuron disease, looking at the physical decline and the struggles Jane has to go through caring for him and the family. Those wanting or expecting a look at Professor Hawking's scientific work will be disappointed as it is only glanced at: if you want the film about Hawking's science then I recommend watching the excellent BBC TV film Hawking starring Benedict Cumberbatch.Redmayne is transformative in his role as Stephen Hawking, being brilliant at showing Hawking's disability taking over, from small things like struggling to run to being unable to speak. He had excellent chemistry with his co-star. Jones as Jane does have a sizeable role, having to help with husband academically and physically and develops a relationship Jonathan Jones (Charlie Cox).James Marsh's direction is solid making sure their decent pace and provides some interesting visuals thanks to Benoît Delhomme's old- fashioned cinematography. But Anthony McCarten's screenplay has a very episodic quality, looking at small moments of Hawking's life, such as Hawking's university days before his diagnosis, dealing with his diagnosis, early scientific breakthroughs, etc.... The scientific revelations shown to be eureka moments.The film is very reminiscence of A Beautiful Mind, looking at the personal life and struggle of a scientific/mathematics genius, having a look at his relationship and how they have to deal with adversity.7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Everything you need to know about the movie,"""The Theory of Everything"". Initially, by the name, it may seem that this is a terribly scientific film about the career, training and discoveries of Stephen Hawking. But, in fact, in front of you is a mesmerising drama of his life.The film is an adaptation of Jane Hawking's book ""Traveling to Infinity: My life with Stephen"", dedicated to the relationship with her ex-husband, the outstanding physicist Stephen Hawking.The story unfolds from the time of Stephen Hawking's student days at Cambridge University. It will tell about how he met his future wife, about how he found out about his illness and how he overcame it, about what mind-blowing discoveries he made, about how, thanks to his wife, he became indesperate and how he became internationally popular.This is actually an impressive film, it's not for nothing that it grossed over $ 100 million. Critics panned the film. But, do not forget that the story was originally told by Stephen Hawking's wife, so it is not super-objective.I would recommend this film for person who like to look at the life of world celebrities from the other side, to look into some secrets, to learn the subtleties. And of course, the film inspires to not give up, even if it is a serious illness. Despite the misfortune, Hawking was able to live a very fruitful and long life with it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The Theory of Nothing,"About the famous physicist Stephen Hawking. Based on the book written by Jane Hawking, his first wife, it focuses mainly on family intimacy, giving no emphasis to the fact that why today Hawking is considered one of the best scientists and geniuses ever. It seems to me that this film is not so much a bio of Stephen, but more of Jane and her 'Catholic' struggle in a marriage that is neither normal nor conventional. Very slow and boring movie. The most intriguing thing about this film is the fact that Eddie Redmayne won the Oscar for Best Actor for spending more than half of the film sitting in a wheelchair; people with motor difficulties must be insulted.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

"The Actors go Far Beyond the Call of Duty,","The Theory of Everything is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an absolutely outstanding cast. The film is dramatic, emotional and completely enticing from start to finish. It is mostly carried by the groundbreaking performances of Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, they clearly did every bit of research and preparation they possibly could to prepare for these roles. Redmayne's Academy Award win is definitely deserved, it is almost impossible to believe when you watch him on screen that he is simply an actor, that he does not have ALS, he transforms completely in to Stephen Hawking and no one could have played this role any better. Filled with emotion and intense dialogue, the Theory of Everything is an absolutely outstanding film that I would recommend to all moviegoers.Follows the life and struggles of Stephen and Jane Hawking as they marry and raise children while the renowned physicist's Lou Gehrigs disease becomes increasingly worse.Best Performance: Eddie Redmayne",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Well made and often very moving,"The Theory of Everything is a biopic about world-renowned physicist Stephen Hawking and his first wife Jane Wilde Hawking. I really enjoyed it. It was well made and often very moving.The film covers most of the important moments in Stephen Hawking's (Eddie Redmayne) life, beginning with his courtship and eventual marriage to Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones), a literature student whom he met at Cambridge University. Over time, Hawking begins to lose control of his muscles and he is unable to use his hands and feet to accomplish even the simplest of tasks. The doctors diagnose him with motor neuron disease, an illness which causes the human body to slowly and permanently shut down the ability to move limbs but is told his brain will remain unchanged. He is given 2 years to live. In that time, however, Hawking starts a family with his wife and gives lectures at universities on his theories of black holes and the birth of the universe. Despite his condition getting worse and worse, Hawking still tries to see the positive side of life and even manages to write his famous book ""A Brief History Of Time"", which becomes a bestseller.Eddie Redmayne's performance as Hawking was so convincing I often had to tell myself he isn't the real person. Felicity Jones was great as well as Hawking's loving and committed wife Jane Wilde. The love story between them always felt genuine and never forced.I rate it 9/10. I also recommend watching the 2004 TV movie ""Hawking"" starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a companion piece for this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Masterpiece,"Turning someone's life into a film is as common as it is difficult. Trying to stay true to the story and, at the same time, leave it thought provoking for the viewer is a challenge faced by the biographies. In this take, it was Stephen Hawking's turn to have his career told by the seventh art. Directed by James Marsh, The Theory of Everything does justice to the physical and presents us with an immersive story of love and overcoming.The film features a young Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), who is at the peak of his academic life and starting a romance with young Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones), when he discovers he has a degenerative motor disease at age 21. Thereafter, Stephen and Jane have their love tested by something that, until then, was considered a death sentence for those receiving the diagnosis.There would be no better actor to play Hawking than Eddie. He deserved all the merits he has been receiving for his incredible interpretation, which goes far beyond physical characteristics - very well incorporated, by the way. Redmayne allows us to know Stephen far beyond the physical, humanizing him to the point of making the viewer feel intimate with the character. He manages to convey Stephen's feelings and emotions without the need for much dialogue, but through subtle gestures and looks. This, in fact, is one of the assets of the feature. Despite occurring in large quantities, Theory has its true culminations in brief conversations or even words. One of the most touching scenes, for example, has a ""thank you"" as its main line.Felicity Jones is also noteworthy for composing a strong and determined Jane who does not allow herself to be shaken by the progress of the disease or the negative predictions of doctors and faces everything and everyone to show that Stephen could have a normal life. She and Eddie work well and are convincing in the role of the young couple, thrilling the audience with subtleties. Stephen and Jane's marriage and the way they both struggled to build their family despite adversity is told in a short but detailed sequence of scenes. The impression we have is that we are watching a home video that shows the story of both.The film is realistic and does not try to alleviate the difficulties faced by both, but seeks to show that, contrary to popular belief, life is not limited to problems or a disease and it is possible to see positivity even in the most negative situations. It can be said that The Theory of Everything is a film about life and also about love and overcoming. It is not about telling the story of Stephen Hawking, but about showing how a woman's willpower helped him not to give up and overcome himself.The figure known to the public and his greatest achievements are an integral part of the narrative, but not its center. It is not a matter of exposing the story of someone remarkable on the big screen, but of showing how two people managed to build a firm and lasting relationship - it was almost 30 years of marriage - despite all the adversities. Before being a film about Stephen Hawking, Theory of Everything is a film about the human being in himself and how it is possible to overcome himself daily.Also worth mentioning is the great soundtrack by Johann Johannson, which brilliantly leads the story and is easily one of the best of the year. The script, however, runs at certain times and even leaves some loose ends, but nothing that harms the sequences in an extreme way. The feature film delivers what promises and delights the viewer, introducing him to the man behind the genius and the woman who helped him get there.I liked this criticism of CinemascopeFilm seen on July 8, 2020.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Life is a miracle and we are the wonders of the world,"What worked:
The first thing that comes to my mind is the unbelievable and profound transformation of Eddie as Hawkings. It's a very powerful, believable and relatable performance, making us almost believe if he was the real Hawkings. His portrayal is phenomenal and of course Academy award was without a doubt well deserved. The movie is beautifully written, acted and directed, and special mention to the music of the movie. Was it the best movie they year? Maybe not , but still a great movie. An inspiring story
What did not work:
I would have loved the movie more if we were given some glimpse of how great of a scientist he was. We did have some scenes regarding his academic world and research , but more would make it easier to relate to what a genius mind he really was

A good choice for good evening,"When I heard about the release of the film ""The Theory of Everything"", as a person who is fond of physics, I immediately watched it. The plot of the film is based on the life of Stephen Hawking, a scientist who, despite his illness, continued to work. Eddie Redmayne co-starred with Felicity Jones in this film, and even won an Oscar.We can say that the director was able to successfully shoot an adaptation of the book by Hawking's wife. Jane (Hawking's wife) overcame herself, she gave all her vital energy to her husband. The actors played superconvincing, the events of the film are memorible.It cannot be said that the film is fast-moving, because there are few special effects in it, of which there are too many in new films. There are no sharp twists and turnsin the film, which can scare away the audience, because everyone loves gripping films. But with these disadvantages, the film wins in that it is thought provoking, the viewer sees all the impossible tests that stand in the way of a up-and-coming scientist and his wife, and they do not give up, which sets a good example for postgenerations.I can't call this movie a masterpiece of cinema, but if you want to watch a mesmerizing film and want to get a new subject for reflection, then be sure to look at the ""Theory of Everything"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

In such times, one realises that family and friends form very important part of our lives.

Even in the midst of everything, she didn't lose her faith, she didn't give in to other desires, she didn't give up hope. Steven, on the other hand (impressively portrayed by Eddie Redmayne), doesn't change. Sure, his physical state deteriorates, but his character never really developed or grew.

My name is Katya. I from Ryazan. I would like to share the opinion on the film/,"I was always surprised to that as people with big problems with the health do something. Цhen I have watched the film about Stephen William Hawking, I have understood why they do it. Life all this. Love all this. The person surpasses all expectations. There are people who after each failure cease to do something and go towards the aim. But such people as Stephen Hawking on the contrary keep optimism also aspire to the purpose, overcome all difficulties of their life. I am ready to be proud of such people. When I look at them to me there is a wish to live. I think that Eddie has played a leading role in the film perfectly, he has given to the audience all emotions, all feelings, everything that occurred on the screen. It deserves separate admiration. I am the person who doesn't understand physics and astronomy, but when viewing I could understand many things so it is very good when actors speak available language. Stephen's relation to the family and to the friends is shown very brightly. We can understand as strongly he loves them and for the sake of what he lives .",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Thoughtful Biopic of Stephen Hawking,"While some people may be off-put from the lack of focus on Stephen Hawking's scientific aspect of his life (which I'll admit I was initially as well), I ended up really appreciating the personal and human element. And the passion of revolutionizing the scientific world is still present as well, it just isn't shown as much of a conflict as Stephen getting more and more consumed by his disease while his wife and other loved ones try to support him all the way through. Once I found that the biography this was based on was written by Jane Hawkings, I realized that this was more of the story of Stephen Hawing's life shown from his wife's perspective, their shared conflicts are at the main focus and they both get equal amount of screen time. However, it is still Stephen freaking Hawking, so I can still understand desire for more of his scientific aspect shown. As for the cast, Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne both hit it out of the water with this one. You really feel for these characters and understand all of the layer Eddie in particular had to perform since as the scenes go by he has to find a new way to communicate to the other actors in a respectful but realistic manner. Fortunately, the religion vs. Science aspect is kept to minimal banter, and the personal conflicts in the last act are for the most part handled quite well. Overall while this may not be the scientific Stephen Hawking biopic that you were hoping for, it still provides enough personal conflict and human connections with two spectacular leads to make it worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The Theory of Everything contains masterful acting from both leads,"The Theory of Everything (review)Every week the Sierra Nevada Movie Club meets up to catch a flick. This week's offering was the James Marsh directed ""The Theory of Everything"" with Eddie Redmayne undertaking the role of Stephen Hawking and Felicity Jones, the part of Hawking's first wife. I had been waiting for this film to reach Reno. The biggest little city in the world is growing, but can still be a little bodonk when it comes to receiving some of the smaller pictures (one member of the movie group decries every film that is short of a generic action film as being ""bizarre"".) I went into the theater already primed, having recently watching the excellent PBS documentary from earlier in the year simply entitled ""Hawking"". ""The Theory of Everything"" matches much of the arc of the documentary, both choosing what to highlight. Stephen Hawking, who apparently enjoyed ""Theory"" did describe the picture as ""broadly true."" The film begins shortly before Stephen show serious symptoms as he struggles with in which way he is going to finish his academic career. He meets Jane (Felicity Jones) at a party and immediately begins courting her in earnest. Not long into their relationship Stephen has a serious fall and is diagnosed with motor neuron disease that leaves him with a life expectancy of two years. What follows is a force of mega adaptation for both of them. In one scene between Jane and Frank Hawking, Stephen's father, she tells him that she may look like a weak girl but she will prove that she is strong. This she does in a herculean effort. Although Redmayne has garnered most of the buzz for his performance and physical transformation, Felicity Jones is the heart and pulse of this movie. We can see her love, her struggle, her determination, and finally her frustration and heart break. This is not done through dialog, but shown through minute visuals, the type of acting that motion picture was made to capture. Although the emotional arc of this movie largely follows a man and woman falling in love and then eventually losing touch with each other, I never felt overly dragged into these pangs myself. The points that were meant to be visceral daggers, I felt were just a tad bit forced, pushed, as typical in many films, by a manipulative score. It's not as much that these scenes didn't feel sincere as much as they just tended to not dig deep and the scenes fell away like dead leaves in a gentle breeze. This film is definitely worth a watch, if for nothing else than at least a snippet view into the life of an amazing, determined, humorous, brilliant man. I am very curious what projects come Eddie Redmayne's and Felicity Jones' way now that the world is even more aware of these actors and their ability. Again, I highly recommend looking into the PBS documentary that is narrated by Hawking himself to contrast with ""Theory"" which is adapted from Jane's Hawking's biography.Blarv Score 8.6/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Not bad!,"But not great! Very very predictable, in the slow and boring style of many British films of recent years. Eddie Redmayne really does play a big part as the
unfortunate character of Stephen Hawking. Felicity Jones is just OK in the role of his loving wife who, after all, though she promised to never leave him, leaves him to be with another man.

For Hawking,"The Theory of Everything, a cinematic symphony that not only explores the cosmos but also delves deep into the complexities of human relationships. The acting? Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Stephen Hawking is a breathtaking dance between vulnerability and resilience, a performance that transcends the boundaries of the screen. Film editing? The seamless narrative threads weave through time, creating a tapestry of emotion that mirrors the ebb and flow of the universe. Strengths? The film's ability to balance the intricacies of scientific discovery with the tender love story at its core, showcasing the brilliance and fragility of life. Weaknesses? Perhaps at times, the pacing felt like a celestial dance that required an extra beat, but the emotional gravity compensates for any perceived lulls. The music? Jóhann Jóhannsson's score is a haunting melody that echoes the vastness of the cosmos, harmonizing perfectly with the film's emotional notes. The message? A celebration of the human spirit's unyielding pursuit of knowledge, love, and understanding in the face of profound challenges. Cinematography? A visual masterpiece that captures the beauty in both the cosmic expanse and the intimate moments of a single life. 8/10 is a humble acknowledgment of its brilliance, a film that leaves an indelible mark on the heart and mind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

The film does a great job on covering Stephen Hawkings story from before and after having ALS , and the physical transformation that Eddie Redmayne goes through in the film is absolutely incredible . You really feel as though you are actually watching Stephen Hawking , and it's undoubtedly one of the best male performances of 2014.

Perfectly poignant,"Eddie Redmayne is already winning awards. He ought to scoop the lot. The gawky kid who charmed us in MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is now the geeky cosmologist who wins the heart of a girl at college, enjoys a happy life with her and their children and conquers the scientific world with his theories about the birth of the universe even as Motor Neurone Disease takes away his mobility and his speech, but not - against all the odds - his dignity or his humour.Stephen Hawking is a scene-hogging role like Dustin Hoffman's in RAIN MAN, but Felicity Jones manages to steal some of his limelight much as Tom Cruise managed to steal from Dustin. Her Jane Hawking is believably impossibly perfect - the wife who lovingly supports her increasingly frail partner and then with exquisite discomfort falls in love with somebody else. There are no scenes of violence or vitriol: Stephen and Jane's love survives the collapse of their marriage.

"Rich, Sweet and Sobering, As Much About Evolving Relationships as Theoretical Physics","The intense, heartstrong, tragic saga of Professor Stephen Hawking, who succeeds professionally despite the personal and physical tolls of an early-onset ALS diagnosis. It handles the subject remarkably well, placing us in the wheelchair right beside him throughout his physical descent. When he aches, struggling with staircases, obligations and words alike, we hurt along with him. We fall head over heels for Hawking's relationship with his young love, Jane Wilde, only to watch their spark slowly flicker amidst the trials of his condition and increasing social status. It's a bittersweet combination of enduring hope and crushing loss. Beautifully shot and superbly acted, particularly in the two lead roles, this is a wonderful encapsulation of the vibrancy of a life well-lived. Well worth watching, it's sure to move you in many different ways, and maybe even make you think twice about what you've unsuspectingly put your own loved ones through.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A love story that transcends the traditional genre,"Although it's not a true genre, Memoir/True Story is a methodology for writing a biography. Mixed with Drama, which shows the intimacy of characters in a web and a strong moral dilemma that ""blows"" in the Climax Sequence, the Memoir/True Story is like a detective story. Uncovering clues to a person's psyche is the detective aspect of this genre. And when one uncovers enough clues and is able to arrive at ""the truth,"" what oftentimes happens is that ""the truth"" can be problematic.In the case of The Theory of Everything, the wife of Stephen Hawking made the conscious, if not romantic decision to ""stand by her man."" A religious woman by nature, this entered into her decision as well. After 25 years of devotion, with literally life-threatening decisions she had to make while a parent of three of their children, they end in divorce.The flip or transcendence of the usual beats of a deteriorating marriage are as follows: Stephen is not a disabled man in his heart or brain. His wife helped him to rise above that depression, which would have killed him had she not been by his side. His wife is not just a ""caregiver"" bleeding heart, but rather, a deeply spiritual woman who rose above what most young women look for in a marriage partner. This giving nature caused her to grow with an enormous character arc. She walked away from a long adulterous relationship when Stephen's life hung in the balance and she knew where her duties lay. Stephen knew where her heart really was though after many years of marriage. He was saddened by it, but he had an enormous respect for his wife's courage and strong moral values. The third transcendence occurred when Stephen finds himself falling in love with his new caregiver. He is a man falling in love - not a disabled, helpless victim. This is new to him and it empowers him. The caregiver replaces his wife in emotional importance. It's an evolution that is both poignant and painful at the same time. Both characters grow in wisdom and respect for one another. The concept of ""time"" is woven into this script as a type of symbol. Whether time goes forward or backward is not of the essence. Time is a chronological measure of growth and happiness. The real measure is ephemeral and everlasting. The two characters go through a moral epiphany that is called a Double Reversal at the end of the story. Stephen pushed away the possibility to survive in the beginning. In the end, he believes that his horizons are endless. Jane was committed to a moral and ethical way of behavior with a man at any cost in the beginning. In the end, she allows herself to follow her heart.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Emotional Award Bait w/ Amazing Performances from the Leads,"There was one major contender during award season that I couldn't quite figure out if I was interested in watching: THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. I am a casual fan of Stephen Hawking and I've read both his ""Brief History of Time"" and ""Universe in a Nutshell"" (as a layman, of courseI've no formal education in the sciences). I am vastly interested in the workings of the universe, even if I can't totally wrap my mind around some of the concepts in their complexity. So, a movie about Stephen Hawking was guaranteed to get my attention. I don't know why I expected a focus on his contributions to the world of theoretical physics in a mainstream biopic (other than wishful thinking) but the movie was still an interesting vision into the man's battle with ALS/Lou Gehrig's disease. It begins near the end of his education at Cambridge where he is studying for his PhD, and it's around this time that he meets Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) at a local party. The two fall in love (abnormally quick) and it's off to the disease when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is diagnosed with motor neuron disease and given two years to live. Once the initial shock has worn off, Hawking becomes determined to complete his education, continue his studies, and live a life with Jane. The two are married and the film gives us a glimpse into their lives as Hawking's motor function deteriorates and the struggle to maintain a sense of ""normal"" becomes too much.THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is unabashed Oscar bait. There is no question about that. Period piece. Noble subject/biopic. Intelligence. Love. Everything the award voters could want. Thankfully, it's a good bit of Oscar bait. Again, I'm a fan of Hawking so there are few subjects more interesting for me in a biography. Eddie Redmayne won a series of awards for his performance as Hawking and it was well deserved. I won't lie: in the beginning of the film, he reminds me so much of a young Austin Powers (think the flashbacks in GOLDMEMBER) that it's a little distracting but it's not long before he disappears into the character. And he becomes more and more convincing as the movie progresses. It's Hawking's battle with the disease where Redmayne shines, giving a pitch perfect performance. Good thing, too, because Hawking's ALS is the main driving force of the movie. He gradually loses motor function, bit by bit, until he's eventually confined to the wheelchair and gifted the text-to-speech software we've come to associate with the man. The movie spends the majority of it's time on the relationship between Stephen and Jane and how the two of them manage to keep strong for the longest time until the stress becomes too much. I'm honestly surprised at how little recognition Jones has gotten for her part in the film. As incredible as Redmayne was, Jones was just as on point with her role as his faithful wife with her gradually fading optimism. Redmayne had the physical struggle; Jones had the emotional.Struggle. It's all about the struggle. As a result, this is actually a pretty depressing movie. Sure, it's got these themes of hope running throughout it but it's nearly drowned in the constant onslaught of sadness and hurdles. Almost every scene in the movie focuses on some new obstacle or the stress before moving on to the next. While it is an interesting movie, it's just such a downer. It is interesting to see the progression of the disease, and it's interesting to watch Hawking's career blossom. But, man, what a bummer. I guess it would've been difficult to form an engaging movie around the man's career alone, but I think I would've loved it more. THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING drops little tidbits here and there, showing us moments where Hawking finds the inspiration for some of his ideas but that's about it. And the film follows his story up until the point that he publishes ""A Brief History of Time"". But then that's it. Oh well. The movie accomplishes what it sets out to do. It's a very emotional story and it's wonderful to look at. It's got all the ingredients to bring home the gold during awards season, and it's tailor-made to do just that. It'sI don't know.good. Go ahead and give it a watch. There's nothing here to offend any tastes and the performances are amazing but (for me, anyhow) it didn't take long to sink into the background noise of all the other award bait biopics out there, standing out only because the subject is an interest of mine.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Beautiful story!,"There are two kind of movies I normally never watch and those are musicals and romances. Musicals I will for sure never watch them, romances every now and then if the story looks good. Well with ""The Theory Of Everything"" I have to say that it was an amazingly beautiful movie. It's been ages that I dropped a tear for a movie.

Oscar worthy performance and a heartfelt biopic.,"""There should be no boundaries to human endeavor. We are all different. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope."" -Stephen Hawking.This film is Biopic/Drama+Romance about the famous theoretical physicist and cosmologist, Stephen Hawking. I really admire the guy and it was great to see that the movie did a great job of bringing his life story to the big screen. The main reason I admire him so much is the fact how he battled being diagnosed with ALS/Motor Neuron disease from his early age, defying the impossible and contributing greatly to the world of physics and cosmology. One of the greatest mind of our time.The film's main focus is not the achievements or genius of Hawking, but his relationship with his wife and his/their fight against the disease. IT is a really heartfelt story.It is hard enough to play as a Genius in movies since they mostly tend to be a bit socially awkward in one way or another, but it is a whole another thing to portray the effects of the said disease, and the decline into worse stages. And Eddie Redmayne did just that. He was just breathtaking in his performance. Not only does he look very similar to Hawking's younger self, he gave one of the best performance I HAVE EVER SEEN. It was like you were seeing Hawking himself. Last year has been full of great performances, but after watching this film, I'm fully supporting Redmayne for the best Actor Oscar, by far the best performance of last year. Beside Redmayne, Felicity Jones, who plays Hawking's wife, also gave a stunning performance. Not only that, she also stole away my heart, new celebrity crush. I don't know but I just found her immensely beautiful. The supporting cast was also great and contributed greatly in telling this tale and in heartfelt moments.Soundtrack was another thing that I really found captivating in this film. Was very well composed.The only complaint of mine with this film, just like The Imitation Game, is that I would have loved if they showed more of his work or genius workings.Whether you like Hawking or not (Can't see how can you not like him), or whether you even know about him or not, definitely give this movie a try.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

"When there is life, there is hope : A brief history of a Extraordinary Man","It is an encouraging sign, for those who doubt cinema's capacity for intelligence, that two films within a couple of months have examined the human condition through the medium of astrophysics, incidentally making reference to the works of Kip Thorne. For those who found Interstellar a little cold or its scale a little overwhelming, this biopic of Thorne's great contemporary and friend, Professor Stephen Hawking, may be the warmer and more human option.Aside from a brief flashback framing device, this is a fairly straightforward account. The young Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a graduate student working towards his doctorate. When we meet him, he is remarkable as much for his haphazard work ethic as his aptitude; a sort of Oxbridge everyman, he cheerfully coxes the rowing team and plays Wagner too loudly. But Hawking describes his subject as ""everything"", narrowing it down only as far as ""time"", handily showing that his ambition has already outstripped his diligence.Tragically, there are foreshadowings of a different sort: a lurching walk, a shaking hand. While Hawking's romance with Felicity Jones' Jane Wilde initially has a tinge of fairy tale - dancing on a bridge, bathed in the glow of fireworks - shadows threaten. Even as the arts graduate adjusts to the social oddities of her scientist admirer, she has to decide whether their relationship can endure a disease that seems certain to end his life, and soon. She sits, steely-eyed, to declare her devotion when his father tries to warn her off, and forces Hawking himself to find a path through.The realities of that steady erosion test both their limits, as the disease rides roughshod through Hawking and strips away his independence. Unquestionably the physical transformation of the year, Redmayne adopts Hawking's ravaged form as he shrinks into the familiar figure of modern times. A stick becomes two, a wheelchair looms, and then as Jane is teaching their children to walk, Hawking is losing the same capacity. Finally, his voice is silenced and his work thereby threatened, the hardest trial of all for the gregarious scholar.Jones' performance communicates the subtle sense that Jane thought she could endure the short life sentence Hawking was initially given but begins to quail when she realises that he will survive decades more, steadily needing more and more care. Hawking, meanwhile, obsesses over his great work and sometimes neglects the strains on his less lauded other half - but he never loses his humour, or his charm, a twinkle in his eye surviving through all but his worst days. Perhaps, like Beethoven losing his hearing, Hawking's disease didn't so much hinder his work as remove the distractions. Still, these two extraordinarily intelligent people display a mutual respect and consideration, even as their marriage threatens to fail, that would put many more traditionally successful marriages to shame. There are moments where they seem too easy on each other, as if this story has been lightly sanitised for public consumption somewhere between history and memoir and screen, but the overwhelming impression is that of a couple trying hard to do what's best, and sometimes not quite managing it. With so many movie marriages either flagrantly unhappy or barely sketched, it's inspiring to see a deeply felt commitment that proved crucial in unlocking some of the secrets of the universe.A compassionate and inspiring look at an extraordinary life, anchored by two of the best performances of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

I hope you find your equation,"The universe was born from a black hole exploding. What caused the explosion? Isn't it overwhelming, in a good way, that consciousness was born from giving instead of consuming? I don't think this is a false conclusion.The theory of everything has caught the essence of what they have intended to show and it is enough to call into action those who needed and wanted to understand the greater need of a person to contribute rather than be a passive part of a reaction. I don't think I realize yet what lies ahead. There is a need to be careful. There may be weights against us but those are weights that we may overcome. Heavy defeats? Defeats are a very human concept. There is only implosions and explosions. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed. You cannot limit to human attributes the magnitude of ideas spread here. Because in the first place, with our limitations, we cannot even fathom by the use of our limited senses and abilities, the implications of the concepts shaping this artwork. The lines, ""It's okay Robbie"" and ""The beginning of time."" offers the duality of perspective and equal weights and pull of its influence in directing his quality of life.Some particles can escape a black hole?

"Hopeful, illuminating and masterfully crafted","I had high hopes for ""The Theory of Everything"", but it also had me worried. The plot of this film is based on the book ""Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen"" by Jane Wilde Hawking and tells the story of how the author and her husband, famous theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, met and what their marriage and life together was like. I had some reservations about the movie initially because most of the people featured in the film are still alive, but the film is not a documentary. Could it be that they had such a compelling story to tell, and that the actors were just so talented that waiting any longer would have been a waste of time? This movie feels like one in a million. Not only in terms of overall quality, but also because it feels like all the stars have aligned and the people working here were all present at the right place, at the right time. If they hadn't seized the moment and made this movie, they would have missed a great opportunity. For some, the highlights will undoubtedly be the earth-shattering performances or the retelling of real-world events in such a frank and honest way, but for me it was what the movie was really about that had me hooked. This movie is about the life of Jane and Stephen Hawking, but what it's really about is people being prisoners of their own lives and how they manage, as best they can to escape their cells. What do I mean by this? Well, I don't think it's a spoiler when I tell you that real-life smart guy Stephen Hawking suffers from Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The man is trapped in his own body, barely able to move and presently, unable to talk except through the use of a computer. The movie shows you his physical degradation and the struggles that this entails as he becomes completely immobile. As Stephen becomes trapped, his crippling condition bears down on others as well. His wife becomes his round-the-clock caretaker, a a prisoner of her own responsibilities. This film has two parallel stories as these two people, struggle to free themselves, or make the best of the cage they had unfortunately found themselves in and as other people enter their lives, they also become inmates in this prison. I really enjoyed seeing the connections between all of the people between the people in their lives, how many of them also, in a way, ended up being prisoners because of their choices (like Jane's choice to marry Stephen despite knowing that he is affected by ASL) or Stephen's disease. I'm certain that the film would have been effective if it had focused simply on Stephen or Jane, but by showing us both of these stories, you really come to understand these two people and you fall in love with them.This movie could have dropped the ball in a number of ways, but I found that like any underdog story, it leaves you empowered and hopeful. Major credit is due to the two leads. The obvious actor to praise is Eddie Redmayne (fresh from the ""X-Men"" franchise) whose performance is so good it makes your average actor look like an amateur. Think about it. While at the beginning of the film we have Redmayne walking around and talking like your average guy, later the performance becomes much more subtle and much more difficult to pull off. You actually believe you're seeing the real-life Hawking because everything is bang on. The way his body is contorted on his wheelchair, the way he struggles with his words as the condition gets worse and in the end, the way that the tiniest movements in his only partially mobile face are used to convey real emotion are absolutely brilliant. I don't want you to focus solely on Redmayne though because Felicity Jones as his wife is just as good in a role that's even more complex. She convinces us that she's a woman that really loves her husband, but is in a way also mad at him for surviving the disease and robbing her of a normal life. I said earlier that this movie was about people being trapped; you almost feel worse for Jane because you see that she is a person that is both happy and sad at the same time, all of the time. Watching her, you can feel that she always has conflicting thoughts and emotions inside of her. All of her scenes are captivating.To wrap this up, I'll just list some of the other praises I have. I thought the score complimented the emotions and themes superbly. I never felt like I was being manipulated, as much as what I was feeling inside of me was being reflected musically by composer Philip Glass. I found the film to be very moving, but also quite funny at times, reflecting the fact that Hawking retained his sense of humor despite everything that happened. I thought everything was bang-on and I didn't even mind that because of Redmayne/Hawking's slurred speech, I missed a couple of lines here and there. I liked how the movie felt genuine, showing nobody as a perfect saint and never erroneously assuming that we needed to have someone do some heinous act and branding themselves a villain. I thought the screenplay showed profound intelligence and that it looked quite beautiful thanks to cinematographer Benoit Delhomme. Finally, I admire director James Marsh for bringing it all together.This film is sad at times, but more often than not it's very hopeful, very emotional and surprisingly, very funny. It really is something special and I bet the real-life Stephen and Jane Hawking would agree. Everyone's going to be saying this I'm sure, but watch out for this movie, you will be hearing about it again come Oscar season.

Stephen's character is portrayed and played by Eddie Redmayne and his wife, Jane by Felicity Jones. It was directed by James Marsh based on Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen by Jane Wilde Hawking. Throughout the movie, it had shown the struggles that Stephen had faced as well as his achievements and his personal life that many weren't aware of.We all know that Stephen's character is very hard to be impersonated hence the fact that he had the motor neuron disease. Unfortunately, this disease causes problems to his physical appearance and abilities when his muscle and neuron began degrading one by one. In the movie, not only did Eddie have portrayed the emotions well but he also had transformed himself physically so that the audience could understand how this disease brought so many changes into his life. The actors did a wonderful job at playing their roles which I found really captivating and I admire the efforts and emotions that they had put into this movie.There were uphill and downhill. The ending could have been more realistic but overall I think it was great.

"""Theory Of Everything"" Is Fascinating Biopic Of Stephen Hawking","I've read that some biblical scholars don't consider the New Testament to be a series of books about Jesus, but rather a series of books about Paul. Sure, the four gospels take us through the life of Jesus, but the remaining books either document Paul's ministry following Jesus' death, or they are Paul's epistles. These scholars have a point. While Jesus is the central figure, his acts and his teachings are seen through the recently-converted eyes of his greatest disciple.The same could be said for James Marsh's new film biography of physicist Stephen Hawking. Yes, Hawking is the central figure, but the story is told through the eyes of his wife, Jane Hawking. At first, I was bothered by the fact that Hawking's wife was given so much prominence in a film that should have dealt more with Hawking's scientific theories. But about halfway through, it dawned on me that this is not so much Hawking's story as it is that of his wife.Now, why would Marsh choose this approach? First, the film is based on Jane Hawking's memoir, so it's automatically as much her story as it is his. But I believe Hawking is a difficult character to ask the masses to relate to. His brilliance exceeds the mental capacities of most viewers so much that another character must be used as a conduit to bring Hawking within our mental grasp, if you will.Try to imagine a motion picture about Albert Einstein. A filmmaker could spend two hours attempting to explain the theory of relativity to the masses – a difficult, and not particularly interesting approach – or he could spend two hours disseminating Einstein's genius through the lens of another – a spouse, childhood friend, or professional colleague. Remember Milos Forman's ""Amadeus?"" A film biography about Mozart would have been fine, but it was Oscar-worthy when told through the jealous eyes of his less-talented rival Salieri. And the New Testament would have been fine had it stopped after the fourth gospel. But it only becomes tangible when filtered through the first great promulgator of his teachings.Young British actor Eddie Redmayne plays Hawking, and perfectly captures his genius, which becomes more focused as the years progress. At the same time, of course, Hawking's ability to communicate diminishes due to his motor neuron disease. Some critics have complained that Redmayne's performance isn't as strong as that of Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of artist Christy Brown, who suffered from cerebral palsy. I say Redmayne has, in a way, a more difficult task than Day-Lewis, because Hawking simply doesn't possess the fiery personality of Brown. Hawking is a fairly easygoing guy – especially considering his physical condition – and Redmayne does an excellent job of showing us his sly sense of humor, even without a voice. It's a great piece of acting, which is deserving of a Best Actor nomination.Meanwhile, it would be a crime if the academy does not also nominate Felicity Jones as Best Actress, in what I consider to be the best performance anyone's given in any film so far this year. Jones perfectly captures Jane Hawking's tender and supporting love for her husband, coupled with the inner strength she summons to live her own life. She is, at once, the gatekeeper of her husband's growing legacy, the strength he requires to lead as ""normal"" a life as possible, and a woman determined to carve her own niche in this world. The understated nuances of Jones' acting are a joy to watch.While ""The Theory of Everything"" suffers somewhat by never even making an attempt to explain Hawkings' teachings, that fault diminishes as the film progresses. Jane's independence and Stephen's stubbornness eventually lead to a split in their relationship and, eventually, their marriage. This turns out to be the most interesting section of the film, because their love and respect for each other never wavers, even as their lives begin to take on different trajectories.""The Theory of Everything"" is more a love story than it is a story about science. Don't expect to learn about what's inside Hawking's brain, but rather how it relates to those around him. Do expect to see a fascinating story about a modern-day genius and the independent woman who always has his back.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The ultimate female empowerment love story,"The Theory of Everything is the ultimate love story. Eddie Redmayne does a phenomenal job portraying physicist Stephen Hawking physically self-destructing as ALS cripples everything but his mind. Redmayne showcases the pain Hawking must have felt at each new struggle he faces — such as his inability to crawl upstairs as his baby curiously stares down at his daddy through the baby gate. But the heart of the film is Felicity Jones, who plays Jane, Hawking's determined wife. Jane refuses to let Stephen feel victimized, struggling to maintain a normal family life despite his crippling disease. Jane is the poster- child for the feminist wife: intelligent, determined and totally in control of her family.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

Life is cliché but you have the ability to turn it into something fantastic!,"I have read reviews about this movie being a total cliché. Well, think about life of any ordinary human being these days. You're born, luckily someone will take care of and love you -- parents -- and you're likely to go through pre-school, elementary, mid-school, high school, college and find a job, get married, have kids or a career. What is different in all of that? It is YOU!! You think, therefore you are able to make your existence worth. Some will make it, some will not. Some will get nowhere although they totally were born equipped and some will do so much better against all the odds. Life. We all look for the same thing: happiness! Find a point to support our existence, find our passion. and maybe, finding nothing at all, just live one day at a time and enjoying the show as it is. Some good days and bad days, but yes, as long as there is life, there is hope. It is a total cliché, and it is total true! Find your joy, find your passion, it might be just before your eyes!

Made me wonder about life itself,"Before I even saw it,I knew this was an extraordinary movie. But it startled me. This movie has so much strength in it. It is not just a story about very difficult life of Stepehen Hawking,it is also a movie about life, love ,sacrifice, strength,battles, science, restrictions, possibilities ... It is about so many things,that it's about the hardships of life itself. The story,the life of Stephen Hawking has inspired many,and made them wonder. It made me wonder. It made me wonder about what is worth fighting for in life,what is right,and what wrong. It told me that love has immense power over people,and over universe itself. We find purpose in life in small and in great things,we struggle,everyday,and every moment. And his life,his hard,difficult,and painful life is teaching us about what moments should we fight for,when to struggle,and when to give up. And we need help from others,we can never make it alone,and we never will. Universe itself is draining power from small particles,quantum. We need that particles in our everyday life,because they inspire us to do unimaginable things. We are all capable of doing wonderful things,which we have to fight for. Stephen Hawking did,and he won.

Touching and Privilege to Watch,"This is basically a love story between Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), and it is quite a love story and certainly not one you would normally expect or even hear about.In many ways this movie is a privilege for us to see things about Stephen and Jane Hawking, but also in many ways this is difficult to watch because we do not like to see anyone struggling with a non curable disease and also to see what wife Jane, as caregiver, goes through as well. We will see that our doing the most simple of things is quite difficult and complicated for Mr. Hawking to perform. I would suggest you keep a box of Kleenex handy as you will need it at times.Once Stephen Hawking is diagnosed to have ALS he is projected to live 2-years more. As we can see this did not happen and why he survives more than the 2-years is never explained or can be explained. Love? Divine Intervention? We needed to know his theories? HmmmmThe main focus for Stephen Hawking is that he wants to find an equation that will explain everything in the Universe. He believes he needs to prove that TIME had a beginning.The movie is about his marriage with science thrown in all the way through. Since we really do not know much about Stephen Hawking everything will be a surprise and I will not let the cat out of the bag. But here is what we do know: Mr. Hawking is a genius in our time and also has a great sense of humor. He has guested on The Simpsons and The Big Bang Theory TV shows and some of his comments herein will also show his wit.Eddie Redmayne who portrayed Mr. Hawking did so flawlessly to such a point we only saw Stephen Hawking, not Eddie Redmayne. What a great job. Kudos. Felicity Jones as Jane Hawking brought tremendous amounts of compassion to this story and sometimes we felt what she felt as we reached for that Kleenex box. We see many scenes between Stephen and Jane that are more than touching and are Pure Gold. Mr. Redmayne won the Oscar for Best Actor and Felicity Jones was nominated for Best Actress and it should have been awarded to her. (and not because you think she is very pretty?) The movie itself was nominated for Best Picture and it should have won for that.In our lives we tend to pray for family and friends at times. Keep in mind that it is okay to pray for geniuses too. Even though Doctor Stephen Hawking is an avowed Atheist, I don't think he would mind. At least I hope not. (10/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No Language: No.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Jane Hawking thou shalt not be overlooked!,"Marsh's finest piece is a biopic of the living (something producers rarely pick) miracle, Stephen Hawking. The life of the prodigy is smitten with misfortunes, wonders, eurekas, not to forget the love of his life Jane who sacrificed everything normal just to be with the polymath.The life of Hawking is in itself a melodramatic narrative which doesn't need any more filler to spice things up. It already reeks of mishap and tragedy. What is worth noticing is the fact that despite all the adversity that dangled around his life, it was still pulled off and buffed up brilliantly by Jane, without whom the master couldn't have made it.I place this biopic's direction above Morten Tyldum's work just for the fact that theories that people don't comprehend have been expounded brilliantly at different points of time in terms of simple examples one would understand, which was, in fact, missing in The Imitation Game. Marsh endeavors to make things relate to us by explaining Hawking's discoveries. Even whilst he does that he makes sure he doesn't miss out from the drama that the movie so gorgeously carries.Marsh captures every aspect, every crossroad and setback that Hawking faced in his life with perfection. People tend to remember only the renowned. But what Marsh did by manifesting the parallel life of Jane Hawking, the mental agony she had to go through, the dilemma of not leading a normal life, the vexation of all the work she did, the hope that lit up her dead verve, the broken chance to escape from everything, and the jilted emptiness are far more beautiful and worth commending.The story is also a beautiful reflection of mind's conundrum. It shows how at one point love dies and no matter what you do, and no matter how close you were at one point, it always meets the same fate. Comes a time when there is no other option but to let go. Sometimes for the sake of the happiness of your other half.Hawking is an epitome of hope. It just goes on to show us how a will to fight, a reason to live and the gusto to learn could never stop a brain from dying.Definitely worth our time!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

"An emotional and relationship-centered biopic, 'Everything' is a welcome change of pace","The stories of great people, particularly the great thinkers, have been source material for a number of acclaimed and awarded biopics, a sub-genre that has evolved a lot in the last decade. You can tell just by comparing two of 2014's best, each focused on one of the greatest British minds of the 20th century. There's ""The Imitation Game,"" the suspenseful, ""critical moment in the life of"" take on the life of mathematician and computer grandfather Alan Turing, and then ""The Theory of Everything,"" an emotional romance taking the ""snippets in the chronological life of"" approach to theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking.Taken from Jane Hawking's memoir, it makes sense why ""The Theory of Everything"" tells us more about her and Stephen's relationship than it does about Stephen's work. For those interested more in the science of Stephen's life and work, it's a film that will disappoint on some level; director James Marsh and writer Anthony McCarten are far more interested in the philosophy and ideology that influenced Stephen's way of thinking, and how Jane influenced him as well.""The Theory of Everything"" is also a chronicle of a crippling disease. We meet Stephen (Eddie Redmayne) at Cambridge, where he meets and falls in love with Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) and shortly thereafter learns he's suffering from ALS, a fatal disease. Stricken with depression, he tries to distance himself from Jane, but she insists on staying by his side. We slowly watch Stephen lose the ability to move parts of his body until he becomes wheelchair bound and can no longer speak. Yet miraculously the disease never claims his life, and never affects his mind, even if it does take a heavy toll on his family.Redmayne certainly deserves all the praise in the world for being able to honestly and authentically portray the evolving disabilities, but his performance is so much more than such surface-level awards-bait fodder. Redmayne's true accomplishment is how he lets Stephen's personality grow and shine through despite of the physical limitations. Through eye contact and facial expressions, he paints something special despite the clear restrictions of his brush. Stephen's spirit really shows, and it adds to what's already an emotional film.Yet Stephen is not the sole focal point of this movie. Jane is very much his equal, and in many ways, the film is really about her, a woman's struggle to be the caretaker she set out to be, what it is like to feed and clothe and literally care for an internationally famous person incapable of doing those basic things for himself. She is a complex character, both strong and weak, shoving aside expectations of how she should or shouldn't behave or think at every opportunity. A young-faced 30-year-old, Jones is trusted to convey age and maturity as the film goes on (the makeup doesn't really get the job done), and she does in a way most actresses her age simply have yet to demonstrate in their careers.Marsh and the film's casting director, Nina Gold, deserve a whopping commendation for trusting in such young talent to convey these people at such mature stages of their relationship. Most films would've gone with older veterans knowing they could get away with them playing Stephen and Jane in their 20s and that later in the film they would fit naturally. Instead, they got two lesser-known but rising stars who have long careers ahead of them and could still probably fill these roles 15 years from now.""The Theory of Everything"" only lacks in compelling drama. It's a portrait of two people and the ups and downs of their relationship, making it a much more indie take on the life of a famous person rather than the Hollywood prestige biopic route that won ""A Beautiful Mind"" the Best Picture Oscar. More concisely, it will move audiences far more than it will entertain them, which for the biographical genre, is actually refreshing.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Beautiful and humble love story,"The Theory of Everything is brilliant, beautiful and most of all honest movie. It won't mince it's story and other way it won't take pity on Hawking's dramatic life.

It is a story how relationship will be put to test in this hard situation, but it is also a beautiful story how sustainable true love can be. Eddie Redmayne is brilliant as slowly crippling Hawking and deserves his is if he will pick it. Felicity Jones acts strongly as Hawking's wife, but I not well enough to deserve Oscar from her role. This movie is humble and touching story, but many ways very positive story. Somehow the whole story feels much bigger than life.

Redmayne's performance is still the best Oscar winning performance of the decade!,"This film is about the life of Stephen Hawking - played by Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne - and his wife Jane - played by Academy Award Nominee Felicity Jones. When he was at Cambridge, he was diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease, with the doctors giving him only two years to live. Needless to say, he was distraught. But it was his love for Jane and her love for him that pushed him forward. Needless to say, he lasted way longer than two years. As his condition deteriorated, his mind soared to new heights and he is considered to be one of the best scientists of all time. But it was the struggles and the triumphs with Jane at home that really tested their relationship.You can't review this film and not talk about the phenomenal performance that comes from Eddie Redmayne. I simply cannot say ANYTHING bad about his performance here. He throws himself into the role and his dedication to it was absolutely astounding. Apparently, he sat in that wheelchair for so long that he altered his spine. But in the end, it was worth it, as his dedication and performance earned him the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It was well earned and well deserved, as his performance reminded me of Daniel Day-Lewis' Oscar winning performance as Christy Brown in My Left Foot. Yes: Redmayne was THAT good.However, what makes this film truly great is that neither of the two leads outshine each other, which brings us to Felicity Jones' performance. Her performance provides the other half of the emotional weight of the film. As Jane, you can see how much she loves Stephen...how much she cares for him...and how much it crushes her to see his condition deteriorate. You can also see the emotional toll that it takes on her, as she balances dealing with a husband whose condition is worsening and kids running around the house. You can see the struggle that she faces while juggling all of these things. While Eddie Redmayne's performance was superb, Felicity Jones was just as good, and both of them provided the story with an amazing amount of drama.Absolutely go and see this movie. Go and see it for these two performances. While there were many great things about this film, it's really Redmayne and Jones that bring out everything great about it. It's the chemistry between them; it's the sadness between them; it's the joyfulness between them; it's everything between them. They are the film, and they truly shine!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A brilliant film on a brilliant man that was made even better by Eddie Redmayne's stunning performance,"It is a brilliant film, as good as a biopic can be in all honesty. It is sad in many ways, to the extent in fact that throughout the whole length of the film I sat with a heavy heart and with a lump in my throat, but at the same time it allows us to celebrate the career and the achievements of a man highly capable and most determined to fight himself more than anything/anyone else. The scene where he breaks down in tears when his wife suggests of herself finally wanting to part from him is just..... If I see that again it could potentially lead me to depression. I would need days to get over it.A special mention for Eddie Redmayne. For a moment I had myself asking whether this is the Professor himself acting in the film! Equally, I would like to mention the film-makers for making his physical appearance look so similar.I can relate to a thousand things from the film and his life, yet on the other hand a lot of the things not because I have yet lived a third of his life. Most memorable one for me keeping in mind my personal experiences, has to be the bit about tracheotomy and the loss of speech caused by it. I could have had to face exactly the same but since thankfully mine was a less severe case I went against the advice of the doctors and was rewarded for my hard work and determination by regaining the ability to breathe independently (except whilst asleep) within weeks by training so hard. So the moment it was mentioned and alongside it him losing speech, it hit me hard, as it did to elder sister who watched the film with me. I wasn't willing on her to join me knowing how for an impact it could have on her, but I couldn't ask her to leave the room, the result of which is that she keeps mentioning the film again and again and is finding it difficult to forget it.It is a overall a very sensitive topic to comment on much, so I would refrain from doing that, but there perhaps a few things that could have been done or managed differently in order for him to avoid a lot of troubles and the heartaches that he had to bear, but again we have to keep in mind that the events discussed are from many, many years ago and people back then thought differently about things as we might do in this age. Also, this is hindsight for you, and it is a lot easier to analyse others' lives than to be in someone else's place.Again, a brilliant film from every angle.

Stephen Hawking...,"""The Theory of Everything"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we follow the life of the famous physicist, Stephen Hawking, his relationship with his wife and his personal life in general.I liked this movie very much because it was based on the life of a very important scientist and its plot was very interesting, too. His life and his career were both very interesting and the way it was changed by an unexpected illness. The direction which was made by James Marsh was very good and he presented the life of Stephen Hawking in a beautiful way while he succeeded on presenting his scientific career and his progress. The interpretation of Eddie Redmayne who played as Stephen Hawking (he won the Academy Award for the Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role) was outstanding and he made the difference. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Felicity Jones' who played as Jane Hawking. In conclusion, I have to say that ""The Theory of Everything"" is a nice biography movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because Stephen Hawking was a very important scientist and worth learning about him and his career.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A Well Made Film With Terrific Acting,"""The Theory of Everything"" is an adaption of the memoir of Jane Hawking, wife of renowned cosmologist Stephen Hawking, the Oxford professor who is as well known for his struggle with ALS and being confined to a wheel chair as he is for his work on black holes and astrophysics. The movie examines Hawking's life, paying particular attention to his personal life with wife Jane and their three children, all of whom were born after Hawking was diagnosed with ALS. The film features some of the strongest acting that you're likely to see in the 2015 Oscar field, with both Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne turning out stellar performances —but, in the interest of being honest, it's Redmayne that really steals the show, as he becomes Hawking in a way that eclipses most any role that has ever been played on the silver screen. It would be a travesty if Redmayne were not to win the Oscar this year, and while I have yet to see the other films that the Best Actress pool of nominees is pulled from, Redmayne may win Best Actress for Jones as well. We shall see.That having been said, the film itself is overall quite well made and is ultimately time well spent. Still, the storyline itself ultimately makes the film take a bit of a hit, as its hard to make Hawking's narrative into as enjoyable of an experience as other films in the biographical genre, even those that are equally tragic in nature (such as its 2015 Best Picture competitor ""The Imitation Game"", which tells the story of fellow British academic and genius, Alan Turing). The end result here is a strong film with amazing acting, but one which ultimately only deserves 8/10 stars in terms of its overall quality—granted that this 8/10 movie is yet a very impressive work in its own right.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"""My Left Foot"" meets ""A Beautiful Mind""","When we first see the hero is Stephan Hawking's well-deserved biopic we see him happily riding his bike carefree with his friend. The ability to do this is short lived as we all know his physical condition will slowly deteriorate. Nonetheless he maintains his will to live for although his motor skills go away, he will he have the ability to think and do his best work as a physicist and arguably the smartest human being alive.Eddie Redmayne is absolutely superb and Oscar-worthy as Hawking. Even before he's given the tragic news, his body language suggests he has this disease. As his speech grows more intelligible, I was reminded of Daniel Day Lewis's Oscar winning performance as Christy Brown in ""My Left Foot"". In the last half of the movie when he can't talk, he provides enough emotion in his facial expressions for the audience to feel for him.With all the brilliant work Hawkings has done in his life, the main focus is the love story with his first wife Jane (well acted by Felicity Jones). It starts with a Meet Cute at a party where it's revealed they have not much in common. He's a secular atheist, she's a member of the Church of England. However what they do both have is an interest of the creation of everything. This is shown in a party scene while as they're looking at the stars, she quotes Genesis.In describing Hawking's thought process the movie uses what I thought were pretty clever visuals (including one shot with his coffee) though they could be too obvious for other people. He is also always changing his mind and challenging himself. His college thesis sets out to prove an existence of a being (like God) that created time while he later argues against it. It is implied that his deteriorating condition could be the reason for the change of heart.As his story with his wife and family are shown, it at times feels pretty conventional. For example we see footage of his family growing up like they were home movies. Jane is a character who loves her husband and tries to cope with his condition while maintaining their marriage. Her character is not dissimilar to the one Jennifer Connelly played in ""A Beautiful Mind"" who faced a similar struggle with her brilliant but medically unstable husband.There are a few interesting things about Hawking I didn't know like the fact that he's British. There's a humorous scene when he first gets his computerized voice machine and they note: ""It's American.""What happens to their relationship and Hawking's life as a physicist and best-selling author I will not spoil for you, since as a true story I'm sure it is fairly common knowledge. Though the film often feels conventional and derivative, it is still a brilliant acted, well shot and directed, inspirational film and will even make you think a little bit afterwards.

The film is amazing, the way they did it showing us every single detail and the message behind it is just speechless.

I don't have the words to describe the amazing man he was and still is.

The storyline (which only has a few minor diversions in detail from the factual) is totally gripping.This film portrays Hawking in a very accessible way, so much so that I feel I now know this man very well - and my admiration for him has also grown.Don't expect a film full of Hawking's theories, or wallowing in praise for his achievements. This film looks at the personality and character of a very interesting and likable man in a truly entertaining way - and the acting is absolutely superb.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
The Theory of Everything is Everything You Wanted and More,"Hit with the diagnosis of motor neuron disease, 23 year old Stephen Hawking was given a mere two years to live. Having survived another 5 decades, his health had large part to do with his first love Jane Hawking (well, Wilde). Based of Wilde's 2007 memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen, The Theory of Everything has an ability for you to feel defeated and triumphant at the same time.
The film follows Stephen (Eddie Redmayne) and Jane (Felicity Jones) from their first encounter in college through the 30 years of marriage that was a extraordinary struggle for both parties. Stephen struggling more and more with his impending demise, Jane puts her education and future career on hold. Having to do all the care for not only their three children but for the physicist as well, Jane had issues from the beginning. Stephen pursued his worked, publishing two books in the span of the marriage. He had a better understanding of the universe, then his one wife's needs. When she pleaded for assistance in care taking of the family, Stephen pushed harder saying it was unneeded. When they both hit a breaking point they find a choirmaster from the church, Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox), that assists Jane in her daily duties for both Stephen and the children. He also stirs up emotions that are just another issue to the collapsing marriage. When Stephen finally gets a full time nurse, is the union is irreparable.
The Theory of Everything does something unexpected, if you heard the movie was going to be about a world renowned physicist, you would expect any love story to be thrown out the window. This film is different, you believe in the love between Stephen and Jane. Eddie Redmayne, most known for his part in Les Misérables, trades in his immense singing voice for a role with growing limitations. It may not have not been set in the ever dangerous French Revolution, but the role of the disease stricken physicist was extremely trying and it is showcased. Redmayne did remarkable work making you believe that he himself was struggling with ALS, but never stopped bringing the same joy and triumph from the beginning to the end, no matter how many words were spoken. Being extremely physically demanding, Eddie Redmayne did a incredible helping see the other side the renowned scientist; a loving husband and caring father.
Although the Theory of Everything is a modern film or artistry, it does have its downfalls. Throughout the film you see Jane struggle with everything she has done for the relationship, but you don't really see what Stephen did to help speed the impending demise. You start to hatred toward the lovely Jane because she just wants to live the life she wanted. She is loathed by the audience for merely trying to receive a life she deserves. Playing Stephen off as divine and not at all the cause of the forthcoming split. It takes two people and Jane and all she did for him was being taken for granted. In the end, you learn to appreciate the time they had together as if you were apart of their lives. You feel as if you are both happy and sad with how the way things turn out.
The script causes you to cherish the ability we have to communicate. As time goes on, Stephen slowly loses his ability to speak and express emotions, but the one person who was always there to interpret his words, thoughts, and feelings was Jane. As he lost the ability to function as a normal person and deprived of living his former life, Felicity Jones is magnificent in how she picks up the pieces and keeps up an outstanding performance.
The direction of the film is truly its holy grail. James Marsh, famous for is academy award winning documentary, Man on a Wire, truly knows how to make true stories feel as if you are in them. The use of close up and point of view puts you in the movie. When Stephen is receiving the devastating news, you see it from his point of view, looking at the doctor telling him he has limited time you see how everything else starts to become a large blur. You step out of the theater into the film and it leaves a lasting effect like no other. Marsh handles the instrumental task of not only somebody's work but they love and care it took to create it. All the devastations and all victories, you are placed in the world with them.
The Theory of Everything is extremely moving. You are placed into the movie and for two hours you live in a different time. It's heartbreaking and inspiring in how love conquers diagnosis and how a diagnoses can become the downfall to a relationship. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones put on two marvelous performances that will not be forgotten.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Masterpiece,One of the finest movies i have seen. Brilliant direction and acting. Stephen hawking would be proud of this too.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Almost perfect,"The theory of everything 8/10
My expectation was very high, i was expecting to see a perfect film 
From the title and the story of the film i was hoping to see a scientific film about the famous physicist Stephen Hawking and his theory's, but i got sad disappointed a little bit, the film ignored so much the science and focused on drama and romance mostly which was good , it does tell an inspiring story about Stephen Hawking's personal life and struggles with his health issues
Its could have been perfect if they just added some real science to this film",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Portrayed and told brilliantly.,"The acting was just sensational. Eddie Redmayne encompasses the character of Stephen Hawking so well, that I almost came to believe that Hawking himself was in the film. His slight facial expressions down to his minor feet movements were just so detailed and done with so much care and precision that I cannot give him enough credit. Felicity Jones as well, played her part really well and you could really feel her love emitting from her. The chemistry between them was just too good; it was heartbreaking to watch. This may be the best love story ever portrayed.Not knowing much of Hawking's life myself, I'm not sure how credible this film is, but Hawking himself seems to be satisfied that it mainly depicts the truth. It didn't really seem like much drama was added to it to make the film more 'exciting', so I'm going to believe that most of what was shown is the truth. My interest has definitely been peaked after seeing this, and I definitely want to give a go at reading ""The Theory of Everything"" as well as Jane Hawking's book ""Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen"", which this film is based on.The cinematography was marvellous and I could really notice when great shots were taken. It added so much depth and feel to the film. Kudos to Marsh, this was brilliantly made.One thing I would've liked a bit more was probably to have more of an insight into Hawking's emotions. I got the feeling that the only one who was troubled was Jane, when obviously Hawking is the one with ALS and would've had emotional or psychological breakdowns as well. Or maybe it just wasn't known because he couldn't really speak, or that his coping skills are really top class as from what this film depicts, he has a humorous personality which might have helped him with the disease.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
"A real gem, great script, a very talented cast, and a believable touching story","I expected this movie to be an overly romanticized sugar coated version of Jane and Stephen Hawking That's probably the reason why I didn't rush to the theater to see the film. Although, it's tastefully done, the story is does not shy away from the difficulty they faced.The Theory of Everything seamlessly shows their life, the personal side of thing, and it's no romantic comedy. The film tells a great deal of what this brilliant man and his wife had to endure. Jane married this genius man, on borrowed time, planning to cherish the little time they had but in time found herself with a husband, whose slowly crumbling body, demands a lot of her. Stephen, this brilliant young man, who had a bright future in front of him, found himself faced with a hurdle he can't possibly overcome and only live with. Their story is beautifully told, fascinating but also cruel.The Theory of Everything is subtle and clever. Like I said, it's not an overly sugar-coated and romanticized story of Stephen and Jane Hawking. They are portrayed as strong and determined people but they're also flawed, which makes them human and very likable. I was touched all the way through, immersed into the story and into their lives, but I did not pity them I admired them. The immersion into the story is wonderfully accompanied by the score. It gives an extra layer to such a beautiful story.The cast is just superb, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones really deserve the nominations and awards they got because they carried the movie. Redmayne was incredible and once you fathom the amount of work and details that went into this performance, you realize how impressive Eddie Redmayne's performance is. Felicity Jones, though, is the cherry on top the movie wouldn't have been as good without her in it. She's sweet and incredibly good as Jane Hawking her eyes speak for themselves in the movie. She's brilliant.As Biopics go, The Theory of Everything is a great one among the many we had this year with Unbroken, and The Imitation Game, or Selma. When the story's great and you have a very talented cast, the director is often overlooked James March did a stellar job.I now understand what all the fuss is about. The Theory of everything as a great script, talented cast, is believable and touching.@wornoutspines",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"

When I tell you I cried... I mean it!,"I already started crying in the beginning and I simply could not stop. I never thought this would be the most emotional movie I've watched.This movie tells the story of the famous physicist Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane. At a young age Hawking gets a muscle disease and doctors assume he only had 2 years the life. This is were I started crying. I think it's beautiful how his, then still, girlfriend told him she'd stay with him until the end. Here I cried even harder. They try to live their life the best without thinking to much about the future and the even start a family. You can see how they both struggle, but still manage to stay strong. That's a thing I really liked about this movie, how well the emotions are portrayed. I also loved how Stephen's personality didn't change because of his condition. He still had a good sense of humour and everyone loved him for it!So the storyline started off strong, but it stopped getting better half way through. I still cried, but I didn't like how they focussed more on the relationship between Jonathan and Jane than her relationship with Stephen. His relation with Elaine on the other hand, happens very fast and we don't really get to see how it ends, nor did they give them a happy ending like they did with Jane. The whole ending was actually a big anticlimax, because I literally stopped crying.As I said, the movie involves their love story, so it doesn't focus too much on his discoveries and theories. If you've read the description before watching the movie, that probably didn't bother you, but if you haven't, like me, the title is very misleading. I thought it would be more about his work, while it's actually only about his disease and his relationship with Jane.The movie is visually so beautiful and the acting is simply outstanding. Redmayne did a great job, he really made me feel things. The rest of the cast was decent too, but I don't think anyone can surpass the lead in this.It's a good love story though and I also love how his friends helped him so much. I'd defend recommend you it if you want to see a story about love and friendship and need a good cry!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Incredible and Life Changing Movie For Me,"The Acting Performance of Eddie Readmayne was Incredible and Very Strong.

Best movie of 2014! Well I haven't seen unbroken yet.,"I came in to the movies having high expectations and came out still thinking about everything that happened. And realizing that it exceeded it completely! It was amazing, nothing has ever intrigued me more. The acting was wonderful and flawless! I thought they were the real people and weren't acting at all. The way it was filmed was amazing and exciting! I've never seen anything more perfectly shot! And the true story is amazing, I really want to read all of Stephen's books now! It's so... so... perfect and seemingly flawless. Though I am not a professional film critic. I have to assume anyone can love this movie. Watch it!

Good Representation of Disability... Under the Circumstances,"The 2014 film The Theory of Everything, based on Jane Hawking's memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, depicts the life of theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne). The film does not just focus on Hawking's progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease that causes him to be in a wheelchair and speak through a computer system. It shows his relationship with his ex-wife, Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), and his successes in physics. ALS is fittingly shown as just one part of Hawking's extraordinary life.The movie has received criticism for casting Redmayne as Hawking and being ""the latest"" performance ""in a long line of what detractors call 'cripping up': able-bodied actors taking on disabled roles, which some critics find as deplorable as the thankfully outdated practice of white actors pretending to be black"". I too would be critical of this casting decision were it not for the special circumstances of this film.The film is meant to reflect Jane Hawking's memoir, a story that shows Hawking's life before and after his diagnosis and through every stage of his ALS's progression. This situation is not identical to a character who is always seen in a wheelchair being played by a nondisabled actor or a character who is born blind being played by a seeing actor. When the circumstances prevent the role of a disabled character from being filled by a disabled actor, there are certain steps that must be taken to ensure that the experiences of disabled people are as accurately portrayed as possible. The Theory of Everything does a very good job of fulfilling this criteria.First of all, Redmayne spent over four months studying Hawking's life, watching every video he could find on him and reading books written by him. Redmayne worked with a choreographer to record and analyze every movement from picking up a pen to drinking to walking. To understand and accurately portray how the disease affected Hawking throughout the different stages, Redmayne met with over 30 people affected by ALS and viewed photographs of Hawking throughout his life.Most importantly, Hawking was consulted during every stage of the movie's production. Redmayne met with him before starting to film, and he visited the set during production. Before the movie was released, Hawking viewed the film and gave his approval. Redmayne's hard work paid off, as Hawking called the film ""broadly true"" and that there were ""certain points when he thought he was watching himself"". After the screening, ""Hawking was so pleased with the movie"" that he let the filmmakers use his own, trademarked computerized voice.In instances when disabled characters cannot be played by disabled actors, it is crucial that people affected by that specific disability are included in the process and that their concerns are listened to. Since everyone's experiences are different, multiple people must be consulted. The experiences of disabled people must not be misrepresented, and the reinforcement of stereotypes must be avoided. The motto of the disability rights movement, ""Nothing about us without us"", applies to media representations as well.When portraying disability, care must be taken to ensure accurate representation and people within the disability community must be included in the process.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
A thought full story line,"Focused on his relationship with his first wife, Jane (the film is based on her own autobiography). It has little interest in what Stephen Hawking is about, except for very cursorily. I guess that's not a huge problem, but, frankly, I don't know that much about Hawking and wished I had gotten to learn more from this movie. It does deal a lot with his disease and health struggles, which I suppose many are more interested in. The film will surely be most notable for its two lead performances. Eddie Redmayne certainly nails the physical side of Hawking and projects a very clear character. Felicity Jones, though, does better work as the woman who has to work very hard to make their lives work. No one else really registers much (though David Thewlis and Emma Watson, among many others, are featured), but that doesn't really matter. The filmmaking is competent but not notable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
Fell in love with every bit of this film,"Right from the very beggining of the film, I was very intrigued by the story itself. And right when I was ready to engage myself to the film, I see Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking, I was already sold to it. I could watch it even if it were 6 or 10 hour long. I have seen so many biopics earlier each had its own place in a way but this one will always stay special to me, the actors, story, narrative, even the landscapes, photography, the very lights in each frame just blew me away. And It wasn't done yet, I still listen to the OST of this film, after 2 years since I saw it, and Arrival of Birds is one of the top played songs on my playlist. I would love to elaborate on the story and how fascinated I was to watch this beautifully crafted film but that wouldn't be called a review, it would be called a thesis, Just kidding. The last few minutes of the film, I had tears in my eyes and the music queues, I couldn't feel my legs after the movie ended and I still love this film to the very core of it. Each actor did the very best of what they could and I can never see any such performance ever again, nor I will ever company any other film, actors, performances or anything with this film.Grandeur!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Romance"
