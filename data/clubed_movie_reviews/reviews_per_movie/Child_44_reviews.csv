"Good, but could have been great",Sort of confused about the massive chasm between ratings Seems you either love this movie or hate it. I thought it was good. Started off strong and had a reasonably strong story-line but got a bit lost midway through. Sort of seemed they needed to finish up the movie and just rushed it at the end like they lost track of time. Had potential to be much better but still considered it suitably entertaining.,7.0,Anonymous,History
There is no Murder in Paradise,"The Ukranian orphan Leo is raised by a Russian family and becomes national hero during the World War II. In the 50's, Captain Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy), his best friend Alexei Andreyev (Fares Fares) and the coward Vasili Nikitin (Joel Kinnaman) join the Ministry of State Security (MGB) during the political regime of Stalin and Leo marries Raisa Demidov (Noomi Rapace). When Alexei's son is found murdered completely naked near the railway, the official explanation is that the boy was hit by a train since there is no murder in paradise since it is a capitalist disease. But Leo finds other similar cases and proceeds investigating, falling in disgrace with the Party. He loses his rank and is transferred with Raisa to Volsk to work with General Mikhail Nesterov (Gary Oldman). When a body of another boy is found near the railway in the same conditions of Alexei's son, Leo convinces Nesterov that there is a serial-killer and he agrees that Leo conducts a further investigation. Meanwhile the ambitious Vasili tries to persuade Raisa to leave Leo and move to Moscow to stay with him. What will happen to Leo and Raisa?""Child 44"" is a film with a promising storyline, great performances but not engaging. The political subplot is weird and raises the doubt whether it is true the premise that ""there is no murder in paradise"" or it is an anti-soviet propaganda as mentioned in the previous review. In a controlled political society by a dictatorship, it is expected low crime rates as consequence. But why not secretly investigate a serial-killer? My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Crimes Ocultos"" (""Hidden Crimes"")",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Doesn't quite come together right, I still enjoyed it though.","'CHILD 44': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A mystery thriller film; starring Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace and Gary Oldman. Hardy plays a security officer, that's investigating a child murderer, in 1950s (Stalin era) Soviet Union. The film was directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Richard Price; it's based on the novel, of the same name, by Tom Rob Smith (the first of a trilogy of books). It also costars Joel Kinnaman, Vincent Cassel and Jason Clarke. The movie was a bomb at the box office, and got mostly negative reviews from critics, but I enjoyed it.Leo Demidov (Hardy) is a former war hero, that now works as an MGB agent, in the 1950s Soviet Union. He's a strong supporter of Stalin, and his country's ideals, but when a series of children start turning up dead, his loyalty is put to the test; being that murder is not supposed to exist there (it's believed to be only a capitalism crime). When his partner's son is killed, he refuses to go along with the government's cover-up (of the crime), and he's exiled; along with his wife (Rapace). Despite their treatment, Leo continues to pursue the killer, and justice.The movie is well directed, written and full of great performances; especially Tom Hardy (my favorite male actor). Some people have a problem with the fact that the actors all speak English, in the film, but with Russian accents; that didn't bother me. I actually like the characters (especially Hardy's) and the insightful political commentary of those times; I found the movie to be quite involving as well. Maybe one of the main problems, with the film, is that the first cut was 5.5 hours long; and now it's less than 2.5 hours. It's a lot of story, and character development, crammed into one movie. The film is actually pretty fast paced too, it just doesn't quite come together right. I still enjoyed it though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/5zwAFiaOqq4",7.0,Anonymous,History
Guns to reviewer monkeys,"The only reason I am writing are view is because some simpletons have actually given this 1 star, what kind of idiot thinks this is 1 star viewing? Do not believe these trolls, whilst I prefer films to be in the local language this does not detract from such a good movie. My only criticism is that the killers reasons are not explored enough and too much emphasis is on the central characters rather than the story line. Having said that, such strong performances easily rate this a 7. Gary Oldman is excellent as usual and Tom Hardy is the thinking persons go to actor, but Naomi in my humble opinion was the standout character and elevated the survival instinct interest inside the USSR to a believable level. Like Downfall,if a Russian version was available this would have made such stronger viewing but I am more than happy with what I saw.",7.0,Anonymous,History
We're already dead,"Child 44 is so much more than just crime. Yes the movie rotates about the killing of children however the actual drama, tension and horrific atmosphere lays in the system and society/politics during that time (true or fictional is not up to me to decide on). The movie managed to paint an intense picture of a very special era. Disturbing, and in its authenticity and accuracy plain awful to watch. Fear and paranoia washes out even the smallest bit of kindness.
despotism everywhere, no matter what u do or don't do, everything can be interpreted as wrong and used against u. condemn was only one vehicle for pure cruelty and destroying life after life after life.
The male lead said at one point:
We're already dead. Which was only one of many memorable situations which left me speechless and touched me deeply.

From Russia with Crime,"Not sure how accurate some of the things are (this is based on a novel which is based on real events) we get to see in this movie. But you could believe that some of the things would have been possible to happen. It's no wonder that Russia was not really happy about the book of course (not the best depiction of authority or anything else going on there). Haven't looked up how the movie was received, but I can't imagine they welcomed it with open arms.Tom Hardy is as straight an arrow as you can get in this one, but he gets major support by Noomi and Gary to name but two. The incidents occurring that the movie is about apart from the human side of it, are despicable, not that anyone was actually confirming them. It's a tough watch especially because of its pacing, but it's solid and suspenseful from beginning to end",7.0,Anonymous,History
"There is greatness here, muddled by inconsistency and superfluous subplots.","This is a movie I've kept my eye on ever since it was revealed. Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman are two of my favorite working actors, and having them co-lead a Russian serial killer film seemed like a slam dunk. Unfortunately, Child 44 is not the slam dunk it could have been. It has the talent, it has the story (based on the best-selling novel); all the ingredients necessary for greatness are there. But it also has a plethora of baggage that bogs it down to mediocrity.Tom Hardy is the star of the film through and through. It's a story about his family life and professional life clashing over the case of a dead child. The officials want to pass it off as a train accident, but witnesses swear that it was a homicide. As more and more bodies start turning up and the higher-ups continue to look away, it's up to Hardy to find the killer and bring him to justice. Again, the acting in this film is great, as is the story. The problem is the way it's presented. Half of the movie is focused on the serial killer angle and Hardy's character going through the loops of finding the right person to help him on the case, and the other half is about Soviet officials exiling his family and stripping him of power for his disobedience. The way these stories intertwine is messy and confusing, for a number of reasons.For starters, the tone is all over the place. What should be a dark, gloomy mystery among the cold streets of Soviet Russia ends up as a haphazardly arranged domestic dispute due to political interference with a child murderer lurking around somewhere. There's no time for momentum to build when it's constantly changing course. Gary Oldman being billed a co-lead is a huge stretch. He's in the movie for about 20 minutes total and his character doesn't do much to further the story. Mind you, it's Gary Oldman so he gives a fine performance, but as someone who was looking forward to Hardy and Oldman sharing the scene for two plus hours, I was disappointed to say the least.And then there's the practical aspect. Hardy and Oldman are accent chameleons, there's no doubt about that. I didn't even know Oldman was British until I saw him in an interview. But why on earth are these Russian soldiers speaking to each other in English? For a wider audience no doubt, but it's such a basic matter of common sense that it bugged me continuously throughout the film. It's also far too long. A serial killer hunt stretched over the course of two hours and 15 minutes is exhausting. The tension becomes less and less dire as the movie progresses until you're just waiting for it to end.Child 44 isn't a bad movie, but its flaws are glaring. It's not the dark, edgy thriller you'd expect. In fact, to call it a thriller would be a misnomer. Child 44 is a tone-deaf political drama filled to the brim with wasted potential.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Dark matter,"I watched this film with a definite unease, having read the description of the film I didn't find it hugely appealing, just because of the subject matter, which is particularly dark, but because Mr Hardy is in it, I had to watch it. They managed to take us back to Stalin's Russia, we see a brief glimpse of how tough life was for people back then, those poor people were living in horrendous conditions. The story in brief, The State have turned Russia into a Paradise, crime simply isn't possible, and the thought of a child killer unthinkable, but when young boys are being found murdered along the train tracks the unthinkable is happening. Security Officer Leo Demidov is disgraced, but believes a Serial killer is to blame, and despite the vast obstacles the state puts in place, he sets out to find the killer. Tom Hardy (of course) and Gary Oldman are particularly brilliant, and there are also wonderful performances from Paddy Considine and Petr Vanek and many others. As I've mentioned it is quite harrowing matter, but it's not overly done, mercifully the scenes aren't that gory, it could have been dreadfully overdone. I eagerly anticipate the next instalment. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
Better Than I Expected...,"OK, so before I watched this movie, I was reading reviews online and saw so many horrible reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave it like 27%, so I thought this movie was going to be a disaster.Luckily, it wasn't so.Now, I'm not going to get into the propaganda and all that or how they got their facts and history wrong and stuff. American (and other nations) movies bend stories to their bias all the time, so we've come to take what we see with a grain of salt.All I'll say is this:If like me, you're a Tom Hardy fan and you're watching Children 44 because you can't get enough of Tom Hardy's acting, then you're actually in for a treat as you watch the guy attempt to handle his role as a Russian anti-hero quite successfully.In fact, generally the acting from the cast was great. Gary Oldman didn't have much screen time but he was excellent as always.The plot and many parts however, had their flaws, convenient plot devices and ""Why the hell would he do that??!!!"" moments. These, in my opinion, are the downside to this movie.On a whole, this movie is definitely worth a watch for the appreciation of how some of our favorite actors and actresses handled their respective roles in Child 44.And if you don't want to get your panties in a bunch over how this or that wasn't portrayed accurately, watch with an open mind, and you may actually enjoy this movie like I did.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"An overly ambitious film, but still an interesting one.","Honestly, I expected a little more from this movie. I found it on television, just by chance, but I had already heard about it, I'm not sure for what purpose, but I had the impression that it was a very good film. It's not as good as I expected, as it gets a little lost between politics and police mystery, and that ends up compromising the pace.It all starts with a drama where an MGB agent named Leo Demidov tries to protect his wife after a political prisoner denounces her as his accomplice. The effort pays off, but it's so obvious that he wanted to protect her that his superiors send him to an industrial city on the outskirts of Ukraine. Meanwhile, he will have to tell a friend that his son died in an alleged train accident, but it is clear that the child was murdered. In the new city where he is posted, Leo discovers many more cases of children in the same situation, deducing that there is a murderer killing children along the railway line. The problem is to convince the Soviet police that these crimes are not exclusive to the capitalist world.The film has good dialogues and the script is very good, but I felt that it is too ambitious and that it ends up not being able to handle it well. The difficulty in reconciling the two subplots (the criminal on the loose and the protagonist's conflict with the fanatical authorities), both equally powerful and relevant, is palpable. There is another plot point that leaves me with a lot of doubts, and that has to do with how Leo's wife changes radically, from someone passive and without relevance in the story to an active and cooperative figure, central to the following events. If this change, on the one hand, made it possible to put her back at the center of events, it also seems to be an inconsistency. The ending isn't bad, but it's inelegant: the atmosphere of tension and suspense gives way to more action, in absolute contrast to what the film had been doing.The cast features several well-known actors, starting with Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace in the lead roles. None of them were bad, they are both quite confidant and the interpretation they bring us is solid and well concepted. Joel Kinnaman is a convincing villain and plays the political fanatic well. Vincent Cassel and Gary Oldman are well-known veterans and pretty safe bets for the most prominent secondary characters. The only negative point I have to make (and I think it's not the actors' fault, but director Espinosa's) is that terrible pseudo-Russian accent that the actors tried to emulate, and which should never have been done. If the director wanted that kind of accent so badly, then he should have looked for Russian or Eastern actors who could speak in English.Technically, the film relies heavily on cinematography and camera work. They tried as hard as they could for these elements to convey a variety of sensations to the public, from the biting Winter cold to the inhospitable, gray, unfriendly and distrustful atmosphere of Soviet cities during the 1950s. I also really liked the cars, the uniforms, costumes and sets, as there was a good effort at historical reconstruction, in general. The soundtrack does its job, but it doesn't stay in the ear.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Too many weak points,"A crime thriller, set in the Soviet Union during the Stalin era: it sounds like a good idea. And it probably is, but unfortunately 'Child 44' doesn't have what it takes to be a really good film. Some things are well done: the oppressing atmosphere of living in a police state, and the courage it takes to go against of the powers that be, are very convincing. That's partly because of the excellent cinematography, full of grey colours conveying the joyless society that Soviet Russia must have been; and partly because of Tom Hardy's convincing lead.Hardy shows exactly the right amount of tenacity to make him believable as the Russian war hero who becomes an outcast because he refuses to denounce his innocent wife, against the will of the regime. Only after he exposes the incompetence of the police force in a series of child killings, he gets rehabilitated.The weak point of the film is the script. It takes a long while before all elements of the story are clear, and the quick succession of events at the start is a bit confusing. Moreover, the story is spiced up with some action scenes that are not well executed and unnecessary. Also, the tear jerking scene at the end is at odds with the hard-boiled story.What really annoyed me (and I think I'm not alone) is the language. The actors speak English with a mock Russian accent. This half-hearted way of solving a language problem makes some dialogue almost ridiculous. Just let them speak normal English. I know, that makes the film a bit less authentic. But nobody spoke English with mock Russian accents in Soviet Russia.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"""Child 44"" is a grim but fascinating police procedural that peaks behind the Iron Curtain into the paranoia and dysfunction of the U.S.S.R. under Stalin.","Sometimes it's tough to stand on the side of right. That's especially true when all those around you are more interested in perception than reality. And I don't just mean your family and your friends or your social circle. I'm talking about fighting against the abuses of power, corruption and cover-ups of an entire society. That's what Moscow-based secret police (MGB) agent Leo Demidov faces in the Soviet Union of the 1950s in British writer Tom Rob Smith's trilogy. The first book in that trilogy lends its title to the film ""Child 44"" (R, 1:37) and focuses on the real-life crimes of a Russian named Andrei Chikatilo.Demidov is played by underrated British actor Tom Hardy. Hardy's character is a tough, but good man who wants to do what's right, but runs into a brick wall every time he tries. He's a cop in Stalin's U.S.S.R., a government that whisks away any citizen who expresses a point of view contrary to that of the authorities and holds fast to its denial of the existence of crime in their communist utopia. When the young son of fellow agent Alexi (Fares Fares) is murdered, Demidov is reminded that, according to Stalin, ""murder is a capitalist disease."" Or, as Vasili (Joel Kinnaman), Demidov's bitter rival within their secret police unit says, ""There is no crime in paradise."" As Alexi's friend and superior, Demidov is assigned to present the police report to the family. ""Railway accident"" is listed as the cause of death. Everyone, including Demidov, knows that this is a lie, but when the family argues with him about the official version of events all he can do is half-heartedly insist that they read the report. He pulls aside Alexi to tell him repeatedly that his son was not murdered. You can see how difficult it is for this talented investigator to deny his friend any hope of justice, but it's for Alexi's own good. Demidov knows that pursuing the matter any further would mean the end of both of their careers, or worse.Demidov soon gets to experience an example of that ""worse"" for himself. When he finally takes an unyielding stand and refuses to toe the party line on another issue, he is demoted, and he and his wife, Raisa (Noomi Rapace), are basically exiled to a small town that is even bleaker than Moscow was for them. When Demidov is helping investigate the murder of another young boy, he encourages his new supervisor, General Nesterov (Gary Oldman), to investigate further. Nesterov soon discovers that there have been a total of 43 similar murders in the region. ""44,"" Demidov corrects him. ""My friend's son was murdered too."" Nesterov does what he can within the confines of the Soviet legal system, while Demidov and his wife go well outside normal procedures in an effort to catch the killer. Vasili gets wind of what the Demidovs are up to and tries to use this to get his former boss out of the way for good.""Child 44"" is grim, but effective. The story is a disturbing but fascinating peek into life in the U.S.S.R. late in the Stalinist era. We get a look at the state of schools, orphanages, mental hospitals and even the treatment of homosexuals, but this film is mainly about the paranoia of a broken system which victimized its own people and allowed many criminals to go unpunished. The script is strong, but the acting is even stronger. Hardy plays Demidov as a confident and dedicated public servant who is barely holding the cork in the bottle of his righteous anger. Rapace comes off as proud and strong, but with a barely concealed vulnerability just beneath the surface. Oldman has been (and remains) one of the most talented actors of his generation and, anyone who remembers him as the terrorist leader in ""Air Force One"" (1997) can attest that the man knows his way around a Russian accent. Basically, this is the kind of movie you want to see if you're in the mood for a serious crime thriller which has the courage to approach the sub-genre of police procedural from a little-understood place in a nearly forgotten time.

A tough watch but a brilliant job by all concerned,"Child 44 isn't the movie you watch for light entertainment. It is gritty and tough, and I found myself feeling a sense of absolute disgust for anyone and anything connected with the old school communist state in the USSR. It really makes you look at just how bad that system was and how monstrous the people were who enforced it on the general populace. Nonetheless, the story is compelling, although sometimes the thread jumps around a bit. Tom Hardy's performance was his best ever. I think he warrants an Academy for it. Noomi Rapace was excellent - very authentic in her role. Child 44 is a dark thriller - and without giving anything away, the build up and hatred toward the serial killer really sticks you to this movie - you simply want the killer to get the most gruesome death conceivable for what he does. Apart from the Hollywood aspect, this film depicts reality. This is how life existed under Communism and I think that message is just as compelling and important as the rest of the story - because it really depicted the terror and the suppression that millions of people lived under in the name of some douche bag's idea of ""ideology"". May Stalin forever lay dead and remembered for only one thing - he was a murdering asshole.

An absolute mess.,Child 44 is the story of an ex member of the Russian military police who investigates a series of child murders during the Stalin-era Soviet Union. I am struggling to think of a bad film that Tom Hardy has made . He is currently flavour of the month and quite rightly so but Child 44 is probably the worst thing he has done but it's not his fault. This film is all over the place. It can't decide whether it is a serial-killer thriller or an old-school anti-Soviet propaganda movie and just ends up failing miserably on both fronts. The editing is disastrous. It feels like a bunch of scenes all put together and not always in the correct order . I honestly thought there had been scenes accidentally deleted at one stage it was so bad and at 137 minutes you can't wait for the end credits to roll.4 out of 10,4.0,Anonymous,History
Tom Hardy Delivers A Knockout Performance!,"Based on Tom Rob Smith's 2008 novel of the same name, 'Child 44' is a yet another showcase of Tom Hardy's excellence. The supremely talented actor is in complete show-stealing mode here, delivering a knockout performance from start to end.'Child 44' Synopsis: A disgraced member of the military police investigates a series of nasty child murders during the Stalin-era Soviet Union.'Child 44' is strictly an okay film, though. While its beautifully Directed by Daniel Espinosa & Photographed by Philippe Rousselot, this mystery-thriller still fails to mesmerize you. Reason? Richard Price's Adapted Screenplay, which ranges from riveting to plain dull. I did get goosebumps in some sequences, especially in the film's intriguing first-hour, but was mostly bored in its dull second-hour. Also, the final-act doesn't work. 'Child 44' had all the makings of becoming an instant classic, but what is eventually served, despite a few genuinely terrific moments, is an average fare, at best.Performance-Wise: As mentioned right from my summary, Tom Hardy has topped himself, yet again! With his flawless Russian accent to perfect body language, Hardy proves that he's the best in the business today, among his contemporaries. Noomi Rapace is competent, as always. Gary Oldman is adequate. Joel Kinnaman isn't menacing enough, while Vincent Cassel seems to have done his bit in a massive hurry.

Communist Red Tape,"1950's in the USSR would be a total drag, that much is clear.The film has essentially two plots. One is Tom Hardy's character as a Soviet police officer/investigator and how the tables are turned against him. The other, is the child murderer and the abundance of red tape to actually investigate such atrocities, never mind admitting that it is happening. The two have a weak connection and seem to negatively eat away at the run time. As a result, both story lines are rushed, or the viewer suffers from a lack of interest. Wished Gary Oldman had more screen time.It gives a grim perspective on how that part of the world was run at that time is still mind blowing.

"Some Weak Points At The Start... But Stay With It, It's Worth It...","My Ratings:
Story 1.50 : Direction 1.25 : Pace 1.25 : Acting 1.50 : Entertaining 1.25
Total 6.75 out of 10.00This is an enlightening story in many ways. I just think it was a shame Richard Price, who adapted the Tom Smith novel, didn't structure it better. It's too straight forward and casual. The first quarter of the story, which charts Leo Demidov's youth and acceptance into the Russian MGB (Ministry Of State Security) has very little feeling. This is a bad thing as it stops the audience from relating to him. Because of this, you don't become emotionally anchored to his future until the last third of the film. This further distances us from the story and the film.By the end though, you have a much clearer vision of the man and his motives. However, this would have been a much better film had we been given that insight, even if it were only hinted at, earlier.What stands out in the story most is Mother Russia and the Government and their ideals. This is not a happy country. It is bleak and life is hard. So the regime spins their own truths to match what they want their people to believe. Therefore, there is no murder in paradise. It's a Western weakness. In turn, this new truth, helps the serial killer hide as all his kills are solved as accidents.At the same time, the MGB are hunting out subversives and spies. Which opens up new troubles for Leo and his wife. We start to get a true image of Leo at this point forward.The confrontation between Leo and the killer is a little shakey. Some of the things the killer tells Leo about knowing him don't ring true. We never get to know if he did know him or not. Or if he was generalising. It's a flimsy and insufficient ending.The straight forward way the story is told is mirrored in the direction and is detrimental to keeping the audience's attention. I like to immerse myself in the story and the movie. I couldn't fully do that with this film. Daniel Espinosa does a good, though pedestrian, job of directing. There are plenty of times when pace could have been altered to create tension and atmosphere. Even some diverse camera angles and lighting techniques would have added strength and interest. The simple point and shoot are okay, though it does very little to help the viewer to the end of the story.Luckily the acting is top-notch. And all of the actors and actresses are superb in their roles, eve Paddy Considine nearly carries off the accent till the end. I am a fan of all the actors in this movie, though I have to say Considine does have trouble with accents. But hey, at least he tries. Charles Dance sounds exactly like... Charles Dance. Tom Hardy goes from strength to strength and shows how good he is at character acting. This is one actor I could always watch.All of that said, this is worth one watch, at the least. It's not the best mystery thriller but it does open your eyes to how the Soviet Union used to be.Come over and see where Child 44 ranked on my The Game Is Afoot list.Take Care and Stay Well.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Gripping.,"A very chilling indictment of how corrupt the post-war Soviet Union government (now Russia) was, Child 44 is about a serial killer of young boys that no-one seems to want to catch. After all, it might have negative implications for the fake 'paradise' they've created.The authorities blame everything to make the problems go away... first they put the murder down to train accidents, then they pin the blame on some poor mentally disabled guy who can't argue back.As the grisly murders continue apace though and whispers of dissent start getting louder, one courageous officer is willing to ignore the party line to try cracking the case himself... even at the cost of his career and possibly, his own life. Are you excited yet?!Tom Hardy tries his hand at a Russian accent and at creating a sympathetic hero, succeeding on both counts. The actress playing his wife also does a fine job, strong, determined and with secrets of her own. Finally, if Joel Kinnaman's main brief was for us to despise him as the villain, then mission successful I'd say.It shines a light on a particularly brutal period in history, where the Russian state demanded absolute loyalty in all circumstances (and due to a combination of violence & murder, usually got it). The sad truth is though, it's unclear just how much has changed...Anyway, what can't be denied is this movie is a good watch, and the ending is symbolically a perfect way to conclude a thoroughly engaging experience. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
A missed opportunity but not completely,"I read the book and was blown away - dark, intense, claustrophobic- it reminded me of Hans Fallada - Alone in Berlin. I wanted the film to capture this, the chill of Russia during Stalin's reign of terror, the cold brutality. The opening chapter haunts you - the opening scenes less so. I can live with unnecessary accents but it is such a shame the backstory was underplayed. Taking the film in isolation, it was good but if you watch it without the novel to relate back to, it's a challenging. Where was the snow - the ice cold bitterness - the deep state frozen in time and distrust. The Russian ice age where society is suspended, placed in cold storage so no man can progress, no family can grow. Innocent are killed like the slain children at the heart of the book. Leo's appreciation of his life, his loyalty to the State and the duplicity of his moral compass gets too little attention. You are guilty the moment you are arrested whilst paradise has no crime, the crime is paradise. The sham of a marriage which was the foundation of distrust, felt less valued. I understand that a film has a running time whilst the book does not but it was a missed opportunity. As a comment on Russia, it is highly relevant and shows how little things have progressed.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"This is a movie that is very much worth seeing and I do recommend it, but it would be hard to watch more than once. I give it a B","""There can be no murder in paradise."" After WWII Russia is doing everything it can to show that their country is perfect and nothing bad ever happens. When military policeman Leo Demidov (Hardy) begins to see a pattern between the ""accidental"" deaths of children his reward is to be demoted and sent away. Now with his wife (Rapace) and General Nesterov (Oldman) he investigates on his own and what he finds is worse than he imagined. This is a hard movie to review. The acting is amazing. Tom Hardy is becoming one of the best actors working today and I think it is only a matter of time before he wins an Oscar. Watching him and Rapace play off each other is very intriguing and worth watching for that. On the other hand the subject matter is very intense and a little hard to watch if you have children. Nothing graphic is shown only discussed but that is enough. Overall, this is a movie that is very much worth seeing and I do recommend it, but it would be hard to watch more than once.

The few good ones on a wintry harsh time,"Child 44 is a crime investigation with the backdrop of treason and espionage in post-World War II Russia. It's a bizarre take on detective flick and leaning more towards social commentary and the psychological repercussion of the time. It may be a bit slow as subplots are overlapping, but the great acting from the leading actors present an engaging spectacle.Leo Demidova (Tom Hardy) is an upstanding officer of Russia. During the cold era of Stalin, he presides over many investigations to uproot treachery. His life and carrier would change drastically as a serial child killer emerges. He's soon demoted for chasing the truth, and with only his estranged wife Raisa (Noomi Rapace) at his side, he adamantly pursues the killer.This is a complex setting for crime thriller, and it still works mostly due to the actors' capable performance. Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace are both splendid on creating the human drama, audience would root for his character who is idealistic almost to a fault and in expense of personal relationship. Tom Hardy looks believable as an officer, more importantly a man, trying to do right despite the oppressive nature he must deal with.Noomi Rapace looks confident as a survivor, she wears a tough front and confidently strong yet has a fragile side as well. These two are not the usual spouse as their issues are pretty dysfunctional and sadly deep-rooted, occasionally they might even resemble partners than husband and wife. Gary Oldman is versatile and certainly impressive here, he pulls off the magnetic general in stoic manner, yet still seemingly combative at times.The narrative covers a great deal of subjects. This in turn creates a longer runtime as well as more subplots. Granted, it may be too slow for some audience. Its mix on the crime and social aspects take time to bear fruit. It is rewarding in the end, although the first half might feel plodding and not every angles work. The action could be better too, since the camera shakes violently in a few of the action sequences.This is a different kind of thriller, it traverses through not only one but many touchy subjects. However, the acting prowess and adequate material present a fascinating look on the time and the cruelty it harbors.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Great from hardy once again,"Good film, great acting from the two leads, what more can you ask for. It's not a great book to film adaptation but if you forget the book it's worth a watch.

Summing up it's a good watch for those who like thrillers and tom hardy. The film itself is probably a 7/10 but tom hardy and noomi rapice were so convincing as the leads that I upped it to a 10. I was disappointed we didn't see much of Gary oldman as he is also one of my favourite actors but the small part he played was played very well.

Overly Convoluted Mess,"If you want to see this movie - done right - watch ""Citizen X,"" the HBO movie that supposedly 'inspired"" Child 44, but outshines it in every conceivable way.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112681/?ref_=nv_sr_4Anyone will be able to see where Child 44 borrows from Citizen X, but where Citizen is a true-to-the-facts, utterly chilling story about one of the worst serial killers in history, Andrei Chikatilo, the telling of which is so much more creepy and horrifying for its simplicity and lack of ""Hollywood"" style embellishment.Child 44 tries far too hard to be too many things, and fails at them all. The child murders, which are supposed to be the story's catalyst, end up feeling brushed over and tacked on, while the real-life bureaucracy and just plain pigheadedness of the government-in-denial that was almost complicit in many of the deaths due to inaction, becomes a confused and unreal spy/love story/rivalry conundrum that ends up feeling contrived and unfocused.In recommending Citizen X to people, as I often have over the years, as possibly the best movie about a serial killer ever made, it is for precisely all the reasons where Child 44 goes wrong. Citizen X is wonderful writing and acting, is frightening and believable, a true look at a human turned monster, because it isn't overdone and pumped full of clichés and contrived action.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Excellent film, cerebral and complex, maybe not for everyone . . .","This is an excellent, but complex film. No, it's not an ""action thriller"", no wild chase scenes or moment to moment cgi enhanced adrenaline shots. If that's what you are looking for, no need to spend time here, you won't get this film at all.However . . . As an exceptionally well acted, well crafted examination of the human condition, brought to its various extremes under extraordinarily challenging circumstances, this is an example of applied filmcraft well worth its time.Noomi Rapace and Tom Hardy could not have possibly delivered their characters any better. If anything, they propelled this production beyond what it's initial limitations might have been. That's not to detract from the other actors in this production, all of whom were well cast and credibly delivered their ensemble of characters.Though the primary plot line of this story centers around a serial child killer and his eventual fate, this evolving thread is woven into the fabric of a multi-layered, complex examination of life in post WWII Stalinist Russia, the Soviet Union in its darkest days.There is a reason why this film was banned in current day Russia.Yes, it is true that many contemporary Russians have difficulty understanding or believing the contextual background as depicted in this production, but as one who has personally known various Russians over the years who were there at that time, or who had relatives who lived through this era, the general depictions are chillingly close to the actual experiences familiar to many from that time. Much more time could be spent here trying to explain this in detail for those who are not familiar, but elaborating on such descriptions may be beyond the context of this film review.As for the production quality of this film, the attention to detail and cinema photography is remarkably well done. To watch this film really does transport the viewer into an experience of that era. I freely admit this film may not be for everyone, but for those who can resonate with this elaborate study of the human condition, as extruded through the mandrel of this cultural and historical motif, it is a remarkable production well worth its time.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Anybody never denied that bandits existed. The Soviet ideology was based on a brotherhood and mutual aid of people. In the years of the most rigid repressions in the Soviet prisons was less condemned, than today in all prisons of the USA. Problems were but where they weren't? I think that the author of this history specially distorted historic facts. Today someone very much wants to show Russia resident evil. These attempts are ridiculous as modern Russia refused socialism. However, refusal of socialism happened at all not because in the USSR to live was intolerable. On a referendum in 1991 the Soviet people voted for preservation of the USSR, but the elite was against. Today Russians have an opportunity to compare capitalism and socialism. Sociological polls say that more than a half of Russians consider the public relations in the USSR better, than present: free education, free medicine, cheap transport, cheap access to culture.

I love a good ending and was rewarded for staying with this film,"It is progressively rarer to have Hollywood films storyline take place in a foreign countries war time era in the first half of the 20th century. Child 44 is one of those exceptions which combined the Stalin era of fear and propaganda (Example: The Soviet Union has no murderers and no homosexuals) in a totalitarian state with a purported child serial killer on the loose. Unless you have a fondness for reading up on your history of the World War 1 & 2 era, the first 30 minutes of this film may not relate with the audience as it depicts how millions of people were being starved to death and if they were lucky to live, they would be terrorized by the Russian militia.Child 44 stars Tom Hardy as Leo Demidov a security officer whose job it is to weed out protesters and anti Joseph Stalin revolutionaries. Leo recently married the beautiful Raisa (played by Noomi Rapace) who early in the film explains to Leo that she married her security officer husband out of fear and not because she loved him. I think the film's director Daniel Espinosa could have created a more personal film for his audience if he had effectively explained why Raisa feared for her life and so she chose to marry Leo just to survive thinking she had no choice in the marriage to a Russian security officer. As the movie progresses we see that Leo is not the hard ass he appears to be, and his love for Raisa is beyond reproach.As in any military regime there are men with egos, and who aspire to greater military roles. The scumbag who holds down this role is actor Joel Kinnaman who plays Vasili who continually tries to undermine his commander Leo by engaging in acts of terror against the people which include cold blooded murder and executions by military shootings against a compound wall which is plastered with bullet holes and his selected victims blood splatters. Vasili also has eyes on destroying Leo by taking away his job in the military as well as convincing his wife Raisa to leave Leo and come live with him. Through time Raisa finds out just what type of man she has married. Leo is a man who is very tough, persistent, focused on finding a child serial killer which his government emphatically denies even exists. Leo is also a man who truly loves his wife Raisa and would rather lose her by allowing her to make her own decision to stay with him or leave him without any repercussions. Two other good performances are presented by Gary Oldman playing General Mikhail Nesterov who Leo is assigned to report to in the slum town of Rostov as part of his banishment for pursuing a serial killer.The other good performance is that of Paddy Considine who plays the sly child sexual predator named Vladimir Malevich who picks up children at various train stations by offering them food and candy. Loosely based on the real life Soviet child serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. Chikatilo was born in 1936, who himself experienced between 1941 and 1944, witnessed some of the effects of the Nazi occupation of Ukraine. Chikatilo was a constant child bed wetter living in fear as a child of wartime strife and in his latter adult years was responsible for at least 52 children's murders which took place between 1978 and 1990.Child 44 focuses on the relationship between Russian military officer Leo Demidov and his wife Raisa, and how the slimy military officer Vasili uses his painful interrogation tactics to lie about his superiors (Leo Demidov) knowledge of his wife's involvement in the anti Stalins sentiments.The downside to the film for me was the difficulty of the Russian dialect for Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman in particular to achieve, and the use of a sub par grainy brownish colorization utilized by director Daniel Espinosa to influence the film being in the World War II era. I think the film editing should have been able to enhance the films end product with both the dialogue and cinematography but overall the film was both painful to watch due to the real suffering a world war is responsible for, as well as for a wonderful ending which I don't want to spoil for any potential first time film viewers. The excellent performances by both Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace will continue to keep them in good stead with their followers. I give Child 44 a sound 7 out of 10 rating.

Just to counter the ones who downvoted out of pure grief.,"I'd say amusement-wise this movie is worth 7.5 out of 10. The story holds his own and apart from the accents that might perhaps now and then throw of some authentic feel the movie is certainly enjoyable.Since the book in itself is superb, and by no means historically 100% accurate as the writer Tom Rob Smith also wrote in the last pages of the book, so no need for anyone to get their panties in a twist.Of course the same goes for me, so I will try to be as little judgmental as possible.That Stalin is responsible for the deaths of millions of Russians, is still today for many Russians a form of western propaganda.Having had a Russian girlfriend a couple of years ago at her hometown somewhere in Russia (It's precise town is irrelevant) me, a few friends of mine and her sister were having a drink and a laugh in her apartment.At some point we all had to name a historic person who was important to our country and someone we saw as role model, hero or whatever.When my girlfriend's (19 year old) sister named Stalin I first assumed she began to develop a sense of sarcasm and I laughed at what I expected to be a joke. This infuriated her and so the game was suddenly over. Any arguments made in my defense by me and my friends mentioning some of Stalin's gruesome crimes committed upon his own people were received as US propaganda/Western lies.What some people also here fail to realize is that this is no Hollywood propaganda.

Missed opportunity..,"Okay, so I liked this. It was a nice view and a nice bit of escapism for 2+ hours. But it didn't hit me. I have a unsatisfactory feeling of missed opportunity, of watching yet another run of the mill Hollywood production.Off course I knew this film would deal with the same horrific history as the far superior ""Citizen X"" and I guess my expectations were a little to high, especially with such an awesome cast. Performances were good overall, but nowhere were they brilliant. And the story for me was very muddled, but I guess that's also to do with the period in Russia in which this film plays out. For me the heart of the story, the childmurderer case, felt rushed (despite of the 2 hours+ running time) because of the slow and really slightly tedious first part of the movie.I've seen ""Citizen X"" more than a couple of times and Stephen Rea's performance brings a tear to my eye again and again, not to mention the maybe even more emotional wonderfully understated role by Max von Sydow. None of that in this one. The only bit that came close, without spoiling anything, was the scene with Gary Oldman (who else) visiting Rostov.Joel Kinnaman was miscast, or typecast, and annoying. Fares Fares had to little to do and even Nicolas Lie Kaas' performance felt under-directed. Such great actors appearing in Hollywood movies, but performing nothing like they do in the movies they make at home.""Safe House"" was cool, ""Snabba Cash"" remains his masterpiece,""Child 44"" is a missed opportunity for Daniel Espinosa. Iff you didn't see it, go find and watch ""Citizen X"" and shed a tear over one of history's most horrific episodes ever.. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History

Too bad the story is not so tightly knot,"The story as a whole falls far from the category of being a good movie story. The movie has a good opening and character development. The story also has good twists and turns, and also all those predictable and suspicious moments of opportune revenges among colleagues. Yet the story part where it has the movie's own title, the one about the child murders, instead only has a little and less meaningful part to the movie as a whole. It's only used as a bridging part to set Leo's life story in continuance. Also the story doesn't really close or solve all those plot holes left at the movie's end. The acting overall feels nicely suiting to the described time period and location. Although the bad part is that all the cast really over used accentuation on their dialog that they sounded mumbling almost all the time, even including Tom Hardy's performance. But Tom Hardy really grasps his character well and his performance is nicely gripping. Noomi Rapace nicely worked out her role and so did the antagonist in Joel Kinnaman. Gary Oldman nicely completes the angles for the story's continuance.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Presents a New Landscape, but Barely Tolerable with its Muddled Stories","The Movie, Based on Real-Life but Time Shifted Backwards a couple of Decades, is about a Serial Killer of Children in Russia during a Time when it was Said that ""There are no murders in paradise.""The Combination of Political Representations, Gloomy and Dank befits the Harsh and Cold Soviet Winters, with a ""Police"" Procedural might seem to be a fit worth Filming. But Here it is with a Sloppy Hand that the Story is Told.Confusing and Bewildering at Times, the Movie Never Finds the Right Footing and it Wanders around the Landscape with many Profound Pronunciations that are Rarely Followed-Up or Clearly Presented.The Whole Movie is Wildly Washed Out and Never Narrative Satisfying.

How Much of this is an Actual Representation of the Majority of Souls at the Time is Currently Debatable. Gary Oldman is mostly Wasted with Little Screen Time.Solely as a Movie and a strictly Engaging Set Up and Story, it Misses much but Delivers enough to make it Worth a Frustrating Watch. The Pursuit of the Child Killer is Not Handled very Well, and the Life Situations told from the State and the Citizen's Point of View is mildly Intriguing but both are Mishandled to Distraction.The Movie's biggest Strength is presenting a Crime and Political Story in a Setting that seems New and it is that Milieu that makes the other Shortcomings Watchable and Tolerable.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Tensionless and slow,"Child 44 is a retelling of the story of the serial murders of Andrei Chikatilo. The cast is very much A-level (and the reason I saw this flick) with Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, Gary Oldman, Vincent Cassel and Charles Dance. But none of this matters much coz the movie is slow, drags on, has sideplots that make the story less streamlined and more convoluted. There are scenes that are meant to build the characters but only slow down the pace to a grinding halt and feel like they serve no essential purpose. There is almost no build of tension and it feels aimless. It's just crawls on for 137 mins till it reaches the end which feels very trivial and anticlimactic. So I'm not recommending this flick. I do recommend you check out 'Citizen X', a 1995 TV movie with Donald Sutherland and Stephen Rea which is about the same murders but done SO much better. The acting alone is just exquisite.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Bad novels make bad movies - don't waste your time,This movie is a disaster. It's grim story about how the mistreatment of Ukranians mixed badly with a serial killer story.The varying degrees of Russian accents mix together badly and a lot of the dialog ends up incomprehensible. It would have been better that everyone didn't try to fake an accent than for them to have some exaggerated accents (like Tom Hardy's) and some faint accents (the rest). Make a movie about the Ukrianian serial killer and keep it true story. That may have worked.There are some incongruous characters. The villain played by Joel Kinnaman seems evil for no reason. Very fake and contrived. Noomi Rapace doesn't look or sound Russian at all. Strange choice.Don't bother with this long and dreary nonsense.,1.0,Anonymous,History

Few films have conveyed the despair, depression, and paranoia of this era, yet the film itself is so much more.Fans of Tom Hardy (and who isn't) will find this film is another in a line of marvelous characters. Fans of Noomi Rapace will find her disappearing into the character while capturing the Russian persona to perfection.Among my favorite actors - Gary Oldman does a good job but he is only in a few scenes.

Child 44 review,"Some scenes are exaggerated, such as execution of the parents in front of their daughters, this might have happen back in 1917 - 1945, but not in 1953.

For sure, he would be send away for a while until everyone ""forgets"" the incident. The military and police ranks are a complete mess in this movie. 1) No way someone carries an army sergeant rank in 1945 (Tom Hardy, Joel Kinnaman, Fares Fares) becomes an MGB captain (Tom Hardy) or lieutenant (Joel Kinnaman, Fares Fares) within 8 years. 2) Gary Oldman carries a colonel rank on his shoulder straps, but everyone address to him as a general, this is especially wrong because there was no general rank in USSR police force until October 23, 1974.

I feel it wasn't quite driven home just how much the 'no murder in paradise' needed to be believed.That said, this is probably my shortcoming and not the movies.Very good performances all round.

Frightening Movie...But Not for the Child Murders,"Tom Hardy is phenomenal in delivering his role, as a often is. He is likely the best actor of his generation. His supporting cast are quite good and are familiar faces. The scenery, period attire, props, etc., lend itself to getting the feel that it is 1953 Soviet Union.The film is terrifying, especially in the beginning to about halfway through. The capricious arrests, searches, and executions of the citizenry are what nightmares are made of. The terror from seeing it portrayed is worse than the child killings being investigated. The second half of the film delves more into that along with petty co-worker back stabbing...which is oddly a relief to the watching of the authoritarian state from the first half of the movie. In a perverse, peculiar way it is easier to wrap one's head around child murder and conniving co-workers than paranoia Stalinist internal state security.It is a good watch, but there are some slow and plodding portions, albeit necessary for character development and psychological insight.",7.0,Anonymous,History

More of a docudrama about Soviet history than a detective story,"""Child 44"" is a highly fictionalized account of the investigation into the murders by Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. The actual crimes occurred 1978 and 1990, during Brezhnev's rule. The award-winning book recasts the events into Stalin's Russia, but the movie is set in the early years of Khrushchev's rule.The only reason to change the time period seems to be to make heavy-handed statements about Communist rule in Russia, which was dreary, depressing, arbitrary, paranoid, brutal, unfair and generally not much fun. But it begs the question of why change the time frame to Khrushchev's era, which reportedly wasn't nearly as bad as Stalin's.HBO produced an excellent film about the case called ""Citizen X,"" starring Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland, which depicted the actual events fairly accurately, as described in a detailed Wikipedia article. There was a very active investigation between 1984 and Chikatilo 's arrest in 1990. He was tried, convicted and executed. The trial was a media circus. While the investigation was hindered by some party hacks, there was a major effort to find the killer.The movie asks the question, what might have happened if a serial killer like Chikatilo had operated during post-war communist rule and the authorities refused to acknowledge the possibility that a serial killer could operate in their workers' paradise. Rather than focusing on the investigation or the crimes, it concentrates on the extreme measures the bureaucrats might have taken to avoid challenging the party line.Along the way, it throws in war orphans, persecution of homosexuals, economic deprivation, the Communist Party's prioritization of children's education, sexual harassment by party members, professional rivalries, and other social issues. It also devotes considerable attention to the protagonist's background and his relationship with his wife and suggests it is impossible to be loyal to ones wife and family and also have unequivocal loyalty to the party.His wife improbably becomes his sidekick in an unsanctioned, independent investigation and, as all Hollywood sidekicks must rescue the protagonist at some point, she participates in a donnybrook.Chikatilo's victims were about 60% females and 80% children. His early victims were predominately girls, while his later victims were mostly boys. Vladimir Malevich, the movie's villain is given surgical training and removes organs from his victims, who are all male children. There is a very strange scene where the villain does to himself what he does to his victims, which detracts from the heinous nature of his crimes. They can't be that bad if he undergoes the same treatment and survives.People are dragged from their beds in the middle of the night by state security forces, there are executions, mock executions, extrajudicial executions and summary executions, banishments to remote districts, train rides, travelling baggage class, endless betrayals, duplicity and much more. In true Russian cinematic tradition, the first cut of the movie was reportedly five and a half hours long.The result is a stark condemnation of communist rule, but a muddled detective story. As a docudrama about life and politics in Soviet Russia, the story is meticulously detailed and offers fascinating visuals and performances for any student of Russian history. As a detective story, it is less than compelling and uneasily segues into an unlikely action story before wrapping with an implausible Hollywood ending that seems to have leapt forward in time to Brezhnev's policies of glasnost.The movie bears the title of the book, which is misleading. Perhaps a fifth of the movie deals with the actual crimes, the victims and the investigation. The movie is really about the need for unquestioning loyalty in a totalitarian system.The cinematography is wonderfully dreary and depressing. The costumes and largely Czech settings are more than adequate. As usual, Tom Hardy delivers a very intense performance.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A Very Well Acted Period Piece,"We rented this last evening and did not realize it was over 2 hours long. However we were glued to the screen as the plot unfolded and our attention was held by the great performances involved. While trying to decide what to rent we looked it up on IMDb and saw the low score. But we had recently rented Survivor (5.5) and because of the actors involved we rented it anyway. We ended up enjoying the fast action, suspense and the great performances and we felt Child 44 could be the same situation. And it was. Why anyone would give Child 44 one and two stars is a complete mystery to me. Based on their reviews it seems that some folks fancy themselves as more than a viewer or consumer of entertainment. It seems some see themselves as screen writers, directors, cinematographers, editors and professional critics. I wonder if these are folks who dropped out of film school or many never went but wanted to. This movie seems to have been particularly downgraded by those that read the book and think the screen writer had the responsibility to hold the script details closely to the book's story line. Come on guys, get a life and quit trying to downgrade good movies with your unwarranted low scoring.

But, I can tell you, if you care about a good storyline, and how the story is told, the strength of the plot, and the characters etc. I can tell you this film scores very poorly on all counts.Since I don't like spoilers you won't find any of them here either, but even if I tried it would be impossible because how can one spoil something that is already spoiled?Readers of this review, I urge you to watch the trailer of this film, then perhaps watch it again for good measure, and really ask yourself, ""Does this look like a film I want to spend over 2 hours of my life watching?"" I wish I had done this and perhaps if I had I wouldn't be sitting here writing this right now..Lastly, I want to know what actors like Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman are actually thinking when they receive a quarter baked script like this and actually say yes. The fact that this has a 6.3 rating on less than 5000 votes speaks volumes, once that figure reaches the region of 50,000 - 100,000 votes I would expect this to drop in to 4* territory.I suppose if I had a soviet gun to my head and I was forced to say something positive about this movie I would say that I managed to make it out of the cinema without demanding a refund, but that's probably because someone else bought my ticket for me.Anyway guys I hope you enjoyed this review.

Laughable anti-soviet (russian) propaganda.,"Movie is actually a bit toned down compared the anti-soviet imaginations presented in the book. Unfortunately movie is not much better than the source. As a person who is familiar with what communism in USSR was (parents/relatives), nothing which is accented on in the movie is true.USSR had low crime rates, not because simply ignoring the crime, but due to overall mindset. When there were actually cases, they would be immediately investigated. Soviet Union could not afford eliminating people in such rates as shown in movie. If this was true, population of USSR would decline rapidly. Control was strict, surveillance was there, KGB and so on, but they did whatever FBI/CIA are doing these days in USA.Hunger was not only Ukrainian problem prior to WW2, it was problem of USSR as whole due to many reasons, including poor decision making in critical times. Ukrainians love to speculate that it was something set against them, somewhat of a holocaust. Ignorance and stupidity of undereducated people who think like that. I'd love them to investigate on this problem.It makes me sad when movies like this are shown to people, who are not familiar with history of Russian Empire/USSR. This heresy ruins future image of russians. I am not surprised we are presented/seen as a global threat. When you learn more about our culture, you will understand how laughable movies like this are, when casted actors can't even pronounce simple Russian words. Cluelessly or intentionally they are digging a hole between World and Russia, as future generations will form opinion based on this movie.Writer of this book wanted to show a system trying to prevent crime investigation. He choose system he probably knew less about. Result is this movie.

"A dark, confrontational thriller in post-war Russia.","""I would rather spend a lifetime in a sh*t-hole like this with you, than spend one minute in Moscow without you.""First let me clarify something. I'm not an anti-communist or supporter of anti-Russian propaganda. Neither am I an anti-capitalist or against the other superpower on the other side of the planet. I'm a tiny little person who leads a modest life in probably one of the smallest countries in the world. To label this film as propaganda against the USSR, sounds to me in the present world situation quite exaggerated. Who the hell would benefit from that? Isn't this movie trying to visualize the circumstances in which ordinary people had to live and survive in the post-war period? I can't tell if the shown images are truthful or not. But I'm glad I'm not living in such harsh conditions these days.What a depressing and frightening regime this must have been with repression and blind obedience as main values. Turning in others as a resort. Those who are your blood brothers today, could become your worst enemies the next day. Regardless of your status or rank. Before you know it, you're deported to the farthest corner of Mother Russia to do some filthy work in deplorable conditions. Downgraded to a meaningless and insignificant person. And that's the strong point of this film. The portrait of a society under control of a police institution, in this case the Russian State Security (MGB, forerunner of the KGB) in a post-war, post-Stalin regime. The MGB was the security apparatus of the USSR that made sure that loyalty to the communist regime, remained intact. Dissidents, anti-communist and political opponents (and annoying individuals) were carefully chased down and removed. The MGB wasn't perhaps as violent as the NKVD, but they weren't choirboys either, I guess.""Child 44"" is grayish, dirty and confrontational. The misery, the poverty, the paranoia, the hopelessness and the ruthless repression are portrayed in an impressive way. It's certainly not a film that makes you happy. Unfortunately the main topic (a topic the whole movie actually revolves around) was pushed a bit into the background. The serial killer theme is rather poorly developed. The only interesting thing was the way they dealt with these crimes. The existence of a serial killer was unthinkable (""There's no murder in paradise""). Only a capitalist regime can produce a killer. That's what the Soviet doctrine claims. The actual murders are scanty visualized. The final denouement and unmasking was a bit too simple. So don't expect a ""Silence of the Lambs Made in Russia"", but a kind of docu-drama about this chilly Russia.In terms of acting, there's really nothing to wrong, though most characters were stereotypical portrayed. Many will criticize the use of a fake Russian accent. Perhaps it's for some very annoying, but personally I thought this contributed to the overall atmosphere of the film. A Russian speaking perfect English would be unnatural to me. And it would make me really nervous if all conversations would be held purely in Russian. Tom Hardy plays an outstanding role as the war hero Leo Demidov who slowly but surely sees his status breaking down. Noomi Rapace (I thought she was magnificent as Lisbeth Salander in ""Män som hatar kvinnor"") stands her ground as the embittered wife of Leo. And Joel ""Run all night"" Kinnaman wasn't so bad as the vengeful Vasili (a coward who becomes threatening due to his acquired dominant position). Maybe it's because I haven't read the book this film is based on, since I thought this was an excellent film. But there's this golden rule when it's about book adaptations.

Well Done,"There are plenty of fair reviews on this movie, some that liked it, some that did not. I liked it, as my rating indicates.I'm mostly writing to express my disagreement with all those who viewed the movie as a betrayal of the novel. In my view, the novel was just awful - turgid, overwritten, with some action scenes that strained credibility, and a coincidence at the center of the plot that was beyond ridiculous. I detested the erstwhile Soviet Union, and the Stalinist years were hypocritical and vicious beyond Western understanding - but even at that, some of the descriptions of Soviet judicial processes in the book were extended to the border of caricature.In my view, one of the strengths of the movie was the craftsmanship of the screenwriter in transforming the mess of the novel into a workable two hour screenplay. The alterations in the plot were all to the good. The only concession to reality was the demonization of one of the villains. All in all, it became a pretty good melodrama, which did not unduly strain credibility, and to which the British cast (Tom Hardy in particular) gave the usual good service.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Thriller that's Small on Thrills,"Child 44 is a decent movie with a reasonably developed storyline and a very talented cast. As far as the flaws in this film goes, the performances are the least of their worries, Tom Hardy shines in the lead role, proving his versatility as an actor once again and showing that he is currently one of the best actors in Hollywood, the best scenes are certainly the ones between him and Gary Oldman, as we watch them both shine in a movie that they're both too good for, even the small parts have brilliant casting, with top class actors such as Jason Clarke and Vincent Cassel all delivering brief, well acted cameos. For a thriller, the film is very tight on actual thrills, and it's a shame because the storyline alone made this sound like an ""edge of your seat"" type of movie, but there just aren't any big moments, no parts that shock and terrify its audience and give us a clear sense of the dangerous situation the character is in, the most thrilling moments are the ones that are mentioned, but are never actually shown, and if you're expecting an exciting finale that makes up for the slow moving two hours, don't get your hopes up. The film also seemed to have had a major issue with tone, it was never quite sure where it was going, it had moments that played like a thriller, others like a compelling drama, then some psychological scenes, it was never really sure what genre of film it actually wanted to be, and I think if the film had stuck with being a drama then it could have been much better, the slow moving story arc would have been appreciated more and audiences wouldn't be left disappointed because of it being advertised as a straight up thriller, which it definitely wasn't. For the performances, it's worth the watch, but you shouldn't go out of your way to see it, Child 44 simply isn't worth it.During the reign of Joseph Stalin, a Russian police officer investigates a series of child murders.Best Performance: Tom Hardy Worst Performance: Noomi Rapace",6.0,Anonymous,History

Great imagery of what life was like in Stalin's Russia.,"This movie was banned in Russia from day one due to their rekindled nostalgia for anything Soviet especially Stalinist.The imagery in the movie showing what life was to like in Stalin's Russia is very realistic and accurate. Historically there were very few movies created by Hollywood that realistically depicted Soviet life especially the Stalin's period. Ironically Hollywood has more comedies about Soviet Union than historical dramas. I believe there were political reasons for this if you look into the history of Hollywood and the Cold War.I highly recommend the movie to anyone intrested in history of Russia and how their culture was formed in the early days of the Soviet Union. This film is also relevant to their current political situation. I really enjoyed how the movie visually takes you to that time period and gives a viewer a realistic glimpse of life in the Stalinist Soviet Russia.It's highly disturbing how nostalgic Russians have become for the most violent gruesome and deplorable part of their history as we can see from many brainwashed reviewers. Stalinist period is nothing to be proud of, making ussr a giant prison camp with no value of individual human life and building a society through slave labor murder and ethnic cleansing is not an achievement and was the reason USSR failed In the first place.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"""In a time of universal deceit, speaking the truth is a revolutionary act""","Directed by Daniel Espinosa (SAFE HOUSE), and starring Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace (among others), CHILD 44 tells the story of one man's effort to bring a serial child murderer to justice in a society where the mere existence of murder is denied. The society in question was Soviet Russia, ca. 1953, and the existence of such evil things was basically unthinkable/untenable in what was ostensibly a ""worker's paradise."" In a general sense, based on the lackluster reception from both audiences and critics, I wasn't expecting too much from this. I didn't too much care for Daniel Espinosa's previous film, SAFE HOUSE, but he does have a gritty style that I appreciate. What interested me more was the incredible cast he assembled for what I thought was going to be a rather simple, if protracted (at 137 minutes), crime procedural. What I got actually spent more time on the human drama, which I didn't mind at all, although more time could have been spent on moving the plot forward in what was a film with a rather languid pace. I also took some issue initially with a non-Russian cast putting on their best Russian accents. Some do better than others (Noomi Rapace, in particular), but for the most part I got used it and it never really bothered me after about 20-30 minutes. What the film does really well is examine Soviet Russian society in the 1950's, with all of the paranoia, backstabbing and low standard of living for the common person. In that respect, the milieu the film portrays and the way in which it is portrayed create an atmosphere that all but chokes out any sense of justice or hope. That's what makes the central characters' journey so compelling, aside from being well-written. You feel for them because the odds are not in their favor, and yet they continue to pursue a goal that puts their lives at risk. Also, in a more general sense the film explores the degree to which people will lie to themselves and others in order to avoid an inconvenient truth. When looked at from this perspective, the quote which opens the film (""There is no murder in paradise"") becomes, not a statement of fact, but a mantra repeated to stave off the knowledge that the world we live in is anything but a paradise. Although the film does take its time getting into gear, the journey it takes you on is well worth the wait and, despite the downbeat tone, it does have a fitting ending. Also, to the film's credit there were a few moments of violence that made me flinch. With the way movie audiences have become desensitized to violence, it was refreshing to have a film where it serves a purpose and has real impact. Overall, this isn't really a film that I'd soon watch again (due to the depressing subject matter), but is something that should be seen by more than have already. Don't believe the negative buzz and just give it a try.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Considered, sobering, if a little plodding","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the early 1950's, the Ukrainian people are living under a regime of forced starvation under Josef Stalin. Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy) is a dedicated officer in the army, who's suspected of being a traitor for not turning in his fiancé Raisa (Noomi Rapace.) However, he's soon ruffling feathers again when he starts drawing attention to a series of child murders that appear to have been taking place along the train tracks. He finds himself transferred from Moscow to a different area, where he is met with resistance from General Nesterov (Gary Oldman), before a climactic final showdown with the killer.Serving as a kind of alternative period piece, Child 44 transports us back to a most grim of periods, which is captured in pretty much every aspect of its production, whilst relaying a fairly typical detective story. A film set in the grimmest of times telling an even grimmer tale. Generally speaking, it's not a film to have a laugh with. It's captured most effectively in the drained, gloomy lighting and dark cinematography. The script is equally humourless, which perfectly matches the already established mood.Since the tone has been captured so perfectly, all that remains to be spoken of is the writing and performances. Spreading out over a long time frame, it's an intelligently written piece if sadly a little dull, without the nail biting suspense consistently injected into the script to make it really effective. Performances wise, Hardy does a decent Russian accent and appears as committed to his role as any other, a feat matched by younger (and now sadly less relevant) version Oldman. A lively supporting cast, including Joel Kinnaman and Vincent Cassel, keep the project charging down the tracks.It's a decent mystery thriller, then, if a little long and dull, and very little to laugh at. ***",7.0,Anonymous,History

The movie does mention Holodomor, Stalin's policy of starvation against the Ukrainians. Also, in one of the scenes it show a Red army soldier wearing 5 watches suggesting that the watches were stole. The reality of the Battle of Berlin were much more gruesome with many rapes and murders of civilian women by the Red army soldiers.

Anti-Soviet Propaganda,"""There is no murder in paradise.""Another of my most anticipated films of the year that failed to live up to my expectations. I usually tend to look forward to films based solely on the director, but this time I was excited about the cast: Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke, and Noomi Rapace. Child 44 is an adaptation of Tom Rob Smith's best selling novel directed by Daniel Espinosa (Safe House) set in Stalin-era Soviet Union. Of course it is easily going to be labelled as anti-Soviet propaganda considering it is based on a novel written by a British author and directed by a Swedish director. The screenwriter, Richard Price (The Color of Money), is American and despite being set in Russia no one in the cast is Russian. Child 44 feels like one of those movies that came out during the Cold War trying to prove to the Western world how awful the Soviet communist regime was. You have British and Swedish actors playing Russian characters, but speaking in English with Russian accents because it wouldn't be as accessible to us if they had them speaking Russian. I'm not a fan of this style of film making and would much rather them stick with the original language, but we probably would miss out on seeing such a talented cast like this if that were so. The accent issue isn't the greatest problem with this film however, the tone of the movie is inconsistent and there are several tonal shifts that simply make the story drag at times. Child 44 is 135 minutes long and you feel every minute of it.Tom Hardy is Leo Demidov, a Soviet military police officer who was adopted at an early age after the death of his parents. By chance he became a war hero thanks to a picture taken of him waving the Soviet flag over Berlin after their victory. Now in the early 50's he has an important rank working in Moscow as a military officer married to Raisa (Noomi Rapace) and he enjoys sharing the story of how they met with his fellow officers. He's idealistic and pursues anyone who is against the Stalin regime labelled as traitors. When a young boy is found dead near a train station the officials dismiss the cause of death as simply an accident, but it is evident that the kid was brutally murdered. But of course under the Soviet regime there can't be any murders because they're supposedly living in a perfect society. The kid happened to be the son of one of Leo's friends, Alexei (Fares Fares), and so he begins having his doubts about the cause of death. However that doesn't go well with Major Kuzmin (Vincent Cassel) who warns him to leave it at that. After successfully capturing a traitor named Anatoly (Jason Clarke), the officers get a list of names of other suspects from him. Raisa happens to be on that list and Leo is asked to testify against his wife and bring her in, which seemed to be a way of testing his commitment to the regime. He refuses to turn her in and is disgraced, demoted, and exiled to a small town near Moscow to serve under General Mikhail Nesterov (Gary Oldman). When another child victim is found there in similar conditions, Leo convinces Mikhail to look into it and they secretly begin investigating the case.The premise of the story is very interesting, but unfortunately this period piece takes its time to introduce each character. I've read that the first cut of the film was over 5 hours long and you can tell here that it hasn't been edited in the best way because there are several tonal shifts throughout the film. Price was given the almost impossible task of adapting the screenplay of this novel without trying to leave any of the subplots out. There are several elements of the story that could've been ignored and which would've allowed for a much better pacing, but unfortunately every time the thrills began to draw me back to the story they introduced another narrative arc that drowned the pacing once again. If the film focused exclusively on the search for this mysterious serial killer it could've been a strong thriller because the performances in this film were all solid. Tom Hardy is great in his role and he alone almost makes the film worth recommending. Gary Oldman, Joel Kinnaman, Noomi Rapace, Fares Fares, Paddy Cnsidine, Vincent Cassel are all convincing as well, but they don't get as much screen time and some of their narrative arcs aren't as interesting.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,History
There's no such thing as murder in paradise,"Ostensibly a crime thriller, this film is really a portrayal of what life is like in a totalitarian state, with the 'great leader' telling everyone they live in paradise and forcing them all to agree if they don't want to be persecuted. The result is generalised fear and a perfect breeding ground for cowardly monsters. Fortunately, there are always some with the character and courage to resist.

A grim tale of a dark subject.,"Set in Stalin's post-war Soviet Union, this story of serial child killings runs parallel with that of the strained relations between Hardy and Rapace's lead characters, Leo and Raisa. In Moscow, the discovery of a friend's son's body and the state's denial of such crimes and subsequent cover up provoke something in Leo. He uses his powers as a senior Soviet police officer to pursue the perpetrator, against orders. This, combined with an embarrassing clash with a fellow comrade sees him stripped of rank and dispatched to a dystopian, remote industrial town as punishment. Dismissed from her teaching job, Raisa goes with him. As forces conspire against Leo, they must make a stand together. So, a different town but yet, another murder. What is their connection? Desperate to find answers, especially for his friend, Leo must persuade the local police chief that there is a connection between here and Moscow, where his case started.

And the commentary that is left is more of the ""this is what life was like under communism"" and less of the ""this is how the communist system interfered with the investigation and postponed his arrest""You can kind of taste the difference between the two, as they are both important, the cops look more incompetent with this version, and that is, I think, doing them a bit of a disservice.On the other hand, I doubt one would see either criticism if it were made today, so...take what you can get.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Absorbing but unusual thriller,"I haven't read the book and only just watched the movie. My first thought was that I did enjoy it - but that it was a very unusual movie experience.

Perhaps it would have been best being made as a Russian movie with English subtitles. But it wasn't so we have to accept it for what is is. As a thriller? It is good. The story line is good, and extremely disturbing. I though Tom Hardy was great, Noomi Rapace wasn't, Paddy Considine was effectively creepy and that we just didn't get enough of Gary Oldman. I think that it lost focus at some point on being a dark thriller and tried to add too much historical background (although I can see why they did this). On this front I think that it lost something and let down some of the performances. I have to say I was very impressed with Joel Kinnaman's performance, who gave serious credentials to his role and was a match for Hardy.

"Tepid and caricaturesque, despite its potential","While having a high-level casting, a quite interesting subject (Stalinist USSR State hides a serial killer's children murders because acknowledging the crimes would damage official ideological speech about crimes existing only under capitalism and not under Bolshevism) and being technically well shot, this flick that too serious drawbacks to accomplish a good outcome. First of all, it is unbelievable that instead of making the actors and actresses speak Russian (what would be the ideal, as the characters are doing that in the story) but also instead of making them speak normal English as in 99.9% of Hollywood productions, they though that is would be a clever idea if everybody spoke English with a ridiculous exaggerated Russian accent. Generally, accents appear in a film to contrast native speakers with foreigners, it is nonsense that all characters speak English with that accent. This caricaturesque approach off corse is extended to all depiction of Soviet Union, as expected, with the most vile soldiers, widespread sadness, greyish dark palette imagery, and so forth. According to Wikipedia, this led Russian minister of culture Vladimir Medinsky to criticize (reasonably, I must add) that Soviet Union is depicted similarly to how Tolkien describes Mordor in The Lord of the Rings. The flaws in the film are not only those linked to its Rambo/James Bond/Rocky Balboa way of portraying USSR. The movie may also be critisized for its incredibly unnecessirily long length. As a matter of fact, there is too many parallel minor events that do not really contribute for the main plot, for character building or for anything eles, just turning the movie long-winded and not engaging.

Good but slow,"Child 44 was a good movie. Not great though it could have been. I found it a bit too long and plodding. Acting by Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman was effective and Noomi Rapace was better than in other movies I've seen her in. (I loved her as Lisbeth Salander, and she was good in Prometheus but in subsequent movies just so so). The story drew me in. The ending was a bit too pat, too Hollywoodish for me with the fight and deaths. The costume and set design was wonderful. The portrayal of 1950's Russia looked cold, wet, dirty and bleak. Clothes, besides some official's uniforms, were worn and faded. It looked very realistic. I would watch a sequel if one was made. The characters of Leo and Raisa Demidov and General Nesterov were portrayed as complex personalities that warrant further investigation. The movie is listed as a thriller but I would disagree with that label. There was not enough action for a thriller. It is more of a murder intrigue where the story unfolds slowly, a bit too slowly I think. Anyway it is worth a watch. I wish I had read the book before seeing the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Two unsatisfying story lines,"Child 44 is not a detective story.Nor does it make any sense otherwise.I watched the trailer here to be sure, and yes, this movie is advertised as the story of a search for a serial killer. It is not! I guesstimate that maybe one fifth of the storyline concerns police vs. a serial killer, and that storyline about chasing down a serial killer is very superficial, in which deductions are made as if ""out of the blue,"" and the killer is apprehended quickly. No suspense whatsoever.The main thrust of the ""plot"" is just as silly: a policeman (Tom Hardy) is a hero, is then disgraced and demoted (for dubious reasons), becomes a hero again and is promoted. Since the thrust of the movie portrays a regime's iron control over its citizens, it's illogical and even laughable that our ""hero"" should be reinstated after going way off the grid to pursue a killer against orders. That's just one prime example of this movie's nonsense!Another example: the character that Gary Oldman plays doesn't serve any purpose.Considering that the neither of the two story lines makes any sense, I'm inclined to believe that neither does the depiction of life at a certain time in soviet Russia.I agree with reviewer John Wayne from United States: ""Citizen X"" (1995) is an excellent movie about a search for a serial killer under a soviet regime: I recommend it.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Nicely done,"Child 44 has an intriguing plot and takes place in such an interesting era in soviet history. The film's not very straight forward because they really set it up, the era, the back stories, the relationship between the characters are all set up before they hit the ground running with the selling point of story. So you sort of know your characters - who they are, how they see themselves, and how other people see them - when you get in the thick of it.The set up in Child 44 makes for a lot of tense relationships and subplots in the film that only adds to the realistic feel of the situation. The sheer fear, paranoia, and despair is palpable. The cast did a great job as to giving us an insight of what's going on in these character's heads. There is a lot more going on than just the investigation, Agent Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy) has all these hurdles that he has to overcome to reach his goal, to potentially catch this serial killer.As interesting as the investigation is, the relationship between the characters is as captivating, but Raissa (Noomi Rapace) and Leo's is quite the unconventional love story. A great attention to details was put in the film but I gotta say, the contacts on some of the actors looked cheap as hell and sort of threw me off whenever I looked at them. And as good as I think the movie is, there is no doubt in my mind that the book is infinitely better because the film lacks a certain finesse that experiencing a book has.Child 44 is a dark thriller with an intriguing and riveting plot with great dramatic tension. @wornoutspines",8.0,Anonymous,History

The fact that this movie was banned by Putin's censors ( truth hurts! ) is in itself a very good reason why you should see it.This is a good portrayal of the grim, awful reality of life under the Stalinist regime and it shows very well what this murderous, totalitarian system ( that the Russians invented and wanted to spread all over the world ) was like and what it did to people. It crushed their conscience and the backbone of their humanity. It killed morality and any innate goodness of mankind. It created a Homo-Sovieticus who is still alive and kicking in today's Russia.And yet, no matter how much suffering and how many victims this monstrous system created, there are still communism apologists in today's Russia ( and elsewhere in the loony left western media world ) that just can't accept the simple truth that communism was as bad as Nazism.That's why they don't want you to see this movie, that's why they will tell you it's rubbish not worth seeing.

This movie is historical fake and grotesque of Western anti-Russian propaganda,"I have not read the book but the movie is a historical fake. Because:1) There was absolutely different spirit and atmosphere of Stalin's times. That was time of huge enthusiasm and high hopes in a social life. This movie show absolutely different thing. This is proved by huge economical and social achievements in a USSR's life of that times. After a 2nd world war USSR restored itself very quickly. Such huge achievements are completely impossible on a spirit of violence like this movie shows us.2) Movie contains a bunch of historical mistakes:a) a Kalashnikov rifle which was shown in hands of KGB soldiers was first time used in 1956 but here it was show in events of 1953.b) pentanal sodium as a ""truth serum"" first was used closer to the end of 1950th, but here it was shown used in 1953.c) the phrase at the beginning of movie about ""state-imposed famine against the Ukranian people"" is a politically motivated historical fake. Studying facts about that time and events completely refutes version of ""state-imposed famine"".3) The movies itself contains tons of weird anti-Russian propaganda:a) KGB never killed civilians in such way like this movies shows (at 0:15:02). Especially in a Moscow region! Such maniacal behaviour like shown in this movie from the side of one of KGB officers is impossible even as exceptional case in a far provincial village but here it is a Moscow region. So, it is completely unrealistic.b) The phrase ""... like Stalin teach us"" used by KGB officer in a movie is a fake - such stupid appliance of communism ideology was never used in KGB business! KGB officers were especially trained to have cold reason and excerpt. Especially in 1953 when Stalin's control style were still strong there.And there are lot, lot more complains on fakes and mistakes in this movie.However, by watching this movie you can study a ""black propaganda"" style - it is interesting to see what techniques were used by movie producer to play with feelings of audience.PS. If you were read some Western-published stories about USSR you need to know that during last 10 years it was cogently proved that such stories was a big fake. So, Alexander Solzheniczin, Viktor Suvorov and other such kind of authors were just ride the wave to earn some money on a anti-Russian propaganda.

It is a dark film, and the locations are grey, but it portrays a Russia of the past. No-one is suggesting this reflects current affairs. Tom Hardy is brilliant, his character is ruthless but compassionate at the same time. His performance is so watchable and carries the film. Noomi Rapace is also very good.

"Disgusting and shameless anti-communist, anti-Soviet and anti-Russian Western propaganda!","As a Greek, who lived for 12 years in Eastern Europe, in the so-called ""real socialism"", I saw this disgusting ""masterpiece"" of sh**, with the clear conscious that what I'm going to see, will be another one cold-war, anti-communist, anti-Soviet (and in the end, anti-Russian), 100% pure western propaganda, full of lies about the Stalin era and the socialism in general and I wasn't wrong.Let me explain something first: In Russia there are 4 seasons- summer, autumn and spring! Not only winter and snow!Also the Russian people are not beasts, neither monsters, as they are ""delivered"" to us from the Anglo-Saxon's propaganda garbage-movies. Russian people and Russia have never made genocides and crimes against humanity, like the WASP civilization did it (See the Nazi-German genocide in WW2 and the colonialist British genocide against India for example AND NOT ONLY!!).Stalin compared to Hitler, who brought bloodshed in Europe to more than 80 million people, compared to Churchill and all the British elites, who massacred millions in the anti-colonialist revolutions around the world, compared to Truman, who in one day exterminated hundreds of thousands of people in Nagasaki and Hiroshima (and the US crimes against humanity are continuing until today, with millions of victims around the world), WAS A ""SAINT"".The only crimes (executions after obviously rigged trials) that he committed, were against his own comrades from the politburo and especially the elite of the party, but also against simple party members and thousands of officers of NKVD and Red Army, in the dark years of 1936-1938, but not against soviet people in general. Yes, millions of people went to the GULAG camps, not only for political reasons, but also for criminal reasons. But anyway, millions of them returned, after their conviction.The foolish and totally idiotic, western-propaganda conception, that Stalin killed as much soviets as Hitler killed (28 millions) and it is in use now, by the West against Russia, in its confrontation for Ukraine, was fully rejected since 1991, in the Yeltsin (a totally Western puppet!) period from the Official State Archives of the Russian Federation, which clearly confirmed that:"" after the end of the Civil War in Russia (1922-1923) and until the death of Stalin (1953), the convicted to death and executed citizens in Soviet Union were 918.000 !""I have nothing more to say except that, the cynicism, the double-speaking, the falsification of History will not stop the fall of the WASP, globalist, capitalistic, Imperialist Civilization!

Educational while entertaining. Very relevant after Russia-Ukraine war.,"In 2015 this movie was censored in Russia. The minister of culture banned it, and surprisingly that didn't made headlines in the West.But it shows how Russia nowadays, they try to erase any criticism of USSR. So a movie is interpreted as an attack on the Russian population.In the movie, many characters die, some are tortured and others exiled to poorer provinces. That explains how the soviets essentially erased all creative, open minded people, and the survivors of communism were the yes men, the dishonest, the sadistic ones. Even people who were part of the military, secret police were always preying on each other. No one was safe and betrayal was the name of the game as long as Stalin's rule remains unchallenged.So if you want to understand why Russians are so ruthless right now , this movie might help to explain.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Sloppily Put Together Crime Thriller,"Child 44 follows a man who, after learning of the deaths of several children, begins a search for the man who murdered them, despite the fact that they were written off as accidents.I love me a good crime thriller, really I do. And when I see a plot like this where the movie is brave enough to deal with a subject like murdering children, then it casts Tom Hardy, then color me interested.Unfortunately, the actual plot doesn't start until the last forty minutes of this 137 minutes film. And even then, none of it is really all that interesting or even easy to follow. In fact by the time the plot starts rolling the script just stops trying to make sense. There's a scene that, under normal circumstances, would sound pretty awesome where a bunch of people start fighting and killing each other on a train cart, but in context there isn't actually any. The scene begins when some random expendable character pulls out a knife and tries to attack the protagonists. Somehow said protagonists know exactly what he's planning the second he stands up, and this big fight ensues. Sure, it's cool, but it doesn't make any sense. At that point I gave up on trying to understand the movie. The actual finding of the killer ends up being super anti- climatic and watered down, and it's just not engaging at all.What about the 100 minutes leading up to the actual plot you may ask? Nothing happens. It's 'character development' where none of the characters are interesting and nothing that pulls, or more drags, the oncoming plot along are anything special. It's just a whole lot of nothing.Overall Child 44 is kind of boring and dumb for the vast majority of it, yet somehow worse when the actual plot starts.

2/10,"An atrocious and disappointing experience, a bore from frame one to the very last, a real lesson on how not to make a movie. This comes from someone that has been on the Tom Hardy train before it even existed, I have been saying ever since last April that he deserved to win the best actor Oscar for ""Locke"". Same thing for Gary Oldman, I am a maniac of his work as an actor. But not even my love for these two actors could save the waste of time ""Child 44"" was.I do not ever give ""1s"" or ""2s"", It really has to be a wreck for me to go that low, yet that's what this film is. There aren't really any positives I can talk about with the exception that Hardy, Considine and Oldman are genuinely watchable. I generally give ""4s"" or ""3s"" to movies I hate because despite the fact that I totally disliked them I found that my seat didn't get uncomfortable. But man, this is a whole other level of bad. I despised this film. Espinosa goes deep into taking every possible wrong choice and leaves you wondering what the heck was he thinking when he put this together in the editing room? There must have been embarrassing silence in there for the whole process. This film looks like the product of amateurs. I am surprised that someone like Pietro Scalia edited this film together, he is actually a great editor. Yet here he was probably editing while being drunk. The cinematography definitely doesn't help. Calling it horrible would be a favor. There is some of the worst cinematography and lighting I have ever seen in my life and I wonder how the FU*K did this make it to a professional level. From the second scene in the movie you take it that you won't ever understand what is going on in an action sequence because the shaky cam is preposterous, but man not even understanding what's going on in a dialogue scene?? How is that even possible, you managed to mess up fu**king dialogue scenes?? The photography of this film is so bad my eyes were hurting 20 minutes in. How the hell do you go from shooting the masterpiece that ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is to shooting this incomprehensible chaos? Joel Kinnaman gives another irritatingly bad performance. Don't get me even started on screenplay, story coherence or character development because there isn't any single one of those elements present in the film.I could go on ranting about ""Child 44"" for pages, but it isn't even worth it.

Historical Film Noir in the USSR,"Forget the low ratings,as this is an excellent movie. It's kind of like Film Noir with the flavor of historical Russia. It was set in 1953 and that is interesting as that is the year Stalin died. So, eventually, after his death, this is when the USSR began to loosen up a little bit without Stalin's craziness ruling over everybody and ruining many people's lives. So the characters change as in all drama, and the country is going to be in the throes of change as well.The combination of a detective thriller with the political repression of that period is brilliant, I think. It really gives you a two-track story. It has been said that all drama is about how a character changes as the story moves along. Truly Dickensonian in that sense.(I like Dickens)OK, the acting is great. Tom Hardy, of course. He is the new Gary Oldman as he can play anything. It is ironic, or is it?, that Gary Oldman is also in the movie. Noomi Rapace. Can't beat the Dragon Tattoo lady. She says very little and says so much.

I am far from thinking that this film is a comedy (on the contrary), but I'm curious how after the phenomenal success of ""Citizen X"" there were so courageous filmmakers who dare to do something like remake of it?Obviously, the wave of anti-Russian hysteria is fruitful opportunity for any sort of performances from literary and filmmakers, but in this particular case - unsuccessfully realized. Maybe Ridley Scott must find the courage to engage with directing instead of acting only as a producer? Perhaps the Russians had to let this film widely in Russian cinemas to show the audience a failed attempt to paraphrase the story of Chikatilo, inspired by ideological premises?Actually it does not matter, just the efforts of a great cast are wasted due to propaganda exertions and ad hoc political-ideological campaign. There is nothing more annoying than stupid propaganda. I can not say that this is a very poorly made film by itself, however, certainly looks that way after ""Citizen X"".

"People, don't listen to idiotic comments. It's quite good movie.","Firstly, as I said don't be fooled by negative opinions. I will tell you about it later. Movie is good. It has interesting, engrossing story and is well played. Tom Hardy is as good as he always is. It was pleasure to watch him portraying Leo Demidov. The same the others. Well done! However, in my opinion the murderer identity was revealed to quickly. There are some other imperfections but on the whole it is this kind of film that you can spend you money and time one without regret.Now, about negative opinions. You may hear and read that the movie is US anti-Russian propaganda, lie etc. I suggest you to not listen it . In most of the cases these opinions are written by Russians who are brainwashed by communist/bolshevik/putinazi propaganda and THIS is the real propaganda. Of course, this is not historical movie, it's only a thriller, a criminal drama with fictitious characters but it can give you a glimpse into what USSR was under the rule of bolsheviks and Stalin himself. It was a country where fingering and distrust were almost a normal state. You could be denounced by your wife/husband, brother or son and be sentenced years in GULAG or be killed as an ""enemy of the state"" just for telling jokes about Stalin or expressing loudly your negative opinion about the party ideology or the country. This is true. I studied in Moscow, I have visited Russia many times and for ten years I have lived in one of the former USSR country in Central Asia. I met people many of whom are descendants of exiled ""enemies of the state"". Some of them, now in the age of 90, still remember that horrible time. I have heard a lot of stories, sad stories about late 30s, 40s under Stalin's regime. Remember, communists in USSR made a boy who denounced his father to the political police a hero and role model for all young people and children. Now Russian are trying to excuse and justify an oppressive system built on terror by murderer Lenin and his followers. Bolsheviks to keep the power, which was taken by force, killed millions of Russians and rest of them kept in fear but Russians still honor Lenin in his mausoleum in the heart of Moscow. Probably most of the negative reviewers haven't even watched this movie, they just follow the same pattern as was used in case of Solzhenitsyn's books: ""I haven't read Solzhenitsyn but I reckon that ...""(blah, blah, blah about how bad is he and his books).

Typical Hollywood bobble-heads.,"While it has been many years since the varying interest (money men & tax experts, liberal ideologues, and the ever present legions of pure sycophants who's only wish is to ""be"" with whomever they have a crush on this week) all have an epiphany regarding a single ""project,"" they never say movie when they know so many PC and other criteria mist be met before even the script is finished, upon which each investor (the money-bags for sure but also others who will invest time and talent to make everything work) must be satisfied that, on the surface, at least, you get a good (not likely) movie, which is the case here. However, there are numerous problems connected with the pure waste of film that Child 44 represents, as follows: A. The movie is a direct ripoff of Citizen X (1995) which was a loosely based story of Russia's first serial killer Andrei Chikatillled of over 50 who killed over 50 people in the old Soviet Union. B. The story was rearranged-written to pander to the current whitehouse attitude toward the Russian Confederacy so now it puts the evil government against other Russian police-type good-guys. C. The victims were gratuitously changed from mainly women to all boys so as to pander to yet one more of hollywoods numerous pressure groups D. And to add insult injury hired the current hot (sexy yet respectable) Swedish actress Noomi Rapace (to guarantee at least a few ticket sales) and topped off with the veteran (for those who care about acting) actor Gary Oldman in order to have a slid lead for the story to demonstrate requisite conflict that MUST be (even if it has to be manufactured) in all Hollywood productions. So what does everyone else know that the bobble-heads here do not--quite simple actually, i.e., the film was made to advertise a message (needlessly set in 1953 ultra dreary Russia when this dog could have been set at any time or place), i.e., us-good-Russia-bad, he socially correct message that no one has it as hard, no put intended, as gay's do these days. All in all I thought this dog was dreary and interminably over-long despite some good acting by Rapace and Oldman, to say nothing of the films heavy handed, group-think, approach to delivering messages pro-anything the current administration thinks we commoners need to learn (yeah, yeah we get it, Putin bad, liberal opinion good).

The final product of Child 44 is the exact right mix of overstuffed and underdeveloped that would come with shaving three hours out of a five hour movie while trying to keep as much in as possible. The big moments are still there, but so much of the connective tissue is gone.There are really two interrelated stories at play in this film. The first is what's on the posters and what was made into the television movie Citizen X, the story of a child murdered in the Soviet Union. Murders don't happen in the Soviet Union. Murder, according to Stalin, is a purely capitalistic disease and murders, as gets said several times, do not happen in paradise.This story gets sidelined for long stretches by the second story, which is a more expansive view of life in Soviet Russia as seen through the eyes of Leo Demidov, an MGB agent, and his wife Raisa. This tries to capture the horror of daily life in the Soviet police state, where every word could be reported to authorities and your entire life ended by mere suspicion. That's dramatized early when Leo himself tracks down a veterinarian who immediately starts running when he sees MGB agents on his tail. He's not guilty of anything, but he knows that if he gets caught then his life is over.The movie starts both of these stories pretty well, giving us time to appreciate the slow horror of both of them, but by about the halfway point, once Leo gets demoted to the militia and sent to the country, things begin to skip and speed up. Gary Oldman is prominently featured in the marketing, but he has about a scene and a half. We skip through the investigation of further child murders to suddenly get a complete list and Leo and Raisa have to go back to Moscow for unclear reasons. There they interact with one of Raisa's former fellow teachers who ends up being an MGB spy trying to entrap people at the school, and it gets revealing while Leo is killing the man with a phone cord. The two end up on the run, but it's unclear why. Is it because they killed the man without anyone witnessing the murder? Is it because they got into Moscow on faked papers?And why does Leo continue this investigation, especially after he's been released from the police. He ends up taking Raisa around to a manufacturing plant where they track down the killer before getting into a fistfight with a former fellow MGB agent who's tracked them down. The connective tissue between all of these scenes is gone.Mentioning Citizen X is instructive. It strives to tell only half the story that Child 44 does, and it does it much better because it has over 100 minutes to dedicate only to that. It's not a great film, but it's a solid procedural from another world. Looking at the similar story of Child 44, they only dedicated about sixty minutes to the crime and investigation itself, and it's lost in a bunch of other shortened stuff along with it.The action of the film ends when Leo and the antagonistic MGB agent get into a fistfight in the mud. Now, a second for an aesthetic comment. When you make your film aesthetically unpleasant, you build a handicap for yourself because your film is simply unpleasant to look at. You can still make a great film, but you're making the job harder for yourself. This may be appropriate considering the material at hand, but it doesn't change the reality that making a movie that is ugly to look at will not help you with most audiences. Child 44 is, from beginning to end, hard to simply look at. On top of that, it's about a child murderer and the oppressive life under Stalin. There are levels of ugly to this film that extend deep into the subtext, and it never lets up, culminating in the fistfight that ends with one man getting his head violently thrown against a rock. I'm not saying this movie is bad because it's ugly (I think I've listed the reasons clearly enough), but the ugliness simply put up a barrier between artist and audience that may not have been completely necessary. As a counterpoint, I think of Tarkovsky's Stalker, which was filmed in a Soviet state, in a region of industrial decline and nuclear radiation, but it's gorgeous to look at despite all that.It's ugly, about difficult material, and it shortchanges every aspect of its storytelling because they never found a way to write a screenplay condensed enough to tell the story they wanted to tell. They filmed it all and ended up having to shorten it significantly in editing to disastrous results. Perhaps the full five hour version is a better film, but we'll never see it because the movie ended up losing so much money that the studio will never touch it again.",2.0,Anonymous,History
A powerful and haunting film about a brutal regime!,"Every once in a while a movie comes along which reminds the world of a place long forgotten, an unsettling piece of our history. This is what 'Child 44' does as it portrays the brutality of the communist regime of the Soviet Union post second world war. The film is based on a disgraced military officer's search for a serial killer who the authorities fail to accept actually exists. The film is not based on the manhunt but more on the communist values of the USSR and the plight of the poor victims. Tom Hardy and Naomi Rapace deliver towering performances as they face their own struggles as well as a desperate search for the truth. The film is tense and bleak, where something disastrous could happen at any turn and that is the fear the movie successfully transfers to the viewer. The setting is dull and the pace of the movie is slow but this gives the movie a haunting look. The film could not have had a more refined cast with the likes of Tom Hardy, Naomi Rapace and Gary Oldman at work with an intelligent script that never loses it's focus. The critics fail to understand what the movie is trying to portray and the truth is that we have got use to high octane action sequences, dramatic shootouts and explosive characters. With 'Child 44', we have an honest and powerful tale of a brutal regime that shut itself off from the world and believed they had created 'paradise'. @zulfmanauthor",9.0,Anonymous,History
A dark and brooding mess of a film..,"Child 44, a dark and brooding mess of a film about a serial killer in 1950's Ukraine. Distracting, fake Russian accents, uninteresting dialog and a supercast one wouldn't expect to have signed up for a film with such a scruffy scenario, turns this movie into a torture to make it through to the credits.A completely redundant effort as well; this film was already made with far more aplomb at the hands of Chris Gerolmo when he made Citizen X (1995), starring Sutherland, von Sydow and Stephen Rea. A similarly themed film that is far better crafted even without the usage of bloated cinematic prowess and CGI extravaganza which is commonplace today.Go watch that little nugget in stead.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112681/",1.0,Anonymous,History
Dramatically intriguing thriller all the way through,"This movie is very underrated since both acting and the movie itself is very well made. From my point of view it was so dramatically intriguing I almost bit off every single nail before it ended 2 h and 17 minutes later. The great actors did not save any powder and made the long time spent well worth it. Also I have not read the book and that might be for the best of my health without the sleepless nights. I might just be satisfied with what this movie gave me. An excellent show in it's category that made my mind go bananas and barely let me get a hold of myself before hitting me with an invisible hand, having my deep diving focus a little bit dazed. It's what happens when you get too mesmerized by all the violence and mystery going on.

Maybe Putin is an improvement over Stalin but similar in many aspects. I had a very negative opinion of Russians prior to watching the movie but later felt empathy and was reminded we are all human and we need to make the world a better place.

A really good thriller,"Man, I managed to avoid watching this movie for a year. I read some bad reviews and I kept thinking, I don't want to watch it, it's gonna be bad. Finally, because I had nothing else to watch, I decided to kill some time with this movie and I'm so glad I did. I haven't read the original book, and I try not to compare books and films because I will always get upset about what they did with the source material. Maybe if I'd read it, I'd be furious like some other reviewers out there.I really don't understand why people would call this movie boring and give it so little credit. Perhaps it's because they didn't understand that it was a movie about more than just the murders. I actually liked this concept a lot - the idea that there are several stories to it rather than just one story-line going smoothly from A to Z. Honestly, scene after scene I was wondering where the story would lead the characters, how it would end.The movie kept me hooked till the end. It was very intense, and quite scary too because the regime of the USSR was brilliantly portrayed and you can just sense that there must be something bad waiting to happen round every corner. If you imagine what life would've been like back in the day, you can feel what the director and screenwriter wanted to achieve.There were issues that should've been developed more. Some characters should've been given more attention and some things weren't explained so you have to figure stuff on your own - and maybe sometimes it's OK, but in this movie I think we should've been given a little more. For example, I didn't quite get why the whole operation was such a secret, why some people would kill some people and try to cover up the investigation. As much as I get that 'there's no murder in paradise' so you can't let anyone run around digging for some killer, I think that someone should've been interested in this guy. After all, 44 kids is kind of a big deal and why would you want to sweep that under the carpet?All in all, though, the story is coherent, the acting is great, the mood is dark and heavy just as it should be, and all the extra stuff that some people found unnecessary, in my opinion really adds to the movie and makes it multidimensional rather than a one-dimensional thriller-by-numbers. Such stories are about the people, not about the plot. Once you accept that this is this kind of movie, maybe it will be easier to watch it with an open mind.I loved it.",8.0,Anonymous,History

poor,"What a disappointment, just two point for Tom Hardy, as he truly IS Leo Demidov, I had him in mind when I read the book. But now to the movie itself: First of all, they tore the gripping story of the book apart and succeeded in emphasizing unimportant parts of the book while the real interesting part like Leos change from an Apparatschik to a human being with a conscience was totally left aside. They spend probably vast sums of money filming a totally useless war scene in Berlin where Leo in fact never was as he as in a special unit defending his country in the war, it was gruesome, what a waste. Anyway, read the book, be thrilled by the story, be touched by Leos inner fights, and imagine just Tom Hardy.By the way, Noomie Rapace looked like Leos frigid mother, there was never a hint that they finally found each other and gave their new love a chance, she is just an old hag what a terrible cast.Wassily also was a total miscast....the character was not developed at all, just a flat villain.This movie would have need a narrator I guess in order to cover all the shades of the story, just plain acting did not do the job.Do not waste your time, read the book (the books actually, because there are three of them with Leo).",2.0,Anonymous,History

Thumbs down!,"A good story totally ruined by a bad director. Great actors have been degraded thanks to Espinosa. English with Russian accent was and always is a terrible idea, especially when you choose the actors that have problems with performance in this made-up-dialect. The story is also misleading the audience a few times in the film making 3-4 stories in the same film, jumping from one to another, with a poor or no explanation in a single part of the movie. At the end I was confused, didn't know how to connect the events into the plot. At first seemed we search for a murders done by Soviet system, then ups!-it's not, there is somebody, a single killer, but seems protected by government (why?who knows!), then we have some stupid short story about drugged nazidivisions which are inserted into the Soviet-system to revenge their defeat in war. At the end- No,again! It is all about a sick ex-soviet officer from the WW2 who is crying at the end end being shot just 2 minutes after showing up in the movie.

historically incorrect political propaganda,"This film is full of prejudices, propaganda, factual errors and plot holes. There is no single positive person in a whole film except two main characters. Moscow and all cities shown are dark, filthy, polluted and dirty. All system is corrupted and it seems that police is doing all they can-NOT to catch a killer. In reality Chikatilo, real serial killer, committed murders from 1978 to 1990 and not after the world war II during Stalin era as it was shown in the film. It is not true that the state was trying to deny existence of a killer (and murders generally) in Soviet Union. In fact, a team that was established to work on a case consisted of 10 investigators. In film, only the lead character is trying to catch a killer and the whole state is against him in an attempt to prove that there is no crime in a perfect state, no murder in paradise. Again wrong, all newspapers at the time were writing about murders and serial killer, even Chikatilo himself was reading about his murders in the papers. There are so many improbable things, small woman (scene in a train) kills a man 2 times bigger than herself who was also carrying a knife, killer in a factory recognizes inspector who is chasing him-how? Pacing is slow, a lot of time is wasted on depicting bad officials and dialogue between two main characters Leo and Raisa (no chemistry at all, bad acting). What should be the main part of the film-serial killer who killed more than 50 people is less than 20% of a film. Serial killer character is unconvincing, cartoonish, even laughable.

"Slow burn, but worth your time","A compelling story, and I sense the screenplay has stuck very close to the novel (I can almost detect specific lines from the book in this). I'm going to read it right away!
Excellent turns from the always honest, complex Tom Hardy, and mercurial Gary Oldman. Joel Kinnaman (I'd only seen him in House of Cards, up to now), Paddy Constantine (can he just be in everything? Playing wonderfully well against type, here), and Noomi Rapace are all compelling ambiguous, and all actors convey excellent depth, subtly communicating the back stories of their characters with deft show-don't-tell. Good, also, to see Jason Clarke. Pretty much my favourite lineup of character actors! All they needed was Jared Harris, but the always wonderful Mark Lewis Jones fills that gap with no problems!
The end is particularly worth the journey, but I can't help but think this storyline would've been better served by a mini-series, allowing more time and pace to develop the themes and context (aspects the thoughtful, experienced and utterly believable cast manage to do, nonetheless). Beautiful production design and sense of culture/society/place. Again, another reason to read the novel.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Masterful Book brought down from Paradise to the Big Screen.,I don't know what to say to be honest. I was so looking forward to this film that when I saw the trailer I up and bought the entire Trilogy of the book series. I'm not a big reader at all but I read the entire first book in five days which for me is Impressive. I absolutely loved the book it is a Masterpiece and the best book I have ever read and I plan to read the other two sequels. I have now got that out of the way I shall continue on with the movie review. The cast was Superb I will say there is no denying that in any way shape or form though they weren't utilized properly besides Tom Hardy as Leo because he is the main protagonist. I also felt the story moved extremely slow which in the book it was a roller coaster of a ride. The thing that upset me the most was that they changed key plot points and since I just finished the book the day I saw the film it was fresh in my mind. I feel that the points they changed just killed it for me and as for anyone who hasn't read the book they might enjoy this film more so then I did. I would recommend skipping this and buying the book series and reading that instead which is painful for me to say because I was so stoked for this film and it was such a let down. I will say as for the action it was there in a few key points which was a hell of a lot less then the book had and also one last thing to add is most of the reviews from critics were correct which is rare.

Good direction, exquisite performances by the cast, more than a correct editing and choice of music and so on on one side. On the other side, during SSSR, no one ever said to anyone ""Yes, sir"". There were no ""sirs"". Just ""comrades"". If you place movie in Russia, let it at least look like Russia at that period. Not so many cars on the streets, not so nice buildings (as in Prague, where the filming took place). Let actors speak plain English (or Russian) and, for God's sake!, DO NOT spoil everything with some fake Russian accent. This is not the first time that Hollywood uses English with some foreign accent (Book Thief?). Why? What's the message? You do not have any idea how irritating this is. Also, in one scene, when Leo and Raisa change clothes, Tom Hardy is clearly seen wearing jeans. Jesus! So many stupid (producers'?) acts and yet the movie is very good, well told.

I mean I would have understood the necessity for accent, if the story was happening somewhere abroad, and it would be natural for actors to speak in English with Russian accent. But why make it here? To add more value to the characters? But nobody speak their native language in their homeland with accent. Bit odd. Big question to the director? why?",9.0,Anonymous,History

Good movie from Eastern Europeans,"Unfortunately you have to be from former eastern block to understand this film. Probably USA viewers could not understand why was too difficult to travel in former USSR, even now its impossible to live in Moscow if do not have a Moscow citizenship. In 50's if do not have visa its was impossible to buy train ticket between two Russians cities. Second why they did not catch the murderer it was so simple a few people could travel across the country.The director failed to explained this to USA and western Europe viewers.

Not Bad If You Haven't Read The Book,"I saw the film first and liked it prior to reading the book. Then I read the book and the film immediately lost its appeal. Many times, if not always, the film doesn't match the drama or intensity of the book, we all know that. However, in this case they left out plot lines and changed some major events. Unforgivably, they completely changed the beginning and omitted the massive twist/reveal at the end of the novel. What is so frustrating is that they could have easily incorporated both into the film without adding more than 5 or 10 minutes to it. Very disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,History
An Outstanding Movie!,"I have never written a movie review but felt I had to say something about this film. The acting, the setting, and the two equally complex storylines that intertwine around the main characters, were remarkable. I have watched films that did not have nearly the depth or character development of this one, that somehow, received higher ratings and I don't understand why.The film is about a series of terrible murders and the Russian military officer determined to find the killer, but it's also about two people surviving in a world that conspires against their sense of decency and love for one another.""Child 44"" may be a thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat, but more so, it's a well crafted and deeply touching love story.Maybe that's why I found it so compelling. You can splash all the action and thrills you want on the screen, but if the story has no heart and no characters that you truly care for, it's like a giant pepperoni pizza made of cardboard.",9.0,Anonymous,History

This Movie is actually about a Serial Killer,"The user ""mattrose"" obviously did not see the movie ""Citizen X"" and hence does not know that this ""Child 44"" is a horrible remake which I overrated it at a 5.This movie may have been based upon a book, but the whole plot most of the time was very confusing and leaves one guessing at what the whole story is about until about the last 30 minutes or so. The Soviet system during the time of Stalin was a lot of back stabbing in order for one to gain favor and move up in the ranks.The real truth of this movie is that it is actually a horrid remake of the 1995 movie ""Citizen X"" which was about a search for one of Russia's most prolific serial killers; Andrei Chikatilo. In April 1992 Chikatilo confessed to a total of 56 murders from 1978 to 1990 and in October 1992 was convicted and sentenced to death for 52 murders, then In February 1994 he was executed.The clues that led me to the fact that this movie was a remake, was the mention of the town of Rostov and that most of murders occurred near two railway lines which where most of the murders actually did occur! If you haven't seen ""Citizen X"", I highly recommend it! It stars Donald Sutherland, Stephen Rea, Max Von Sydow, Joss Ackland, and Jeffrey DeMunn (as the killer); and all of their performances were just superb! Some dialog will make you laugh and some will bring tears to your eyes (as it did mine) so I rated this movie a 10.Enjoy",3.0,Anonymous,History

Agnieszka Grochowska is nice to see, again, and will hopefully do more fine films. I also enjoyed Fares Fares' performance and would like to see him do much more films. For those who enjoyed this movie I highly recommend watching a made for television movie called Citizen X which was based on a true story and Child 44 seems to mirror in some ways.

There's only one reason I don't give 10 to this movie...,"IT'S NOT THE BOOK people !! It's not the book ?!!I won't put any spoilers here folks, but I just have one thing to say. Read the book first.The movie is excellent, very enjoyable overall with incredible performances BUT IT'S NOT THE BOOk ! And by this I mean I still cannot believe they took out the greatest thing about the story ! The bit in the book that was like a punch in the stomach when we find the truth about the child 44 killer ! The best twist in the story is totally absent from this screenplay and this means that the psychopath in the movie version has no motive at all to do what he does. His reasons are presented in such a generic manner at the end that it almost destroys the entire movie and makes the killer character feel totally like a character that does not belong to this story after all. After the spectators spend two hours glued to all that is happening in the story at the end , the killer bit is totally irrelevant to the story !!Contrary to what happens in the book, where the killer is very well rooted in all the plot which connects the characters in unique ways. Not on the movie ! What ?! Why ?! Who thought that taking out the best twist in the book which is actually what gives meaning to the original story, a good idea ?!Why bother buying the rights to a book with such a great story and then remove all that was supposed to be the central twist of the mystery out of the screenplay ?! Somebody explain this to me because I'm absolutely puzzled here !So yet again people. READ THE BOOk FIRST ! Trust me , it won't ruin the movie for you because the writers in the movie took out the most important bits which are fundamental to the plot in the original story. The book also goes much in-depth into the characters past, even the secondary characters have a life of their own and everything feels like a thriller version of The Shadow of the Wind , if you know and loved the type of characters in that book, you'll find the same feel when you read the original Child 44 novel which is brilliant.The book is not the novel in so many aspects that it hurts. I got suspicious right at the start when I noticed that the structure didn't seemed to follow the most important bits in the novel and that really made me wonder what would happen after that regarding the characters. For example in the movie Vassilli is almost a cardboard villain, while in the novel the reader even has some empathy with him at many points of the story. And the killer is even a much deeper character than we see it in the movie. I need to shut up so I wont spoil a great book. Read the book first. The book has lots of parallel stories that are totally absent from the movie and which there's no reason for them not to be included.The movie , on its own is actually very good, some of the best scenes from the more dramatic bits in the novel are there, but even on this the movie downplays and simplifies everything. Nervetheless it's a very entertaining movie, with a great cast and brilliant acting and lots of atmosphere. It feels a bit fragmented sometimes but that is because of what gave some of the characters a soul was mysteriously removed from the screenplay.Perhaps the greatest mystery in the Child 44 movie version is why they did almost everything right except leaving out the great twist on the book regarding the killer mystery.But i need to give it a 8 out of 10 nevertheless because it's a great drama set on Russia and even from an historical point of view deserves to be seen.Just...read the book first. Please.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Very poor book adaptation,"I sincerely doubt that the author of original Child 44 novel, Tom Rob Smith, had a chance to read the script for this movie, as this movie adaptation of the plot is just beyond the definition of bad.Not only the movie has very little resemblance to the novel itself, it actually seems that the script writers have zero understanding of the Soviet history, upon which the events unravel.All events in the movie are not coherent, the motivation of characters is the mystery, and the thriller part gets lost in a seriously dubious attempt to portray the ugliness of ""the Soviet Russia"". And what did they do to Tom Hardy, why every sentence he says sounds like he's seriously drunk. Is that supposed to mean ""Russian accent""? So Russian language sounds like English, but after drinking half bottle of vodka?This movie is just so very bad, it's not even worth a review. The movie which was supposed to be about the mystery, is a mystery in itself - the mystery of how some good actors, including Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman, agreed to be in it. However, just to warn others, I must warn ya: better read the book, it's really good and don't waste time watching this movie. It really has nothing to do with the book, apart from the name itself.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"A Different View of a Horrible Time in History - With Brilliant Performances, Intriguing Storyline, and Overall Amazing Film - That Deserves FAR More Credit","""Child 44"" is a different kind of movie that takes place in the 1950's, (1930's in early flashbacks) & in USSR, among the communism & reign of The famous brutal Dictator, Stalin.As Stalin says ""There are no murderers in Paradise ,"" and in a communist society - if you even mention it - you die. Hardy, a high-ranking Russian officer is given a decision among claims that his wife is a traitor ( played by Noomi Rapace, who has been a personal favorite of mine since 2011's 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.')It's different but I really loved it; it's a mystery and a period piece of a time when any mention against Stalin's beliefs or even accusation of being a traitor gets you killed. I really like this take on the 'other side' of Russia, which teaches the brutal history of the USSR & times.This movie flew under the radar and had harsh reviews from so-called professional 'critics,' but it seems many movies they look down upon are ones that become my favorite. I was sick when I began watching this & didn't think I could watch much of anything that night. However, this film drew me in immediately; I was hooked for the entire time (a very nice surprise and a rarity.)It's based on the 'top selling' book in 2008 that won numerous awards & rated much more favorably than this film. Yet, I can't figure out why. I know, despite the critics who gave it negative ratings, there's been many who've countered with positive reviews of their own. I decided the same but it's far from the only reason.I TRULY enjoyed the performance of every actor in this film. While Hardy continues to stand out, Noomi Rapace is just as impressive (if not more,) as they take on this case of murdered children in an 'Us-vs-the-world' mentality. Gary Oldman also delivers a solid performance, as usual. Yet it really is the 'on-screen' relationship & energy between Hardy and Rapace that leaves a great, lasting impression.If you're Tom Hardy fan - it's definitely worth seeing. Even if you're not - if you enjoy mystery, period movies, crime/drama, history, action etc. - you'll love 'Child 44.' For all of those reasons - as well as a great deal more (that would give away spoilers) - I gave it a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not the book but I liked it,"This is one of those movies where the little details become more interesting than the plot. Its a detective movie without the detective. The actors are fine, some are outstanding. The sets and location shots are excellent. Lighting and sound were fine. Cinematography was overall really well done.Two problems stick out. It's not the book. OK, so what? ""It's not the book"" is almost an unfair criticism. But this movie didn't just take liberties with the story, it rewrote the damn thing. Almost like the scriptwriters overheard a broken conversation between two drunks talking about the book on an airplane flight, scribbled down some notes and pitched it to some money guy in Hollywood and bingo! got themselves a movie and a good bit of change too!.The second problem is the totally unsatisfying ending where the perp is I.D. and caught. Whoever the person was who thought of this ending should be banned from film forever. Don't assume the movie has a plot with a resolution, just watch it for the overall tone. Otherwise you'll be disappointed. The ending was abrupt, cartoonish, out of the logical sequence of events and obviously glued on because, well, why not? Deadline, y'know. Gotta meet that deadline.Still, with all of its flaws, taken in chunks that don't necessarily have to hang together at the end of the film (they don't) its a fascinating movie. Mix up patriotism, paranoia, betrayal and loyalty and watch out when they come to a boil.

Almost perfect...,"Let me begin with a confession: As far as I know I am heterosexual, but I have a very non-heterosexual fixation on Tom Hardy. And Idris Elba. And Carey Price. And Benedict Cumberbatch... But most of all, on Tom Hardy, particularly of late. Since I first discovered him... (That's right, I discovered him. At least that's how it works in my mind...) In the film Warrior, which I and a few friends only went to see as a kind of joke. I mean, none of us was expecting a movie around Mixed Martial Arts to actually be any good, and none of us had ever heard of the two leads, Hardy and Joel Edgerton. (Oh, yeah, him too...) So we were expecting it to be awful in that way that you can sarcastically make fun of for years to come. I have an extensive background in boxing and Mixed Martial Arts, so I was expecting to find that amusing and worthy of ridicule as well. (Since then there has been the brilliant television series, Kingdom and the hilarious Here Comes the Boom, so apparently you can make good things around MMA.) We were all particularly shocked by the intense and powerful performance of Tom Hardy. Of course we all assumed he had to be American and must be an experienced Mixed Martial Artist. I had no idea that I had already seen Hardy in RocknRolla and Inception then. Aside from having quickly become one of the finest actors on the planet, Hardy has an ability to physically disappear into roles in a way that we haven't seen since Gary Oldman's early work. Since then I've seen Hardy carry an entire film just driving in a car and talking on the phone in Locke, make you forget that you're watching the same actor playing twins in Legend, give powerhouse performances in films like The Drop, The Revenant and Bronson, audience thrilling performances in The Dark Knight Rises and Mad Max, Fury Road, and most recently give one of the best performances seen in a television series since James Gandolfini, his co-star in The Drop, in the stunningly good British production, Taboo. Hardy, as an actor is quite simply as good as it gets. So I found myself looking for anything else that Hardy has done which I somehow might have missed. And a friend told me about Child 44, which I had never even heard of. The film itself stretches believability a bit with the murder mystery aspect, asking us to buy into the idea that a Stalin era MGB (forerunner of the KGB) agent becomes obsessed with a child serial killer while his life is being torn to bits by the agency that he once worked for. The latter part has been written about extensively by writers like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. It truly was a kind of inevitability that these ""Blue Hats"" would find themselves the subject of the same brutal paranoia and torture which helped them rise to power. Hardy sells the former aspect brilliantly, but even then, it feels a bit thin at times that a man in such an environment would be able to, let alone could become fixated on solving murders in a world where Stalin himself had declared that murder did not exist, that it was a product of corrupt western capitalism. This is a very small, negligible problem with the film because of its brilliant cast, which includes the aforementioned Gary Oldman, Hardy's co-star from The Drop, Noomi Rapace, and Joel Kinnaman, who was so brilliant in the TV series The Killing, as well as films like Suicide Squad, as the villain (Yeah, okay, he's another one...). There is also a wonderful sub textual underpinning of the paranoia of that time and place and how that can lead to a world where nothing is what you think it is. Hardy's lumbering stoic presence is yet one more remarkable physical transformation. As is almost always the case with Hardy, and with so many great British actors, there is never a moment of self indulgence or sentimentality about his character, which is dead on for this particular character. Rapace, who is no stranger to strange European murder mystery, having risen to wide public acclaim in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, is wonderfully guarded and unreadable as Hardy's perhaps not so willing wife. Kinnaman, also having a background in Swedish film, is disturbingly calloused and unfeeling as Hardy's nemesis. And of course there's Gary Oldman, who, like Hardy, seems incapable of giving anything less than great performances. In this film, we see some vintage almost impossibly textured Gary Oldman moments, though his role is only slightly more than a kind of cameo. The rest of the cast is equally superb and the filmmaking is perfectly dark and brooding. That previously mentioned thin premise is almost entirely overpowered by the strength of the whole and is made only a minor blemish on an otherwise very close to perfect canvas. If you love Tom Hardy, even in a non-heterosexual way, you will definitely love this movie. Not quite as much as you may have loved Taboo, Locke, The Drop or Warrior. But probably as much as you loved Bronson or Legend.",9.0,Anonymous,History

It's Okay,"In 1953 Russia, Soviet hero General Leo Demidov (Hardy) of the MGB (precursor of the KGB) Military Police is ordered to investigate his wife Raisa (Repace) as she has been implicated in traitorous activities -actually mostly because she was friends with Brodsky (Jason Clarke) - who was a known traitor. Leo could find nothing to implicate her. Leo is also currently investigating child murders, but his superiors don't buy homicide because ""there is no murder in Paradise"" and label everything as accidents. Leo and Raisa are exiled to an out-of-the-way military base under General Nesterov (Oldman) who has no love for Leo.This is kind of complicated, but if you keep in mind that Leo needs to complete the child killings, catch the serial killer and hopefully get reinstated, you'll be fine. There are a lot of sub plots to distract you. In time, he gets the help from General Nesterov when Raisa tells the General's wife that the same killings could happen to her two boys who walk to school every day through the woods.Everyone in here has Russian accents and they are fine, and there are no sub-titles. (that's a break)The other thing you might keep in mind is there is a love story between Leo and Raisa. Leo is fully committed, Raisa not so much. (here we go) You will enjoy the banter between them as they try to work things out. Okay as Leo tries to work things out. Some scenes are pure gold. Good chemistry between them.The movie gets to be good when Leo and Raisa work together and this is where the movie really starts. (takes a while though)Overall not bad, but many, too many darkened scenes, and often the actors mumble their lines or talk so low we have no idea what was said.

It was the single place where you could hear the voice of freedom! I was only a child, but i remember the dark atmosphere, the power blackouts, the gray of the city, the constant fear to speak your mind...so much memories. No wonder that this side of the Europe is undeveloped, just think outside the box for a second, what chance has an orphan kid for an normal life?

Disgusting butchery of a novel,"Please, do not watch this mediocre movie with fake Russian accent. Go read the book.

Gut wrenching and well acted. Why did this get such bad ratings/reviews?,"I had never heard of this movie, but when I saw that it starred Tom Hardy, recorded and watched it. I found it to be riveting, and with a depth and beauty rarely seen in movies of these times. The box office failure is very similar to another beautiful film; Cinderella Man, starring Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger, that, (at least), got the reviews/credits it so deserved, unlike this movie. The typical movie going audience does not appreciate depth as much as flash, it seems. I almost stopped watching due to the intensity and utter bleakness of the setting, but then realized that was how damned good of a job they did to suck you into the pit of despair that was Russia of that time.

There is a murder mystery somewhere in here,"There was an interesting story here about a hunt for a grotesque child killer. Too often the main plot goes off the rails and is more to do with an unhinged subordinate with a grudge.Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy) is orphan turned war hero. Now in the early 1950s he is a high flying secret service officer in Stalin's Soviet Union. A state where murder does not exist in paradise. Murder is a capitalist disease. When they come across a murder it tends to be reclassified as an unfortunate accident.Leo comes across the death of a child near a train line. His father is a fellow friend and comrade. The father believes it was murder but Leo persuades him to forget about it.However deranged underling Vasili (Joel Kinnaman) has nefarious plans for Leo because Leo challenged him when he killed two people for harbouring a fugitive. He also has desires for Leo's wife Raisa (Noomi Rapace) who is accused of unpatriotic activities and Leo fails to denounce her.Leo is demoted and exiled to the remote town of Volsk. Leo works under General Mikhail Nesterov (Gary Oldman) who is at first suspicious of Leo, especially when a child's body is discovered along the rail line. However both reluctantly team up when they discover there have been a spate of similar killings over the years.There are several plot strands that compete for attention and the film never properly gels. In fact it is a dour stodgy mess that neglects the important part of the movie so it can have a go at the nightmare of Stalinism.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Perspective is key,"This movie is entirely a depiction of the Stalin-era from the inside and all the professional reviews I read miss this, which is the very point of the film. It is banned in Russia for a reason... The movie is criticized because the investigation is out of place. OF COURSE IT IS. The film-makers just used it as a ""cover-up"" so to say. It probably would have been too much on the screen, and they probably wouldn't have gotten the financial backing if they make a movie only showing the cruelties of the dictatorship.Good cast, the role suits Tom Hardy well, he puts in a great performance, and so does the rest of the cast.This movie is an exceptional view of the 1950 Russia, and it's a unique work because not many movies cover this subject. I reckon people tend to miss the point because they never experienced any of the soviet system, and that fact makes you see things very different.I recommend for everyone to see, because it really shows what life was like back then, unimaginable.

Disappointing! 4/10,"Review: I quite enjoyed this movie, mostly because of Tom Hardy's performance but it does take a long time to get going. It also dragged in parts and the investigation about the murdered children was weak and not that detailed. Anyway, it's about a highly ranked officer (Hardy) in Moscow who is demoted because he won't denounce his wife as a traitor. He then gets sent to a Volsk to join the Militsiya as a low ranked officer alongside general Mikhail Nesterov, played by Gary Oldman, while his wife, who used to be a elementary teacher, cleans in a school. Hardy struggles through a troubled relationship with his wife whilst trying to investigate these dead kids bodies that keep on turning up in random areas. His best friend lost his child to the serial killer so the case is close to his heart but none of the officers want to admit that there is a problem in Moscow so it's hard for him to get any help. He finally convinces Oldman that there is a serial killer on the loose so they get together enough information to track down the brutal killer. There wasn't much depth to the investigation and there wasn't an conclusion to his troubled marriage. He does give her a ultimatum to leave him but I don't know if she stayed with him out of love or the fact that her life was in danger because she was branded a traitor. Although the performances were brilliant from all of the cast, the movie seemed to drag and it seemed like it was going round in circles. There is a sense of intensity throughout the film because they are on the run from officers most of the time but there isn't that much action and I was left feeling empty when the movie had finished. I did like the chemistry between Oldman and Hardy but for a two hour movie, they seemed to crack the case with ease, even though they were the only two people investigating the murders. Judging by the box office takings, it didn't really go down with audiences that well but you can't fault Hardy's performance. Average!Round-Up: Tom Hardy, 37, has really made a name for himself since his role as Bronson in 2008 but he did star in some top films like Layer Cake,  Black Hawk Down, Star Trek: Nemesis and RocknRolla before that leading role. Since Bronson he has starred in the lead in big movies like Mad Max, which I heard was quite good, Inception, brilliant but bloody confusing, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Lawless, This Means War, Dark Knight Rises and Warrior so he has to be happy with his career so far. He first hit the screens in 2001 in the Band of Brothers series and his 30 movies to date have grossed over a billion dollars worldwide, which isn't bad going for a late bloomer. I personal think that he's going to be one to watch because he doesn't play safe by picking the easy roles and he has proved that he can take on any genre. This movie was directed by Swedish born Daniel Espinosa who also made Safe House with Denzel and Ryan Reynolds but thats about it. He also made an ""unheard of"" movie called Easy Money which starred Joel Kinnaman in the lead but that seemed to have slipped under the radar. Joel Kinnaman also played the villain officer in this movie so that explains why he was picked for that role. He really reminded me of Hayden Christensen for some unknown reason! Anyway, I did have high expectations for this movie because I am a Tom Hardy/Gary Oldman fan but I didn't find the movie that brilliant. Noomi Rapace was a good choice as Hardy's wife but she just had to put up and shut up through most of the movie so you don't get that much input from her. There are a couple of emotional scenes with the couple but there relationship was in turmoil right from the beginning. With all of these elements going on through the film, it should have been much better than it was but I just wasn't that impressed.Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $3.3million (Terrible!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/thrillers about an highly ranked officer in Moscow whose on the hunt for a serial killer who is brutal killing young kids. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,History
I guess I am the major exception,I am a big fan of Tom Hardy but truth be told I first became attracted to his style of acting and him as an actor while watching this film I think Noomi Rapace is a very talented actress and she made another movie with Tom Hardy that I am aware of and also saw but at the moment I can't think of the title I do know they work well together and the rest of the cast is phenomenal I think the staging is excellent One gets a very good feel of the drudgery of the Soviet union at the time I think the film itself is well done It actually is one of my favorites I know it's not a blockbuster as Mr. Hardy has made already more than once but acting as usual is terrific.

Wasted Potential,"The main problem with Child 44 is the narrative is split into two stories. On one hand, it's the serial killer mystery (the one the trailer promised) and the other is the Russian government hunting down Tom Hardy's character (the one the trailer kept hidden). The problem being the serial killer storyline is hardly established/relevant to the movie, and the other storyline gets too much attention. From what the trailer gives us about the movie, I expected a tense mystery thriller with a pretty frightening story (a killer running rampant in Russia).Instead, the movie skimps over this story by basically using it as a backdrop for the other story of Tom Hardy's accent vs Russia. And when we finally come to a close as to who and why the killer does what he does, it makes little to no sense and couldn't be more disappointing. And before you know it that plot point is over and we're back to Tom Hardy dodging the back MGB.And like I said, the serial killer mystery is second string while the government/spy story is the main force. And that's too bad because this story just isn't at all interesting, especially when you keep waiting for the other story to take over. To put it simply, there was just too much going on for the movie to make it thrilling. The movie is based on a book and like a lot of adaptations, the book didn't translate well to film.Do not go into this movie expecting it to be anything like the (pretty damn great) trailer, Child 44 is flat out too long and extremely short on thrills. There is almost no tension to speak of (certainly none involving the serial killer storyline). Maybe I went into the movie expecting something different and that could be my fault, but what was put on screen was nothing short of disappointing. It's unfortunate, but this type of story had so much potential and completely falls flat.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Feels long when it should feel short,"The idea of a thriller/murder mystery set in the 1950's Soviet Union, where to be accused is to be found guilty and the majority of the population live in state of constant paranoia, starring such acting powerhouses as Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, Gary Oldman, Paddy Considine and Jason Clarke, who have all starred in some damn fine movies over the past few years, would make one assume they were in for a guaranteed masterpiece. Based on Tom Rob Smith's 2008 novel, the first of a trilogy, Child 44 the film is overstuffed with disconnected sub- plots, mud-brown grimness, rushed storytelling. and a smorgasbord of thick Russian accents delivered by a mostly European from a variety of countries apart from Russia.Beginning in a war-town Ukraine where starvation has wiped out a bulk of the population, young Leo Demidov (Hardy) escapes an orphanage and into the arms of a sympathetic soldier, who adopts him and gives him a home. Years later, and Leo is a war hero, having his picture taken raising the flag of the U.S.S.R. over Berlin, and has a beautiful wife in Raisa (Rapace). While the country lives in fear, Leo and his comrades dine in fine restaurants. He is an obedient soldier, hunting down and capturing suspected traitor Anatoly (Clarke), but also shows restraint and empathy in his work, trying to convince Anatoly to confess to escape his inevitable torture and execution, and dressing down fellow soldier Vasili (Joel Kinnaman), a known coward from the war, when he executes a peasant couple in cold blood.Vasili, who rises through the ranks to become understudy to Major Kuzmin (Vincent Cassel), becomes Leo's nemesis. When Leo is called in to investigate a gang of citizens suspected of working against the state, Raisa is implicated, possibly by Vasili as a grudge against the man who humiliated him in the field. Leo must face a choice of giving up the woman he genuinely loves, or handing her over and maintaining his social position. Meanwhile, the child of one of Leo's friends is murdered, and may possibly be connected to other murders that have happened in the vicinity. But the higher-ups fails to acknowledge the murders, as serial killers can only be the product of capitalism, and there are no murders in paradise. Leo, refusing to hand his wife over, is sent to take a demeaning position in Volsk, operating under the command of General Nesterov (Oldman), where more bodies are found.Child 44 has all the ingredients for an intense whodunit and character study from a time and place rarely depicted by mainstream cinema. I haven't read Smith's book, but judging from the critical praise and awards lavished upon it, director Daniel Espinosa, best known for action fare Easy Money (2010) and Safe House (2012), seems to have only skimmed the back cover, forgetting to add anything resembling tension or believable character development. 2006's German masterpiece The Lives of Others created an overwhelming sense of fear and paranoia within its characters, but Espinosa seems to be more invested in rushing his way through the plot to get to an end that is in no way satisfying. The performances, despite being burdened with thick Russian accents (though the cast generally stay on the right side of those Compare the Meerkat adverts), are solid, although Oldman and Considine are wasted. At 137 minutes, the film feels long when it should feel short, and you get the idea that this may have worked better as a mini-series, where better care could have been taken to tell the story with the patience it deserved.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Enjoyably enjoyable,"Its hard not to like any film with Tom Hardy in it. He has this natural chemistry where he can be paired with anybody and make it work.A true master of the voice arts, Hardy delivers yet another stellar performance. I would say the suppprting cast was very underutilised if it wasn't Hardy in this film. The fact that there is so much talent from start to finish is nothing short of a gift to the viewer.Fitting that he should appear yet again, with whom i'd like to call his predecessor in the character arts, Gary Oldman. This guy is a legend. Anytime you get him Hardy & Oldman paired up, you know its going to be something special.The film itself delves deep into a surreal realism, giving us an unfiltered persepctive. An honest perspective.I'm mot sure what more could have been done to tell the story without compromising artistic integrity.This isn't some U. S. war film chock-filled with fiction and propaganda. So I can see why some people might not be able to appreciate just how great this film is.The only qualm I have personally was some of the shakey camera work during the fight scenes. If you suffer from certain things as I do, it can make watching scenes like that rather difficult. Hard to follow at times.Aside from that, a fantastic job all around. I have to imagine there was a minimalist approach to what they could and would use to keep things authentic.I can't foresee there being much to work with given the nature of the story, so I really have to applaud the prop and costume department.Entertainment Value 8/10
Overall Rating 7.5(8)/10I round up to an 8 because Tom Hardy always gives a 10/10 performance. The movie doesn't have many flaws. Some of the editing could have been handled a little better, but clocking in at just over 2 hours, 2:15.00 i think, they kept it just short/long enough.As I said, its hard to dislike.

A true waste of talent and potential,"So many things on paper point to Child 44 being quite the film. The book on which this film is based on by Tom Rob Smith is a hugely popular and well liked novel, we've got a cast here which led by the ever impressive Tom Hardy looks like a sure fire winner, director Daniel Espinosa has shown promise before with his early films Easy Money and Safe House and the material at the heart of this tale could be both thrilling and emotionally resonate. Upon pondering these elements, it makes it even more frustrating that Child 44 is such a downright mediocre film.I'm sure I'm not alone in saying openly that Child 44 was one of the films I was most looking forward to catching on cinema screens this year. The reuniting of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier ,Spy and Lawless co-stars Hardy and Gary Oldman, mixed with the white knuckle thrills of a serial killer whodunit in the colds of post war Russia, it seemed like a quality movie event but that fact that Child 44 never even screened on Australian cinema screens says all we need to know about how viewers felt about Espinosa's hodgepodge production.A large portion of Child 44's failings must be placed at the feet of Espinosa who seems unsure of how to utilise his cast, while Hardy is commanding despite a somewhat overplayed Russian accent, the rest of the films main players seem utterly wasted with particular mention of a barely registering Gary Oldman and the complete waste of supports like Paddy Considine and the blink and you'll miss it Jason Clarke. Espinosa clearly had trouble also with a narrative focus that shifts too often between the toils of Hardy's Leo and his troubled wife Raisa (played by Noomi Rapace who once more frustrates in an English language production) and the almost side playing's of brutal child murders that are engulfing the nations impoverished.It'd be easy to go on at length about how Child 44 fails to capitalise on juicy plot lines and interesting characters traits and arcs, but put simply, Child 44 seems reluctant to back itself in as either a drama, a thriller or a mystery and while there are glimpses of the films possibilities, a messy delivery disallows audience interest beyond mild curiosity.Easily one of 2015's most disappointingly average movies, Child 44 had all the makings of something special but never becomes anything more than a slightly more polished TV movie that is elevated by the on screen presence of Hardy and a few stand-alone scenes that seem cut from a much better overall product.2 homemade candy treats out of 5",4.0,Anonymous,History
Relentlessly grim,"""Child 44"" has a stellar cast and a classic premise: A tough, gritty cop on the hunt for a gruesome serial child killer. The twist is that the ""cop"" is a Stalin-era MGB agent, Leo (Tom Hardy). He's a former orphan who became a war hero, and now lives in a spacious apartment with his beautiful schoolteacher wife, Raisa (Noomi Rapace). The plot, based on an award-winning novel, is convoluted, but mainly hinges on Leo's growing interest in a mysterious string of deaths of young boys, and his dogged determination to crack the case as his privileged status in the Soviet hierarchy unravels. Yet the film is weighed down by too many side plots, and hits you over the head with endless examples of how horrible it was to live under the Stalin regime.""Child 44"" is a relentlessly grim movie, with heaps of gratuitous violence (even when it doesn't really advance the story). Many of the scenes are dimly lit, everything colored in browns and grays. Leo and Raisa have a strange, uneven relationship, and it's very hard to grasp her motivation for doing anything she does in this film, other than that she was living in a constant state of fear because she's in a totalitarian state. Her character makes no sense, even though she's in most of the scenes. A waste of a great actress like Rapace (the original ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"").The serial killer plot feels stale. ""Child 44"" seems less focused on the mystery solving and more on all the suspicion, backstabbing, blackmail, ratting out on your friends, police state brutality and bureaucratic oppression of the old USSR. I love Tom Hardy, and he does infuse his portrayal of Leo with pathos, longing, pain and gritty determination to do the right thing in a corrupt system. But this film's script and direction are just muddled.Kids, if you want to watch a far superior, engaging movie with a similar premise, opt for ""Gorky Park"" instead. Sorry! With some of my favorite actors in the cast, I wanted to like this more than I did.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent movie for students of history,"""Are you a spy?"" Leo asks Raisa.""No... it's just our turn.""That scene encapsulates the height of the Stalinist era purges, where close to a million people were persecuted, tortured, and killed in order to satisfy Stalin's paranoia.This movie is a thriller for anyone who has studied Soviet history and knows EXACTLY what is coming for Leo and Raisa when she is falsely accused of being a spy. As soon as that happened I was on edge for the rest of the movie because I know what happened to so-called ""spies"" in 1953 Moscow.Whether or not the two will survive to the end is the real tension in this story, and not because of a serial killer on the loose who the Party refuses to admit exists. The real threat is from corrupt Party officials who will stop at nothing to prevent their false accusations from being exposed.If you enjoy well-researched period pieces, you'll probably like this movie.

The script is precise and the main character has the gravitas, integrity and virtue that a viewer can admire in a hero.I thought this movie was a thousand times better than the ridiculous Dunkirk supposedly depicting war and madness.

After the his investigation ended without a result, the sacked officer gets a lifeline to begin again life in another town. But the trouble follows him when he started to investigate the children's deaths. The result of the case brings the end to the tale with a tiny small twist.The actors were decent, not very impressive. Especially I understand since it was internationally produced, they preferred English language, but I would have liked it in the original language to get best appeal. It was too long film, the first half was very boring. Because it was most unrelated to what comes in the later part of the film. When the narration shifts its base out of the Moscow, that's where it really gets very interesting. So after first 60 minutes, the real story begins.This where the actors got better. Noomi Rapace and Tom Hardy, both were like the kicked off with full of energy. So the second half of the film makes it watchable. Directed by a 'Easy Money' filmmaker who also brought in his Swedish actors to play the smaller roles. It was not good as I expected, but ended well. I don't think it is worth a watch, but who knows what you like. So I neither recommend nor reject it. But it was an average film to me.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
A compellingly deep and dark hunt for a serial child killer,"Take grim times, the Soviet regime, add in child killings, Party politics, corruption, brutality, betrayal and Nazi leftovers, stir well, add plentiful quality actors, a stupendously good script, superbly dark and atmospheric cinematography and you have a ridiculously good film, whose only failing is it's muddled up language - it could have been subtitled throughout or English throughout but not mixed up in places.The acting is superb, with a hat full of memorable lines, plot twists and turns, love, hate and deception heaped into each other. The story takes a while to fall into place but, by the end, it all makes perfect sense, a tribute to the way the film is allowed to unfold in real time.I am going to see it for a second time and I am hoping to look out for things I may have missed first time around. It really is a must see film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
READ THE BOOK,Way to turn a great book that would have made a great script into this zombified mess. Why did they have to change so much? It wouldn't have been hard to do a faithful adaptation of the novel. At all. What a waste.,4.0,Anonymous,History
haven't read the book,"This movie put me in mind of the books of Martin Cruz Smith like Gorky Park and its hero Arkady Renko. The unremitting cold and snow adds to the tense and stifling atmosphere.I have not read the book, which is the first of a trilogy so I can't comment on the hard facts or lack thereof, but I enjoyed this and thought Tom Hardy excelled as the rebellious Investigator flouting Soviet authority and endangering him and his family in so doing.I don't get the complaints about the ""Russian"" accents - what accents would the complainants have them use - American or British, Australian or good old South African English (the most neutral English accent)?A tense and atmospheric thriller.

Murder in Mordor,"A potentially fascinating subject (very loosely based on the case of serial killer Andrei Chikatilo during the eighties, but relocated during the fifties to make it even gloomier) founders in the usually welter of drab colour, wobbly steadicam photography, hushed dialogue in impenetrable 'Russian' accents and extreme overlength.The Russian authorities withdrew the film because of the grimy picture it painted of the workers' paradise during the fifties and the incredible idea that a serial killer could have operated with impunity at such a time; but the activities of the German serial killer Bruno Ludke during the Nazi era - also hushed up at the time for reasons of political expediency - had earlier also been the subject of their own film, 'Knachts, wenn der Teufel kam' in 1957.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Really really good.,"This is the movie that finally got me to sign up for an IMDb account so I could write a review, after several years using the app on a regular basis. Child 44 is excellent, top notch acting by superb actors, great writing and directing. It seemed a little slow off the start, but it's such a great story, with such deep and dynamic relationships (especially between the two main characters) that I got more and more involved as it went on. I cannot say enough about Tom Hardy, he's a brilliant actor, rivaling all the current big Hollywood names. Several viewers commented on the truth and historical accuracy of the film, someone even called it propaganda. That's simply ridiculous, the movie was based on a book. The book came from a brilliant author's creative mind.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Read the book, ignore the movie","The beginning and end of the book have been completely removed, which took out the twist and the emotional punch.Honestly, every single bit that stayed with me from the novel they took out, and instead turned it into a really basic police hunt bad guy movie.There are so many nuances which have been lost. So many characters are thin, backstories removed or changed. It really is an appalling piece of script writing.The only saving graces are the excellent cast, Tom Hardy in particular.Do yourself a favour and read the book and don't bother with the movie. It's far more interesting and gives a bit of a history lesson too.",4.0,Anonymous,History

An Unfortunate Departure from the Literary Canvas,"Adapting a literary work to the big screen is a formidable undertaking, requiring a deft hand to distill the essence of the narrative while accommodating the constraints of a different medium. Regrettably, Child 44 falters in this delicate balance, resulting in a film that disappointingly dilutes the potency of its source material and mismanages its stellar cast.Based on Tom Rob Smith's gripping novel, Child 44 had all the ingredients for success: a chilling tale set against the backdrop of Stalinist Russia, a protagonist grappling with moral dilemmas, and a serial killer on the loose. Yet, what transpires on the screen is a watered-down version of the novel, a mere shadow of the intrigue and complexity that once pulsed through its pages.One of the most glaring missteps lies in the omission of pivotal details that lent the novel its intricate depth. The backdrop of Soviet oppression and paranoia, so vividly portrayed in the book, is reduced to a mere backdrop, a missed opportunity to explore the psychological labyrinth of living under the iron fist of Stalin's regime. The characters' inner conflicts, so richly textured in the novel, are reduced to mere outlines, leaving audiences with a frustrating sense of incompleteness.The film's powerhouse cast, which includes Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace and Gary Oldman, offers promise that is tragically underutilized. Hardy's Leo Demidov, while hinting at the internal turmoil that defines the character, never quite breaks free from the constraints of the script, leaving his performance rather underwhelming. The chemistry between characters, so crucial in the novel's resonance, fails to flourish on screen due to the film's lackluster execution.The narrative itself is a jumble of half-explored threads and a whodunit plot that struggles to engage. The suspense that should have propelled the story forward is hampered by the film's inability to maintain a consistent tone. As it stumbles between political thriller, murder mystery, and psychological drama, Child 44 loses its grip on the audience's attention.While adaptations inherently necessitate pruning and modification, Child 44 strays from adaptation to mutation, forgoing the intricacies that made the novel a gripping exploration of history, psychology, and crime. The film's shift toward a conventional thriller compromises the intellectual and emotional weight that once defined the narrative.In a world where films have the power to breathe life into beloved books, Child 44 serves as a cautionary tale that that translating the complexities of literature to the silver screen requires a delicate touch and a commitment to capturing the essence that made the source material unforgettable. Sadly, Child 44 is a mere whisper of what it could have been-an opportunity lost in a sea of missed potential.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Sure its a bit slow at the start but....,"The intensity of this movie is really gripping - first it sets the scene really well in post WW2 Russia - then it evolves into a murder mystery story. It does both really well and its helped by an incredible cast including Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman & the awesome Joel Kinnaman playing a cretinous bad guy. This film is very involving and it does well to set out the ""feel"" of what Russia must have been like then.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Somehow nothing really fits,"I don't know why a lot of things in this film don't fit together. A mass murder story against the background of Stalinist terror remains a mass murder story at first. The motives of the perpetrator are quickly dealt with, mainly it is about Tom Hardy's character, who lives in permanent danger of being killed by government powers, although he is actually part of them. This conflict could be dealt with more strongly, because with Hardy an outstanding actor is at work here who can get the last word out of his characters. Director Espinosa has chosen to portray him as a reserved and sensitive man, who, however, blows his fuses in crucial situations. Noomi Rapace as his wife is the reliable performer as we know her. She has some remarkable overtones, but tends not to vary her roles strongly enough. And Gary Oldman doesn't have a shine for me anymore. His characters are now highly predictable and bore me. The overall result of this film is ambivalent for me, as I find the narrative style too slow at times, the duration too long and also the characters not well enough developed.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Way better than expected,"This film was an absolute surprise, a hidden gem. I wanted it to be good but it was way better than expected. If you like films that are about war and/ or the decades 1940/ 1950 this film is for you. At first it has a very catchy plot. A Russian who was considered a war hero is now sent away as he's considered a traitor trying to investigate a case where more than 40 little boys are killed. There are very well characters developments and you can easily identify yourself to them. Plus, Tom Hardy's performance made the whole project even better. He even changed his accent, he was just extraordinary. I loved the end. I don't have anything else to mention. It's a 9/10, I surely recommend it!",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Good story, shoddy accents","Don't waste your time on this, none of the actors or actresses were able to represent 10% of real Russian/Soviet accent. It was a shoddy and lame attempt by the entire cast which kept reminding me how stupid this movie became. It's a shame because if they used some real Russian actors, it would have been a decent plot but no, heavy & fake accents was the way to go by the director. At various points of the movie you can hear the accent drop off between sentences to be replaced with the native American accent. To top it all off, none of them even looked like Russians from the soviet eras besides the 2 hunks that were sent into the carriage to shank them.I love Tom hardy, but sorry, he's much better with the English accent in the movie Legend",4.0,Anonymous,History

soviet Russia,"In the year 2012 I lived and worked in Siberia, Russia. Living conditions are hard today, although more acceptable then before the 1988 Perestroika. But still is not possible to travel freely today without permission between Oblasti. You should report to the police the place of your short time accommodation if you are out of your residence. I see the situation in Soviet times did not allow the development of a story showed in the movie. The man - Leo acts like a freelancer. If doing so, he would be dead more times during the story. Too much humanity, that is still absent in the people there. In general, the story by Tom Rob Smith describes the soviet living like as if it had seen from outside. He comes with a tale, no story.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Should have been better,"Based on the acclaimed novel by British writer Tom Rob Smith, this is a thriller about the tracking down of a serial killer of young children, but what gives it a special atmosphere is that it is set in Stalin's Soviet Union (actually just before the dictator dies).Shot largely in Prague, the film certainly manages to convey both the drabness and the terror of living at this Kafkaesque time and the work boasts an impressive cast list, including Tom Hardy as MGB investigator Leo Demidov, Noomi Rapace as his wife Raisa whom he is told to denounce, and Gary Oldman as General Nesterov in the provincial town to which Leo and Raisa are exiled.Unfortunately the treatment is clunky and the accents distracting in what should have been a better transposition of the book.",,Anonymous,History
Child 44 - Suffers Lack Of Care,"A story with promise and an interesting setting (serial child murders in Russia during WWII and beyond) is left labouring due to overbearing treatment. It suffers throughout from cinematography featuring clumsy hand-held cameras and zoom lenses set too close to the subjects - giving a suffocated and incomplete feel to the narrative. The entire treatment is dark and grotty and while this can sometimes be an atmospheric plus, here it's so unrelenting it becomes tiresome. Overly convoluted 'style' and heavy violence tend to be used as substitutes for quality story elements - this could leave some viewers unsatisfied - forced dialects are also off-putting and quickly become annoying. Fans of the stars Tom Hardy & Gary Oldman (the latter's role surfacing in the last half only!) may survive to the finish while others might give up way before the lengthy 2h 17m is halfway through.",,Anonymous,History

Tom Hardy is set to star in a new film about Ernest Shackleton, the polar explorer famous for his remarkable escape from the Antarctic continent with all his crew despite losing his ship when it was crushed by ice. He is noteworthy because of his unforgettable performance's in each of his films.",,Anonymous,History
