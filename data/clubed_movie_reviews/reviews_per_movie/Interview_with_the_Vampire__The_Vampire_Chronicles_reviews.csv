One of the best vampire movies I've ever seen,"Based on the Anne Rice's novel and with a screenplay adapted by herself, this film tells the story of Lestat and Louis, two vampires with over three hundred years. Directed by Neil Jordan, has the participation of Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and Kirsten Dunst (as a child). It received two nominations for the Oscar (Best Art Direction, Best Original Score).This is the film adaptation of one of the greatest horror novels of this American author, and is even more appealing when we realize that she actively collaborated with the production, signing the adaptation of the script. Indeed, it's a great script, faithful to the novel and original story. And for me, this movie has another good note: fully escaping the recent ""sex symbol vampire"" clich√©, fueled by movies like ""Twilight"", this film depicts vampires as they really should be: monsters with some psychological depth.The actors are excellent in their roles. The highlight goes obviously to Pitt and Cruise, who were not only perfectly able to give charisma to the characters but also not ignore the importance of the psychological characteristics. Pitt took it to the extreme in his character, torn between the love of his own humanity and the overwhelming desire for blood he feels. The way both actors share the scene is irresistible, such as how Cruise transforms his character in ""evil genius"" of his friend.The film contains several very intense scenes with moments that can hurt some sensibilities. Nevertheless, its not a very bloody movie. The atmosphere is dark, sinister, something largely enhanced by the cinematography, dark and misty, and the soundtrack, worthy of a good horror movie (something that this film is definitely not). The special, visual and sound effects are good, such as the characterization and makeup. The costumes are exceptional, portraying accurately the clothes of the several historical periods portrayed throughout the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tom Cruise IS Lestat,"I, like Anne Rice, was initially dismayed that Tom Cruise had been cast as Lestat. But when I saw the film, I had to admit that he absolutely nailed the role. I had always thought of Cruise as a pretty boy, and not really a serious actor, especially since he failed in his attempt at a Streepian accent in ""Far and Away"". However, he perfectly portrayed Lestat for what he is, a monster with a monstrous ego.  I think that this was the first film I had seen with Brad Pitt, followed shortly by ""Legends of the Fall"" so to me his acting credentials were impeccable, in spite of my female friends swooning over him. The rest of the cast was excellent as well, with the only minor quibble that Antonio Banderas was too old for the part of Armand. Kirsten Dunst was adorably evil. The cinematography was beautiful, considering that almost all of the film (of course) takes place at night.  One note on the supposed ""homo-eroticism"" in the film. I have the advantage, having read Rice's books, so here is the deal on that. In Rice's world, the vampires are absolutely sexless. Therefore, gender has no meaning to them. When a vampire loves another, or a mortal, it is truly from the heart, as no sexuality of any kind ever enters into it. The only thing to them that is close, is the kill. Killing is highly ""erotic"" to vampires. However, this too is really asexual, and so again, gender has no bearing on the eroticism of the kill. I think that some elements of this, which apparently came across as homo-eroticism, were included in the screenplay just to emphasize how different, how non-human, that vampires are.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A lavish, deep film.","Interview with the Vampire is such an unusual horror movie, it stands up incredibly well many years later, it's lavish, decadent and sumptuous. The filming and direction are wonderful, it never fails to impress.It's a very different style of horror, it has softer tones, and yet it's blood thirsty when needed. The story telling itself is one of the film's major strengths, it's a captivating watch, splitting vampire lust and cravings against a very human element.Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are both fantastic, I'd argue it's one of Cruise's best performances, the whole supporting cast are great.I've watched it many times, I've never once lost interest in it. It's a great watch. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Deep-thinking vampire searches for meaning in eternal life,"'Interview with the Vampire' is an atmospheric, highly gripping ""film involving vampires"" - not a ""vampire movie"". Whilst the latter would describe a film that focuses on its vampirism and might be judged on the sharpness of its fangs, this ""film involving vampires"" has all the merits of the very best cinema, and at its core is nothing but a fantastic story carried by compelling, believable characters.For those who may not be able to overlook the vampiric content, look again. The vampirism herein is a plot device, a way of presenting characters who cannot die or age or be harmed, so that the philosophical questions of life itself can be explored. But equally, for those who will be interested in the vampiric content, this film presents a rich mythology backed by a trilogy of books, which fleshes out the concept of the vampire in a much deeper way than any other production.Every person has their own world view, their own way of living and thinking. People can be brooding, contemplative, cautious, reasonable, carefree, hedonistic, optimistic, emotional - and every shade in between. But these are all world-views based on the knowledge that life is short. What would happen if told their lives would never end? Who would be happiest? What would they do? How would eternal life affect each person? And most importantly, if a way of living was bringing meaning to a person's life, would that still work once life was infinite? All of these questions help us explore philosophical ideas as old as time, and that exploration is the focus of this film.The story is propelled by vampires Louis (Pitt) and Lestat (Cruise), each representing a different take on life. Whilst Louis, who began as a depressive wanting to die, thinks of eternity as an extended curse; Lestat, who seems to live every second as it comes, barely even considers the future three minutes hence. Told from Louis' viewpoint as he struggles to find some meaning in a life he knows will never end, we are taken on a ride across the centuries, as Louis' outlook and happiness undulate whilst characters and relationships come and go.Alongside Louis' turmoil in coming to terms with his (now eternal) life, a secondary theme is explored, which is the notion of survival. Even though Louis is clearly dissatisfied with life, he never attempts to end it, despite this option being open to him. In other words, surviving, in and of itself, was a motivation that outdid any other. Most importantly, survival outdoes Louis' trouble over the fact that his only source of nourishment is now the blood of living animals, preferably humans. Despite attempting abstinence, and then attempting to drink only the blood of rodents, this basic feeding instinct proves too much for Louis. And yet, as Lestat points out, what is the problem? The fittest always survives, and whoever is lower down the food-chain will be eaten. Humans eat animals, and vampires eat humans - it's all natural. But nonetheless, are there moral limits? Even if you have to kill a human, is there a more moral way to do it? ""Monstrous,"" Louis exclaims, as he watches a group of vampires murder a defenceless girl. Yet might survival require the forgetting of moral consciousness, like Lestat?'Interview with the Vampire' explores all of these deep, important issues whilst delivering an incredibly powerful story populated by charismatic characters, haunting and diverse settings and immortal dialogue. Gripping from start to finish, you will be enamoured at the vampire-world opened up to you; and by the end, you are left wondering what choice you would have made, given the one that Lestat never had...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Obviously misunderstood,"Someone said that this movie was too cerebral for horror fans who live for drivel like ""From Dusk 'Till Dawn"", and too much of a horror movie for people who look (or at least pretend to look) for meaning in movies -- pseudo-intellectuals. That person couldn't have been more correct. I'm not a horror fan, I'm not an Anne Rice fan...I'm not even fond of Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and Antonio Banderas. But Interview With a Vampire was a movie that excelled my expectations.I refused to see this film for 3 years because I believed it would be what I perceived it to be: glitzy Hollywood garbage geared toward adolescent girls with posters of the 3 main actors all over their walls. I finally broke down and rented it, and I was astonished by the incredible performances delivered, the thrilling dialogue and the way it was delivered by the actors, the scenery, the plot, the score...everything. I never thought that Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise could act, but their performances made their unbelievable characters a reality. However, the true star of the film was Kirsten Dunst. At 12 years old, this girl was able to hold her own against her co-stars, and often stole the scene (particularly the incident in which Claudia tries to cut her hair and subsequently Lestat discovers the corpse in her bed.)You don't want to look for the meaning of life in this movie. It's a story. The plot is basically the history of a vampire's life, and I don't understand why people are compelled to trash a movie because of its simplicity. Look at the title. That's all it is, and if you expect more you're setting yourself up for disappointment. It's not the deepest of movies, that's why it should be enjoyed for the intense dialogue and the great production that went into it. Others trash the movie because of its homoerotic undertones. This aspect is so fleeting that it's ridiculous to dwell on it, and if you dwell on such an insignificant aspect of the movie then you were obviously looking for something to bother you. One additional thing: to even suggest that the violence in this film could be responsible for incidents such as the Columbine High School killings is beyond moronic.This isn't the greatest movie that has ever been made, it's certainly not a complex analysis of life, or a parable with a moral dictating the enjoyment of life. It's a brilliantly produced gothic tale of a vampire, nothing more and nothing less. In respect to the book, I've never read it and I don't particularly care to read it. But for all of you who have been complaining about the movie not living up to the novel, here's a clue that might prove useful in the future: the book is ALWAYS better than the film. Don't waste your time complaining about something that is understood.",,Anonymous,Horror
"highly underrated, often over-looked","When you ask someone to name the best movies to come out of the early-mid 90's, not many people would mention this movie. That's too bad.It isn't American Beauty deep, but the film presents real human emotions through the surreal notion of vampires. Cinematography, set design, and score are top notch. It doesn't look dated at all, particularly in this day in age of CG, blue screen galore.The acting....i hate to admit, because i'm not by any means a brad pitt or tom cruise fan....is pretty darn good. This was the first film I saw tom cruise in and thought (gee...the pretty boy can act), the other coming to mind being Magnolia. Brad Pitt isn't as great, but holds his own and it's a quiet, somber Brad Pitt, which is a good change to the normally twitchy, over-the- top characters he portrays (fight club, 12 monkeys, ocean's 11....even se7en to a certain extent). and of course.....kirsten dunst....who's best role in her career is this film.I haven't read the book, so i am writing purely on the film. Apparent by the other reviews here, there are people who really like this movie. It's a shame that more people haven't given this movie a chance.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ornate, lushly filmed horror, with erotic overtones","Now that some time has passed, Neil Jordon's beautiful work can be watched without obsessing so much over the stars who were involved. 'Interview' is an extravagant assault on the senses, filled with beauty, erotic and graphic violence, and wonderful, at times poetic dialog. To be sure, this is a Hollywood production, but with director Neil Jordon in charge, the film possesses that special ""arthouse"" film look, with many scenes being too strange and dark to come across as typical Hollywood. Pitt is fine as Louis, the centuries-old vampire who recounts his sad and fascinating history to a nameless ""interviewer"", played a bit too light by Christian Slater. If you dislike Tom Cruise and his films, as i do, you should not let his participation in the film dissuade you from seeing this; As the sinister Lestat, Cruise is barely recognizable, and gives here, what might be his finest performance. Obviously due to the subject matter, 'Interview' is a relentlessly dark film. There are a few short scenes of daylight in the beginning, until Louis is transformed. Then begins his life of eternal darkness. When I saw this in the theater, the effect of sitting in a darkened room watching a film that takes place entirely at night, really felt strange. Coming out of the theater I felt as though I had been away from the real world for a long time. Jordon's aesthetic vision, supported for once by the huge Hollywood budget, insured that ""Interview"" looks gorgeous. The plantation that is Louis' first home, and then the Paris apartment are filled with exquisite antiques, ornate furnishings, gold framed mirrors, lace and velvet four-poster beds, etc, transporting the viewer into the 18th and 19th centuries, and lends an extra level of decadence to the lifestyle of these vampires. The costumes as well are breath-taking, and accurate to the time. The finest thing about this production though, is the beautiful, doll-like Claudia, the child-vampire, played by Kirsten Dunst. It is always terrifying and strange when a child is cast in such an evil role. Claudia's thirst for blood exceeds that of Lestat himself, and her total lack of remorse for the people she kills is the most haunting and disturbing thing about this. The approach to her character was very un-Hollywood, thankfully. Anne Rice's book evokes feelings of loneliness and a profound sadness, and those feelings translate well into Jordans film. ""Interview With the Vampire"" is a very special, and at times superb cinematic delight, that was not ruined by it's over-exposed stars and commercialism. And those that love Gothic horror and period films should see this, and ignore it's Hollywood origins.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Vampire essence,"I have a passion for films with dark settings. What's even better is when the film is not only dark and dismal but also deep and engrossing. With a combination of Anne Rice's script and Neil Jordan's direction, the overlooked Interview with the Vampire not only looks great but contains good material. Most of the time when a film is based on a novel it will try to capture the themes of the novel by choosing areas to work from. Luckily Anne Rice also writes the screenplay and understands more than anyone else what areas need addressing, providing the backbone to the dialogue and plot.Set in 1791 Orleans and progressing through different periods of time, IWTV is technically excellent and aware of its surroundings. From the first moment your eyes are fixed on the screen. This is the sign of great art direction coupled with costume design and set pieces that are more than pleasing on the eye. Far from in your face the film allows a taste of each period with a mixture of light and colourful scenes to the more prominent dreary settings it encompasses. Moonlit streets, abandoned plague ridden residential and underground gothic architectures all add to the great detail that has been taken in creating a believable and picturesque look to the films periods it contains. Helped also by a musical score that really lurks in the background, depicts the time and in some areas the feeling aptly.The story, told with a mixture of narration from the protagonist (Brad Pitt in this case) and a screenplay with enough room for all the stars makes a tight little package. At just over 2 hours long though, this may put off the viewer looking for an all out action vampire piece or those with little patience. Interview after all is a drama at heart with horror elements but what sets it apart from others is the humane way in which it's dealt with. A point in the film that leans on stereotypical vampire views sets the tone of the film perfectly, fiction aside Vampires aren't so unlike humans which is portrayed through the emotions (or rejection of them) throughout. One of the key players in such a task is surprisingly Tom Cruise as the bad influence Lestat. In one of his more challenging roles, Cruise conveys a charm that fits the theatricals of his character perfectly. Through excellent makeup and clothes from a period he refuses to break free from, Cruise is less distinguishable but all the more better for losing the usual side of him that may have been too familiar. Left only with a look of ferocity and impertinence Cruise works his role to a brilliant combination that really brings out the character of Lestat making him extremely fun to watch. Lestat's mood swings and cruel insinuations really spark the film up, stealing every scene he's in.What makes the film interesting is how every character has a background and each character has different things that make them tick. Along for the ride with Cruise and Pitt is a very young Kirsten Dunst as the disillusioned vampire child Claudia. It seems that Jordan is a good director for getting performances as Dunst gives a fine performance at such a young age, definitely showing more promise than the usual teenage focal points she has set herself on since. While Lestat is the most enjoyable character and practically the teacher, Louis and Claudia are the key elements to a story of self-discovery concerning the dark world they have joined. Other than this Christian Slater and Antonio Banderas share little screen time but enough to make their characters wholesome enough.One area that I applaud but others may disclude is the vivid scenes of a gory nature used profusely throughout. Jordan, going for realism and with blood being an important part of vampire life includes graphic details.. and with no holds barred. Jordans realistic touches add only to the plausibility of the vampire way of life, emphasising the grotesque way of living they are lumbered with for eternity. Such a eternal damnation is one of the main themes of the film exploring the depreciation of Louis and Claudia and how they come to terms with their new life. It would seem that such a serious tone to a fictional tale would make it hard to enjoy but with a mixture of dark humour throughout the film knows not to take itself 'too' seriously. The end clearly establishes this fact nicely.Minor quibbles aside like some hokey dialogue from time to time and despite Pitt underplaying his performance a little, among the Vampire genre and even as a drama this is a classy piece of work from a intelligent director with a flair for dark style (in most of his other films too), and more importantly produces a epic tale with sturdy direction. If you have the interest for a drama, specifically based around vampires there is little other choice than this. Through its fine performances and stunning look one things for sure, you wont forget this one easily.7.5 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still one of my favorite vampire movies!,"'Interview with the Vampire' is exactly as the title indicates. A reporter interviews a vampire, Louis, and we learn about his life and loves through his retellings. Brad Pitt stars as Louis, a man who tragically lost his family and in the process lost his desire to live. Antagonist vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) came to his rescue. Or did he? Did het not condemn him to eternal misery instead of saving him?Indeed so. We see Louis battling coming to terms with his new life - that as a vampire. Although Louis and Lestat are now both vampires, they couldn't be more different, and I found this an interesting approach to the age old vampire traditions and traits. I once read writer Anne Rice was upset upon learning Cruise was cast as Lestat, being ""the wrong person for the role."" However, Cruise is so fantastic as Lestat that she personally apologized to him afterwards. Tom Cruise truly is incredible in this film. For someone who was supposedly one of the most unlikely candidates for the role, Cruise seems all too perfect!'Interview with the Vampire' is a stylish film with great costumes and cinematography, with beautiful settings and production design. The make-up is also excellent. There are a lot of very disturbing images, though, and a lot of blood sucking scenes - many of which are gross. Due to the graphic nature of the film it certainly is not recommended for everyone, and most definitely not for kids. You're going to have to choose your audience well with this film.'Interview with the Vampire' is still one of my favorite vampire movies, providing loads of thrills, chills, action and adventure. I love it!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Romantic, melancholy and beautiful - a vampire epic for the new millennium","INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE: THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLESAspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / SDDS17th century New Orleans: The relationship between an ancient vampire (Tom Cruise) and his bloodsucking proteg√© (Brad Pitt) is tested to destruction by a young girl (Kirsten Dunst) who challenges their established dynamic, leading to betrayal and murder.A doom-laden meditation on life and death and the nature of grief, based on Anne Rice's bestselling novel (written as a response to the death of her beloved daughter), and featuring two of contemporary Hollywood's most recognizable stars (both astonishingly beautiful here) as vampire and willing victim, remaining eternally young as the world evolves around them. Cruise plays a seasoned killer who revels in bloodthirsty excess, while Pitt is a conscientious objector who balks at the prospect of drinking human blood, until Cruise creates a 'companion' for Pitt in the shape of a little girl (Dunst) who refuses to grow old gracefully, with tragic consequences.Scored with melancholy grace by composer Elliot Goldenthal, and beautifully designed and photographed (by Dante Ferretti and Philippe Rousselot, respectively), the film is epic in concept and execution, spanning the social upheavals of 17th and 18th century America and the horrors of 19th century Europe, where a nest of ancient vampires (led by scene-stealer Antonio Banderas and a miscast Stephen Rea) wreak terrible revenge on those who transgress against vampire lore. But, for all its spectacle, director Neil Jordan (THE COMPANY OF WOLVES) - working from a script credited to Rice herself - maintains a leisurely pace and never loses sight of the characters. The movie contains some beautiful, transcendent passages, including a breathtaking transition from 19th century Europe to modern day America via the introduction of motion pictures (everything from SUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS to GONE WITH THE WIND and SUPERMAN!), and an incredibly moving sequence in which a once-proud vampire is discovered in exile, laid low by his own vanity.The film's delicate tone is upset by a trick ending which comes completely out of left-field, though Jordan has denied any suggestion of studio interference. And, as with the novel, the homoerotic undercurrent is mere window-dressing, an unconsummated tease which the filmmakers (and Rice herself) refuse to explore in any detail, lest it frighten the mainstream crowd. Sadly, the movie is dedicated to the memory of River Phoenix - originally cast as the interviewer who provides one half of the film's title - who died of a drugs overdose during pre-production; his role was taken by Christian Slater. Followed by QUEEN OF THE DAMNED (2002).",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
needs something to drive the plot better,"In present day San Francisco, reporter Daniel Molloy (Christian Slater) interviews Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt) who claims to be a vampire. Back in 1791 south of New Orleans, he was a 24 year old owner of a plantation. He is in grief over his wife's death in childbirth. He wants to die and Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise) answers his wish. Yvette (Thandie Newton) is Louis' favorite slave whose killing is the final act before he sets the plantation on fire. Louis refuses human blood until he finds young Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) living besides her dead mother. After Louis has a taste, Lestat converts her to a vampire.Were we ever so easily swayed by the simple promise of sexy vampires? Apparently we were. Of course, there is more to this than the two sex symbols of the time; Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Director Neil Jordan is able to bring Anne Rice's Gothic sense to the big screen. It is beautifully shot and expertly crafted. However it doesn't drive. At least, the plot isn't very hard driving. This is a ponderous affair. The movie already shows that Louis exists at the end so he doesn't have the tension of danger. The story plods along but it does so beautifully. It's also quite a nice introduction to Kirsten Dunst.

"Dunst Shines, But Cruise Steals The Show","Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to Interview With The Vampire (1994)Plot In A Paragraph: Louis (Brad Pitt) a vampire tells his epic life story: love, betrayal, loneliness, and hunger.At the time of release, this was not like any other vampire movie I had seen. In movies like Lost Boys and various others, being a vampire is portrayed as almost fun. This movie goes into what a curse immortality is, in a similar way Highlander did, admits all the decapitations.Cruise does not play the main role in this one, but he does something all great actors can do. Play the best part in the movie and steal every scene. The best role in a movie, does not need to be the lead role. It just needs to be the most memorable, and Cruise dominates proceedings and truthfully the movie is duller when he is not on screen. Which sadly is almost all the last half of the movie.Brad Pitt is not an actor I really care for. There are exceptions, but generally he bores me. This is one such example. I must point out Kirsten Dunst,who was rightly nominated for an Oscar. Her performance is superb. If it was not for Cruise she would have stole the movie. Antonio Banderas is OK, whilst Cristian Slater doesn't really have much to do. I never realised Cruises future MI2 co star Thandie Newton was in this. I enjoy the use of Guns N Roses cover of Sympathy For The Devil over the end credits too. I actually let the credits run.I wonder why there was never a sequel, it's certainly open for one, and the potential is there. Maybe it wasn't a big enough hit.

Swooping In.,"A man (Brad Pitt) who turned into a vampire way back in 18th century New Orleans tells his life (and afterlife) story to a skeptical modern-day journalist (Christian Slater) in novelist Anne Rice's unique take on the famed supernatural creatures of the night. Pitt goes into major details on how he became a vampire (thanks to vampire loon Tom Cruise in a wickedly wild over-the-top turn) and his run-ins with others like him (a very young Kirsten Dunst and a then-unknown Antonio Banderas). Opulently realized schizophrenic exercise that has a little bit of something for most audiences. Pitt is focused, Cruise is unbound and Dunst arguably does the work of her life. Director Neil Jordan (who is best known for films of similar style like ""The Crying Game"") knows exactly which buttons to push and when to push them. While flawed in many areas, ""Interview With the Vampire"" is still nevertheless a fun and entertaining venture that definitely has blood, teeth and wings. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Horror

Has stood the test of time. bloody good movie,"My Review -
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)
My Rating 9/10What a delight to revisit a movie decades after its original release and to
re discover performances like an 11 year old Kirsten Dunst who is superb as Claudia the young girl who is granted eternal life as a Vampire that will never age by Vampires Lestat De Lioncourt played by Tom Cruise who certainly delivers a devilish performance and Louis De Pointe Du Lac played by Brad Pitt in one of his finest roles ever in my view .Claudia in retrospect is one of the most interesting characters in the film from the time she is discovered mourning her dead mother by the Vampire Louis to her eventual demise later in the film.I don't recall Kirsten Dunst getting the same recognition for her excellent performance that Jodie Forster received for her role as Iris in Taxi Driver 1976 or that Brooke Shields received for her role as Violet in Pretty Baby 1978.I think Kirsten Dunst is wonderful in this film and it's easy to see how this role was a precursor to her fame today in films like The Power of the Dog and Melancholia .The late Great film critic Roger Ebert described Kirsten Dunst's performance as a deeply eerie one and described her role at the time as being ""one of the creepiest aspects of the story.""
This aspect of the story involving the relationship of a pre pubescent girl and an older male if todays moral compass is applied would probably be dropped from the story today and that's exactly what happened in 2023, more on that in my review of Interview with the Vampire TV Series .It was also interesting to go back 3 decades to watch 3 early pivotal performances from 3 actors who have all also gone on to impressive movie careers .Brad Pitt who plays Louis dePointe du Lac the Vampire being interviewed was 31 years old at the time of filming and I think gives a finely nuanced performance as he recalls his life from 1791 as a New Orleans plantation owner who mourns the life of his wife and child hoping for death himself until he meets LeStat De Lioncourt the Vampire . LeStat feeds on him and rather than leave him die as he wishes by mixing his blood with the young grieving plantation owner restores him to the eternal but problematical life of a Vampire.The role of LeStat is played with great style and panache by Tom Cruise who was 32 years old at the time of the films release.Antonio Banderas who plays Armand has a vital supporting role as the Vampire Leader Louis meets in Paris . Louis accompanied by the still child like Claudia escapes to Europe from LeStat to begin their search for others of their kind.Usually I like some humour in horror movies but this is a serious drama and looks exquisite even on the small screen the film score by Elliot Goldenthal was deservedly nominated for an Oscar but lost to Hans Zimmer for The Lion King.The film also missed out on its second nomination for Art Direction by Dante Ferretti and Set Decoration by Francesca Lo Schiavo they lost to THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE with Art Direction by Ken Adam and Set Decoration by Carolyn Scott.It's hard to fathom why Neil Jordan the Director missed out on a nomination as the quality of the look and performances in Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles has the same stamp of quality that his superb film The Crying Game had in 1992 in which he did win an Oscar in 1993 for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.I recommend anyone interested in that period of Cinema towards the end of the 20th Century and there are many many great movies of that era rewatch or watch for the first time Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles it's a bloody good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Redefined Vampire,"For better or worse Anne Rice has redefined what a vampire is in movies and literature. Before there was the Twilight saga there was Anne writing her novels and seeing Interview With A Vampire we see that vampire now means Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. No longer is it Bela Lugosi with his continental suaveness and Hungarian accent.But Cruise and Pitt are just as deadly, maybe more so. The film is exactly what it says. Journalist Christian Slater has tracked down Brad Pitt whom he interviews. Pitt tells him about his afterlife as a vampire dating from colonial New Orleans with a few highlights in New Orleans and Paris where he settled in the Third Republic years. There's also young Kirsten Dunst who masters a most difficult role as a child vampire. She's matured, but rather strangely.The homoeroticism sticks out all over this film especially with Cruise and Pitt when Cruise takes that bite and initiates him into the vampire existence. What beautiful children they would make it if it were possible.People who loved the Twilight Saga and other recent vampire films, this is what really starts it.

Best Looking Vampire Cast Ever,"Neil Jordan's interpretation of Anne Rice's initial novel, Interview With the Vampire, the first of the Vampire Chronicles stories is noted for having the most beautiful lineup of males with fangs. Casting Brad Pitt as Louis, Antonio Bandaras as Armand, and over the top as always, Tom Cruise as Lestat, this group of male beauties is the deadly trio who toy with the child-vampire, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) to her ultimate demise.An uneasy novel when it was first released in the mid-70s, the translation to film was almost a generation in development before reaching the public. First choice for casting of Lestat as Anne Rice noted was Rutger Hauer and later, Sting, however, by the time the film hit the screen, both actors were too old and the part went to Cruise, much to Rice's initial disapproval. However, as Cruise grew into his fangs and no doubt, on Rice, she changed her mind about the actor. His Lestat is outrageous if only as a foil for Pitts bottled up Louis, the reluctant member of the trio. While Lestat and Claudia enjoy the human hunt for victims to sustain their lives, Louis is never comfortable nor as delighted with his fate as a hunter of blood. His torment after 2 hours is to shout, ""Enough, get over yourself, Louis.""While a fan of vampire film and of male eye candy, Interview with the Vampire is never in the same league with the novel and can not be compared with the moody and sexually overt, Frank Langella performance as Dracula (1979). This is another kind of vampire story, an oral history of sorts with Pitt in a one-man monologue. Costumes and sets are appropriate, but, in total, the film is flat despite the attention to details, if fails to satisfy, perhaps because the overload of testosterone on screen never has sufficient acting chops to pull off the fantasy and romanticism of the lore of the undead.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Merciful death is bittersweet.,"Great sets and equally impressive costumes fill this lurid and dark vampire tale. Anne Rice adapts her best selling 1976 novel for the big screen. The story of depraved love, lust and hunger is told to a reporter(Christian Slater)by Louis(Brad Pitt)the conscience-stricken protege of the unremorseful and lascivious Lestat(Tom Cruise). Lestat tries hard to convince Louis that the blood of New Orleans aristocrats is the most pleasing of all. Louis would rather suck the blood of rats and chickens than to take human life. Joining them for companionship is Claudia(twelve yr old Kirsten Dunst)who favors sinking her fangs into whores and elderly women. Armand(Antonio Banderas)the oldest living vampire in the world lashes out his judgment of the three blood suckers.It is fun watching Cruise and Pitt living as a couple in hopes of hiding their vampirish way of life. Miss Dunst is absolutely great as a character that ages thirty some odd years while staying in the body of a child. Note:Cruise was not Rice's favorite choice to play Lestat, but after the finished product was said to be more than pleased. Moody and gruesome, but a must for vampire fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dracula and Nosferatu can rest in piece if this is the only competition they are up against.,"***POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS***Lavish adaptation of Anne Rice's novel, scripted by the author herself. Film begins with a modern-day prologue as a reporter played by Christian Slater interviews Brad Pitt who claims to be an ageless vampire. Narrative then moves back to the end of the 18th Century in New Orleans. Here Pitt is infected by the vampire Lestat, played by Tom Cruise, and the film follows the progress of their relationship and later Pitt's journey to Europe where he encounters another vampire, played by Banderas.This is a film of set pieces, with lavish scenes and masses of extras playing out against a hollow narrative and a particularly poor ( and miscast ) performance from Cruise. Rice was supposedly mortified at the casting of Cruise as Lestat, but after seeing his initial scenes retracted this and endorsed him fully. I don't know what she saw because he is totally unsuitable in the part despite making a gallant effort. Considering the importance of his character, this deals the film a mortal blow from which it never looks like recovering.As in other Neil Jordan films, this is all gloss and no substance with the basics of storytelling and film-making given a backseat. Like 'Mary Shelley's Frankenstein' (1994), 'Interview with the Vampire' shows how the modern age still hasn't figured out a satisfactory approach to the horror film. Be it an historical vampire story as we have here, or a modern update as in 'Near Dark' (1987), recent attempts at serious horror concerning vampires have been dull, contrived and not very scary. It seems that only a comic-book approach can provide decent, albeit shallow, entertainment for fans of the undead - 'Blade' (1998) and 'From Dusk Till Dawn' (1996) are limited but, by default, are the most commendable recent offerings.Overall the film is a big disappointment. Only Brad Pitt manages to extricate himself from the mediocrity and puts in a good performance despite the material. People who rave over this mustn't have seen the multitude of top-notch vampire films over the years, the majority of which provide pints of thick, deep, red blood, as opposed to the dribble of anaemic, watered down rubbish we have here. Star names, a big budget and glossy production values don't automatically make a quality film and in this case can't even provide an average one.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gothic romanticism AND gore.,"With its photogenic cast and a story-line revolving around the emotional anguish that goes hand in hand with vampirism, Interview With The Vampire could be accused of being the 90s precursor to Twilight; its vamps might be sad, however, but they sure ain't sappy: the vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) would happily tear Edward a new one; Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) would rip out Bella's throat without batting an eyelid; Louis (Brad Pitt) would find it hard to join in at first, but his hunger would prevail. That's because Interview With The Vampire is a proper vampire movie with proper vamps designed for a mature audience, not watered down PG-13 tripe aimed at the less discriminate teen demographic.Interview's bloodsuckers might have emotional issues to deal with‚Äîimmortality and a constant craving for blood doesn't come without its baggage‚Äîbut when it comes down to it, these guys see mortals as food and having a relationship with dinner is only going to get messy (much better to slash their throat and be done with it); Interview's brutal bloodsuckers (and its R-rating) ensure that viewers get a healthy helping of gore to go with their Gothic romanticism, Stan Winston's incredible effects giving the film plenty of bite. Factor in excellent direction from Neil Jordan and great turns from its stars (Dunst is amazing for her age), and what you have is a terrific vampiric horror in the truest sense.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

gorgeous stuff....,"One of the best and most beautiful vampire films ever.This film is amazingly beautiful, from the sets, locations, even right down to its main characters (apparently this film prided itself on the casting ¬ñ it used four of cinema's most gorgeous actors). The casting for this movie is pure inspired genius, although Cruise did cause absolute uproar when he got the part of Lestat. Let's face it, he's not portrayed as the most likable of people, (not to mention being a tad unhinged) or even as a decent actor (remember 'Legend'?) but he does an amazing turn as Lestat. He's vicious, villainous, camp and demonically gleeful in this role. Even Anne Rice sent him a letter of apology after she saw his performance. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Louis is a fair show too; he manages to maintain constant melancholy without crossing the line into whiny annoyance, although his constant pouting detracts from his character somewhat (you're a vampire, not Zoolander!). Kirsten Dunst's Claudia is pure childlike evil. Hard to believe she was only 12 when she made this film.Having read Anne Rice's infamous 'Vampire Chronicles' a hundred times, it wasn't until I saw this movie that I'd even heard of them (shameful, no?). Even after reading the book, it was one of those rare moments when you think, ""well the film was just as good"". And to say that a LOT of the narrative was cut, it retains everything about the original story that it should; the atmosphere, the gloom, the characters, it's all there. Even the gore factor is stylishly done; for one, the blood looks real, which, let's face it is one of the most important, yet overlooked elements in most vampire films ¬ñ in Blade, they used what looks like ribena, in Dracula, they used red jelly, and in The Lost Boys they used something resembling passata. The vampires themselves also look absolutely amazing. (To quote Louis ""Do you find us beautiful, magical? Our white skin, our fierce eyes¬Ö"") The makeup and contact lenses, for once, do more than just make the actors look like they've got flu.Unlike ""Queen Of The Damned"" this movie sticks to its content, and gives the audience the story, remaining true to it at every stage. There's no story jig, no idiotic and pointless changes to plots and the whole thing is as stylish and sinister as you can get. It does justice to the book and remains a brilliant film in its own right. One to add to any film-junkie's collection.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I watched it a tad too late...,"""Who will take care of me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?""I just recently got around to watching Interview with the Vampire, twenty years after Neil Jordan directed this successful film, and I have to admit the recent overload of vampire films and novels over the past decade did affect my viewing since most of the innovative elements that Anne Rice introduced here I have seen in later films and TV series (like True Blood). I'm sure many of these films were inspired by some of Rice's original ideas which made this movie stand out above prior vampire films. Unfortunately I'm giving this a lower rating because I am a bit tired of these films and in my opinion the best vampire film continues to be Let the Right One In (which managed to stay low key unlike this epic story). Rice's story is imaginative and Jordan's direction visionary, thus creating a unique and dark vampire drama with some strong performances. The film did drag at times and it is a bit too long but several scenes were intense and skillfully delivered. If you are a fan of vampire films or of Anne Rice's work then you will probably enjoy this much more than I did because it is dark and Gothic, but it does have its weaknesses and the ending is a bit off note.As the title suggests, the story is told in the form of an interview as a journalist named Daniel (Christian Slater) encounters a 200 year old vampire named Louis (Brad Pitt). His story begins in 18th century New Orleans after having lost his wife when he was 24. Deciding he didn't want to live any longer, Louis set out to destroy his life picking fights at local bars. One night while doing this he catches the attention of a vampire named Lestat (Tom Cruise) who gives him the opportunity to become like him. Louis accepts and becomes Lestat's apprentice, however he isn't satisfied with his new life as a vampire and refuses to kill humans. Louis hates who he has become, but his life changes when Lestat turns a little girl named Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) into a vampire and together they form a family. Louis continues to narrate his story through two centuries as they encounter troubles and betrayals along the way.Tom Cruise is a huge action star and at times it's difficult to separate him from his characters, but surprisingly he lost himself in the role of Lestat and gives a convincing performance as a blood lusting vampire. Brad Pitt despite not losing himself in the role as well as Cruise does still delivers a believable lead performance. The real surprise for me however was the young Kirsten Dunst who gives the best performance of the film. Once her character is introduced the story really picks up and it becomes engaging. In my opinion the interview scenes didn't work too well; I would have preferred if Louis simply narrated his story directly to us considering Slater's character doesn't really do much as an interviewer. Despite some flaws in the story, the film does look good and the effects are also done well. Jordan and Rice were able to create a unique vampire film that stood out from the rest and that is the reason why 20 years later it is still talked about and referred too.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Favourite Vampire Movie!,"I am a vampire lover and this is the ultimate vampire movie (second only to ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"") consisting of the two sexiest male vampires ever created- Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. I must admit at first I thought Tom Cruise was a touch too 'apple pie' for this role, but he ultimately knocked my socks off! In fact, he is my second favourite vampire ever, second only to the incredible Gary Oldman in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". And Brad Pitt - oooh Brad Pitt - is hands down the most gorgeous vampire ever. And he played the role of Louis convincingly... but in my eyes would've suited the role of Lestat as well.

Pitt is fine as the lead who find the whole blood letting requirement morally tricky, with Dunst, hugely impressive in her first significant role as the young girl unable to grow up physically and unhampered by scruples of any kind. However it is Cruise as the flamboyant, amusing, rather unpleasant character who couldn't care less who gets killed and why, that brings it all together and the film seems weaker when he's not around.

Maybe they can't act in other films like he says but in this one they do a great job, I can't understand what problem he saw in their performance. Anyone saying this movie is one of the worst in the world or below average like those two, must hate it for some other reason than the actual artistic value of the piece.

A visually stimulating tale of darkness and mortality,"I'm trying to get over the fact that the ending of the film makes absolutely no sense to me (unless i'm looking hard for something that's not there). When I do get past that, however, I find that ""Interview with the Vampire"" is a very beautifully told tale that looks deep into the heart of what evil truly is.Based on Anne Rice's novel (and also her screenplay) ""Interview"" is the retelling of Louis's (a vampire) story of how he became a vampire. The story starts in 18th century Louisiana where Louis (Brad Pitt) encounters an opportunity for eternal life when he is seeking death. A vampire named Lestat (Tom Cruise) gives him this opportunity with the expectation of companionship. When Louis has trouble disconnecting his human moral compass from his blood-lusting monster of a self, Lestat tries to test him and eventually brings him another companion when he makes Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) a vampire as well. The story is Louis's search for an understanding of this immortal life that he can come to terms with, which results in a film that explores deep into the notion of immortality with a price.The film's beauty comes from the very lavish sets and the strong mystical element that is worked into every set. Though the setting is all real world, because the film explores the fantastical world of vampires, everything seems surreal and magical. Dante Ferretti has created another beautiful movie world and Neil Jordan makes it shine through his camera-work. Jordan really brings Rice's screenplay to life, or else you'd be looking at a particularly boring film.Cruise as Lestat was a good choice. He is downright creepy and conveys the sense of moral ambiguity that Lestat represents. Pitt also shows both the strong and the weak sides of Louis, though he is not as skilled with handling some of the film's melodrama. Dunst is probably the most praiseworthy. Having to portray a child who technically has wisdom beyond her appearance is a challenge and Dunst is behind some of the film's best scenes and most suspenseful moments. Her fits of rage are probably the most interesting as is her character's predicament with never growing up, which really starts the conversation about mortality and the film's themes.Though some plot clarity would have been nice and a little less melodrama would have helped make the themes really significant to the rest of the film, ""Interview"" is a successful film from a visual standpoint. The craftsmen of this film, everyone from production design to costumes and make-up, truly made this film take off from okay to good and very interesting. There is no doubt that you are deeply interested in what happens to these characters and that is thanks to the actors and the incredible world that was envisioned for them to act in. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interview with the Vampire,"With the recent passing of Anne Rice it's good to rediscover the best film adaptation of her best known work. Elegant, cultured, dark, and oh so bloody, ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" is an exploration on the fundamental realities of life through the lens of myth and legend. A vampire is interviewed in a rented hotel room and he narrates his unique story. The tale is a vast panorama of history, culture, morality, mortality, relationships, sexuality, evil and life itself. Well directed with good casting that shows the star-studded flick brings out the actors' strengths ornamented by the poetic and literate script that lends the film with an aristocratic air of perverse decadence that fits it well. It's unfortunate Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise didn't get along during the shoot and never worked together again as they have a chemistry that would have worked in other films. There are slow parts throughout the film and an underlying shallowness that keeps it from being a classic but the overriding quality maintains its viewability from start to finish. As attractive as a withered rose on a silken suit, ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" lingers with its haunting depiction of the darkness of the human psyche and the light which its nature ennobles and brightens.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is a common theme within the Vampire subgenre however, most tend to fall flat on this premise or something else if not that.

"Seductive, erotic and sensual - exactly as any vampire movie should be.","""Interview with the Vampire"" is a film based upon the ""Vampire Chronicles"" series by author Anne Rice, whose other novel of the series - ""Queen of the Damned"" - was also made into a film in 2002 (originally titled ""Interview with the Vampire II"" in production phase).Although ""Interview"" is far from a flawless picture, it does boast some remarkable visuals from director Neil Jordan, who seamlessly integrates the modern day America with that of a few centuries ago. The story begins with an avid reporter named Daniel Malloy (Christian Slater) being granted an interview with an enigmatic young man named Louis (Brad Pitt), who eventually claims to be nothing other than a living, breathing vampire.He recalls his story to the reporter in dismay and disillusionment, telling how his dreams turned to ruin and he was deceived by the seductive Lestat (Tom Cruise), who promised him eternal life...but never divulged into the misery it would provide him.The story traces back hundreds of years to the revolution and Louis and Lestat's tale drastically alters through the years as the eras change and new faces come and go. For Louis, this is the most disheartening aspect of being a vampire - having to see the ones you care about disappear forever.Louis forms a friendship with an orphaned vampire named Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) and their friendship completes the tension between Louis and Lestat, which escalates as the film progresses.""Thelma and Louise"" might have made Brad Pitt semi-famous as a pin-up boy for a while but it was ""Interview with the Vampire"" that gave him his career as we know it today. In fact, after making the film, Tom Cruise reportedly never wished to speak to Pitt again because he considered him to be a fierce rival in showbiz - a younger talent trying to steal the veteran's Hollywood presence. And Pitt has succeeded quite well at not only equaling Cruise's star power, but arguably surpassing it.His performance is the key to ""Interview with the Vampire."" He's far better than Cruise, who demanded praise for his ""camp"" performance - it's alright, but it's basically just Tom Cruise acting out his personal life...after the whole thing with him jumping on Oprah's sofa, it's really not so hard to see him acting this over-the-top in reality.Pitt conveys emotional conflict behind his cold stare, and that is the vital element of the film. Another powerful aspect is Neil Jordan's direction - the cinematography is beautiful and perfectly captures the essence of the modern day Gothic vampire film, picking up where Coppola left off with ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" In fact, they form nice companion pieces, although ""Interview"" boasts far superior acting.All vampire movies are based upon a heavy amount of eroticism - the seduction of the vampire as a metaphor for sexuality. Jordan really captures that here. Cruise's flamboyant performance portrays Lestat as a metro-sexual, and there are certainly intentional scenes of sexual tension between Lestat and Louis, particularly when Lestat first seduces Louis and drinks from his neck. It almost becomes uncomfortable to watch to a certain degree.""Interview with the Vampire"" is not a flawless film - it's too long and a bit too ""heavy"" for its own good - but overall it is an entertaining and effective vampire drama.As a trivia note, the soundtrack for this film contains the last official recording of the original Guns N' Roses lineup - a cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil.""",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Gothic tale of love, hate, sorrow and blood","As with Queen of the Damned, so it was with this movie that I made what I thought was a rather hideous mistake in watching the movie prior to reading the book. Those fears were well based with queen of the Damned- the book is utterly fantastic, whereas even without having read the book the only part of the movie I liked was the soundtrack.My fears were groundless with ""Interview"". Granted, there were parts missing and parts changed, but not in such a way that it detracted from the story in general. Where the book is a horror novel which almost parallels Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" in its ability to terrify, the movie is a drama which alternates between inducing laughter, sorrow and, in some parts, nearly reducing the viewer to tears. Pitt's performance in this regard is particularly fine.However, the one thing that everyone who has seen this movie cannot fail to agree on is the fact that, whilst there is indeed an all-star cast (notable characters are Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater and Kirsten Dunst), it is the twelve year-old Kirsten Dunst (playing Claudia) who steals the show. In the book she was a truly terrifying child, whose alternate flashes of rage, love and complete and utter lack of emotion serve to unsettle the reader to the point of wanting to close the book and calm down for a few minutes. In the movie she is a little less cold-hearted, and the relationship between her and Louis (Pitt) is bizarre, seeming at times like the relationship between father and daughter, and at other times like the relationship between lovers.Many viewers who have not had the pleasure of reading the book (in particular the jocks) criticize the movie for the homoerotic undertones which define the relationship that begins to build between Louis and Armand, at times like that between a teacher and their student, and at other times (again) like lovers. This relationship is underdeveloped in the movie, and is not given the chance to blossom into the full- fledged bond that Louis and Armand share for a brief period in the book.A strong performance is put in by Banderas as Armand, albeit slightly different in temperament than the Armand of Rice's books. Unfortunately the role was too brief a one, and Banderas did not get nearly long enough a role.Louis' progression through the years is another example of the areas in which this movie excels. Whilst he physically does not change, his surroundings do, and his dress sense changes with the years.This was a strong adaptation of a brilliant book, which fans of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles should all enjoy. The main plot of the movie stays true to the book, and in some places the dialogue is perfect, straight from the book, line for line. It has the power to disturb, induce laughter, sorrow, and excitement, and is a visual feast for the eyes. The vampires look exactly like Rice describes them, except (dissapointingly) in the case of Armand. And even with the screw-ups in Armand's appearance, Antonio Banderas plays him extremely well.The fact that I happen to despise Tom Cruise can only serve to add to just how good this movie must be.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Somewhat interesting vampire movie, but at the same time it is also a bit boring.","This movie has its highs and lows in it, for the most part the first half was good and the second half was rather dull.  Ironically, Rice hated the fact Cruise was picked for Lestat, but he did the best job in this picture as far as I could see.  Once he exited the movie the energy level went down and I couldn't wait for it to end.  The main problem is Pitt, who pardon the phrase, was as stiff as a corpse.  Through the entire movie he just seemed bored.  Once Cruise left we are stuck with him and then they introduce a very bland Banderos who also offers very little.  Dunst does rather good as the girl vampire and Slater is also good, though he is not in this one very much.  What to say about the plot, there sort of is none.  It is mainly Pitt telling a reporter about his early days as a vampire, nothing to horrific is really featured in this one.  Just a bunch of people in those old time clothes.  Though it was somewhat good still, mainly because of the Cruise scenes which were funny in a demented sort of way.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Is this supposed to be taken seriously?,"I remember reading of Ann Rice's initial disappointment with the pending film version of her novel INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE.  She was upset at Tom Cruise being cast as the flamboyant Lestat (Rice always envisioned Rutger Hauer in the part).  She felt that Cruise would have been a better Louis and Brad Pitt, who played Louis, would have been better as Lestat.  Upon seeing a preview screening, Rice changed her opinion, publicly apologized and gave the film her seal of approval.  Not having read the novels in their entirety, I can only go by the excerpts that give the description of Lestat: Tall, slender, blond, face like an angel.  Sounds like Brad Pitt to me.  An early comic book adaptation had Louis drawn to resemble Tom Cruise (this was five years before the movie!).  After seeing the movie, all I can say is that I agree more with Rice's first opinions and that Pitt should have been Lestat and Cruise should have been Louis.As it is, Neil Jordan's take on INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE:  THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES plays like a bad take on Roman Polanski's FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS.  Cruise, as Lestat, acts as if he should be chewing on the scenery rather than his victims' necks as he goes horribly over the top. Pitt, as Louis, seems to be of the opinion that since Cruise is in acting overdrive, he should be in very low key and is almost comatose.  However, the big sin of the movie is that it isn't scary in the least.  Cruise comes across more like the little kid in one of those really cheap Halloween costumes who jumps out of the closet and tries to scare you.  Everything ends up looking so lifeless that it's as if real vampires may have invaded the production.I did like the scene where Louis goes to a movie theatre to catch up on all of the sunrises that he has missed in his life via film clips from the silent classic SUNRISE to SUPERMAN:  THE MOVIE.  Christian Slater does an admirable job as the Interviewer, filling in for the late River Phoenix. While the movie as a whole disappointed me, I will say this:  I said to myself that if what happened at the end of the movie would happen, it would end on a good note.  Fortunately, Jordan got that part right . . . if nothing else.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Vampire, Louis, Tells the story of his life to a young reporter","Interview with The Vampire is a spectacular movie full of complex emotions that are fabulously portrayed by the actors. Brad Pitt does a wonderful job of playing the vampire Louis, who is meant to be ""an immortal with a mortal's passion"". While Pitt carries the main role well, the movie is all the more accentuated by Tom Cruise as the dark-humored vampire Lestat and Kirsten Dunst as the forever-young vampire Claudia. The movie is not intended to be a horror, however. It is more of a documentary of emotions. With the loss of Lestat's character about halfway through the story, the film seems to slow down a bit, but the connection to the characters is still quite alive.

One of the best movies of all time!,"You can tell I really love this movie. I named two of my e-mail addresses not to mention my IMDb ID after either Lestat or Louis.Where shall I start? The plot is exceptional, I have to give credit for that, and the cast is so STAR STUDDED! They were not only pretty faces but also great talent! This movie featured the likes of Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise & Christian Slater, which are 3 of my favorite Hollywood men, who bought life into their characters, making us feel that they were not actors portraying a role but the actual characters themselves, which is important in an actor to get into every movie's individual character(Do you know what I'm saying? It's kind of like the Keanu Reeves issue, in which he acts the same for every different role he's playing.), distinguish it from the other roles he's played.Kirsten Dunst was fantastic, this being her best movie in my opinion. She definitely deserved that Golden Globe nomination. For a girl going on 12 at that time, she acted magnificently! She really portrayed a young, confused vampire, filled with fury & anger, yet still has love for certain people. Louis de Point du Lac's role was mighty complex, being caught in the midst of his mortal self, & the cruel, non-forgiving monster he's become. Brad Pitt did well to accomplish this, as so did Tom Cruise formulated a certain something to Lestat de Lioncourt's character, making it so special, something that wasn't in other Tom Cruise movies.There were many things special about this movie, but I'm not quite sure what exactly made it so special to me.

Farewell to the sunrise...,"Neil Jordan's movie-version of Anne Rice's celebrated novel, which she adapted for the screen, might have skirted disaster with boyish, all-American Tom Cruise cast as the cunning vampire Lestat de Lioncourt. But Cruise acquits himself admirably in the role: not a towering figure of evil, nor even a dark, imposing force, Cruise's Lestat is a devious trickster, a child-demon, and this sort of wicked decadence works well for Cruise. In 1790s New Orleans, a young widower (Brad Pitt) is picked by Lestat as a companion of sorts (it's never made clear, but apparently vampires feel the need to pass on to others what was initially done to them); bitten twice, Pitt's Louis is given the choice to die or to go on as part of the undead. Though the film is handsome and well-wrought, with mordant passages of dark humor and blood-soaked, cringe-worthy carnage, it does exist on mostly one note (which extends through to the tepid finale). The hunt for human victims can only stretch so far before the picture falls into a wryly bleak, downtrodden rut (these are not foppish or cackling vampires by any means). As Louis, Pitt doesn't fare quite as well as Cruise; playing a morally grounded man who chased death and got captured, Pitt's good ol' boy persona isn't completely overshadowed, and his shallow qualities as an actor in general don't quite mesh with this more-or-less complicated character. Cruise, however, is surprisingly nimble and skilled; his angular frame has seldom been this graceful, and he manages to make Lestat a lithe, sensuous prankster. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Bloody Dose Of Realism,"This is a vampire movie with a unique twist - realism! I am not inferring that creatures like this really exist - this is fiction - but if they did, this probably would be the most accurate account of them because vampires are not glamorized here. In fact, the film pictures the vampire existence as a lonely, depressing one. At least we see that in the case of Brad Pitt's character here, a vampire who needs the blood but knows it's morally wrong to kill human beings for it.The acting in this movie is excellent, which includes the star of it, Tom Cruise, and young Kristin Dunst. The latter was a surprise hit to me as the young vampiress (is there such a word?) who is trapped in a little girl's body. (Dunst was about 11 or 12 years old and not that well-known at the time of this release.)What I was a little uncomfortable with were a few of the bloody scenes, particularly in the first third of the movie. They were too graphic and just plain disgusting at times. Also, there also were definite homosexual overtones between a few of the vampires. Was this film another attempt to push that agenda? Probably, but it seemed out of place in a vampire movie.Perhaps the final song of the movies sums up its contents best: ""Sympathy For The Devil,"" by the Rolling Stones. Hmmm.....an interesting choice for a closing song.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles,"Given author Anne Rice was annoyed by the casting of Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat. Interview with the Vampire had a very controversial production. Not least the death of River Phoenix who had been cast as a reporter.However this was the first movie I realised just how good an actor Cruise actually is. Before this Cruise had been paired with an older more experienced actor such as Dustin Hoffman or Paul Newman.Here Cruise blows away most of his co-stars and the film suffers when Lestat disappears from a large portion of the film.Director Neil Jordan got the gig after winning an Oscar for Best Screenplay for The Crying Game. This is a Grand Guignol Gothic.In modern San Francisco, reporter Daniel Molloy (Christian Slater) is called to interview Louis (Brad Pitt.) He claims to be a plantation owner from New Orleans and is a vampire who is over 200 years old.Louis recounts his life story, how he was converted into a vampire by Lestat after the death of his wife in childbirth. Louis initially resists the urge to take human blood while Lestat is a natural predator.Later Louis finds an orphan Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) who is turned into a vampire and Louis treats her like a daughter. Now Louis is tired of life and immortality.Despite a cast of good looking Hollywood hunks. Interview with the Vampire after a bloodsoaked beginning becomes ponderous and indigestible. Not helped by the watering down of the gay subtext of the source novel. It robs the film of an important plot element. Pitt and Antonio Banderas are bland. Apart from Cruise, only Stephen Rea stands out as one of the vampires.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Stylish, atmospheric, but not entirely full blooded","Reporter Daniel Malloy interviews vampire Louis (whom has remained in the state for the past 200 years). Along this journey Louis describes his life's journey through varying emotional states from his initial friendship to Lestat to his paternal relationship with young vampire Claudia...Interview with the vampire is certainly well-made, is atmospheric, stylish and perhaps even a tad sexy, but whether it is a brilliant film remains up for speculation...The problem I had with Interview with the vampire is that I felt that many of the characters were a bit shallow and lacked depth; despite good performances and some tense direction the film never entirely gripped me in the way that it should have done. Lestat and Louis should have been more complex and intriguing, but the truth is that they weren't and this really hurt the narrative. Of the 2 Cruise fares better, but this is perhaps due to the fact that he has the more showy role, but Pitt underperforms creating a character that it's hard to really care about. Allegedly, Kirsten Dunst was nominated for a best supporting actress role and given the fact that she was only 12 years old when the film was released that is some going. She's every bit as good as the big guns (possibly better at times) and deserves all the credit that she gets.The story is good enough to sustain interest and the film has a sort of suave sophistication permeating over it that just about covers the weaknesses and makes it worth watching, but the superficial character development prevent it being the masterpiece that many claim it to be despite it being worthy in other areas.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Lestat (Cruise) is one of the vilest Vampires I have ever seen but towards the end of the film I found I understood him and somewhat sympathized with the character.Claudia (Dunst) I felt really bad for her... she is a young girl turned and she will never have a chance to grow up.Louis (Pitt) I felt pity for. He never wanted to ""feast on a human"". He remained strong in that area for a long time - feasting of small animals most of the time.

Brad Pitt was at good performance as always, Antonio Banderas was good and Tom Cruise was great. He certainly made a very good Lestat.And to the ones who didn't read the book - the film is perfect for them too because it is a very decent vampire film without the constant silly fighting. It describes how vampires feel and think about life and existence. They question life, afterlife and everything.I strongly recommend this movie to everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Much more of a fascinating story than a horror story""","I'm not a fan of horror films, and I had always thought that this film was a horror story since it was about vampires.  However some people I had met claimed that this film wasn't really a horror story. I didn't really take their recommendations into account until shortly after I'd seen 'Underworld' which to me was a good action film as well as a dark and Gothic film. So I decided that it was about time I watched 'Interview With The Vampire'.When I saw this film was fascinated and intrigued right from the start. I felt like I would have done the same things Louis ( Brad Pitt) had done in his long destiny into ""darkness"". I also felt very sorry for Louis he lost the little girl vampire           ( played by Kirsten Dunst) whom he was very close to. This film displaysvampires more like fascinating creatures rather than terrifying monsters, so I think the film can really cast a spell on some people. I also liked the two main vampires being played by two great American actors Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt.I believe Ann Rice has invented an entirely new way of looking at vampires and perhaps I'll some of her novels one day. Overall I film I once rejected is now a film I certainly recommend.",,Anonymous,Horror
What's the title again?,"All these years I'd been calling this movie ""Interview with A Vampire"" instead of ""Interview with THE Vampire."" It's like The Berenstein Bears instead of The Berenstain Bears.""Interview with the Vampire"" is one of my favorite vampire movies. I like it even more than ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" Louis (Brad Pitt) spends time with a journalist, Malloy (Christian Slater), giving him a highlight of his 200 years of being a vampire. It began with his ""birth into darkness"" at the teeth of Lestat (Tom Cruise). Along the way he made a tiny companion in Claudia (Kirsten Dunst).His life as a vampire was anything but the blissful rein as top of the food chain that one might imagine. Louis was a vampire that didn't want to let go of his humanity. Unfortunately, vampirism is no place for bleeding hearts.The movie was dark, naturally, and nebulous at times. The vampires were all so sensuous and vague in their speech that it was hard to pick up what their intentions and motives were. In that respect it was one of those movies of which reading the book fills in those small, yet important details. I still liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Youth and Beauty Preserved Forever,"Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles: 10 out of 10: Adaptation of the Anne Rice novel that has aged like a fine red wine. Not that the vampires would know they never drink the stuff.The Good: This movie is better now than it was when it came out. The actors are more established. You don't have that silly controversy about Tom Cruise as Lestat. (He is incredible by the way). The theme of being forever young really hits home as you see these guys (and gal) from twenty-five years ago. In a way, actors are a lot like vampires forever young on the screen.The Bad: This really isn't a bad per se. I know that Christian Slater was a thing back when this movie was made. He doesn't ruin the film or anything but he is definitely the weakest link.The Ugly: When one lists child actors that went on to adult stardom (Jodie Foster, Ron Howard, Christian Bale, Natalie Portman) you know who never seems to be mentioned? Kirsten Dunst. I am not saying she is the best actor in this movie... okay, I am. She is fantastic, I always wondered why she never seemed to get the credit for it as other actors and actresses have.In conclusion: It is actually hard to review a film like this. If you haven't seen it go see it. If it has been a while since you saw it see it again. You will be surprised at how young everyone looks. You will be amazed at how overt the homosexual subtext really was. You will ask yourself what did America see in Christain Slater all those years ago.

A Different Kind Of Tom Cruise Performance,"It's story time with Vampire Louis. While most movies build to a climax and conclusion, this movie is simply the life story of a 200 year old vampire.

Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and Antonio Banderas playing vampires in a movie together is intriguing all by itself. It's especially interesting seeing Tom Cruise in a role that is very different than his usual. This movie is more drama than horror, which means there are some chills, but not many thrills.

He describes his life before being a vampire, and his journey after being a vampire in the form of an interview.Brad Pitt as Louis, is undoubtedly, the hero of the film. Although he is a vampire, who lives on other people's blood, he shows his human side of love, pity, sacrifice and compassion through the film. Exactly as a protagonist should be. However, he broods and sulks.He looks forever depressed.Tom Cruise as Lestat, the arrogant, egoistic, ruthless, ever immortal blood sucking monster , stole the show. He completely NAILED the character of Lestat. The others also played their roles convincingly.

5 hotties + awesome vampire book= #1 Vampire movie of all time!!!,"Interview with the Vampire is hands down probably the number one vampire movie. We got to see a story so unique and original, the eyes through a vampire and his world. Normally, we see Dracula getting chased around by Van Helsing, all we know is vampires are usually bad and must be destroyed, yatta, yatta, yatta. But this time, we not only experience how Louis became a vampire, but what his life became of it. Anne Rice would truly be proud of how much a great movie her most famous book turned out to be.We have some great and very attractive actors who star in this film like: Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Antonio Bandares, Christian Slater, and Stephen Rea, not to mention a very young and new Kirsten Dunst. The story starts off with Christian Slater interviewing Brad Pitt, who plays Louis, he makes the most interesting statement to Christian that he's a vampire. Obviously, Christian doesn't take this seriously, but Louis offers him one thing: his story.Louis was born and grew up during the time when America was just being discovered in the late 1700's, he just lost his wife and child in labor, a little different than the book, but anyways, but his misery brings him to wanting death, and Lestat, played by the brilliant Tom Cruise, brings him that with becoming a vampire. Of course Louis doesn't realize what he gets himself into, but Lestat does what he can to show Louis the perks of being a vampire, even if it means bringing in a child, Claudia, played by Dunst, and turning her into a vampire to keep Louis with him. But Claudia and Louis look at Lestat as a warden and won't let them go, so they attempt to kill him and flee the city of New Orleans to France.In Paris, they meet a group of thespian vampires, they kill people on stage as if they were in a play. ""Vampires pretending to be humans pretending to be vampires"". Louis meets Armond, played by Bandares, and Santiago, played by Rea. Armond is obsessed with Louis and tells him that Claudia shouldn't be a vampire since she is so young and ends up destroying the thing that means most to Louis, I won't spoil it. Which leads Louis back to the interviewer where Christian is starting to question his doubts of Louis being a vampire.Interview with the Vampire is a terrific film that is just beautifully directed and the actors are just so brilliantly charismatic, it's just impossible in some ways for someone not to enjoy this movie. I know my friends who are not into horror films ended up loving this one because of it's interesting story. It's just a great film that I think everyone should get the chance to see.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Vampire Story that Brought Us Three Brilliant Stars,"Neither the literary nor the cinematic world has been in lack of the presence of those pale, blood-sucking creatures. We cannot say it for certain that this one will be the greatest among numerous other films of the same theme. However, one will be inevitably tempted to give it a higher score due to the three super movie stars that featured in it, namely Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Kristen Dunst.The whole film is revolving around the heart-wrenching remorse of Luis, who made the irrevocable decision of turning himself immortal. The same regret was felt by the little girl converted by him and Leatat. Throwing of tantrums seem a bit repetitive in the film, as all spectators may easily spot and get tired of during the total length of 120 minutes of the flick. The overall narration is carried out with a brilliant style, though. This, coupled with remarkable acting of our three superstars-to-be, made it a work that is worth being memorized by the film history.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I don't hate this movie, but I hate how it is diminished by relying on marquee names instead of talent.","To call Tom Cruise and ""actor"" is generous at best.  He appears in movies, and because he is pretty, people watch. He doesn't have enough talent to occupy minor character roles, and if he weren't so pretty, we would never have heard his name.  But he is, and here he is, without enough horsepower to drive Ann Rice's seminal character, Lestat.But, as bad as Cruise is, he is Olivier compared to Pitt, the other megastar pretty boy non-actor.  Pitt can't act his way out of a paper bag, and frankly, if you watch the plastic bag scene in American Beauty, you'll see a bag doing a better job at acting than Pitt will ever do.Neil Jordan decided to downplay the homosexual aspect of Rice's decadent vampires.  Given the meager talent of the two leads, there isn't much left. Cruise and Pitt preen and pose through endless costume scenes and the obligatory vampire touchstones like fangs and blood, and it is mediocre beyond belief.Thank god for Kirsten Dunst.  She is spectacular as Claudia, the young vampire denied the chance to grow up physically, but who becomes more wise and mature than any human adult.  Without her, there would be nothing but air.  Even Stephen Rea and Antonio Banderas are cardboard cutouts propped up in the scenery compared to her.Ann Rice has publicly said she approved of this presentation of her immensely popular book, but one can't help but wonder if she wasn't a bit disappointed, if the truth were told.

Lavish looking but lacking substance,"In modern day America, a journalist is approached by a handsome young man to hear a story told.  He tells a tale that begins hundreds of years prior, where he was a landowner who had lost his wife and daughter.  He tells of being turned vampire by the suave killer Lestat.  However the blessing of eternal life as the undead becomes a curse.The hunky cast is clearly a major part of the reason that this film was as successful as it was ¬ñ the imdb voting breakdown shows it ranking highly among female groups.  However this is maybe not a fair reflection of a film that is certainly glossy and professional, but not as rich in depth as it is visually.  The plot is reasonable, I have not read the book so I can't compare, but the plot was thin for the majority of the time.  As a journey with Louis, it fails to really grip and involve and ends up being a little dull as it feels like it's going through the motions.  A big problem is that much of the plot is character driven ¬ñ which would be fine if the film had strong characters, but it doesn't.Instead the characters are pretty bland and lacking substance.  Louis is interesting at first when he struggles with the change, but after that he becomes all slick and starts speaking in a low, quiet voice!  Most of the vampires are the same and the relationship between them aren't well done ¬ñ it all feels very superficial without any meat on the bone.  The actors must carry some of the blame.  Pitt is way out of his depth and flounders with a character he is unable to bring the complexities and sorrows out of convincingly.  Cruise looks like a model and is more pretty boy than devilishly dashing ¬ñ his character is a fine example of what I mean by superficial.  Dunst is OK for a child but all she really does is play the role in one way.  Banderas is a poor choice for his role and he looks a little out of place ¬ñ although Rea is good in his role.Overall this film looks good and Jordan has done a good job as director. The score is effective and the film has a good list of names in the lead and support roles.  However both the story and the characters lack a substance which was sorely needed to engage the audience.  While Louis battled to keep his regrets and his human heart, I battled without luck to find any heart within this slick, glossy movie.",,Anonymous,Horror

Great original vampire movie,This movie is really a great horror drama. The director did a great job and it has a wonderful cast who all perform their roles to near perfection.

This movie really does have something for everyone and it definitely suck you into the story.This movie is about a vampire who wants to tell a journalist his life story.

Cruise Shines as the Undying Vampire,"Interview with the Vampire (1994)*** (out of 4)The vampire Louis (Brad Pitt) asks a reporter (Christian Slater) to meet him so that he can tell his life story. He traces back two centuries to when he was a suicidal man who was given another way of life by the vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise).INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE was, believe it or not, quite controversial when it was first released due to how much graphic violence and blood there was but also because author and screenwriter Ann Rice objected to someone like Tom Cruise playing the lead role. By this time Cruise was already a movie star so I guess you can understand why she worried the film would be watered down or hurt with such a star being in it but it's funny to see that without him the movie would have been much less than what it is. Director Neil Jordan brings a European flavor to the movie but there are certainly several flaws here that keep it from being a great movie or even a really good vampire movie.As for the pluses, there are quite a few including the before mentioned European feel of the picture. Jordan was coming off THE CRYING GAME so it was a good choice to bring him on to director as he managed to create a very dark atmosphere and he also manages to handle some of the black comedy quite well. He also managed to bring a certain style to the picture that set it apart from a lot of the Hollywood pictures out at the time. With that said, I think the film didn't quite go far enough in many aspects. I haven't read the story to know what is different here but I just felt that a lot of the sexuality and some of the darker moments had been tamed. If the darker elements weren't in the book then I think they would have helped this film.It's funny that Rice didn't want Cruise in the picture but the weakest portion of the film comes towards the end when he's not in it. I thought Cruise did an exceptionally good job here and I really liked the way he played pure evil. The Lestat character is basically just a killing machine and I thought Cruise made you believe that he really was a member of the living dead and someone who has seen centuries of history. Pitt is also extremely good as he brings a sympathetic touch to the character that puts him at a complete opposite of Lestat. Then you've got Kirsten Dunst who is very good as the young girl who gets transformed into a vampire and also good are Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea. Slater is also good in his role but you can't help but feel River Phoenix would have been much better.INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE isn't a flawless movie as it certainly drags in spots and the 123-minute running time probably could have been trimmed by fifteen minutes or so. I'd also say that the screenplay is pretty much long-winded and at times it seems like it should have been edited down and just had a tighter story to be told. Still, the film manages to have a lot of good things in it and is worth watching.",,Anonymous,Horror

Strangely Compelling But Falters At The End,"Brad Pitt is Louis, in this story of Louis' life as a vampire who shares his story in an interview with a newspaper reporter (played by Christian Slater.) The story traces Louis from 1791 New Orleans to the present day. This is not your typical Hollywood vampire movie. It breaks - and even sneers at - many of the Hollywood-created vampire legends, focusing instead on the intricate relationship between Louis, the vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) and Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), the young girl the pair turn into a vampire and then ""adopt.""Frankly speaking, I thought it was Dunst who really made this movie. Her performance as Claudia was magnificent, as she believably captured the pain and confusion of facing possibly eternal life as a child - learning and maturing but never actually growing up. Her performance captivated me. Pitt and Cruise were passable in their roles, but never - in my view - captured the essence of their characters. Antonio Banderas was a disaster as Armand, the Paris vampire that Louis and Claudia eventually discover during their search for their own kind.This was an interesting enough movie - strangely compelling in fact. I was never tempted to turn away from it. It mixed humour and a mild eroticism into the vampire fare, and did so quite well. The movie fell apart, though, in the last third or so. The relationship between Louis and the Old World vampires just wasn't that intriguing to me. Frankly, the ""Vampire Theatre"" struck me as simply silly, and Banderas - as I mentioned - just didn't work in the role of Armand. But the first two-thirds were quite good. All things considered, I give this a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

thin-blooded,"I grew up on the macho vampire tradition of Hammer horror films, which featured powerful and highly sexualized vampires who spent entire movies chasing women and wasting villagers without sparing a thought about the true nature of their cursed existence.  It was therefore a shock to me when I first encountered Ann Rice's bisexual, whiny bloodsuckers who seem to get no joy whatsoever out of being immortal, irresistible creatures of the night. In place of fun Hammer action, ""Interview with the Vampire"" serves up a constant nasal whine from Louis.  This is a vampire movie for a depressed crowd; it oozes ennui and stagnancy.  The only characters with life are Lestat and Claudia, but most of the screen time goes to boring Brad Pitt and his problems.  There are really no human characters, nobody you can relate to...unless you think your life is like being a bored vampire.  Weird, sadistic, slow.  And the production style is already dated.",,Anonymous,Horror
Vampire Sociology,"Brokeback Mountain is said to be the ultimate exam of viewers' homophobia, but before everybody that's straight heads out to test their endurance with that film, I think Interview with the Vampire is keeping the throne warm for now. There technically isn't anything sexual in Interview, but author and screenplay adapter Anne Rice does a fine job establishing the ""bisexual in nature"" sociology of the vampires and how it compares with the mortals. Goes like this: the vampires cannot be sexual (all of one's body is dead, so... use your imagination), but when they quench their thirsts for blood on their victims, male or female, the thrills they achieve are so exhilarating that the act is comparable to sex. Once the viewer understands this, with some parts of the movie, it's hard to decide whether to be disgusted or not, not with the near homosexual relationship between Tom Cruise's Lestat and Brad Pitt's Louis (which is acceptable) but with Louis' little girl companion, in a pedophiliac sense. Kirsten Dunst, who was about 11, gives (still) the best performance of her career as Claudia, an aging vampire whose physical form stays childlike. However, since Claudia becomes adult and beyond and tries to do away with Lestat so Louis can be all hers, it's hard to watch what still seems to be a child to the naked eye grow so lovelorn for an adult. Their relationship raises tons of questions, some you may not want the answers to. My favorite scenes (tie) are toward the end when Louis seeks fiery revenge on some misled vampires in the name of Claudia and the edgy dialogue and body language exchanged between Louis and Armand (Antonio Banderas, fresh off playing Tom Hanks' lover in Philadelphia) in the scene after. My beef with the movie is not homophobic by any means. I just don't like getting beat over the head repeatedly for a point to be made, and casting all ""pretty boys"" like Cruise, Pitt, Banderas, and Christian Slater as the current-day interviewer is doing just that (though it's really the only case of it). Other than Pitt, I wish the casting director would have chosen the parts by acting ability and not by shock value.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A movie to see for the acting, costumes and special effects","Not being a fan of vampire movies, I didn't love tihs but I actually liked it a bit more then I expected to. I would imagine to really love this movie one has to be a sort of vampire movie fan to begin with and though I am not NOT against these types of movies I'm not into them either-if that makes ANY sense at all.Basically, this is a movie to see for these reasons: the costumes and atmosphere, special effects and very importantly the great acting-and I do mean great. Pitt and Cruise are both fabulous and unrecgnizable-both give their careeres a very large range with these performances.I also think this is a movie best seen in a group-when I saw it it was with a large group of people and we were almost kicked out of the theatre for talking so much-it's that type of movie. Definetly more of a fun movie to see then a deep memorable one.My rating is 7 of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I assume it needs no introduction...,"I have only recently seen this film. Going into it I was expecting to see a moderately good story about vampires. However, I was pleasantly surprised. For me it was an amazing story of emotion.Louis (Brad Pitt) is a man who mourns for his wife and baby. He seeks for a way to end his sorrow and Lestat (Tome Cruise) offers Louis a cure, but is it the right one?This was the first film I saw directed by Neil Jordan and I'm certain it won't be the last. Neil Jordan has given us something that enraptures the emotions. He has adapted the book into a film that couldn't have been made better.The duo of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise as Louis and Lestat is nothing short of memorizing. The performances from each of them glue your eyes to the screen. These two great actors continue their filmography with roles you won't forget.Kirsten Dunst gave an impeccable performance for one so young. She was perfect for the role of Claudia. And let's not forget Antonio Benderas as Armand and Christian Slater as Daniel Malloy. Even though they had little screen time, they made their effect.Interview with the Vampire is a film that will stay with you. The emotions that come from the characters will make this movie last. The existential whitens that drive the movie are even more interesting given the immortality of the characters. It is an amazing film and should be on any avid movie lovers list.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Horror Genre's Greatest Contribution,"I recall this film terrifying me as a child. As an adult, it is even more frightening. It's neither the vampires that necessarily scare you nor the scenes of gushing blood nor the darkness, but the sprawling narrative itself - a journey through an alternative history where monsters, magic and immorality intersect. A journey which begins in the small port city of New Orleans and traverses to Europe and ends back in the New World. Despite the epic nature of it all, Rice writes an intimate and personal story where the emotions of love, betrayal and uncertainty are at the forefront, especially evident in the tragic depictions of Louis and Claudia and the ruthless cunning of Lestat. You root for the protagonist, Louis, wanting him desperately to protect his daughter/friend/partner Claudia and at the same time find his own salvation. The emotions towards Lestat are more mixed; he certainly is the heel but moments exist where a deeply sympathetic and tortured person is sown. Then Rice keenly without compromising the integrity of the story introduces the underbelly of the vampire society ‚Äì a pleasant shift midway through the film.This is a special story. When you add the highly competent acting, this becomes possibly the best horror flick ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

why do vampires have to whine so much?,"i read the book, liked it okay and then saw the movie.  overall, i liked it. it was a welcome change to the usual portrayal of vampires as pure evil, spawned from the devil and with a lot of religious aspects to it.  anne rice made her vampires enjoyable and easy to believe in.  unfortunately, louis (brad pitt) is a terminal whiner.i preferred lestat, loathe though i am to say that i liked tom cruise. brad pitt just annoyed me and i kept wishing he would come to terms with the fact that he now has to drink blood to stay happy and functional.  the star of the show was, by far, young kirsten dunst as claudia.  as the film progressed, she gave the impression of maturing and adulthood, even though her appearance never altered.this movie was fairly close to the book, mostly just leaving things out rather than changing them completely.  it was far too melodramaitc for my taste, however.  why can't vampires just be?  by do they have to talk with a lot of dramatic pauses and look at you with smouldering eyes?  can't they just be?  that, of course, is a personal preference.not a bad movie.  good to see with friends, especially when you like to poke fun a the characters.  my specialty.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good,"This film is not as bad as they say. Vivid scenes and good dialog highlight this one. The acting is very effective. But bad cinematography gives the film a washed-out look. Bad costumes hurt it and so does the anti-climactic conclusion. I think it is still a reasonable film. It solidifies the comeback for Cruise as a unique presence in American cinema and hopefully is a sign that he will do more of these kinds of austere, gripping character pieces more often in the future. This film was nearly perfect, but sadly still not made for everyone. It's an important film, as well as very entertaining. Truly a gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Excellent Movie,"Interview with the vampire, is an exquisite, very stylish film, that at times is boring, and repellent. But the acting is so good, that you have to wonder why these people did not get Oscars for their work. The Story: A vampire who has lived for 200 years, tells Christian Slater his life story, first of how he became what he is, what he's done of what he is, and what he plans to do next. Tom Cruise plays the lead vampire, who turned Brad Pitt into a vampire. Brad Pitt plays the vampire who is telling the life story to Christian Slater. Kirsten Dunst (Jumangi, Small Soldiers) plays the young girl, who the both male vampires turns into a vampire. Therefore she is cursed and will stay a young girl the rest of her life, till someone kills her. The film itself is a fine one, and if you watch this, even though in parts it's boring, its also superstylish, and scary, and also quite gory. So watch this with an open mind, I think you will like it. I sure did! Rated R for vampire violence and gore, sexuality, and nudity.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A waste of Anne Rice's excellent novel,"Brad Pitt and Stephen Rea (who has a supporting role) are the only ones that really fit. Kirsten doesn't seem to fulfill what Claudia's part demands when talking about her acting, but physically she's perfect (she's really pretty, like a doll!). Christian Slater passes, but... RIVER!!!! :( Tom Cruise, in spite of his efforts (which we appreciate), *can't* be Lestat, although he made us forget that he was Tom, for some moments. But the worst is yet to come: ANTONIO BANDERAS. How to start ""critizicing constructively""?... Jim Carrey would have been better as Armand. To make it clear- when you see Antonio, do you think ""he's a Botticelli angel"" (as everybody describes Armand) or ""he's a Macho Latino"" (as everybody describes Antonio)? And when you see Antonio, do you think he's 17 years old (seeming age of Armand)? Besides, Armand's the one whose reputation's most ruined here... we mean, in the novels, Armand does NOT act in the theatre, he's NOT, like, 'hysteric', he's NOT evil and he stays with Louis (for some time, because then he leaves him :( )Armand's the victim, not the 'victimary'!

A Romantic Horror,"It's one of my favorites.It's different from all the vampire movies before, because it's a romantic story ,that is based on the pure,almost human feeling of a suffering not-of-this-world being.It's a great story even if you only read the book,but i believe that the director has made a really great job. The sets,the portrayal of those years are very authentic, and the acting is just as it was supposed to be.The characters are all captivating , both positive and negative ones . Brad Pitt Is in one of his best roles , Tom Cruise ,even if not the best choice for Lestat -as Anne Rice complained also - proves to be very appropriate in the role, and Kirsten Dunst ,a child actor, proved that she has a great amount of talent ,as we can see in the films she made after.

One of the better vampire movies,"Vampires have always been a welcome subject for Hollywood. It has inspired many producers, writers and directors, but not everyone of them has done a very good job with it. Some of these movies weren't exactly good or very believable, making it hard for the others to find an interested public. But if you are interested in the subject and you want to see a good movie about it, than I can definitely recommend this one.The title of this movie: ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" already reveals a lot about what you can expect from it. It tells the story of a young journalist in San Fransisco, at the present day, who follows a man through the streets and ends up in an anonymous room with him. When the journalist starts to interview the man, the stranger tells him that he is a vampire, being over 200 years old. The journalist doesn't believe him, but after the man proves it's true, he tells his story. He once was a plantation owner outside New Orleans in 1791. His wife died when giving birth to his child and he had lost all will to live, when a vampire named Lestat offered him the chance to become a vampire himself. He accepted, but soon realized that life as a vampire isn't all that great either. Then he met a little girl, Claudia, who influenced and changed the rest of his eternal life...Next to a good story, you'll also get some nice performances from the top cast that played in this movie. Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas... all did a very nice job, each portraying a vampire with an entirely different nature, but it was the young Kirsten Dunst who surprised me the most. Even though she was only 12 at the time, she already showed what a good actress she once would be.All in all this is a movie that will be loved by all the fans of vampire movies, but even when you aren't too much a fan of this movie, I think this has plenty of good things to offer. Think for instance of the decors, the clothing, the story and the acting. It all works very well together and that's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Peculiar, Bloody Horror","I'm always down for a horror film that switches up the conventional tropes of the genre. Interview with the Vampire certainly does that, but it also fails to capture one's undivided attention for a full 2 hours.Coming out in 1994, this was the very beginnings of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt's rise to fame, and that plays into a lot of the fun with the film. Cruise plays a seasoned vampire, Lestat, who seeks out a partner in crime, Brad Pitt, to be the next vampire along his side. Pitt had dealt with plenty of loss in his life and so a step away from his normal life and into the immortal life isn't the worst thing. But Lestat's harsher ways of living prove to be too much for Pitt's 'Louis' character. And there you have much of the first half of the film.It's pretty weird watching these established actors back when they were obviously taking on more risky roles such as these. I can't see either of the two taking on a vampire film now, so I guess that adds to the uniqueness of this film. There's plenty of bloody fun to be had with the film. There aren't a ton of scares, which is disappointing, but there's no shortage of obscure Cruise monologues and slasher twists.With that said, the film takes an unexpected turn about half way through, and the rest of the story falls of the rails because of it. So much so that the first and second hour feel like completely different stories. Mixed in you get a touching arc about Louis taking in a young Kirsten Dunst, who is surprisingly great (at only 12 years of age), but it's not enough to overcome a really weak second half.To me, the film is at its best when it explores the dynamic between Louis and Lestat, and lets Cruise and Pitt go crazy with dialogue and peculiar actions. Once we dive deep into why there are vampires and Antonio Banderas' character, the film falls flat.+Cruise & Pitt playing strange/creepy vampires+Bloody fun first half-Flat second half5.8/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

His story starts in the late Seventeen Houndreds in Saint Louis Missouri. He is a depressed man who just lost his wife and child. Than he is bitten by Lestat a Vampire from Paris. Louis refuses to feed on humans and lives off rats and such. Lestat finds this hilarious and taunts him constantly. After moving to Louisiana, Louis can't help himself and attacks a young girl, but Lestat finds him and laughs. Louis runs in self loathing but Lestat finds him and brings him to the dying child. Lestat than makes the child a Vampire and their daughter named Claudia. She is even more bloodthirsty than Lestat and teaches Louis to love again as well to eat human blood.

A Great Movie and A Brilliant Novel,"This is the only film so far that I have watched, and then read the book afterward. Going into this movie without even knowing it was based on a book, I thought it was fantastic. I thought the cast was well chosen, with the exception of Cruise. Not because of Rice's initial opinion that he wasn't right, but I didn't think he was right for the part and I still don't. I admit however, I don't know who else the role should have gone to and I think Cruise did a good job. I don't like that he is featured on the cover packaging either, because in my opinion the story is about Louis, not Lestat.The costume design was brilliant and the sets were incredible. Having now read the book, I think the screenplay was as good as it could be. There would be no way to include everything in the novel, but I found I could assign the visuals of the actors and sets when afterward reading the book. Having done this, I like the idea of not reading a book first, so as to find out details later and not being disappointed by seeing a film first. I am reading the book again right now, as well as those that follow in the ""Vampire Chronicles""; many of which I read after this one. If you read ""Interview With The Vampire"", you must read the ones that follow and there are 12 of them at this time.I did not give this a 10 because that is reserved for a film that would be considered spectacular, but this is as close as it comes to that.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not your typical Vampire genre film.,"Neil Jordan (''The Crying Game'', ''Mona Lisa'', ''The End of an Affair'') is a director who dares to experiment with new ideas and the result is more than often successful as any cinephile is able to recognize the visual beauty and overall aesthetic prowess of his movies. ''The Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles'' begins with a journalist (C. Slater) meeting a mysterious young man, Louis (B. Pitt), in a hotel room in order to conduct an interview for his newspaper. The interviewee claims that he is a vampire, a statement met with incredulity and an awry smile from the reporter who will soon discover that the man in front of him may be made of flesh and bones but he is not human. Louis needs to tell his story, how he became a vampire, who made him, the relationship between him and little Claudia (Kirsten Dunst in a very young age) as well as other vampires. The movie aspires to be a treatise on the nature of evil and the first half is overloaded by conversations made between Louis and Lestat (T. Cruise) who ponder on the fundamental questions of ethics. There is no doubt that the movie's dialogue is well-crafted but sometimes it seems contrived and serves no real purpose and that is the reason why my actual rating is closer to 3,5/5. Apart from that, ''Interview with the Vampire'' is a massive production characterized by high-quality standards and wonderful performances by an all-star cast. I generally detest vampire/zombie genre films and I'm constantly avoiding them. That movie though is an exception as it has a deeper, philosophical dimension questioning the notions of the good and the bad.

Watchable!,"Given the treatment vampires got in recent decades, turning them from horrible monsters to wet dream of every teenage girl wanting sensuality, powerful man and protection, I was expecting this movie to be barely watchable. Given that it also features Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and Antonio Banderas as handsome men women like, I was also expecting to puke at the every minute of this movie. But it isn't like that. It's bearable. It's overly melodramatic, yes, and it has sensuality, but it isn't even close to ""Twilight"" and ""Vampire Diaries"" type of stuff I expected. And it's good. I enjoyed watching it. However, day after, I asked myself: ""What did you watch?"" I haven't read the books, and I am aware that one whole hour of movie is missing, so maybe that would be better than this, but it still doesn't change the fact that this movie is what it is. A costumed charade with vampires and a little bit of philosophy about life and death and things.

"Provocative and bizarre, a guilty pleasure","Far from your typical vampire movie, this often-overlooked film about a 200-year-old vampire who comes across a curious writer is alternately engrossing, only occasionally plodding and overall quite entertaining. Performances here are quite extraordinary. Brad Pitt is extremely sympathetic in the role of Louis, an anguished but unyielding vampire who tries to come to grips with his past. Tom Cruise seems to be having the time of his life in this film as Lestat, the original vampire whom Louis first encounters in 1791 as a living human being. Kristen Dunst steals the film as the child vampire whom Louis and Lestat become guardians of.I have known about this film since it first came out. Although it certainly is not always easy to watch at first, it makes for a strange, diverting and eery film experience. Accusations of camp might arise in some instances, and that is in order. I personally don't care because this film which is now a quarter of a century old, holds up shockingly well. Highly recommended whether you love vampire films or not.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Unconventional, atmospheric and very well made","Neil Jordan's film version of Interview With The Vampire is simultaneously one of the most sumptuous and tedious visions of the affliction to ever hit cinema. On the one hand, it's an absolutely gorgeous, atmospheric and old worlde glance at two damned souls who carry out their macabre destiny with flair and vicious grace. I say tedious as some kind of bitter compliment, because no other film has quite captured the internal torture of eternity or the nocturnal gloom that must prevail over such an existence quite as well as this film has. It barely runs over two hours and we feel like we've been planted in front of the screen for years. Such is the dedication of director Jordan, a sneakily versatile gent who augments his stylistic and tonal approach to whatever material he is working with. The film is exciting and raises a pulse, but only on its terms, and for long periods of time we sit through languishing despair that no doubt adds to the mood, but exists to serve the psyches of our two leads, and dares the viewer to suffer alongside them. I have somewhat of a bone to pick with certain producers behind the scenes who no doubt had a forceful hand in the casting of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. You see, author Ann Rice had her heart set on a filmic version starring Rutger Hauer as Lestat, and Lance Henriksen as Louie. Now, Cruise and Pitt are at the utter opposite end of casting types in Hollywood, and while Jordan is never a guy to compromise or chase stars right off that bat, I am still sour when I think of the film we'll never see, starring two actors infinitely more fascinating and vampiric that Brad and Tom. Nevertheless, I have som much appreciation for the film that I can't take it too hard, and remain a steadfast fan. Pitt plays Louie, a depressed Louisiana plantation owner with nothing left, especially to lose. He meets roaming vampire Lestat (Cruise), who promptly turns him, and the two embark on a century spanning odyssey of nighttime escapades, thoroughly fraught with homoeroticism. It's isn't so much an organized narrative as it is a lengthy look at these two, trapped by their condition and making the bitter best of it. They meet others along the way, including Armand (a slinky Antonio Banderas), Santiago (Jordan regular Stephen Rhea, lively evil incarnate) and Claudia, a child who Louie turns. She's played by Kirsten Dunst in the best performance of the film. A young girl with the vampire curse thrust upon her at such an age, who mentally matures into a steely, furious woman trapped in the body of a ten year old. Not many actresses could succeed at that, but she is a spitfire little shryke who dominates every scene. All this is being retold by Louie to a 1990's journalist (Christian Slater) who morphs from bemused disbelief to cold terror, and eventual morbid fascination. It's a slog to get through, but an ornately beautiful one with some really bloody effects and the always terrific stewardship of Neil Jordan, whose films are never short of mesmerizing, whichever genre they fall into. A dark, dingy horror with lacy elegance at its core.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Even with some structural problems, it is still an unforgettable work of mystery and sensuality, bringing to the cinema this humanized figure of the creature of the night","Sensual and daring, Interview with the Vampire is one of the best films that approach the character we know, crosses a long tradition in the development of societies prior to our contemporary universe. ""Immortalized"" at the turn of the 19th century with the novel Dracula, by Bram Stoker, a work that we can say, was and still is the definitive version for such nocturnal, bloodthirsty monsters, associated with bats and known by the nobility as a social scale on which are inserted, in 1994, these figures won the movie screens in an overwhelming story by the standards expected of a movie with vampires. The basis for all of this was Anne Rice's novel of the same name, published previously, turned into a screenplay by the creator of the universe, written by Neil Jordan, filmmaker in great shape. Here, light is one of the only known enemies of these creatures that are dissociated from the semiotic clich√©s involving crucifixes, garlic, holy water and other elements of Catholic tradition.The plot begins with journalist Daniel Malloy (Christian Slater) looking for an interesting person to tell about his life story, and ends up finding one of the vampires who will guide the viewer through the entire narrative. In 1791, the vampire and protagonist Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), begins his story in New Orleans, in the state of Louisiana (USA), when the French had arrived in the new continent. With a sad beginning, he tells that he lost his daughter and his wife in childbirth, so he starts playing cards with death to see if he is lucky to find his loves.Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise) is his companion and responsible for bringing Louis to the vampire world. He is cultured, cold, has the ability to lure victims into his traps and likes to live in the luxuries that life can provide, always involved with successful people. Lestat tells that he was turned by a vampire when he was still living in Europe and accepts his new lifestyle with ease, unlike Louis. The vampire that completes the main trio is Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), a girl who was saved by Louis after witnessing her mother's death and not understanding that she would be alone. With a voracious hunger for blood, she is treated as the daughter of the duo, taking on Lestat's temperamental traits, but at the same time, with Louis' sensitivity. Delicate and unpredictable, she has followed the vampire duo for decades, deceiving her victims with her candor.The plot develops with the unexpected family strengthening their bonds and seeing the innocent Claudia become a vampire as cruel and thirsty as Lestat, but at the same time very sweet and affectionate with Louis, who projects a sense of fatherhood in her. At certain points we almost forget that it is all part of an interview, we are so immersed in the narrative. It is at this point that the plot addresses more controversial topics, because over time, the little vampire realizes that her body does not age, and even as an adult, she continues with her childish appearance. However, despite appearances, she begins to have a different affection for Louis, often calling him her lover.The allegory of vampirism being portrayed like other human feelings is very well crafted, like the book, and often causes even some discomfort. The clear attraction between vampires is treated with some subtlety, despite the sudden clear passion that Armand (Ant√¥nio Banderas) becomes clearer and more fundamental to the story at the end of the film. Although the book is much more sexual than the feature, nothing is lost in the intention and presentation of the intelligent lines that Anne Rice wrote. The writer herself, who fervently criticized before the film's release, was surprised and recognized at the end that Neil Jordan's work was really a masterpiece, very faithful to her book, and very well transferred to the screen.The melancholy tone present in the opening minutes, as the projection progresses, gives way to a discomfort, generally provoked by Lestat (Tom Cruise), without a doubt the most striking character of the work, who sometimes makes us laugh from his dark humor, sometimes it leaves us markedly astonished by its apparent lack of humanity. Rice's script, here, shows its true colors, putting in perfect opposition the figure of these two characters, Louis and Lestat - one struggles to keep his human side and the other to transform him into a full vampire. The chemistry between the two is palpable, creating a clear sensuality both between them and their victims. Interestingly, at no point do we have sex put on stage, the film builds on something more intimate, almost hormonal, like the constant ecstasy in the seconds before the first kiss.At the time, the work caused discomfort and discomfort in the author Anne Rice, who refused to imagine her Lestat lived by Tom Cruise. Originally, she intended to see Rutger Hauer in the role, but as the project took a while to get off the ground, Paul Verhoeven's favorite Dutch star got a little old and ended up being switched. The meeting between Cruise, who is so good in the film that it even caused Rice to send a letter apologizing for his unfriendly statements, and Brad Pitt was the most memorable crossover of that first half of the 1990s. At the time, the two actors "" vying for"" the title of greatest heartthrob in cinema. While Cruise plays one of the few villains of his career (although he can't get over the professional killer in Michael Mann's Collateral), Pitt plays the most human vampire ever heard of in the world. He regrets taking other people's lives and tries to maintain a diet based on rats, poodles, bats, pigeons and any other animal that comes his way.This hatred, passion that is shown on screen, then takes on a definitely disturbing character with the presence of the character Claudia (Kirsten Dunst). The girl, still in her childhood, is treated a priori as a daughter, but she soon gains a more complex character, becoming Louis' friend and lover. Kirsten Dunst, still eleven years old, impresses and gives incredible depth to the character. Her expression, when she first appears, becomes a distant memory and gains an evident aging as we progress through the narrative. ""Your age is marked by the look"" we are told by Louis' narration and, in fact, this occurs, making the vampire's anguish in never getting old even more solid - after all, we have reached the point where we really believe that there is a woman - past the thirty--in the body of a child.The relationship between her, Lestat and Louis is organically worked out by the script and we are given the definite feeling of having been together for years and years. The transition between each era is made clear by the memorable work of art, which marks each year through a precise choice of costumes, in addition to building dynamic, lively sets that perfectly portray the portrayed era. Vampires, in their physical appearance, in fact, never change, but their clothes serve as proof of the passage of years. In addition, art uses these changes in clothing to drive more discreet ellipses. At several points, we noticed an advance in days or hours only due to the difference in what the characters wear, requiring a redoubled attention from the spectator.In a daring way, the feature film manages to be visibly divided into three very distinct acts - New Orleans, Paris and New Orleans again - at times this narrative fragmentation ends up causing a certain fatigue and clearly the third act takes on a faster pace than the others. , as if there wasn't enough time left to finish the movie. For this reason, the work remains short of the original material, which, although substantially different, manages to establish a more fluid rhythm. In any case, this is not a very serious structural problem, but one that is indeed bothersome.The horror in Interview with the Vampire comes from some scares and the abundance of blood on the screens. The veteran vampire's death scene, for example, has a magnificent aesthetic beauty and is chilling at the same time. In addition, the special effects are surprising and also contribute to the action scenes being, even today, exciting. In addition, the sensuality in Interview with the Vampire also deviates from the norm, stimulating the viewers' homosexual libido. In this context, Tom Cruise's Lestat uses his seductive force to convince Brad Pitt's Louis, speaking very close to his ear, as Louis also later does with Antonio Banderas' Armand. And for the straight male audience, the ingredient is the beautiful victim of the Parisian play, who is completely naked when attacked by vampires. In this sequence, vampires pretend to be humans playing vampires in a morbid play, the ending of which features a naked woman to be murdered in front of an audience, who believe they are facing an incredibly realistic type of staging. ChillingInterview with Vampire marked us in its debut and continues with all its potency even decades after its first airing. It certainly lives up to its source material, ranking as one of the best vampire movies, which helped cement Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles into the popular imagination. Even with some structural problems, it is still an unforgettable work of mystery and sensuality, bringing to the cinema this humanized figure of the creature of the night. In the hands of a talentless director, Interview with the Vampire could have become an excessive spectacle of gratuitous violence and vulgarized ambiguous sexuality. It is not. And that's what makes it fascinating.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Well Themed and Cast Theatrical Experience,"Like poetry in motion, but with enough explanation to discern who, why and what is happening, 'Interview with the Vampire' is sophisticated pleasure, but with a grasp on the violence and horror enough to enjoy without the expected sickness from overuse of gore. In addition the locations and set designs are very convincing, and expert use of shadows increase immersion.Brad Pitt is passable for the most part; I would have preferred more energy and he comes across cold and lacking passion. Tom Cruise is far more approachable and intriguing as a controlling insecure villain.Personally I find the first half of the movie watchable but slow; choosing not to bring in new characters until halfway creates a certain slog. However the remainder of the film is fantastic and really unique.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
How awful? Very awful!,"The occasional good horror flick can make an interesting evening. Vampires are always fun. And hey, here we have some name stars: Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. And it all does come to-gether. To produce one of the most gawdawful, boring, nauseating, DUMB movies ever made. You can't make out what's happening because of the dark lighting and artsey dartsey camera work. You can't hear what's happening because when Pitt and Cruise aren't screaming their lines in anger, they're mumbling them. Okay, we all know that vampires drink blood. But a 90 minute vampire movie should offer a little meatier plot than an infinity of back to back vampire attacks. The stock of the company that makes fake blood must have jumped the week they filmed this epic/schlepic. Rarely has so much of it been shed, spilled, saved, sprayed, sucked, sipped and swallowed. Maybe if I tried watching it again while munching on some garlic....",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best novel to screen presentation I've ever seen,"I am a big Vampire Chronicles fan. Anne Rice has given us a wonderfully different view of the vampire...the vampire as the protagonist, the hero. I read each and every one of her books as soon as they came out. I was a little concerned when they announced that they were making a movie of the book.Then I heard that they were casting Tom Cruise as Lestat. Well, that was plain wrong to me...the brunette Cruise, playing the blonde Lestat? Then I heard the blonde Brad Pitt was going to play the dark haired Louis...again....wrong!!! I decided that I was going to see it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised when Tom Cruise brought Lestat to life just the way I pictured him. And Brad Pitt makes you care about Louis and what he has become.The rest of the cast was well done, too, with stand out performances from Kirsten Dunst as Claudia, and Antonio Banderas as Armand.This, plus the extraordinary cinematography and musical score make this movie a 9 for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant Drama - if you have any interest in vampires you must watch this!,"Interview with the Vampire is the epitome of modern vampire films (modern included to exclude Dracula, Nosferatu etc which would create a controversial debate!).Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles are the most important supernatural works of the last thirty years and must have inspired many of the new vampire/supernatural films that focus on character/action/drama rather than portraying them as fear objects in horrors.This film is a drama, not a horror, and anyone expecting a horror with chases or human victims to feel sorry for will be sadly disappointed. Yes, there is blood and feeding but it is the vampires you feel for.The three leads are incredible, Kirsten Dunst deserves special praise due to her age and anyone who says Tom Cruise can't act should see this film. Brad Pitt's Louis is just as whiney and annoying as he should be, but you understand this given the circumstances of his turning.It thoroughly involves you in the vampire world and displays how lonely and isolating it can be (yes, I know it's not real but you get the point).Here's hoping they film some more of Rice's novels (hopefully more in this vein than the slightly OTT Queen of the Damned) - I want to see Blood and Gold! (Memnoch would be brilliant but not sure if it could be pulled off)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great book Great movie,Just as the summary above it says this was a great movie. The actors all did a great job but Kristin did a fantastic one. She probably should have been nominated. Imagine how hard it is to still be in your teens but playing a role of that of an maturing vampire stuck in a child's body. Once again she did a fantastic job. Tom and Brad also did a great job also but that was to be expected. One thing I have to disagree with the other critics is the Antonio factor.I thought he did a good job in a limited part. And for people who haven't read the book Antonio gave a great adaptation of Armand. If they do make a sequel to this great movie I just hope they get the same actors. Unless they are planning for the sequel to flop as soon as it's released.,,Anonymous,Horror
A good portrayal of the elegantly decadent world of bloodsuckers and their prey.,"The cruel vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) flows through the years like a river of blood that keeps dreaming. When he so wishes, he grants his victims the gift of immortality, whether they want it or not, sucking their blood and also turning them into vampires. At the end of the 18th century, a mortal arrives in Lestat's world, devastated by the loss of his wife and his young daughter , this is Louis de Pointe (Brad Pitt). Louis is vampirised by Lestat who tempts him with a 11-year-old girl (Kirsten Dunst) who in turn becomes Pitt's company through the decades. As Lestat creates a very dysfunctional family but this doesn't tun out well. Two hundred years later, at the end of the 20th century, Louis decides to tell his story to a young reporter called Daniel Malloy (Christian Slater). Drink From Me And Live Forever !.Adaptation of a prestigious novel by Anne Rice and her 'Vampire Chronicles' series, with a brilliant recreation of the environments by production designer Dante Ferretti and wonderful interpretative work from the complete main and support cast. The first book in Anne Rice was 17-year movie project beset by controversy, including the casting of Tom Cruise who looks nothing Rice's description of the character, although Pitt does better, leading to an outcry among cult book's fans though Rice finally came around. A stilysh and very nasty horror movie, stuffed with more modern matinee idols than pints of blood. Neal Jordan, who had just directed ¬®The company of wolves¬® and ¬®Crying games¬®, made a very careful staging, in which the artistic direction matters as much as the literary adaptation itself. Some great make-up, gruesome special effects by Stan Winston and an orgy of blood-letting will compensate horror enthusiasts for the somewhat stately pace of piece. A terrific cast formed by the following ones: Tom Cruise as a sardonic and merciless vampire who fancies a companion, Brad Pitt is the bloodsucker with a human soul who's tired of life after death his loved beings ; Kirsten Durnst is the child-vampire and Antonio Banderas is a French vampire full of fair savoir and a very enveloping fascination. The role of the reporter is played by Christian Slater, after River Phoenix, the actor intended for the role, died in his youth due to dope. Followed by a TV series: Interview with the Vampire (2022- ) by Jonathan Ceniceroz with Jacob Anderson , Sam Reid, Eric Bogosian, Assad Zaman, among others.It displays a rousing and shocking musical score by Elliot Goldenthal. As well as as a colorful and shading cinematography by Philippe Rousselot. The motion picture was original and compellingly directed by Neil Jordan. Filmmaker Jordan brings some much needed to the dark mix along with some overdone gore and tons of blood. This great filmmaker has made splendid movies, such as : Mona Lisa , High Spirits , We're no Angels , The Crying Game , The Miracle , Interview with the Vampire, in Dreams, Michael Collins , The Butcher Boy , The Good Thief , The Brave One , Byzantium , among others . Rating : Better than average . Worthwhile watching . Essential and indispensable seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still a favorite after all these years,"I loved this movie when I was growing up, and that interest waned with the whole. Tom Cruise. Thing.Went back to rewatch it again recently, and it holds up. Atmospheric, dark and broody and sexy and well-told. The pacing is great, the music is great, it's wonderfully gay. The alterations it made to the book as well I thought were smart, and it's not often that a book-to-movie adaptation does this good of a job about it. Really just a delight to revisit.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tom Cruise: another amazing performance,"Very good movie. I would have given this a 7 if Tom Cruise hadn't nailed the part of Lestat. The book was much better but still this was a pretty good movie. Basically, this movie is about the life of the vampire Louis( Brad Pitt). This is not a hacker slasher movie, but more of struggle within movie. It strays away from the normal scary movies into a more chilling legacy. I personally enjoyed this movie a lot and would recommend it to anyone who wants something more out of a vampire movie then blood and vampire hunting. The only downside was Antonio banderas, who i thought was totally wrong for the part. Overall, probably one of the best vampire movies out there because it strays away from the normal themes of the others.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
More than vampires,"Anne Rice's tale of a vampire's struggle to accept himself for what he is puts a new twist on the vampire genre.  Usually the vampire is bad and there are limited ways to kill him.  In this movie however you don't want the vampire dead because Rice makes you sympathize with him.  Everyone must come to terms with what they are or are not and do whatever they can to compensate for it.  Louis, one of the main characters, must accept the fact that he is a killer.  He must also realize that the one person who can help him make his road to self discovery easier doesn't or can't help him. Watching all the obstacles arise and watching Louis confront them is very interesting and as a result I think this is a must see for all fans of horror movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not a bad film on it's own.,"I have been a big fan of anything involving vampires for a very long time. On its own, I really enjoyed this film. I liked the relationships as they were presented among the principal characters. Each one having their own fears about the immortal world they are forced to live in. However, I was a big fan of the book and there were a couple of changes that I thought were unnecessary, but I guess we don't have to dwell on that. Obviously, when Anne Rice wrote the script, she intended the film to stand on its own outside of the canon of her books. Fans of classic vampire films will like this movie because of its willingness to challenge the old fables about these creatures and create a realistic view of these ""preternatural"" beings.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cruise - The Worst Bloodsucker Of Them All,"For me - When it comes to the likes of vampire movies - I'd say that they can all easily be slotted into one of these 3 following categories - Good - Mediocre - Awful.And - With that said - I will give you just one guess as to which category I place ""Interview"".Without question - This dreadfully disappointing horror film's 2 biggest and 2 most damaging deficits were, of course, the total miscasting of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt into the story's all-important lead roles.It was especially the casting of Cruise (Mr. Zero-Charisma, himself) as the ""Lestat"" character that promptly brought ""Interview's"" potentially promising story down to an absolute dead halt.It seems that every time I see Cruise in any picture - I'm always left completely perplexed as to why the hell his vast popularity (and roles in big-budget productions) continues to prevail. 'Cause if there ever was a totally vacant, empty-headed, amateurish actor to successfully endure in Hollywood Heaven - Cruise would definitely be the one.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Brad Pitt was to die for (no pun intended) and made a fabulous Louis, and Antonio Banderas did a great job. But I'm sorry, Tom Cruise was a pathetic Lestat. His American-boy hot-rod attitude just didn't fit the role and the end with the Christian Slater thing just didn't click. The book was more descriptive and provided a better view of the vampire transformation.  My advice, read the book, see the movie, then make your judgement.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

VERY GOOD VAMPIRE MOVIE IN A DIFFERENT WAY OF MAKING,"In San Francisco, the journalist Daniel Malloy (Christian Slater) interviews in a hotel room a man called Louis (Brad Pitt) that claims to be a vampire. Louis tells that he was the owner of a plantation in New Orleans and happily married with a daughter. In 1791, he grieves the loss of his wife and daughter and has no wish to live anymore. Out of the blue, he meets the vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) that attacks him and asks Louis to choose whether her wants to die or to turn into a vampire. Louis accepts to be a vampire but is reluctant to kill humans, drinking animal blood to survive while Lestat feels pleasure in killing human. When Louis meets the girl Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), who has just lost her mother in an outbreak of plague in New Orleans, he does not resist and drinks her blood. Lestat turns Claudia into a vampire to keep Louis with him. Louis treats Claudia as a daughter while Lestat teaches her to be a killer. Years later, Claudia gives laudanum to kill Lestat and flees to Paris with Louis where they meet the vampires Armand (Antonio Banderas) and Santiago (Stephen Rea) that pose of actors in a theater with other vampires. But a tragic event changes the saga of Louis in Europe.'Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" is a Gothic film that discloses the saga of Louis, a vampire initially with human soul. His grief and pain for the loss of his wife and daughter; his transformation into a vampire and relationship with the Lestat; his love for the vampire girl Claudia; his wrath for the vampires in Paris; his return to New Orleans are told in a screenplay written by the author of the novel Anne Rice and directed by Neil Jordan. The changing of behavior of the immortals Louis and Lestat along the centuries is intriguing with the bon vivant Lestat losing his interest in life and Louis questioning the meaning of many things that he has experienced. The cinematography and the art direction are amazing and the haunting music score complete this good film. My vote is eight.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
interview with the vampire the vampire chronicles,"We all know that many movie based on vampires and their world expecely in modern day arent so good,thanks twilight.....but this film from 90s is a solid film and far better then the ones we are getting now,this movie is very good made with some great stars as pitt,cruise and banderas but dunst was for me the best part of a film since she was just a kid and she was able to give such great performance,story isnt so great but it had nice gothic vibe around it and it did at least made me to feel like i was in that world for two hours,some scenes were maybe to long and they werent so important to plot and some lines were to cliche and bookish but it was a solid made film which is big compliment since it is about vampires",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

But it wasn't as good as the book. I couldn't have picked a better Lestat myself. I adored Tom Cruise in this movie. His hair, his accent, his raw sexual energy! Ah! It makes me want to love him, and I usually hate his acting. Brad Pitt was ok as Louis, but his hair was the wrong color and his accent p***ed me off.

His performance as Louis is done with poise and precision.  As well, I am disappointed that Stephen Rea was not at least nominated for an Oscar.  What a wonderful talent she is.

Thank God for Tom Cruise,"I was beyond excited about this movie. Everyone I have talked to just loved it, which is understandable. However, the fact is - it is a vampire movie. It is lame in that respect. If you love vampires, this is the movie for you. If you're like me, I'm not a huge fan of them. Brad Pitt put forth a forgettable performance, but it did not hinder the plot in any way. On the contrary, Tom Cruise put down the performance of a lifetime. He never seems to have trouble capturing the exact core of his characters. He was funny, serious, dark, malicious, and haunting. Because of him, this movie was enjoyable for me. Also, Kirstin Dunst did a very fine job in this film. For such a young girl, it's surprising she did not win the Golden Globe she was nominated for.

It's About Temptation and Guilt,"Many people didn't like this film, because it is too dry and cerebral for most horror fans, and too much a horror film for most people who like thoughtful movies. I found the combination amazingly riveting and original.As Anne Rice said in the introduction to the film, ""It is about US."" Her vampires are symbolic of humans in general, but seen from a different vantage point. It is a story of temptation, guilt, shame and remorse. Louis is a vampire (that is, a sinner), he is repentant, he hates the fact that he is one, but nonetheless continues to be one. Like us, Louis wants to know what it is all about, how did this happen, is there a God, is there a devil? And he is always left with doubts.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sinusoidal,"This film is entirely full of ups and downs. While the performances by Bradd Pitt, Tom Cruise and Kirsten Dunst are incredible, the film on the whole, neutralizes itself to much less than greatness. At times the direction, lighting, script and acting lock in to be nothing less than masterful, and yet at other moments the camera angles are odd and all too ineffective, the script is weak, and almost impossible to act convincingly. The script at many points does a disservice to Pitt, who has absolutely nothing to work with, in scenes full of melodramatic dialogue. And yet there are other moments that lend themselves to a subtle beautiful portrayal. The same is unfortunately cast upon Cruise one time to often. Dunst however, is brilliant in her role as the immortalized child. However, for all it's great moments, there enough ridiculous ones, including the films ending, which is entirely out of place in direct contrast with the mood of the rest of the piece, that on the whole, the movie is mediocre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Casting is the problem,"Anne Rice's book, on which the movie is based, paints her characters with a finely detailed brush. This makes me think the casting director didn't read the book, because deciding that Brad Pitt, and even worse, Tom Cruise as Lestat, is disappointing. First, these characters would certainly have had heavy French accents when they speak English. Hearing Louis's words spoken in a flat Midwestern accent....aaarrgghh. Tom Cruise is simply unable to embody the centuries old mystery that is Lestat, who is supposed to be magnetically attractive, charismatic--not Jerry McGuire in an 1800s tuxedo, buffoonish and about as menacing as Forest Gump. There is nothing supernatural about him. This a role made for someone like Johhny Depp, a young Christopher Walken or Peter O'Toole, Joaquin Phoenix. Louis could've been more believably played by Daniel Day Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, even Bradley Cooper. Antonio Banderas could've shone in either role, rather than being wasted in a much smaller part. Kirsten Dunst holds her own as the woman trapped in her childlike body. In short, it's so difficult to get past these casting bombs that the entire movie loses its ability to pull us into the world Rice has so deftly created.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just Okay,"I watched this film with no preconception of what this film will be about (except for the obvious) or how good it is and I still somehow felt quite disappointed. As expected, it was a predictable Hollywood popcorn flick. It has its big stars and its pretty effects and that's about it.Though it was interesting how the gay subtext was tackled, other than that the film's script is beyond mediocre. I mean Pitt's role is not really salvageable. That character is beyond insufferable. On the other hand, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Cruise, in substantial roles, did their best to impress.Dunst left me with mixed feelings. She was impressive when she was playing as a youngster version of her role but as her character 'age', I did not see a change that I believe the character should have.Meanwhile, Tom Cruise was more impressive in his role. I mean he have the showiest role after all. It has the right amount of pizazz and motherly touch that his character imbued but it was nothing special.Overall, the film was just painfully OK and everything about leaves you wanting for more as nothing really leaves a big impression.

Superb...,This movie was incredible. Everything about it. I have read the book & watched the movie. I disagree with those of you who say it should have been left alone as a book. You can't look at it as the same thing (as with all movies adapted from a book).As for the hair... I agree that back in that time for a normal person to have the long hair it would have been absurd. These characters are not normal people. They do not walk about on the streets as other mortals. They hide in the shadows of buildings & etc. They try to keep there faces & paleness out of sight.

Great cinematography and good acting are only parts of this fantastic film,"I'm not one for book-adaptations, especially those of my favorites. I usually end up hating them for changing key things, and making my favorite characters act like total idiots. This movie is my exception. Everything about it is good, almost. It definitely doesn't get as much credit as it deserves. Of course, it is considered a cult movie a lot of the time, so many people are missing out on it.The story is about Louis, who is changed into a vampire after Lestat offers him immortality. To Louis, it sounds good at first, but after the years go by, he realizes that this is a life of hell. On their adventures, they meet up with Claudia, a little girl who Lestat, with the help of Louis, changes into a vampire. As the years go by, Claudia becomes wise beyond her years, and together with Louis, she plots to rid herself of Lestat. From there they continue on to Paris, where they meet the legendary vampire Armand, and his troupe of evil vampires.This is certainly one of the best performances of both Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise, as well as Kirsten Dunst. As for Antonio Banderes, his character is one of the gayest men I've ever seen, and there's time when you're watching it when you can't understand what he's saying. That would be my one complaint. The majority of the accents in this movie are terrible.The cinematography in this movie is extremely well-done, and adds to the mood. The acting is good in most parts, and the characters are well-developed.The downside of this movie is that there are parts that are extremely disturbing and bloody, but if you can manage to survive that, you will see how great of a movie this really is.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blahhhhhhhd,"The life of a vampire is entered into unwittingly, lasts forever and engenders an infinite yearning for release. After sitting through this movie, I think I know exactly how they feel. Eternal torment was never so glamorous: These supposedly loathsome demons get to live in opulent mansions, master classical piano and put on plays for jaded urbanites; no one ever calls the police, and someone else always cleans up the blood. As an wish fulfillment fantasy for folks who already believe their own lives are nothing but suffering, ""Interview"" serves; as entertainment for the non-self-loathing, it falls flat. And by ""flat,"" I mean flat -- as in, some of the flattest performances you'll ever encounter in a movie of this scale.

The Best Vampire Movie Ever,"If you have read Ann Rice's Chronicles, you would see that this is the most accurate movie based on her Chronicles . Actually, I have read the book after I have seen the movie and I was amazed by how accurate the film was. The only objection is that Armand should have looked younger, that is the way he is described throughout the Chronicles, but Banderas does a great job nevertheless impersonating the character (he is a great actor). Lestat is identical to what I imagined when I read the book, and he is pictured in the movie just as Louis described him : the shallow handsome blond blood sucking monster with no respect for anything that he worshiped and loved and feared. About Louis, he is perfect.Brad Pitt really outdone himself playing this role - the tormented, forever clenched onto his mortal soul,always unhappy vampire. But ""la piece de resistance"" is of course, Claudia - the beautiful vampire woman entrapped in a little girl's body for eternity.Louis's and Lestat's monster-daughter is a living (undead actually) work of art the way Kirsten Dunst plays her.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
How could A.Rice possibly have given her seal of approval?,"For those who have read Anne Rice's fabulous vampire tales, this cinematic interpretation is, to put it mildly, a great disappointment. Tom Cruise is simply too ""Hollywood glam"", the storyline is devoid of Anne Rice's literary charm, and neither the characters nor the events are faithful to her novel. Oddly enough, the exception is Brad Pitt as the pitiful, romantic Louis, and also the young actress who portrayed Claudia: that interpretation is impeccable! For those of you who haven't yet had the pleasure of reading Anne Rice, a piece of advice, save yourself the two hours and get your hands on the novel.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Doesn't Suck, But Has No Bite to It","Anne Rice is one of the few niche mainstream authors.  Her novels, be they on witches, mummies, or vampires, are captivating to the many who read them. To those like myself who for whatever reason don't read them, they are appreciated for their usually good writing, but are just not interesting. ""Interview with a Vampire"" shows that movies based on her books (she wrote the screenplay, so there's no question of it being true to the book) suffer for the same reason.Before anything else, its important to note that the leads, Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, give excellent performances, Pitt as the tortured vampire Louis who would rather drink the blood of rats than mortals, and Cruise as his loving-to-the-point-of-insanity companion Lestat, who cares about nothing, it seems, except Louis.  Though I never had any doubt about Pitt's acting abilities, this was the first ""good"" Cruise movie I've ever seen, though he's still a bit out there, even for his character (I didn't even recognize him the first time I saw the film).  The best performance comes from neither of those two though, but a young Kirsten Dunst as the young vampire Claudia, devious, spoiled, and angry, but at the same time lonely and confused.  Her precocious acting ability is amazing, and its a shame she has been in only a couple movies since where she gets an opportunity to challenge herself and give such a good performance again.  The characters are definitely not the problem with the story, as they are interesting characters to observe, particularly Lestat's almost homo-erotic dialogue in regards to his feelings for Louis and Claudia's questions and childish angry response to seeing a nude young woman and the developed body she will never have.Unfortunately, the plot is simply not as compelling as its characters.  It spans multiple eras, and accurately depicts those eras, however characters change and it never adequately explains when or why.  For example, about 30 years after the creation of Claudia, Louis scoffs and jokes about how he used to drink the blood of rats instead of people.  It never explains when or if there was a specific incident relating to Louis' sudden change in attitude, though all of the movie up to that point explicitly detailed how he didn't want to take human life.  Whether these plot holes are a fault of the original book or just the movie I don't know, but they were distracting enough to prevent me from really getting into the plot.  Calling it a plot might even be a bit of a stretch; similar to last year's blockbuster ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" (which I also disliked for this reason), it seems more like hours of character development than an actual coherent storyline.This is really a shame because, in all other aspects, the movie is REALLY well-done.  The atmosphere is terrific, and as mentioned earlier, the differences in eras are accurately depicted.  Gothic undertones prevail every setting, as locations are dark, but mysterious instead of horrifying. The score fits this mood perfectly, and there is some excellent cinematography and direction, such as the best scene in the movie, a performance of a group of ""stage-vampires"" (who of course are real vampires) that kidnap, strip, and drink the blood of a young woman as part of their totally unrealistic (does anyone really believe such an act, which would be controversial and probably banned today, could have taken place in 19th century Paris?) but eerily beautiful choreographed theatre act.""Interview with a Vampire"" is not a bad movie, its just not very compelling.  While its a beautiful thing to watch once, there's nothing that really grabs a viewer (aside from the vampire theatre performance and Kirsten Dunst) enough to make it a truly great and enduring film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bland film with only one noteworthy performance,"This movie is long, depressing, and I was waiting for it to end. Tom Cruise is disappointing as Lastat, and his adaptation was lame. This movie was good until the last 30 minutes. The only person I found convincing was Brad Pitt. He played Louis with so much conviction. You could feel the pain Louis was feeling.All in all though, it was a lame movie that keep going on and on and on. My sister rented the movie to watch, and she let me watch it first. When I told her what I thought of it, she returned it to the video store. Good move, sis.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
An excellent adaptation,"Overall one of the best vampire movies out there.I just have two complaints:First, Antonio Banderas is horribly miscast as Armand. The character in the novel was a red-haired teenager (~17 years old) of Russian origin with the face of a ""Botecelli angel"" who had spent hundreds of years in Rome prior to taking leadership of the Paris coven and the subsequent transformation of it into the Theatre de les Vampires. Maybe Neil Jordan just wanted a well-known playing the part? Making Armand into a tall, black-haired, menacing, Spaniard type with almost indecipherable speech at times due to a thick accent is beyond me. Maybe he wanted to make Armand more frightening in appearance, but that completely goes against one of Armand's chief weapons -- his disarming beauty that conveys a false sense of innocence that allows him to lie so effectively.Second, reading a previous comment I was stunned to learn that there's an hour more to this movie that has never been released. Someone **please** convince Neil Jordan to make a ""director's cut"" DVD!!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Based on the Novel by Anne Rice, about a Vampire who doesn't like killing humans.","Brill! One of the best vampire movies around! Tom Criuse is perfect in the role of Lestat, adding sarcastic and humorous comments through out the movie. Couldn't ask for a better Lestat! And Brad Pitt plays Louis very well, working beautifully along side Tom Criuse and, bless her, little Kristen Dunst who plays Claudia, Louis and Lestat's daughter. (or the demon child as i like to call her). Antonio Banderas as the legendary Armand works well, although the second book in the series 'The Vampire Lestat' would have been brilliant as a movie as it would bring through the relationship between Lestat and Armand more. 8/10.

"Not the meaning of life, but a gentle reminder to appreciate it","This movie did not have the meaning of necessarily. There is something in there. See, Louis was so grief stricken and bitter after the death of his wife and child that he hated life sought death. When he got what he asked for he was suffering because he wanted back all of those things that he took for granted while he was alive. When Armand said he could take away his last lingering regrets and suffering, Louis said that's all he had left and he would rather have that. And another scene that tells that Louis learned to appreciate all of those things is after they disposed of Lestat, he said while they were on the ship that he desperately wanted those. He wanted to see blue again. Then when he said he came back to New Orleans in 1988 he said that motion pictures helped him see the daylight and the colors that he took for granted, purples, oranges and ""my long lost blue"". He went from longing for death two hundred years before to just taking pleasure in being able to see the color blue. Think of all of those things we take for granted. People want to vacation on a beautiful tropic island, but look around and there are things of a different, but equal, beauty near where you live-no matter where you live. It's sad because Louis seemed like he would have been a nice man before the death of his wife and it's a shame it took immortal life and 200 years of killing and numbness for him to appreciate the life he had left after his wife died.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The time it is set in makes it super interesting. It's really fun to learn about the culture through watching the film.

"Decent watch, but not better than Twilight","1. Brad Pitt was awesome playing a vampire and I initially thought that I might end up liking him more as a vampire than Robert Pattinson in Twilight, but I think his potential was not fully utilized and in the end I still consider Robert Pattinson as the best vampire Hollywood has produced.2. Twilight's story (not franchise, even just first movie) was far better than this. I guess this movie took Claudia (Kristen) too far without any major contribution to the plot of the movie.3. It was not clear what Louis (Brad Pitt) really wanted during the whole movie. It was apparent that he was not in favor of human blood then there was nothing else apart from it.4. One area where movie totally lacked was ""excitement"". Some excitement not a big expectation in a vampire movie. I think that's where Twilight really did well.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ahead of it's Time,"Almost 30 years after it's release, you gain a greater admiration of a lot of films. Some don't hold up well. Mostly comedies because humor and the social climate evolves(devolves) in waves. Typically generationally. But with Interview, I think it's definitely been for the better. Hollywood threw the kitchen sink at this film. Put the two biggest leading men in a mature period piece about vampires?! That's an obvious hit now. Almost regardless of anything else. But Interview is long, episodic and sometimes tedious. I didn't care for Interview with the Vampire that much when I saw it early on.

Pitt is convincing as Louis and Dunst was an absolute surprise as Claudia!  Lesser marks for Cruise as the famous Lestat, but the overall performance wasn't bad.  Banderas is always good and was no disappointment here either, in the role of the mystical Armand.  Rhea rounds out the cast of ''bad'' vampires vs. ''good'', amid beautiful and at times stunning scenery, costumes, and fantastic music.  True to the novel (roughly speaking) minus a surprise ending.  Great theme song from Guns & Roses, to boot!  Nods from both Oscar and Golden Globe (especially for Dunst) were well deserved.  Buy the video, and don't count on a sequel.

Vampires have feelings too.,"This movie is the best Vampire movie out there. The characters have deepemotions, not unlike human beings, yet they are so different. They describethemselves as monsters. This movie plunges into the emotions experienced asa vampire and describes the bottomless void in the life of a vampire. This movie is much different from those other horror vampire movies because of this. These beings are not mindless monsters, but creatures, striving to be human, living with the terrible realization that they are evil.As far as the effects, excellent. The eyes are exactly as I imagined them from the book. (I love the whiteness of the skin with the blue veins showing as well.) The costumes, wonderful. Although I didn't live in the 19th century, I have read books and find that they look appropriate for the time. The sets, magnificent. In each new scene I feel that I myself am actually pulled into the world created by the movie.All in all, it is a great movie, though I didn't very well like the blood in some scenes. It seems that the vampires in the book were a little more careful with their feeding. Yes, the blood may have been too much in some parts. AndLestat. I would have loved to see more of the vampire Lestat. For example, in the Theatre of the Vampires, where was he?I really wish they had made a film of The Vampire Lestat.

The price for Immortality,"Interview with the Vampire Stars Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and Kirsten Dunst. In a Story about a vampire named Louis(Brad) who tells his life story to a reporter. Leading up to his meeting a Lestat the Vampire turns him and temptation him into a life of immortality. Only for Louis to reveal all the guilt and torment he has to endure. This might come off as kinda a turn-off to a lot of people it's not your traditional monster film in the sense that it's not just mindless killing for the sake of it, but it it does something different and creates a compelling story, behind it. As were giving a story of humanity while still mixing those horror elements. The relationship told between Louis and Lestat is truly investing, While the movie has Undertones when it comes to its sexuality THere's a Bromance at most between the two with them. Albeit is a very abusive and toxic relationship. Throughout the Film, Louis begins to question the price of being a Vampire the things he has to result to and trying to keep his humanity. This makes for a very interesting concept of having a Vampire who regrets his life and the effect he has on others. Tom Cruise as Lestat contradicts all of the themes as he's just more of this parasite who exploits and manipulates Louis and everyone around him. Such with Kirsten Dunst as this little girl that they meet later on and Lestat turns her to use her and to keep Louis under his control and you get this whole deep arc of her character as now she immortal but stuck in a 12-year-old body it takes its toll on her mentally as time passes. She begins to become more bitter and self-loathing in her life. Kirsten Dunst for being so young at the time adds some much weight to all her scenes and in every way should be commended for it. As tension grows between the three of them. It is a very Psychological Horror, to say the least, and overall it's Compelling while slow to grab you at first. It does grab and then move along never does it feel like the movie drag.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Vampires.....that's it?,"I am seriously confused with this film.On one hand it has an outstanding costume, makeup and set designs very accurate to the eras in which the films take place and coupled with very competent directing and cinematography it builds a unique dark atmosphere that places you in the heart of the story. The awesome score is very befitting of the movie and complements all of the above adding a gloomy, sinister layer to the movie experience.On the other hand the plot did not peek my interest at all. While I was moved at certain scenes, the plot overall was not gripping enough and it focused on one aspect of being Vampire which is the impartiality towards human suffering and their lust for blood.Pitt's impressive acting delivers this idea but aside from that there was not a lot going on and the dialogue is quite cryptic at times and cringey at others but solid overall.I guess all the good ratings and reviews are from fans who have read the book or people who love the vampire genre.Watch if:you will watch anything related to vampiresyou have read the booksyou like movies with a unique atmosphereyou are in love with Brad Pitt or Tom CruiseDon't watch if:you are expecting a gripping adventure/biographyyou don't like any form of gore or nudityyou think this movie will some sort of smart tight dialogue that grabs your attentionreally just don't watch it if you don't care about vampires this one will surely not change that.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

He was everything that Rice made him out to be and more.  Brad Pitt was good, though he did tend to whine at times, but Kirsten Dunst was perfect for the role of Claudia.

Jocks in Wigs,"Well, I'm late to the party. Mind you, it ain't the worst one I've been to, but I also don't understand the over-the-top love for this thing. The costumes and sets are admittedly sumptuous, in a Scorsese-type fashion. And its hard to hate New Orleans and Paris as settings for a vampire movie. However, we never lose the actors to the backdrop thanks in no small part to the scenery-chewing by Cruise (he really does give Nic Cage stiff competition in that department). Cruise's consistent intensity does play well against the sleep-walking Pitt does throughout the movie (he apparently HATED doing this film). And most defects here might have been over-looked were it not for the writing: The actors are never given much more than wooden lines from novelist-turned-scriptwriter Rice. It felt at times like a high school play with a really huge budget. Oh, and the ending blows.P. S., Cruise's wig (and Pitt's real, but Fabio-esque flowing top) is just plain silly.

Fortunately for the studio, at this time, Tom Cruise was at the height of his stardom following blockbusters such as Top Gun and Days of Thunder and dramas such as Rain Man and Born on the Fourth of July. Brad Pitt was a young , up and coming star as well. Audiences, particularly female flocked to see these two together in an action film. The film is entertaining for a short period of time(10 minutes, but it quickly becomes an endless montage of useless, emotionless action sequences and Cruise , Pitt and Antonio Banderas, who shows up randomly halfway through the film, saying bad dialog with slow, wannabe sexy expressions on their face. I won't spoil the ending, or any of the second half, but suffice to say, I was not particularly impressed. The film has no tragic or moral implications about what being a vampire is like.

Shealone gives a portrayal that is completely believable, and iscapable of eliciting an emotional response from the audience.There ARE good scenes and sequences in the film, particularlythe Paris vampires' non-theatre segments, but the film seems tojust throw each portion haphazardly into an alignment that seemsjarring to the over-all make-up of the picture as a whole.I thought the one, true moment of ingenuity in Vampire mythos thatRice provided, came in the way in which Louis finds he can onceagain watch a sunrise.

Nightmarish yet sad film about how eternal life and damnation is overrated and has pitfalls.,"During the late 18th century Louis (Brad Pitt) tragically loses his wife and child. He can't take the grief of losing them so sets out to make himself the target for murder. Unfortunately it's a vampire that accepts his invitation that of the monstrous Lestat. Lestat invites Louis to accompany him in the afterlife and with regret Louis accepts and endures Lestats murderous lifestyle but unlike most vampires. Louis has carried his emotions and regret with him.
The interview comes about when a reporter (Christian Slater) stumbles across Louis path and instead of making him a meal. Louis decides to give him the story about his unnaturally long life.
This isn't a horror story but more of a biography about a vampires sad afterlife and losses. I believe despite his great looks that Brad Pitt is 1 of hollywoods best and what an amazing performance by Tom Cruise as Lestat! He doesn't nearly fit the part but pulled it off so well. Kirsten Dunst is so incredibly great aswell as Cluadia. A vampire that was made too young and despite gathering the wisdom of a middle aged lady still keeps her child form. 1 of the best child performances that I have ever seen. That's what makes this such a great movie. Each actor has put in the hard work to make their parts great in this movie and you can't help but feel such sorrow for poor Louis despite being what we see as a monster. A must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Costume Showcase,"I'll have to say it.. some books just shouldn't be adapted. While I personally am a big fan of Rice's novel, I think it would have been far better to leave it alone and *not* turn it into this horrid movie, considering that it is, undoubtedly, a book that is very difficult to adapt.I find it sad that 11 years-old Kirsten Dunst could ""outact"" three men in their thirties. While Cruise at least has some strong parts in the film, Pitt obviously just walks through it sighing. His sullen performance, along with the really useless comments from the off were simply and painfully boring. Banderas, while in other films a rather good actor, could be left out completely in Interview. The only thing he did was confuse me. Other parts, like Stephen Rea's and Slater's weren't developed enough to add anything to the movie, and Pitt's sudden disappearance for half of the movie didn't leave a good impression on me either.Another thing that I felt was completely missing in this movie was the part of the victim. The only victims we were showed were either people that had no effect on the way the movie would take whatsoever, or villains, aristocrats that killed their former life partners and animals.And lastly, who was responsible for Pitt's and Banderas' horrible hair-do??",,Anonymous,Horror
A bit silly but also compelling and tragic...,"A film I have been meaning to get around to for decades, Interview With the Vampire follows a reporter (Christian Slater) who is interviewing a supposed vampire Louis (Brad Pitt) about his life. As Louis recounts his story, talking about time spent with Lestat (Tom Cruise) who made him a vampire, their turning of a young girl (Kirsten Dunst) to be their adopted vampire daughter and all the drama, betrayal and death that follows... the reporter begins to get drawn into this story far more than he bargained for...I wasn't sure about this at first, it all seemed to be pompous and dramatic at the beginning, playing almost like theatre... but once it settled and got going it was fairly entertaining. I like the gritty atmosphere and the larger than life characters, and you really feel for Brad Pitt's character as you see his life go from one disaster to the next. Tom Cruise puts in a great performance as Lestat, and I must say that Kirsten Dunst playing a child growing up into a woman mentally, but not physically was quite the feat for a child actor. The tragic story was interesting, and even though it was a bit melodramatic in places, I'd say it's worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interview With The Vampire lusciously sinks its broody fangs into your mind.,"Having not read Rice's novel (and never will), I was expecting a straightforward vampire flick involving teeth biting, vaporisation by sunlight and plentiful scenes of smouldering. Whilst these are all included, the luxurious gothic horror period aesthetic appeal elevated the atmospheric narrative substantially, setting a rather high bar. Chronicling the immortal life of Louis who was turned into a vampire by the devilishly suave Lestat, where his new abilities are slowly viewed as a curse. The unconventional narrative structure is what truly differentiates this film, as the story is told through an interview-like narration. This naturally enables foreshadowing and finer details to be illustrated in a more contemporary method, and it works beautifully. Vampirism is positively viewed by Lestat who relishes in immortality and has come to terms with his curse. Conversely, Louis clings onto his humanity and despises the process of human feeding. The opposition and differing personalities allows drama, humour and tension to arise throughout the story, creating a well-rounded film. However underneath the regal costumes and grandiose musical score, are thematically powered elements that give life to this undead story. From an ambiguous relationship between Lestat and Louis to questioning existentialism and mortality. These strands thicken the blood-soaked narrative adequately. Casting was a surprise. Pitt carried the film with his broodiness and a young Dunst was exceptional. Yet it was Cruise that astonished me. I just didn't expect him in this role, and whilst it did take me a while to warm to him, I thought he was excellent. Arguably the first half is greater than the second half, with Rea and Banderas' characters feeling underdeveloped, and the concluding three minutes were far too convenient. But director Jordan has crafted a bloody divine adaptation filled with luscious authenticity and superb performances that I just want to sink my teeth into. Turn me now, Lestat!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Film but Pitt/ Cruise Were Miscast,"This film is perfect in every way except for the casting of Pitt, Cruise, and Dunst. Cruise and Pitt just aren't right for the parts. They look idiotic with long hair and fangs. There are so many lesser known actors that would have excelled in these roles had they been afforded the opportunity. Why are so many people so impressed with Pitt and Cruise? I just don't get it. They ruin this film. Kirsten Dunst ruins the role of the young girl vampire, coming off as more of a stupid brat, than a creature of the night. A wonderful film ruined by three average actors with pretty faces and Hollywood ticket office power. I did however still give it six stars. So if your mad at me for this rating, you need to get over your crush with Tom and Brad. Their cute airheads with average acting talent.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It failed.,"A LITTLE SPOIL cause film is hollow and if I want to tell anything about it I would tell you whole film.I was expecting something good out of this film cause I heard so much about it and cast is great. But, it failed. It was most of the time boring. And for the first half of the movie I get sick of that blood sucking crap. Film is a mess has huge hole in the script. Story goes well in first 1/3 of the film then falls apart and start circling around same thing again and again. I mean if the point and center of this script is mistake made when young girl turned in vampire, then you should skip this one. Maybe you should see it because of great acting first by Kirsten Dunst, young Kirsten Dunst. She is great, her best role till now. She can eat Brad Pitt for breakfast. I didn't know age difference between her an Cruise, Pitt - its so big. She is a proof that young movie star can have great adult acting career. And I think this is best performance by Tom Cruise till now (even better then Magnolia). While Pitt and Banderas were too cold and bad in this one (if they ever were good). Like I said, it failed for me, so I gave it 5/10. Thanks for reading.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mesmerizing!,"What can I say? This was an amazing movie. A magical story, the creator has a wonderful imagination with vampires: how you become a vampire, whether vampires hate or love being what they are...Kirsten Dunst was incredible. Playing Claudia, a child vampire, she was a great actor...she must have been ten years old. A lot of the dialog was the same as in the book, which I like; I hate it when the book is completely different from the movie. Actually, some of it was different: in the book, the reporter was just a boy, probably nineteen, but in the movie...probably thirty. But that's all right. The fact is, the story was completely impressive. All in all, I loved it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Heartbreaking but beautiful,"I have to say this is the best vampire movie I have seen. Not as good as the book, though. But i don't hold it against it. The book is always better so this isn't a reason not to like it even if you have read it.The cast was excellent. I can't believe how Lestat was Tom Cruise. Kirsten Dunst and Brad Pitt were marvelous Louis and Claudia.This is the shorter, simpler version, of course. You don't get much of it. If you want depth, the story at its wholesome, stick with the book. I ask you not to decide if you are going to read it based on the film because they are very different.However, this is about the film itself. It's a romantic, Gothic tale of love, passion and looking for life's meaning. Of course the ""life"" seen trough vampires's eyes. I liked it. It was a good adaptation of Anne Rice' 100 percent AMAZING novel. Still, if it's important to you to be as good as the book itself, you shouldn't watch it. I myself watched it out of curiosity and i thought it was all right. I hope you enjoy it too.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Overrated, chick-flickey and weird.","I was suckered into renting this because it looked like a horror. Boy was I wrong. I haven't read any of Anne Rice's books, and after the before-the-movie featurette where she told us that she has never been happier with a movie, I don't think I'm ever gonna. This movie is a homo-erotic, romantic chick-flick that happens to have fangs. It's definatley one for the girls- more hunky actors that my sister likes than you can shake a stick at, and not nearly enough bloodletting. Antonio Banderas is a bad-ass as always, unfortunatley he is criminally underused (his name is there on the box, I spent the first 2/3's of the movie thinking ""To blazes with this chick-flickery, when's Antonio going to arrive on the scene?"") and Kirsten Dunst is surprisingly good as a little kid vampire (h er performance was actually stonger than Cruise's and Pitt's). I don't think I'd reccomend this movie to anyone who isn't a 12-14 year old female gothic poet wannabe.",,Anonymous,Horror
wow....,"This is not the best film ever, but vampires have never looked so good!!Brad Pitt looks a bit odd, though, and I reckon a short 'do suits him better.Tom Cruise portrays the evil one perfectly, and it's nice to see the very young Kirsten Dunst.

Death is no respecter of age.,"Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles is directed by Neil Jordan and written by Anne Rice (novel & screenplay). It stars Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, Kirsten Dunst, Stephen Rea and Christian Slater. Music is by Elliot Goldenthal and cinematography by Philippe Rousselot.Modern day San Francisco and reporter Daniel Malloy (Slater) is interviewing a man named Louis de Pointe du Lac, who claims to be a centuries old vampire¬Ö¬Ö..Monstrous!It's a completely different vampire movie! Certainly it's not conventional, this is told from the vampire's point of view, we the audience are observing the lifestyle of the undead, hey they have issues and angst too. It's a wonderfully dreamy, visually stunning, movie, the pace is, shall we say, sedate? And it's very rarely scary. However, it's a film that pays dividends on repeat viewings once there's an awareness of what type of film it is. This can be said of the casting as well, where two of Hollywood's then biggest stars, Cruise and Pitt, sprout fangs, wear make up, suck blood and ponce about like dandy fops. It's only really on repeat viewings that it proves to be astute casting, especially Cruise, who not only didn't have the trust of story creator Anne Rice, but many of his hardened fans were casting doubts on him playing such a role. Rice, upon viewing the finished film, and after wanting Julian Sands for the role of Lestat de Lioncourt, ate humble pie and wrote Cruise a letter of apology and praise of his performance.I've drained you to the point of death. If I leave you here, you die. Or you can be young always, my friend, as we are now, but you must tell me: will you come or no?Jordan was a great choice of director, his work on the fantasy/fairytale/nightmare that is The Company of Wolves made him the ideal choice. Here armed with about fifty five more million dollars! Jordan crafts a near homo-erotic tale and surrounds it with Gothic splendour. The money didn't just go on the cast, the set designs are sights for sore eyes, from period houses to underground catacombs, the production design is first rate and was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for Art Direction/Set Decoration (it lost out to The Madness of King George). As a story the film remains interesting because new characters are introduced into the undead world and that brings about in-fighting and shifts in tone. Thankfully the two most important characters in this factor get fine performances from the actors, firstly young Kirsten Dunst dominates her scenes like an old pro, no surprise that it would prove to be a career starter for her that shows no sign of coming to a close. And secondly is Antonio Banderas, who is utterly beguiling and elegant as the leader of a Paris vampire troupe. Elsewhere, Rea makes an effective top hatted vampire luvvy, and Slater (stepping in when River Phoenix sadly died) competently portrays the ""in awe"" reporter for the present day scenes.The lavish visuals do tend to lend the film towards being style over substance, particularly as the film is 15/20 minutes too long. But it remains a fascinating flip-flop of a vampire movie, and one that's expertly acted as well. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A classic vampire tale...,"The 1994 movie ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"", from writer Anne Rice and director Neil Jordan, is definitely a vampire classic. And oddly enough, I think I've only seen the movie three or four times over the years, and thus opted to revisit the movie again here in 2023, as I had the opportunity to do so.The storyline in ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"", as written by Anne Rice, is definitely a well-written and well-told story. It is one that draws in the audience and introduces some very well-rounded and detailed characters in an equally detailed setting. And that is what makes ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" such a watchable and enjoyable movie.Of course, the impressive cast ensemble also does help to improve the viewing experience. They definitely had an all-star cast ensemble for this 1994 movie, with strong performances from the likes of Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas, Kirsten Dunst and Christian Slater. And not to forget all the rest of the cast, because they definitely also put on good performances.Visually then ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" is good, the wardrobe, props and make-up departments really worked marvels on the movie, as the ages progressed throughout the course of the narrative.If you enjoy vampire-themed movies then the 1994 movie ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" is one that you most certainly should be well-familiar with. If you haven't already seen the movie, then you definitely should get to do so.My rating of ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Before Buffy,"24 November 2009. Before Buffy the Vampire Slayer or perhaps more pertinent, before Angel, there was Brad Pitt, a creole who became a vampire who shunned his new nature derived from Lestat played by Tom Cruise. This dark look at the undertones of raw and gritty vampirism put flesh to the undead without the luxurious trappings of modernity and romance. Instead there is the bittersweet of trust, disloyality, of evil and even love. This Hannibal Lector dichotomy is well captured by Tom Cruise and the curse of the undead is lived by Brad Pitt along with the young actress Kirsten Dunst who may have been the most intriguing character of all. A well-paced and psychologically penetrating family drama of the occult kind. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Near-flawless,"This is exactly what Chronicles fans should want of a screen adaptation: near-flawless, its few issues too mild to spoil plenty of great acting, superior cinematography and a script that totally captures the essence of the source material and its protagonists, leaving or changing nothing of consequence.Tom Cruise mightn't be a great actor, but he always took his job seriously, and none proves it best than this, I sincerely believe his finest performance -and Anne Rice must've agreed, given her famous turnabout on him. Lestat's complex persona is all there: mercurial, expansive, narcissistic, often cruel and, for all his fledglings cared to see, also shallow, amoral and even unwise -except when, surprisingly, he chose not to be.Brad Pitt does a good job as the brooding, often distressed Louis, but on occasion he lets affectation creep into his performance -oddly, to make the rather unnecessary point of being otherworldly. Kirsten Dunst, all of 10, portrays the mind of a woman in her 70s even more realistically than the 5 years old child she starts as. As for Banderas, I don't care that he looked too old (Armand's origins aren't explored here, so there's no need to stick to that detail). What he's asked to do -a 400 years old vampire who's ultimately far needier than those who seek him-, he does it well. Stephen Rea was the only one I really didn't like -a pity, as I like the actor a lot, but his performance was so over the top, it came across as clownish and dumb; plus, no offense, but amidst a cast of almost uniformly gorgeous people, he stood out like a sore.The production values are top-notch, from the cinematography to the decoration and effects, the music immediately establishing the eerie mood. The vampire makeup is excellent -one thing I noticed is that, despite the heavy use of contact lenses, hardly ever do you notice the awkward ""cross-eyed"" effect when these displace; they must've taken great care to avoid this.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Highly interesting film from the vampire's point of view, I rate it ""7"" of 10.","This film is based on the novel by my good friend Anne Rice. And the book was actually based on a short story she wrote back in her college days. Anne, if you are reading this, I only give it ""7"" because it is not the kind of movie I want to see twice, however I admire the script you wrote. You did it in an overall ""comedy"" style and it works well that way.  Although I suppose we need to call it a ""dark comedy"" because of the subject matter and all the people who die such horrible deaths.Big stars Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas are vampires. Pitt is a ""sensitive"" vampire and feels badly that he has to live his life killing people by draining their blood so that he can stay alive. Or rats and chickens when humans aren't convenient. Cruise is just the opposite, and eventually they clash. One of the victims is the mother of Kirsten Dunst's character, and the 12-yr-old is ""injected"" and she becomes a vampire also. The film covers approx. 200 years of Pitt's vampire life, as it is being told to Christian Slater, thus the ""interview"" in the film's title. Most of the ""flashback"" is in Rice's hometown, NewOrleans, from about 1790 to the 1990s. But some of it also is set in Paris as Pitt's character travels the world to find others like himself.I'm glad I saw this film, and it held my interest. Still, it is not my favorite kind of film. Kirsten Dunst was wonderful as the mini-vampire, a role much better suited to her talents then the current ""Bring It On"" where she plays a teenage cheerleader.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Draining, pun intended","After losing his wife and child, Louis(Pitt, a far too reactive(as opposed to one who takes charge, and causes things to happen... he just goes with what occurs), and thus uninteresting lead) risks everything, and is found and turned by old vampire(and the ways thereof are endowed with the eroticism seen in other takes on this mythical creature) Lestat(Cruise, looking somewhat less effeminate than he does in Legend with golden locks), who laughs at the formers attempts to maintain his humanity, refusing to kill to feed(going after rats and poodles instead). One night, they turn a pre-teen girl, Claudia(Dunst, in her best performance this side of Melancholia... stunning), who threatens their peaceful coexistence(they're actually not unlike an old married couple, with constant bickering) upside down, with her lack of discipline and eventual yearning to grow up, to develop into a woman. I've now tried to watch this a few times, and each time the same thing happens: around the middle, I stop caring. Is it that the latter half is less compelling than the first? I really don't believe so. That's actually when stuff goes down. It's just too Gothic and vague(I can barely describe the characters so that one can tell them apart) for my tastes, and that doesn't mean that it will be for everyone. And don't get me wrong, this is a brilliantly acted piece. I couldn't point you to anyone in this who does less than excellent(the one who comes closest might be Slater... don't worry, he's not in it much). It's filmed and edited gorgeously. There are some deep, inspired notions explored through the seemingly endless life(at least 200 years, as is revealed very early on), the eternal youth, and the flirtation between life and death, from both those who have been bitten and those who have not. I haven't read the novel(or any other Rice), and can draw no comparisons. There is a lot of bloody, disturbing, brutal and violent content, some strong sexuality and a little full female nudity in this. I recommend this to anyone who wants a mature look at the nocturnal dweller. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Be prepared for vampires who are real creatures,"Neither did I read Anne Rice's book, nor am I familiar with movies about vampires.Anyway I'd like to comment on this movie which is still beautiful in all its ugliness and sort of disturbing in all its beauty. I hate vampires only supposed to look like horrifying monsters (like those from ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", which I haven't seen), that is trash! These vampires instead - whatever a vampire may be - are real creatures, they feel love and hate, they are powerful and dumb, they try to enjoy themselves and they are desperate. Desperately seeking for the meaning of it all - which isn't there. The movie doesn't make sense - but the way these vampires live and the way they fail to cope with their bizarre existence makes sense.Brad Pitt is appropriate in the lead, but the really good actors here are Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst and Stephen Rea.Someone else already objected to Brad Pitt's and Antonio Banderas' hair. So do I. There are scenes when Brad Pitt looks like an ugly woman. But Tom Cruise's make-up is great, remember the scene when Claudia and Louis are leaving for Europe and Lestat returns and plays the piano. His make-up is emphasizing his voice in a fascinating way. Kirsten Dunst's make-up is great as well, but it's scary since it really makes her look like a doll. The scene when she freaks out and tries to cut her hair is unpleasantly eerie.However, her performance is amazing. This 11-years-old girl is an even younger child and she is old, she is loving, she is evil, she is ""avant-garde"", her facial acting is terrific. I'm glad she was at least nominated for a Golden Globe.Tom Cruise's Lestat is not a villain as far as I can see. He is a vampire who enjoys being one. And in the movie he is even funny in a macabre way, especially when he ""makes"" Claudia and talks about ""one happy family"".The relationship of Claudia and Louis is very sweet, isn't it? The only scene which actually disgusts me is when Louis takes revenge on Santiago and the other vampires, it's nothing but brutal and ugly. And I don't like the frightening music that suddenly comes up several times - it just doesn't fit to the movie's basic tone. I voted 8 out of 10.Check it out, but be prepared: It's a world apart - and any search for the meaning of this world will be desperate.Oh... and if you mind, be prepared to the slight but not deniable homo-erotic tendencies of Lestat, Armand and even Louis. And still there is one thing I forgot: Great buildings!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The most realistic vampire movie ever made.,"It of course sounds like a silly statement, calling this movie the most realistic vampire ever made, since its very safe to assume that vampires never really excited at all. But that's not what I mean by calling this movie realistic. I mean that it's detailed, it concentrates on the issues what it means to be a vampire, what will it do to you, what's the purpose, how to handle the immortality etcetera. It's far from your average every day vampire movie. It's stylish, detailed and full of deeper meanings and therefor provides us a realistic view at what it means to be a vampire.The movie tells the epic tale of the vampire Louis (Brad Pitt). A vampire who still has a sense of decency and remorse, much to the annoyance of his 'maker' Lestat (Tom Cruise). Louis is full of questions by which he is torn- and that he wants answered. What follows is a realistic view in the world of vampires. It takes us to the sensual, almost erotic like, world of vampires but also shows us the dark and less pleasant side of the vampire world.Above all ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" is a very stylish made movie. The movie looks beautiful with nice looking sets and period costumes. Despite being full of deeper meanings and long, poetic like conversations, it yet still always manages to be interesting, as well as at times exciting.What makes the story definitely work are the fine actors that portray the characters. We see Tom Cruise in a role we don't see him often enough in; that of a villainous character. He plays his character with style and delivers an unforgettable performance. He makes the character Lestat one of the best and most memorable vampires, next to father of all vampire. Dracula himself. I'm quite surprised that he didn't even got an Oscar-nod at least for his role. Also impressive was Kirsten Dunst in an early role. Also she, plays one of her best roles out of her career, at the age of 12. Other fine well known actors in this movie are Brad Pitt, Christian Slater, Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea, who is a very underrated and underused actor in my opinion.The beautiful Oscar nominated music is from Elliot Goldenthal, who unfortunately doesn't that often compose more scores like this one.A vampire movie that doesn't concentrate on the formulaic stereotypical vampire movie elements but instead chooses a realistic approach with deeper meanings.

I enjoyed the acting from the leads to the smaller parts, but the acting honors go to Kirsten Dunst.  As a beautiful young girl who is robbed of her youth by a vampire, she lashes back at her attackers with a passion that was beautiful to behold. Tom and Brad are sometimes very funny and seem like an actual male couple, especially when they are bickering or Tom is teasing him.  The movie has more to say about life today than I would have thought possible, and gives the viewer much to think about when its over.  The fantastic sets, costumes and soundtrack work together to make this a complete package.  You are even smiling when its over!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
( American B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10,"The best vampire film! A particularly fun and enticing vampire film, Interview with the Vampire really explores the depths of sorrow and loneliness one might feel if they were immortal. Brad Pitt is so empathetic and passionate, you cannot help but feel for his character. Tom Cruise is charming, but devilish. He is irresistibly fun and intriguing. Kirsten Dunst is so sweet and well ranged in this early role of hers, it's impressive. Interview with the Vampire is touching, funny, sweet, horrifying, and charming all at once. It's a well versed tale that you will not want to miss. Check it out!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Maybe the best film about vampires ever.,"As we all know, almost all the movies about vampires are all very similar: A couple of ""slayers"" trying to kill some bad vampires. This movie is completely different, it's not a film full of gory scenes and lots of fighting between humans and vampires. It's all about a vampire who tells his life story (the whole two hundred years he has been a vampire), and is this fact the one who made me like this movie more than any other vampires movie.The acting was very good, with a remarkable performance by Kirsten Dunst. It makes me sad to see the lack of recognition that Dunst got. Considering she was only 11 years old when she made this film, her acting is great. Her facial movements are at all time good, and the way she said her dialogs made it look almost real. Tom Cruise got everyone's attention with his performance, even though Brad Pitt did a great job.The make-up was fantastic (nothing is fantastic actually, but this make-up was close to it). The only think that wasn't very good was Louis' (Pitt) hair in certain scenes, and Armand's (Banderas) hair also, which, in my opinion, looked awful. Lestat's (Cruise) outfit was excellent, and his golden hair looked better than Pitt's.The color of the eyes that both Cruise and Pitt had made them look more real, and I really enjoyed the fact that the vampires in this movie looked just like normal people, there was no way of noticing any difference, and in this film the vampires kill their victims where nobody can see them. In other films the vampires just arrive to a place where they start killing people for fun and everybody can see that (that is how the ""slayers"" always get there and end up killing every vampire on the scene).The film's script was great. The idea of putting some much images from the past, and so little from the present was good.This film breaks some of the rules in vampire movies. How did Louis killed all the vampires in Paris? Using fire? Who would have thought that was possible. Then Claudia ""killed"" Lestat by cutting his throat after he drank dead blood? And then Lestat ""died"" again burned? In old vampire films this methods didn't work.As Armand said, Louis was a vampire with a human soul. He felt guilty after killing a human, and for a long time he was surviving by eating rats and other animals. But with Lestat's influence Louis became just a bit more aggressive, I mean, he cared less to kill a person. Lestat tried to teach Louis all he knew, I believe, and he wasn't happy after watching Louis refusing to kill humans.I don't like the fact that Louis ended up not liking Lestat. He had a chance to help him, in 1988, but he did nothing. Well, at least at the end Lestat became the 'old' Lestat again, and he would do to Christian Slater (person who taped Louis' story) the same thing he did to Louis about 200 years earlier.I rated this movie with a 9 out of 10, it's pretty good, and as I said, a bit different from every vampire movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A certain type of audience,"If you enjoy dark, angsty, well-dressed, Gothic homoerotic vampire movies then you will probably like 'Interview With A Vampire'. I don't think this was a bad movie at all, but I was expecting more given the current 7.6 rating and good reviews. It didn't seem very original and had little true substance beneath the good performances given by Brad Pitt and, especially, Kirsten Dunst. It felt like it could've been very good if it had been more subtle with it's messages and spent more time on real character development. No one in this movie seemed like real people and behaved very unrealistically. They are so dramatic they aren't relatable anymore. I get this is a vampire movie, but still. I can't say exactly what my problem with this movie is, but it might be that it simply isn't my kind of film. Good movies are, in my opinion, supposed to have more to them than this. I haven't read the book, but I stand by my first description. Dark, angsty, Gothic, and homoerotic. That's about it. (But Kirsten Dunst was very good. Watch it for her)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
vampire angst,"This movie is depraved and decadent, opulent and over-the-top.

Not Very Good,"On the upside, the costumes and sets were outstanding. However, the movie itself was generally boring and bordered on dumb!

A flawed masterpiece; one of the most intriguing horror films in history,"First of all, I want to say that before seeing the film, you should read the novel.  I can almost guarantee that those of you who have not read Anne Rice's brilliant novel ""Interview with the Vampire"" will have a much lesser opinion of the film.Second, if you are an Anne Rice fan (such as I) or have simply read the novel (and liked it), you shall love this film.  Read on, for I shall tell you why.For the most part, the film stays quite faithful to the novel from which it was based; however, some of the key elements (including a suspenseful encounter with a mindless vampire) have been edited out.  Elliot Goldenthal has made an excellent score that fits the film perfectly.  One of the most impressive points of the film is it's production design (by Dante Ferretti), an addition which beautifully captures the three centuries the film travels through and creates the dark, eerie mood of the film. Then, there's the matter of the cast.  Tom Cruise gives a surprisingly good Lestat (the only downside to his performance is his failed accent), Brad Pitt gives a great Louis, and Kirsten Dunst is the ultimate Claudia.  Antonio Banderas is also an excellent Armand and Stephen Rea and unforgettable Santiago.The cinematography (by Philippe Rousselot) is another great addition, from the dark opening scenes in present day San Francisco to the final scenes in Daniel Malloy's car.All in all, it's a great adaption of Rice's novel; a flawed masterpiece and one of the most intriguing horror films in history - it's a lot of fun seeing the horror from the vampire's point of view.  Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome,This Movie Was Awesome That's Coming From A Tom Cruise Fan I Really Enjoyed This Movie It Was A Lot Of Fun,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tom Cruise,"I hate Tom Cruise as an actor. He is not sexually attractive whatsoever to me but amazingly he is beyond gorgeous as a vampire and is perfect for Lestat although the man that plays Lestat in Queen of the Damned is way hotter. I thought it was sick how Lestat (tom cruise)and Armand (antonio Banderas) came on to Louis (Brad Pit). Gay vampire love is not very appealing to me. though most of the movies Tom Cruise acts in are to say the least horrible especially having him in them, but Interview with a vampire is a wonderful movie that I would buy and see over and over and over again. I would recommend this to any of my friends especially vampire lovers and I am positive that they would enjoy it as much as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I can say many good things about this film, but also a few bad as well.","Interview With the Vampire is one of the most breathtaking films I've ever seen. The casting was extraordinary, and the plot was truly beautiful in every way. This movie so wonderfully depicts the most intimate emotions of a vampire; the wonder felt when seeing the last sunrise before your demise, the misery felt when a loved one passes away. The dark, grim music only added to the vampire theme, making it swell. The scene where Louis is so greedily feeding from Lestat's arm, and the look of total fulfillment in his eyes is lingering. When Lestat plays the piano, I could hear the music echoing through my mind, and pulsing through my veins. The haunting sound flows, rushing, almost striking me with fear. Ah, Claudia, the little vampire child, so beautiful. She was the very definition of a woman trapped forever in the body of an innocent child. Louis, the man that had forsaken his mortality because of his mourning over his deceased wife and child. This move was terrific!!",,Anonymous,Horror
A decent drama,"To be honest, I was not even 1% interested in this movie. As I had nothing to watch, I decided to give this movie a try out of curiosity. The movie was a decent drama thriller for me. It was neither great nor bad. The story was simple and average, nothing great in it; the screenplay was too uneven, it fails to keep you engaged at many places; the direction was was loose and the performances were okay. In other words, everything in this movie ranged from average to below average.Overall, I might not recommend this movie to anyone as I didn't fell anything special in this movie and it doesn't have anything to engage you.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Such a great movie!,"The first time I saw this movie I was speechless. Its incredible. If you think you'd never be able to sympathise with brutal bloodsuckers, giant mosquitoes in human form you could say, think again. Emotion surrounds poor Louis and almost all the characters in one way or another, and it is impossible not to pity them. A great plot, brilliant script and stunning acting. An incredible movie.First up: Tom Cruise. His performance as Lestat was stunning. Although I'm not usually a Tom Cruise fan, I can't deny I was SO impressed. He portrays Lestat in such a genuine way - he is a killer. He drinks people's blood. Yet he enjoys it while Louis is repulsed by it. Brad Pitt as Louis was a pleasant surprise. A Hollywood pretty boy as a vampire? Yeah right. I was proved wrong (gasp...)and pleasantly surprised that he played Louis so well, whichever state of mind and time of life (oh the irony, he's immortal) he happens to be in. Antonio Banderas does a fantastic job as usual and makes an evil, dark, theatrical vampire oh so sexy. Stephen Rea is the guy you just love to hate and Santiago would be top of my 'characters to torture' list if I had one.I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Go see. Go buy. Go enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
well-crafted and acted,"From director Neil Jordan comes this captivating descent into the dark, lurid, and often times emotionally wrenching netherworld of vampires. Pitt--a vampire burdened with the emotional frailty and turmoil of a human soul--recalls his two hundred year existence: a life of pain, sorrow, and regret where he clashed with his ravenous, suave, charismatic mentor/creator. Based on the novel by Anne Rice this stylish, violent, engrossing tale is a bit overlong, but made worthwhile by lavish set design, terrific visual effects, along with rich performances. Cruise gives a surprisingly bravura performance as the vampire Lestat, and young Dunst is simply riveting as Claudia. ***",,Anonymous,Horror

The Best Vampire Movie out there!,"i must say, when i was preparing to watch it, i thought ok this is probabley gonna be your typical Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt pretty boy movie. Usually i find Tom Cruise's acting ability to be corney and non-emotional, Brad Pitt's movies typically kinda funny and not so original. But i was quite mistaken after watching this epic tale of the torturing soul and coniving vampires. I don't know if it was because the make-up artists did a good job making Cruise blonde and pale. But through out the movie i actually forgot it was him. He was brilliant as the Vampire Lestat with the evil laugh and crude antics. Brad Pitt brought to life the torturing soul of my favourite character Louis. i was very pessimistic about him as i really didn't want to see a actor portray what i had thought of Louis in the novels, especially a well known pretty boy. But again i was wrong. The chemistry between them was of brothers the fighting, and caring at times. Lestat as the older brother teaching his young vampire Louis. They bond together to parent the young Kirsten Dunst character Claudia,when you think about how young she was at the time she did a awesome performance. It is very unfortunate that Tom Cruise refuses to reprise a role, especially because both actors haven't done a good drama since. That did well because of a good script and not because of media hype.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A magnificent drama, but not much of a horror movie.","The biggest problem i've got with this film is that it is obviously considered by many, for instance by the comments in the newspapers, as a horror movie. That's bullshit. It almost (if only almost) as much horror movie as, say, Lord of the Rings, where there also are some exciting part where people are killed by supernatural beings. Is that what is required to put a movie in that genre?No, its not much horror in it, but as a drama, its wonderful. It's definitely one of my favourite movies with a content that I find unusually deep, at least for Hollywood, it's looking good and most of the actors are superb, save Antonio Banderas. I don't know if he's too old, since I've never read the book, but his acting is all too unrealistic.Since so many dislike Cruise, I must only say that I think his doing a fantastic job. That man has just grown in my eyes during the years, and this is one of his greatest roles ever. By the way; the makeup on the guy is so good that I didn't recognize him the first time I saw the movie. In fact someone had to tell it to me, and I hardly believed it. Perhaps mainly because of the colour of his hair and eyebrows. That little lass is a children-actor (don't know if that's a word, but I hope you understand it) I have only seen the like of in the sixth sense. The rest of the actors are also good.One the best things with this movie is that it feels so realistic; it makes you feel that this is how it must be to be a vampire; the problems, the feelings, etc..Somebody obviously thinks this movie is stupid and ridiculous. I only agree on that on one, and only one, single detail: the coffins. Why the heck are they sleeping in coffins for? Why don't they just have the bed in a basement without windows or something? Yeah, I know vampires, at least in Dracula, have to sleep on the earth of their homeland, but I don't remember that's a topic in the movie. And there are so many other traditions they are breaking, so...Well, that's a detail. The movie is good, beautiful, in fact. It's one of the most beautiful movies I know, with a mood throughout the whole thing that is quite unique. OK, I admit that it might be a bit boring at times, a bit too slow, but that's is on the other hand necessary - to a certain degree. This movie couldn't handle much more speed.I definitely recommend it, but don't expect very much horror. Maybe that's why some are disappointed; they expectations were not fulfilled.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very disappointing,"¬ëInterview' has been a long time for me one of those movies you keep meaning to see until you finally do, years later. Now that I have, I can only express my disappointment. I don't think the slightest attempt was made to capture the romance, the passion, and the pure ambience of the story. Now I do concede, as has been said many times, that if a novel is good enough to be made into a movie, it's probably not even worth it. It's old news that the book is always better than the movie. I grant this, but much more still could have been done with it. This movie should have been an homage to the novel, but it was in fact a disgrace.However, as a film it did have some redeeming qualities. The cinematography was beautiful, the acting superb. Tom Cruise is in his element here (larger-than-life characters) and they don't get much larger than the Vampire Lestat. I cannot envision anyone else take on the role the way he did. Pitt I was surprised and impressed with, though I was doubtful at first of his being cast. Kirsten Dunst shows amazing talent. I have a common gripe ¬ñ Banderas as Armand. Though, incredibly, he does some acting, he's a terrible choice for the part. And I would have liked to hear them all adopt a French accent.The ending was horrendous, the worst possible example of creative license I have ever seen, and gave an awful impression of the real story.Definitely read the books; don't bother with the movie if you're looking for more than performance. It is truly not worth it.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Omage to the Acting,"I have to say that when I saw this it brought a whole new light to Tom cruise for me as an actor. This is probably one of, if not, my favoured roles that I have seen him in and I think that it was a great break from every other(action, action, action) role I have seen him in. I was very impressed by his acting and would definitely recommend that you watch it if you are a Tom Cruise fan. Now I did find it frustrating at times, mainly with Kirsten Dunst's character, actually it might be entirely her character but that's just me. I mean there is always at least one character that you aren't a fan of because there needs to be some sort of a bad guy even if the antagonist is likable. Oh and I'm not saying of she is or isn't a bad guy I'm just giving some perspective or whatever. I'm not really sure about what I have in terms of an opinion when it comes to Brad Pitt in this movie other than I never noticed how big his lips were until I saw him in this role or that he does look kinda feminine at a younger age, it may just be the haircut though. Again, this is only my opinion so you may not agree with it once you've seen the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Just Read, theres enough for everyone.","So funny, isn't it? I used to think that Brad Pitt was just a nice baby face in a good nearly forty years old body. So I did with Tom Cruise, and you can imagined what I thought of Kirstin Dunts after a funny but stupid Bring it On. This movie shows why this actors are so famous today. They do now how to act, only they don't do it very much nowadays. The performance given from Brad Pitt as Louis is perfect, and really captured the sad way of living of his character which, for me, never really wanted to be happy. He's always looking foward to horrible things in a way, and there IS people like that. As for Tom Cruise, I hated Lestad, which is good. I think that was the intention. I hated him as much as I hated Santiago, although I love his ceiling dance. I don't like Antonio Bandera's Armand, and thats it. Claudia is one of my favorite characters nevertheless, and I love her scenes, including the one when she cuts her hair. At that point I knew totally this wasn't a little girl, but a big, mature woman. Her relationship with Louis is the greatest thing of the film. At the beginning he is the perfect father, later a fantastic big brother, and at the end a handsome lover. Nobody talks about it, but I was worried they would never kissed throughout the movie, and when they did the whole stoy suddenly changed, and I was this close to cry when Louis finds her with Madelaine made ashes.At that scene, his expression shows the whole acceptance bussines of humans: negation, rage, negociation and finally acceptance. I'm still this close to cry when I see his sad expression. But later, Louis becomes a total vampire. His human no more, his eyes are so bright you're scared of them and his expression is still ""irresistible"" as someone close to me said so.What girl woudn't give the world to have her first kiss at eleven with no one but Brad Pitt. The music is just hunting, and I had to buy the soundtrack. The script feel perfect and captures the spirit of the novel. I nearly give it a 10, but I won't because I'm scared of that number. It has such a meaning.Something else: I love Yvette, adn Madelaine, and Stelle, and they all talk so little. The good thing about several movies is that even the smallest characters have a meaning.

Tom Cruise is not the Lestat from the book, but his Lestat is perfect for the film. Brad Pitt's Louis is perfect, and Kirstin Dunst's Claudia is straight out of the book- creepy!

"Good ideas, an interesting and effective point of view, and nice direction by Neil Jordan, but never really takes of with the material. We expect much more for such great filmmakers. ** (out of of four)","INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE / (1994) ** (out of four)By Blake French:""Don't be afraid. I'm going to give you the choice I never had"" Lestat de LioncourtThe dialogue, used several times throughout Neil Jordan's ""Interview with the Vampire,"" comes from the lips of a vampire hundreds of years old. His name is Lestat de Lioncourt, played with the right attitude and mood by Tom Cruise. He explains to a suicidal Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), that he can either spend the rest of eternity as a bloodsucker, or meet a dreadful demise. Louis chooses to become a vampire. That is the setup for this stylish, well acted, but lackluster drama from the popular novel by Anne Rice, who also provided the film with its screenplay.The movie is a personal narrative of Louis, but Anne Rice believes it to take a point of view from the audience's perspective. I disagree. Louis is the storyteller here, and I do not think it could be any clearer from whom the story is coming-it is the right angle for the material. The plot is told through the conducting of an interview by a simple-minded reporter (Christian Slater) interested in Louis's complex and intriguing background. ""I'm flesh and blood, but not human,"" explains Louis, ""I haven't been human for two hundred years.""He tells a story of passion, fear, love, death, desire, and need. His history begins in New Orleans during the late 1700's, where he lost his family and lives a life of grief and depression. Louis becomes a vampire after an encounter with Lestat, who wants a similar companion to spend his endless days with. ""That morning I was not yet a vampire, and I saw my last sunrise. I remember it completely, and yet I can't recall any sunrise before it. I watched its whole magnificence for the last time as if it were the first. And then I said farewell to sun light, and set out to become what I became,"" elucidates Louis in one of the movie's most revealing and understood scenes.There are several key characters who play tribute to the long, continuing life of Louis. There is the child vampire, played uncomfortably by a 12-year old Kirsten Dunst, whom Louis grows to love like a sister-or lover. Dunst is unmistakably miscast in her role, giving her character an annoying, insecure mood. She is simply too young to realize the intensities and requirements of her character. The movie becomes even more unconvincing when several other vampires in Paris, including Armand (Antonio Banderas) and Santiago (Stephen Rea), explain to Louis that he is part of an international secret society.Neither Jordan nor Rice make the life of a vampire lookparticularly joyous. That is the point of the movie, to demonstrate that excepting a once in an eternity gift may turn out to be a never ending hell. Throughout the story, many characters beg for the gift of vampirism, but they do not understand the consequences of their desires. ""Interview with the Vampire"" captures the ceaseless sadness of being a vampire; we realize their gift is unintrusive, but the other characters covet it like nothing else.The movie's success is in its appearance by cinematographer Phillipe Rousselot and production designer Dante Ferretti. They create a moody, atmospheric world for the characters. Much can also be said about the scenes in which the vampires feast on the blood of their victims. Jordan focuses the camera on the eye of the attacking vampire. The film presents the moment of attack as suspecting, but at the same time, tantalizing because of the indulging satisfaction and the perfect timing.Several factors of the film are peculiarly vulnerable to logic. Due to the geographical location for the area, the sun can never be directly above Paris. But during one of he film's most important scenes, that takes place at the bottom of a well, the entire floor is directly illuminated. And what about the final confrontation between Louis and Lestat-it's meaningless and brief. Are we really supposed to believe the scene would be this short lived, lacking any kind of imagination or curiosity? It is made clear several times that vampires are immortal, but when one drinks ""dead blood"" it appears as if he meets a graphic decease. If they can die, wouldn't the massive consuming fire have finished him off? Either way, the plot requires the vampire to appear again later in the movie, so he does.The film's mood also gets in the way. We just get the same style repeated over and over. A lot of the dialogue is right on the money, but even more of it feels contrived and simulated. After a while-a short while-the movie becomes down right boring, to the extent where I simply stopped caring about the characters altogether. ""Interview with a Vampire"" also makes the often misunderstood blunder, which I never grow tired of explaining, in which the filmmakers attempt to blend surreal fantasy with reality. If a movie is intended to be fiction, stay with the fiction. Do not try to rationalize the concepts of the unreal with the real. It just does not blend well. ""Interview with the Vampire"" just doesn't know where to draw the line between realism and fable.Neil Jordan is a very talented director, and has not made a bad movie with ""Interview with the Vampire,"" just a misunderstood one. He does no wrong here. Maybe it is Anne Rice's novel, in which I never read. Various things make the potentially intriguing material go awry, and ""Interview with the Vampire"" is a major disappointment. We expect so much more from such a prestigious cast and talented filmmakers, but the only real accomplishment they achieve is coming up with a creative point of view for an otherwise campy production.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

And interview with the vampire, what can I say.... It's about vampire's conflict. Really tighten. I've seen this movie more than once. I even not feeling bored.Of course the actors/actress. Who doesn't know Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater, and young Kristen Dunst. This is a movie with a perfect story and actors/actress. Look little Kirsten Dunst. We can see her Hollywood talent when she just a child. She really has a big talent. No doubt that now she's one of the Hollywood star. In this movie, she can played a girl with an adult mind. And she can expressed her anger with a good acted.Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise... Good news, he played a strong character. Bad news, no one million dollars smile on his face. Just cold, bad, and evil smile from powerful vampire (remember, Lestat was too strong to killed). But, hey! This is so great. This is the first time he played antagonist character. I was so amaze, he can acted like that. With wavy blond hair (hahaha... I think, he looked funny) and long canine teeth, very very evil. It was awesome when I watched him with big anger and wicked laugh.Poor Louise. He hated Lestat but he knew that he couldn't free from his creator. Of course Lestat was an arrogant vampire and too much demand. But, all of his lessons which gave to Louis, was true. Although Louis wanted to free from Lestat bad, he can't denied that Lestat was right. Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise? Or Brad Pitt vs. Tom Cruise? WOW!!! Why not? Good duet.New looking Antonio Banderas. Hahaha... with long black hair and white skin. It's OK. Those are made him like a true very old vampire Armand.And the end of the movie? Besides Lestat changed from his scary old face into handsome vampire again, actually I don't got it. Is it Christian Slater will be a vampire? If it's right, knowing that he'll has a teacher like that, poor Slater.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent !,It's a great story. Anne Rice really knows what she's writing about in her stories. Makes you really wanna live in that time and feel how it is to be a vampire yourself. Incredible work !,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Great Vampire Movie,You know there are a lot of things to say about this movie and one is that this was an incredible film. I liked the story of the vampire's life played by Brad Pitt who he gave a complete story of vampires which gave me a better description and I learned a lot about vampires in this film. Tom Cruise was amazing as the bad vampire and mean one. Kirsten Dunst was a weird and very interesting vampire which this movie launched her career in acting. I thought the movie was almost perfect but sometimes boring but as it went on it was excellent and is the best vampire movie ever made. I think every 1 should see this and get a better glance at what vampires really are.9/10,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Phenomenal,"This movie was superb. Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea were excellent. Stephen portrayed an outstanding villain. Neil Jordan, a directing job well done. I was very impressed with the plot and the story line. I gave it a perfect 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Decadent Almost,"The Interview with the Vampire proved to be a movie of almosts.The plot was almost fascinating. Even the poorest actors and directors would not be able to completely kill Anne Rice's writing. Vampires are always exciting, and Rice's sensual killers...even more so.The acting was almost engaging. Brad Pitt was surprisingly suited to play the role of the morally-ambiguous Louis, and managed to pull of an acting job that belied his pretty boy reputation. Of course, he might have only seemed impressive when put beside his costar Tom Cruise, whose performance served only to cement his role as a pretty face with a gaping lack of talent. Antonio Banderas was also stunningly ill-suited to play the role of the ancient vampire Armand. (Of course, I may have only been distracted by his ankle-length hair. If so, then I can hardly be blamed.) while Kirsten Dunst gave a remarkable performance as the child vampire Claudia. Her death almost brought a tear to my eye. Almost.All in all, the movie was a fascinating waste of time. Although the cast was certainly drool-worthy, the film walked the thin line between a welcome success and a dull failure, and all-too-often stumbled. It was ridiculously overdone--almost. It was decadently vicious--almost. It would be a waste of time to watch again--that's a certainty.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the most compelling vampire stories ever written,"""Interview with the Vampire"", a film based on Anne Rice's first novel of the Vampire Chronicles series is a haunting story of damnation, eternal regret and eternal love. The story begins when Louis (Brad Pitt), a vampire finds an interviewer (Christian sLater) and leads him to his room to tell him his story. The story starts in the 18th century in New Orleans when Louis after a terrible loss in his family (in the film it is implied that he lost his wife and his newborn child but in the book it's his brother that commits suicide) starts to be obsessed with death himself.  He then meets a vampire, LeStat (Tom Cruise) who gives him the opportunity to become a vampire, experience what he longed for, which was death, yet still live forever. Louis who was so eager to die finds the lifestyle of the vampires unbearable and in the first time in his life starts to value human life.  He starts to hate LeStat for being so senseless and killing everyone and everything he can get his hands on and retreats to eating mouse and other small animals to survive because he can't find the strength to kill a human being. His disgust for LeStat becomes so strong that he is about to leave him when LeStat turns a 5 year old orphan, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) that Louis had fed on but didn't have the courage to kill her, into a vampire.  Louis will then stay with LeStat and will become a father to Claudia. As Claudia grows up her relationship with Louis becomes much stronger as they still sleep in the same coffin and she demands to know the truth of how she became a vampire and why she will never have the body of a full-grown woman.  Louis tells her the truth which angers her so much that she is willing to take revenge from LeStat.  I won't say anything else because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I'll just say that the relationship between Louis and Claudia becomes much stronger after being together for almost a century until an ancient vampire, Armand (Antonio Banderas) and his attraction to Louis, which by the way is mutual, is putting the couple's love in danger. Some might think that the relationship between Louis and Claudia, a 24 year old man and a 5 year old girl is gross but it isn't because vampires are not sexual beings and besides, Claudia despite her diminutive stature is technically 100 years old when they kiss in Paris.  Others might be bothered by the attraction between Louis and Armand or even between LeStat and Louis but I want to believe that our society is able to accept homosexuality even if the attraction between the vampires is by no means sexual, since vampires as I have already said are not sexual beings. There are a lot more I'd like to say about this film but there's really no reason to do such a thing in a review. Interview with the Vampire is a fascinating and heart-breaking story and one of the best stories about the vampire's eternal pain and their internal struggles between their morals and their needs.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great,"I highly recommend this movie. It's the story of two vampires living through time, narrated by Louis (Brad Pitt), who is being interviewed by a reporter (Christian Slater). Louis was made a vampire by Lestat (Tom Cruise), who takes him under his wing and shows him the vampire way of life. They ""adopt"" a girl named Claudia (a young Kirsten Dunst). Claudia and Louis consider it a curse to be a vampire, and grow to hate Lestat.Tom Cruise steals every scene of this movie. I know Anne Rice complained publically about his casting, just imagine how stupid she must feel now. Lestat is the character we root for in this one (even if he's something of a bad-guy) which makes the ending so great.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Creepy, Gothic, and Cool!",This is an interesting movie. It sort of explorers a different side of a vampire. We're all familiar with Dracula and this is like the complete opposite from that and perhaps that's why it's so interesting.I've never read the novel by Ann Rice but since she wrote the screenplay then I believe it's pretty faithful to the book.The direction and performances were great. And you know what was the creepy part? The whole Kirsten Dunst not aging thing. Can you imagine if Kirsten Dunst would have never transformed into the HOT gal she is now? :(3(***)out of 4(****)stars,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Romantic vampires,"Although I thoroughly dislike horror, I'm always drawn to the supernatural. Especially when they look like the threesome Cruise/Pitt/Banderas. The way the movie was made you almost expect to encounter a vampire on your next walk through the park, but in this case please let it be Louis (Pitt). The vampire as a predator but before all as the victim, given shape in a sensual setting. I liked it!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best Vampire Movie ever created,"Interview with a Vampire is actually one of the best films of the decade. Brad Pitt probably gave the best performance of his career. Brad showed the pain and the rage of Louis. Tom Cruise was excellent    as the handsome lonely Lestat. Antonio Banderas was scary as Armond. And Kirsten Dunst was great as Claudia, she acted like a woman in a little girls body.This film shows that Vampires aren't blood sucking animals,they have emotions and a soul. Ann Rice puts you in this world and makes you think, what if you could get a Vampire to sit and tell you the story of his life. Neil Jordan's directing was hypnotic and so was the acting. Brad and Tom should have been nominated for an Oscar and I'm glad this film got the Oscar for best original score. I love this movie and I hope it will be seen and loved by many in the future.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Vampire films. I give it a 15 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994),"I thought the movie was the best movie I've ever seen that dealt with Vampires. The only thing I don't like about it was near the end, when that girl was brought onto the stage, undressed, then eaten. And thats only because she was undressed. But other than that I had no objections whatsoever. What other objections could there possibly be?! I mean Brad Pitt was to lead vampire, and he was SO HOT. He looks better with his white skin, his fierce eyes and deadness than alive and human. Don't get me wrong, he's HOT as a mortal but as an immortal.....There's just no comparison.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Probably as good a screen adaptation as one can expect from the book!,"Juicy and flamboyant in every respect of the words. Neil Jordan's lush direction showed us what he's capable of in combining the importance of good narrative with a visual banquet in 'The crying game'. And 'Interview'... is no step-down in that matter. The setting design and make-up is delicious and Anne Rice's script (from her landmark novel in the genre... yes, I AM a die-hard fan!) is as tight as a movie adaptation can manage and do justice, unless elaborated into a 3-hour version, that is (which I think could work, too). The voice-over technique flows fine and handles the occasional awkward tongue-in-cheek elements quite well. Some genuine scares grab you firmly by the throat, not to forget.The cast is surprisingly fitting. Pitt is quite an ideal choice as Louis, evoking not too much sympathy in his frustration. However, upon knowing Cruise was to do Lestat, I remember moaning in despair - he was SO physically wrong! But he IS very good, witty and carrying just that right sarcasm for the part. But it's a final highlight (also titillating, years later, knowing her work as an adult) to see a brilliant Dunst as young Claudia. She's just luminous in her devilishness!The only thing here that I miss from the novel is the sequence from Eastern Europe where Louis encounters the sad, beastly branch developed out of the vampire species; which I found an interesting comparison and analogy to disabled humans.8/10 from Ozjeppe.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best vampire movie,"In an endless sea of vampire vomit, this movie stands as one of the best movies in vampire ""genre"" and, after every vampire crap I have a misfortune to see, I gladly go back to this one to wash off crap from my brain.I don't like Kirsten and I hate Tom Cruise, but here both of them fit perfectly. Brad is good by default, I love Christian, and the only issue is Banderas. I simply cannot see him as a vampire, but his role is too small to influence the overall impression.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This dark, but human fantasy is an all-time fave","After renting this movie about 4-5 times, I finally bought in on sale at a grocery store and can now view it at any time. I've seen thousands of movies, but this is in my all-time top ten or so. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is about this dark, melodramatic fantasy that I like so much, but it's certainly carved a niche in my all-time list. I can start with the great opening and closing sequences that bookend the film and continue on to the intense performances by Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, the brooding New Orleans and Paris landscape, the chilling musical score and on and on. I used to say I liked horror movies and I suppose I still do, somewhat ... and yes, the movie chills and thrills, but thanks to the characters and the screenplay, this is much more than a horror movie. I didn't go into this movie the first time with any particular interest in Anne Rice or anything but a curiosity. But this film has a heart, a soul, a horrible beauty, an ambiguous sexuality and many other elements that greatly intrigue me. At its heart, though, IWTV is about the heart and soul of Louie (Pitt) who lives with temptation and regret every day of his 200 years, which is something most of us can relate to. His performance, along with the spectacular ones of Cruise, Dunst and Banderas is spell-binding.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pointless,"A very weird, twisted, funny, sad and unpleasant film, which never manages to actually be scary. The cinematography, makeup and costumes are all excellent, Pitt is good in his role but I don't think Cruise is though, and the idea of his character returning didn't work for me. The film gets a bit into the vampire lore but also manages to tie itself into nots. Some of the acting and costumes get a bit hammy towards the end, the film has some good effects and production value but I didn't really believe or care about the story. You don't feel anything for any of these character actually and they don't really try to make you either.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than it should be,"Settling down for an interview, a vampire recounts to a reporter about his past when he was initially turned into a bloodthirsty creature by an equally vicious vampire and how they've lived among humanity throughout the years spanning the country's history and how he has dealt with it.This was a rather pleasant surprise and was a lot better than expected. One of the better examples of this is that the film contains a lot of really nice action scenes that have so many good parts that it never manages to get boring or dull. There are some good scenes of him at the beginning after the transformation coming upon the different traits and encountering the people who don't know of him so they allow him to feast on them before turning into the fiery destruction of the mansion as the more flames spread across the estate the more the realization dawns that there's little escape, and it has a really rousing finale that works perfectly. Some of the other scenes, including the night-time hunting in the Louisiana town to the fire in the bedroom and the Paris finale that is a huge, epic fight where the torture method is intense and painful, the revenge is worthwhile and is one of the film's highlights. The last one here is the film has a huge assortment of kills with its big body-count that is worthwhile and makes the other moments all the better. These here are the film's good points as there isn't much wrong with this one, but there's a pretty big flaw to it. This highly detrimental flaw is the manner of portraying its vampires as incredibly whiny and constantly complaining about everything that happens. The reluctance to do anything that usual vampires engage in, from the neck-biting to the supernatural powers are touched over here and there and the same conclusion about the vampires being in that behavior-set is always brought up. That is hardly any way to be able to treat it's vampires since they're supposed to be very creepy and frightening, yet not so much in here. It takes a lot out of the film since that's mostly how the beginning of the film plays out for the majority of the time in those sections, and it rarely comes up from them. It also causes the pace to be so slow and dragged-out featuring all this bland and unexciting non-vampire action. Another small flaw here is that the kills are all done in the same way, and hardly anything else is used here. It really could've used some variety in here, and it's not detrimental but otherwise, these here are the film's flaws.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Full Nudity and violence against animals.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I think that Tom Cruise does a wonderful job playing Lestat, and Brad Pitt playing Louis is quite good.

Kirsten Dunst is the star,"Maybe my own fault for saving this one through the years and having too high expectations. But just watched it and didn't love it... at all. Felt way too rushed; 200 years passed but the relationships didn't feel like it AT ALL. I guess maybe when you read the book first, some if not most of the holes will be filled. But I missed something.Also, ""the interview"" itself seemed rather pointless.I quite enjoyed the last 5 minutes; finally Brad Pitt with a different emotion on his face.Kirsten Dunst was amazing.And I would have liked more Slater and Banderas.I watched it.

I was floored by the acting by every single person in the film. From the bloody suffering whore in Louis and Lestat's room to Louis and Lestat themselves, all the actors and actresses performed amazingly.

I just don't view ""Interview with the Vampire"" as a horror movie... Or at least not the kind of horror movie that many are used to.

And this was even better, one of the most beautiful films ever made. The blood is floating in the entire film, but that's a part of it, it never gets disgusting. The cast was brilliant. Tom Cruise did his best performance ever as Lestat, he was so cool! Brad Pitt does good job with showing Louis' pain. And Kirsten Dunst gave a stunning performance as Claudia, the little avant-garde evil girl. Antonio Banderas, Stephen Rea and the upcomer Thandie Newton was good in their small roles too. Christian Slater also delivers good performance in a minimal role. I have never seen a better vampire movie, and I doubt that the day will come when I do. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie is beyond excellent!,"This movie is great.  I made sure that when I bought it, I got the special edition with added footage.  The cast portrays their characters greatly and makes them believable.  The book captured much more information, but Anne Rice did write the screenplay and said she was satisfied and you have to respect that.  However, if you liked the movie, read the book!  It will help explain some things that may have confused you in the movie or can fill in some gaps.  I am currently in the 4th book of the Vampire Chronicles and I am constantly finding things that make me think, ""Oh!  That makes a lot of sense now!""  The soundtrack is also very good.  This movie is definitely one of my favorites and if you have never seen it, I highly reccomend that you do.  This movie has it all:  action, romance, horror, drama, suspense!

It showed the love and anger between two vampires who are supposed to be friends. And it shows the love of a daughter. I cried in a couple parts, just of how good it was. As for them looking girly at times, thats how it was back then. Guys wore wigs that made them look like women at times. Thats why they had it in that time frame.

In Kalifornia, a movie or two earlier, he excelled, but in this flop, he sucks. No reason he should have been cast but the appeal to market as high popularity grew.Cruise (the was pre-Scientology nonsense and insanity came out) was too dedicated to this role. Gave him a way to shed the good-guy image and dive into darkness. Nobody can claim taking these roles does not impact one's life.

The film is stunning and beautiful and its not often that I use those words unsarcastically. My only complaint is that Interview With The Vampire left out a few key plot points (Lestat's father being first among them) Which prevent making a sequel from the much better book The Vampire Lestat which would make an awesome movie (yes, even with Cruise as lead). This flick also made Lestat into more of a villian for added dramatics. Kirsten Dunst as Claudia is really cool and she's the sort of character that you love to hate.

Or maybe I just didn't get distracted by boredom.Also, I don't think Tom Cruise is a good actor, but he knows how to use his charm when the characters are a good fit for him, and this one wasn't at all. Brad Pitt was not at his best yet and neither could make anything of their terrible and boring characters.Some insist to read the movie ""subtext"" about homosexuality and even if I can see a reference here and there to it, again like I said, I'm not sure the movie goes anywhere with anything.

Beautiful yet scary tale about life on the other side,"This film is in my opinion Tom Cruise's and Brad Pitt's second best perfomance on the screen. Cruise's best is ""Jerry Maguire"" and Pitt's best is of course ""Fight Club"". This movie is about Louis(Pitt) who is a mortal plantation owner who has lost his wife, and therefore his will to live. This is when he meets Lestat(Cruise) who is a vampire that offers him an alternative life(This actually resembles of Pitt's latest film ""Fight Club""). Louis accepts and becomes a creature of the night.Time passes on as Louis starts to regret, he won't feed of mortals as Lestat teaches him the ways of being a superior race. Living in the night, sleeping at daytime makes Louis want to end it all but he can't. In rage and bewilderness Louis feeds off a mortal. A little girl. Lestat witnesses this and applauds him. Believing the girl is dead Louis goes away. Only to return and see Lestat turns the girl into a vampire. This is for Louis' part, to have a friend in the dark.Claudia, the girl, also starts to regret. Because she will never grow into a woman or die. The same goes for Louis. They grow tired of Lestat and desides to kill him, if possible. They succeed. Or do they? See the movie.After they supposebly has killed Lestat they travel to the old world. This is a journey of expierence and sorrow. That will change their lives forever...See this movie.

I went to the video store the next day and my mom rented it for me. It was SO AWESOME!!! The acting was incredible. I've never seen Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt in any other role that they played better than Lestat and Louis. It's the movie that turned me towards vampires.

Tom Cruise with blonde hair!,"Don¬¥t get me wrong, I think Tom never looked better than in this movie!

I didn¬¥t like him until I watched this movie. I can¬¥t tell you how fascinated I was as I saw ""Lestat"". I had to read every book of the ""Chronik der Vampire"" (in German for sure, my English is not that good) - ""Vampire Chronicles"". I really fell in love with Lestat (not with Tom Cruise!). I think it is much better to watch the film before you read the books because in most cases you are very disappointed if you know the book before you watch the film.I¬¥m very sad that it takes so much time until the books are released in German.

A very logically realistic Vampire movie,"This movie is touching, never too much, never too little. It makes you think about the logic of being a vampire and living forever. Of course you CANNOT feel what Loui(The main character) felt because it is too hard to do so. How can you possibly imagine living that long? What you would feel after such a long time? In this movie and the equally thrilling novel by Anne Rice, Vampires are presented, not as hating, evil, blood thirsty creatures, but as creatures with logical human or animal type emotions and cravings. One example of this is how many of them are said to commit suicide, becoming too bored with eternal life. This movie is a must see for anyone who has ever been interested in vampires.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Elite vampires all, they can't seem to 'live' with each other, nor can they live without, and to put the 'nail in the coffin' death is just not an option.Be warned, there's a lot of explicit, intense vampire 'meals' that are just 'loaded' with innuendo.Neil Jordan and Ann Rice have ""teamed-up"" very well to create a very unique, sophisticated, 'timeless' and certainly a 'biting' satire on modern day relationships.",,Anonymous,Horror
Wonderful!,"If you like melodramatic tripe. I saw this years ago, and thought it was so-so. Saw it again last night and it blew me away at how awful the whole movie is. So while I was watching it, i was trying to figure out just what makes this so awful. Is it the actors? Well.. no.. brad pit can act, just watch seven, fight club, 12 monkeys, or true romance... and he's the center of the movie. Is it the director? Well.. no.. there are plenty of well shot and memorable scenes. I believe it all comes down to the source material. The dialogue is so cheesy, often to the point of being downright idiotic, that there is no way you can present it with out being completely awful. I'm sorry, but it's Anne Rice's fault. I believe a more appropriate title for this movie would be ""Brad Pitt's Flowing Locks"", since that's what it seems to be centered on. This movie went through me like a pane of glass, to paraphrase a line from the movie. Truly awful.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A stylish, erotic and moving adaptation that more than does justice to the book on which it is based.",The casting of Tom Cruise as the irresistable Lestat was surprisingly inspired. He easily upstages Brad Pitt's fragile Louis and remains prominent throughout despite being absent for a long period of the film. Antonio Banderas is enigmatic as Armand and his Vampire Theatre is sinisterly entertaining. This film captures all the eroticism traditionally associated with vampires whilst simultaneously invoking feelings of sympathy and revulsion. A modern monster masterpiece!!!!,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A truly superb display of Acting, Directing and Writing!","Having read the novel Interview with the Vampire by the spectacular Anne Rice before searching out the film and watching it I have to admit that I was a little sceptical over the choice of actors.  As I had thoroughly enjoyed the unique character, Lestat de Lioncourt when written down on paper I had already considered the difficulty that the director might have had to face when casting someone for the part.I had not seen any of Tom Cruise's films before this; however, I was completely aware of his expert acting skills but this did not stop me from doubting his performance as the illustrious 'Brat Prince'.  Lestat has such energy as a character, a wicked demeanour and sarcastic nature, but somehow one can not help falling for him- how would an actor such as Cruise carry off such a deep role?Louis de Pointe du Lac is the miserable and 'weak' fledgling of the Vampire Lestat and is said to be the most human of all Vampires.  His mortal-pitying, self-hating attitude was another profile that I was unsure would be carried out to its full potential; however I doubted Brad Pitt less than I had Tom Cruise; I knew that Pitt's soft voice and strong appearance would fit snugly into Louis' character.Already aware that Anne Rice had written the screenplay herself I was ready to accept anything that differed from the book.  A little more romance was added to the film with the death of Louis' child and wife; in the book it had been the death of his brother that had caused him to withdraw into himself and I was willing to accept this as a much more sensitive side to the story.From the moment that Brad Pitt appeared on the screen I had fallen for his portrayal of Louis, he had everything about him to a tee, even the way in which he held himself in which he looked about his surroundings and treated other people were completely accurate.  I had to bite my lip and apologise profusely for my doubting his performance.And to add to my complete awe and satisfaction, I had already fallen for the Lestat that I saw before me on the television screen.  I laughed at his sarcasm, his mood swings, happiness and the way in which Cruise portrayed Lestat's high maintenance attitude.  To watch Cruise on the screen was as much fun as reading about Lestat in the novel.All of the characters that Anne Rice has come up with throughout the Vampire Chronicles keep within themselves something that would be a challenge when put onto the big screen.  However, Claudia, the young Vampiress belonging to Louis and Lestat meant the involvement of a child actor- a side to film that is rarely explored.  Kirsten Dunst was chosen to play this part and at the age of twelve, only two years younger than myself when I watched the film, she carried off the part with maturity and as much understanding as was possible.The only character with whom I was not impressed was that of Armand, whilst Antonio Banderas acted superbly the character had been cast too old. Armand was 'made' at roughly the age of 17 (I believe) and the age that they had worked him into the screenplay at seemed much older than that.  He was much darker than I had ever imagined the character would be and seemed less careless than that of the fun loving, red head Russian that I had read of.Whilst the last paragraph could be construed as the wishful thinking of a huge Anne Rice fan I believe in as much accuracy as possible when it comes to film adaptations and am sure that the pure immortality and beauty of Vampires might have been displayed to a much further degree if Armand had been cast with just a little more thought.Overall this film was positively fantastic.  It was bright and colourful, dark and mysterious, gruesome and terrible.  This film was full of its own magic and it left in my mind the enticing beauty of immortality, the seductiveness of the way in which a Louis and Lestat viewed the world and the timeless story of the Vampire from the ideas of a truly inspirational woman; Anne Rice.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The beautiful people, The beautiful people...","While Interview With The Vampire is cast with hunky Hollywood pretty boy actors like Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and Antonio Banderas . This is not the chick flick soap opera I thought it would be at the time of its release. Years later, I decided to give the film a chance and ended up really digging it. Based on a novel by Anne Rice, Interview With A Vampire is a very serious minded big budget vampire epic that was a refreshing take on the genre. The cast actually delivered solid performances in this very somber vampire movie. The epic and dramatic approach to the material was innovative with good storytelling and characters with strong visuals and excellent camerawork. While this brings a new approach to the genre, it still retains enough gloomy ambiance and thrills that are prevalent to Gothic horror. So, in as many ways as Interview With A Vampire is different, it still sticks to a lot of traditional Gothic horror conventions. Overall, this is a really good film and should appease both horror fans and more arthouse type of viewers that normally would stay away from this type of film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I wouldn't recommend it for people below 13 for there is some inappropriate scenes. Please watch this movie! I promise you'll like it.

The best vampire movie out there,"This movie is dark, its dramatic, its suspensful, its erotic and its brilliant. Bad Pitt and Tom Cruise ignite sparks on screen as 2 vampires, Pitt as the sensitive one and Cruise as the mean one. The film revolves around the life of Pitt who is being interviewed by Christian Slater. He tells of his desent into the world of vampires and of the tension that arose between him and Cruise resulting in their departure from each other. The always great Antino Bandaras and a very young Kirsten Dunst also give effect performances as blood suckers. The script is great and Crusie and Pitt deliver all their lines with power and emtion making this two hour plus movie seem to speed by. Due to several gory images and a few erotic scenes abd the harsh subject matter this movie probably won't appeal to all but for fans of the classic style suspense movies like Bram Stokers Dracula and Marry Shelly's Frankenstien this one will not dissapoint.",,Anonymous,Horror

This is one vampire movie that doesn't suck!,"Having seen my share of vampire films in my nearly 40 years, I don't think I've ever seen one as well-done as this one.  Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" wasn't bad, but there was far more fluff than substance.  Carpenter's ""Vampires"" was ludicrous...and ""Blade""?  Well, let's not even go there.  This film, however, gives a depth of meaning to the life of a vampire that makes the monster far less threatening and far more understandable.In this movie, we get to see what motivates them...why they do what they do and the general depths of depravity that isn't only innate to characters as vampires, but to that of humans in-general.  I found the emotions portrayed in this film as more real than in any of the aforementioned vampire-themed films.  And more, all the main actors did extremely credible jobs in their roles.  I think the only role where Cruise has even come close to what he put into Lestat was in ""A Few Good Men"".  Pitt was a bit pouty, yes, but that's his morose style anyway.Anyway, this a thinking person's film.  If you want blood, gore and body-parts all over the screen, see the films mentioned in the first paragraph.  If you want something that makes you think, watch this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

This film doesn't over-glamourise the vampire world but still makes it look intriguing rather than disgusting. It shows the story from the view-point of the vampire and is presented as a life story.

He has the immense physical and moral presence; he was defiant and yet never without conscience; he was beautiful beyond description yet compelled to do cruel things.

"Buffalo, NY USA","Interview with the Vampire is one of the best films I seen in in my lifetime. Richly filmed, and musically perfected, this film follows the struggles and feelings experienced by vampire Louie in his 200 years and counting of immortality, proving that even the undead have feelings, and daily struggles, perhaps resulting from their own lost humanity. Brad Pitt, who's performance is both amazing, and thought invoking <I must say this had to be the movie I saw way back 7 years ago when it was out that convinced me he wasn't just something nice to look at.> The real impressive acting here comes from Kirsten Dunst and Tom Cruise, Dunst, who is a favorite of mine anyhow, plays Claudia, the eternal child, who's mind is as grown up and intelligent as that of an 80 year old, but who's body remains that of a doll, I was highly impressed vy the ability of someone who off the screen is as yound as her performance to master humanity, and the struggle to a T. Tom Cruise, who has always been to me ""Top Gun"" pretty boy, blew me away, I have always found the ""supervillan"" to be a favorite, the more evil, the more likable somehow. You could have not found a better Lestat, a lot of people were objective to having Cruise in this part, including me, but that changed within 5 minutes a his screen entrance, even to this day I cannot watch that movie without disbelieving that was Tom Cruise. Cruise is never less than convincing as a vampire that has been at this game for so long, he's long since lost any sense of guilt or remorse, but there are scenes where it does seem to be present for however brief a period it may be. In closing this movie offers up vampires as exotic creatures, who for the most part look the same as the rest of us, rather than some ugly creature <ie: Nosferatu> which in itself is a great film, doesh't leave much to be desired in the eyeful dept.

What I think of the movie and the book.,"Well, I've seen the movie and I've read almost all of the Chronicles (I'm still on Blood and Gold).  This movie is a good summary of Interview with the Vampire, but I don't know why they had to change certain things.  For instance, Louis' wife didn't die because he didn't have one.  His brother died and he felt guilty and that's why he didn't want to live. Anyways, like I said it's a good summary.  The acting is fabulous as well as the over all atmosphere of the film.  I believe that they kept the over all feel intact. I have to like this movie for one thing, it got me into the Vampire Chronicles.  I started reading them when I was about 14 and I'm now 19. I'd have to say that they've had a good impact on my life in the past 5 years. There are just certain things that make you think.  I really wished that they would not have changed the story line so much in Queen of the Damned. From what I've learned, Interview stays more true to the original story than QOTD.

I was right about the blood-sucking vampire part and the big name actors but I was wrong about it being bad.  It turned out to be one of the best horror movies of the '90s. Tom Cruise is probably at one of his best parts here.  he is perfect playing Lestat.  Brad Pitt is excellent in this to and I wouldn't have picked a better actor to play his part.  i was surprised at how good Kirsten Dunst is in this.  She definitely made a name for herself in this.

"Vampires not as monsters, but living things.","This movie showed us the other side of the vampire, the side that, like us all, is searching for the meaning of it all. The side that loves, that feels lonely, that seeks companionship. Unlike movies such as ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", who care to portray vampires as ugly, primitive, uncivilised monsters, we are presented with vampires that yearn to discover the meaning of it all, yearn to move with the times and yearn to see once again the sunrise they have forsaken.The acting by all characters in this film is quite extraordinary, with special mention going to Kirsten Dunst for her portrayal of Claudia. Every facial shot of her expressed so much emotion for such a young girl making us truly believe she really is a much older, wiser, killer. Tom Cruise also deserves mention. Although many tend to see Lestat as a villian, I saw him more as just a vampire who enjoys what he is, unlike Louis who has just come to grips with the endless killing. The fantastic make up for all the vampires, especially Lestat's, also gave much to the film. Quite a brilliant scene when Lestat returns from the swamp playing the piano. Spine tingling!Other excellent points about the film include the soundtrack, following the timeframe to perfection. The costume design, again with special mention for Claudia. And the architecture of everything from New Orleans to London to Paris.For a different, and refreshing view of vampires. See this movie. A brilliant movie on all counts. 9 out of 10.

At the age of 15 I finally saw it at a friends house and was amazed by it!  It was better than i had ever imagined it to be and i fell in love with it.The acting is amazing!  Tom Cruise is wonderful!  His Lestat is dark and creepy and I was shocked to read that Anne Rice, the author of the book, had critisized the choice to cast him.  Brad Pitt is great in the role of Louis. He does well to convey the misery he feels.  Kirsten Dunst as Claudia delivers by far the best performance in the films!  The other supporting roles performed by Christian Slater, Stephen Rea and Antonio Banderas are also brilliant.This film is dark and gothic and in some places like a black comedy.  One of my favourite scenes of the film is when Lestat discovers Louis killing Claudia and picks up Claudia's dead mother and dances round the room with her declaring ""there is life in the old lady yet!""  there are also some horrificly frightening scenes where Lestat is set on fire and later when Claudia and her new vampire campanion are killed by the sun light and again when a vengeful Louis kills sleeping vampires.I find I like this film more and more each time i see it and would recommend this film!

"Too bad it wasn't done in the style of a ""Vox Populi"", since that's about as much as I could've taken of what this particular vampire had to say.","When we begin, we begin with a quite wonderful opening crane shot detailing the night sky of San Francisco before rearing downwards onto the embittered road level; the camera moves through an array of people on a street lit only by the meekness of an array of tall lamps, as various folk are pushed through with a real sense that the track is trying to get somewhere specific, as if trying to look for someone. Alas, we settle on that of a motel room; a cut to within revealing that of a man standing with his back to us gazing motionlessly out of a window, as a second man jitters together some sound equipment with a far more animated disposition. If the opening crane shot instilled this sense of looking or desiring somebody to zero in on, it is a shame that it is the man whose story is eventually told we've had selected for us; Neil Jordan's Interview with the Vampire a grotesque spectacle, a spiralling, idiotic freak show of a movie without merit nor a drive for the unabashed and quite disgusting places it goes.It is Brad Pitt playing the titular vampire named Louis de Pointe du Lac, a man who claims to have lived as far back as the late 1700's and is on the way to being immortal, all of which was born out a certain meeting with a certain someone whom gave him unspeakable ability under this guise of what many refer to as Vampirism. Here and now, in the late 1980s, he meets with a reporter named Molloy (Slater) to lay bare his tale, a character fronting the titular interview; Molloy very much acting out the role of the audience in regards to probing certain quandaries and reacting to certain revelations. Jordan's film is little more than a repulsive, flitting circus side-act feeding, if you excuse the pun, off a core premise reading: ""there's a vampire in contemporary times ‚Äì he's had to kill people to live but never felt good about it; he's lived for two hundred years, and stuff's happened during that time."" Whilst later helming 2005's more rounded and, in comparison to this, certainly more successful Breakfeast on Pluto, as a curiously offbeat male hopping from instance to instance; from locale to locale, some stranger than others; some funnier; some scarier, not once are we provided any stone-wall reason to get behind Pitt's du Lac nor find anything of what happens in Interview with the Vampire remotely anything more than a big, fat and bloody waste of time.We begin with du Lac's life taking a turn for the worst when he looses his wife and child, suicidal ideation then following before he meets that of Lestat; a vampire whom does what is necessary to turn du Lac into what he is, doom him to immortality but essentially grant him a new ""lease of life"", so to speak. It is Tom Cruise playing Lestat, an overly encroaching role for a man we usually rather enjoy watching, or indeed backing, in whatever predicament in whatever other film we've seen the man in - a role here which we have precious little pleasure in watching him play, and one in which he brings an aggressive amount of overacting to proceedings. Through a lot of blood; some frayed morals running in sync with a lot of flayed other stuff, du Lac succumbs to his torn mindset and comes to kill a human being in order to survive.Life as a vampire sees these curious beings waltz around sporting big, bulging eyes; veins all over one's face and neck and generally look a little worse for wear as is. In spite of this, they are a big hit on the social scene and especially with the women of the piece. Du Lac and Lestat whisk from one place to another, du Lac's desire to spare human's and seek a more concrete understanding of life as a vampire seeing his philosophical demeanour in stark contrast to that of his friend and rival's lust for blood and misogynist indulgences which often lead on to an array of agonising female death's misguidedly precipitated as cinematic spectacle. Issues open up with the introduction of Kirsten Dunst's character Claudia, the indulging in her relationship with Cruise problematic if only because that old ""unreliable narrator"" scourge rears up; an hour or so has gone past and nothing in this guy's life has changed, we're continuing down the blood-lust trail full of murders, of which nobody else around appears to notice, and everything's just a bit gooey and unpleasant.Long after Pitt's character has 'died' within, the film has died on its feet; a deeply unpleasant film covering what is effectively just a lot of killing and nonsense dressed up with tonally self-important voice-overs and this sense of the grandeur: a lot of time goes by, he travels the world; meets an array of people, some die and some do not ‚Äì all of it amounting to very little bordering on absolutely nothing at all. As du Lac questions his own existence and reasons for presence in this world as what he is, we begin to question why it is that we're all hearing his banal tale at all; a flimsy, misjudged biopic of somebody whose premise for coming about to even exist looses weight very quickly and just becomes very dull on top of what is a bloody, episodic chore covering a great deal but doing very little. The similarly constructed Forrest Gump arrived in cinemas mere months prior to Jordan's mess, a genuinely humorous; fun; life-affirming piece hopping through the ages with a joke every other thirty seconds covering this man's life from one instance to the next - begging the question: why stand when you can sit?",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lestat is GOOOOD! (gasp and drool),"Okay. Now that I have that out of my system, here is my review. This is an excellent movie. You can't really say that either the book or the movie is better, because they both have their good points. The movie, for instance, has a plot that moves along smoothly, great acting, and it just has this whole irrisistible feel to it. Like you want to be there.

Wonderful.,"There are a number of reasons as to why opinion is so divided over the board in regards to this movie.  I could state several, but I would rather emphasize the point that most individuals tend to overlook: this is not a horror movie.  In fact, neither the movie nor the book were intended to fall into that particular genre, but rather, they were meant to provide a look into what the life of a vampire may be like.As director Neil Jordan has said, there is an inherent problem in this when it comes to translating the concept to a narrative:  since vampires are immortal, the threat of danger is practically non-existent.  As a result, we must settle for the emotional corrosion that everlasting life can cripple one with--a concept that is perhaps so farfetched to today's populace, who would rather identify with more realistic matter, that it becomes impossible to grasp and come to senses with.  If somebody is going to be a monster, it is much more entertaining to make them out to be droning, thoughtless creatures, as opposed to the philosopher which Anne Rice argues develops over time.  At the very least, there's action to be seen in the screen when this is the case.Given how much I adore the novel, I was surprised at the overwhelming response I had when I finished watching the film.  Typically, movies based on literary works tend to exclude much of what makes the original material a joy to experience, opting to include only the elements and feelings that are discernible throughout as large an amount of viewers as possible.  Yet this work manages to convey nearly all of the base elements of the novel, particularly in the mood and in the feelings of the characters involved. Lestat is as charismatic here as he was in the novel;  Louis is still the very definition of detachment;  Armand, the one who purports to know all, once again hints at the fact that he is as insecure as Louis about immortality;  and Claudia retains the very essence of evil that was multiplied tenfold in comparison to every other character in the story.  She remains as vindictive as ever, though to a slightly lesser degree.There were two substantial changes that were made from the novel which require mention.  One is that Armand is now featured as an adult as opposed to an immortal with the body of a teenager.  It works for the better, and did not irk me, but it simply makes you realize that out of just about any literary work, Anne Rice's characters are perhaps some of the most complex to adapt to film;  imagine casting a six-year old girl to play the part of Claudia.  The performance Kirsten Dunst gives is beyond belief even for her age, but it does bring me to the second point:  it appeared as though Claudia was toned down just a bit from the novel.  In it, she was constantly immersed in books, and in addition spoke with rather evolved vernacular, which gave the haunting image of a true adult trapped in the body of a child.  In the movie, however, Claudia retains a large amount of her immaturity due to her somewhat plain dialogue, and she even resorts to speaking like a child in a few scenes, as when she says, ""I shall never ever grow up.""  The innocence is portrayed fine due to the movie not showing any of her kills in action, but the character lacked a certain edge... which is surprising, considering how faithful all of her other action were to the original work.There remains not much to be said, other than to state that this is an extremely ""classy"" movie, with some expertly handled sexual innuendo that seduces just as strongly as that of the novel.  Watch it knowing what you are getting into firsthand, and take delight in some of the most unique and captivating characters to be created in modern literature.  And keep in mind that this story, as Anne Rice has stated, is more about us than vampires. It is a wonderfully introspective piece of work.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not normally a HUGE vampire fan, but this is one of the best movies. Brad is so hott!!!","This movie is one of the best out there. It has drama, a little bit of comedy, and horror, everything a great movie should. Brad Pitt, in my opinion was the best actor in this film. His portrayal of a life shattered by loss and heartbreak was phenomenal. Tom Cruise was also good in this movie, though didn't have the same quality as Brad. I never would have thought Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise would be good playing VAMPIRES in a movie, but they were breath-taking. I don't watch sci-fi movies like this, but once I heard the actors names that were in it and saw the first scene, I knew it was a great movie to be seen. Kirsten Dunst was great in this film too, and the famous line of ""I want some more"" is definitely the most memorable and best line in the film! Also, Brad Pitt is MUCH hotter than Tom Cruise is, as a vampire (and in real life, ha ha).:-D",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Spectacular !,"This is definitely one of the top most memorable vampire movies out there. A definite classic, it takes its story from the vampire's point of view and shatters everything we think we know about them regarding Vlad the Impaler, crosses, bloodlust and nearly everything else. Tom Cruise is at the height of his career with this role that he should most definitely reprise, Brad Pitt and Antonio Banderas as both spellbinding and Christan Slater makes the most of the scenes he has. My favorite of course is future babe Kirsten Dunst who plays the female vampire trapped immortally and eternally as a child. The only thing that gets me through the rest of this is the hope that Pitt finds away to bring her back, but seeing Cruise's incessant returns just when you think he's really gone also kept me watching. Lestat's and Louis's odd twisted partnership of less than friends and more than enemies is very similar to that of Barnabus And Angelique on TV's Dark Shadows. The whole surreal situation seems to be the real plot of the movie and the true calling of the Anne Rice material. Ten Stars to this film, its stars and its legacy !",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brad Pitt in his prime,"Recently I saw this again after many years and just one aspect of the film really stands out...Brad Pitt. I defy anyone (male or female) to watch this performance and not be mesmerized by Pitt's sheer animal magnetism. I dare say it was the most erotic portrayal by a male actor since Valentino. Heartthrobs Cruise and Banderas all but disappear when sharing the screen with Pitt. When ""Vampire"" came out in theaters it was such a phenomenon that thousands of Goth-kids around the country grew their hair out to try and look like Brad. But there was only one original. The sad thing is that he cut his hair soon afterwards and has never given another performance that burned up the screen like this one.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Maybe a worthy novel, but hardly a worthy film","Neil Jordan's Inverview with the Vampire strikes me as one of those films which can only be appreciated if you read the novel, which I have not. Like Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein (which came out in the same year) this is not really a horror film, it is a glamorous Gothic drama, but not a very good one. Quite frankly it is boring, lacking in direction, and features too much dialog which is intended to be poetic or melodramatic, but instead strikes me as silly.It starts in a tiny hotel room, with a journalist played by Christian Slater. He is interviewing Louis, a dapper young fellow, who proceeds to dictate the story of how he became a vampire. It started when he met L'estad de Lioncourt in 18th century France, who offered to show him the the ways of darkness. From there the story becomes a series of strange chapters, decade after decade, century after century. If I was in Slater's shoes I would be asleep, long before Louis finished his story.One of the differences between novels and movies is the amount of story. A book can take as much time as it wants, while a movie needs to cut things down a bit for structure. It is for this reason that I am sure Interview with the Vampire is an excellent and very intriguing book. As a movie however, it is a dud.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"beautiful, compelling, unique...","I just watched this film for the umpteenth time on DVD and haven't tired of it one bit. Never one to be easily impressed by a film or won over by gore or special effects, my love of this particular film is rather deep.To start with Neil Jordan is a marvellous director, who has brought us such classics as The Company of Wolves, The Crying Game and The Butcher Boy. This man is a genius of vision and brings out the most honest performances from his cast. I don't think that we will ever see a better performance from any of the actors. It was, unfortunately, Kirsten Dunst's zenith of credibility at such a young age, nothing that she has done since has come close to her brilliantly painful, evocative performance here as the tortured Claudia. Nor is it likely that Brad Pitt's morose Louis will be outdone with any of his other roles (nay, I think Louis even outdoes Pitt's portrayal of Jeffrey Goines in 12 Monkeys). And Tom Cruise has never been so powerful in a role. All three bring wonderfully nuanced subtlties to their roles as the vampire trio and it is enormously compelling and emotionally touching to watch them on their journey.Every detail of this film, from Philippe Rousselot's award-winning cinematography to the wonderfully detailed art direction and Stan WInston's always reliable makeup and effects, are exceptionally created and add to the brooding mood of this film. Without Elliot Goldenthal's sombre, beautiful score which was shamelessly beaten at the oscar's by Hans Zimmer's score from THe Lion King, the film would been very different. The moving string and choral melodies and horns provide such a marvellous atmosphere.The story itself is so heart-breaking and involving. If you let yourself into the world of the vampire (which is rather accessible through the afforementioned cinematic techniques) Interview with the Vampire proves to be a beguiling and unique experience. It is a soaring emotional journey, a quest to not only find the meaning of immortal life, but the very reason for existence.I am greatly moved and satisfied by Interview with the Vampire each time I watch it. It is a great shame that the sequels (which were obviously originally planned to follow on closely from this film - or so the ending suggests) were not handled by the same crew. Queen of the Dammed (actually the third book in the Vampire CHronicles - they skipped The Vampire Lestat) is rather pitiful and lacks the depth and intelligence of Interview with the Vampire. Hopefully if others are to be made, Neil Jordan, or someone at his level, will take the helm. If not, at least we are left with this beautiful film, for there is no other vampire film quite like it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Louis, the heart of the drama","What has made this vampire-themed film stand out is that it shows a struggling, passionate immortal torn between his enduring respect for human life and his very nature as a vampire to kill. Were it not for this bit, the whole thing would become an empty, spiritless shell. And therefore, of all the roles in the drama, the most difficult one being played was that of Louis a vampire with a human soul, an immortal with a mortal's passion¬°¬±, striving to keep whatever humanity remained in him.Brad Pitt, with his fine performance and his uniquely exquisite elegance, portrayed accurately a guilt-ridden, suffering Louis to a great extent. Tom Cruise, too, did well in his part as Lestat, whose relentless, playful attitude towards life formed a striking contrast to Louis's reluctance to slaughter the innocent. Kirsten Dunst pulled off being cast as Claudia, a fierce young killer who moved many hearts by her sheer love for Louis.Indeed, the whole worthiness of the play came to an end when the last breath in Louis that was human had died, and when all his passion ¬°¬∞went with her golden hair                                                      .

The Taste of New Blood,"In truth, I believe that the last comment that I had seen was slightly incorrect in a slight number of ways, although will state for those who have not seen the movie... it is a wonderful representation of Vampires and their uniqueness rather than the primal Dracula with his comical and yet semi-boring journal resources as the story.This is far different. This is not the memory of a number of people who have limited ideas. This is the knowledge of a single being whose life has been that of a Vampire with an actual soul for kindness and knows when there has been wrongdoing. He is a fair-natured man, although the paradox being that he is a fair-natured beast, a Caring Vampire. However, Lestat is much more memorable than Louis from what Louis states.The best quote I found of the movie is merely the fact which I find is very correct and well put into irony.""Evil is a point of view. God kills indescrimanently, and so shall we. For no creatures, under God, are as we are. None so like him as ourselves.""I shall not tell anymore of the movie in that manor, but I do believe in the fact that each vampire is singular, not just in power but personality. Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas, and Brad Pitt expand the personality of the book characters. Although I know friends who say that the characters on the movie are not as good as the story, I quite think the opposite. The movie characters are by far much greater than those of the novel the movie was based on.As a person who likes Gothic movies, join the many of us who likes this and watch the movie.

Drink From Me And Live Forever.,"Having learned a little bit about what might be like to be a vampire(through my readings, and in a fictitious sense), finally I have had the chance to see what the movie ¬ëInterview with the vampire' was like. As I kept watching it, I found myself liking it more and more. It had a very intelligent story, a great cast and gory scenes where human blood was the main menu for our blood-thirsty characters. Vampires might be complex people, but in this movie they are also intriguing and fascinating creatures.The undead are among us and livelier than ever, in this spellbinding screen adaptation of Anne Rice's best seller. Louis is lured by the charismatic vampire Lestat into the immortality of the damned, then tormented by an unalterable fact of vampire life: to survive, he must kill. Interview with the Vampire offers enough thrills, shocks and fiendish fun to last a lifetime... and beyond. What a sheer delight it was to watch this movie. Now you might find that comment a little bit hard to understand, considering the topic that the movie is covering, but I found myself really consumed by the story of the film. Based on Anne Rice's best selling novel, the story is brought extremely well to the screen by the screenwriter, director, cinematographer, and the actors. Director Neil Jordan did a fine job in creating an eerie kind of existence for the vampires in the movie and also does justice to an incredible story.The screenplay was written by Anne Rice, and I am certain that she would have put all the vital aspects of her book within the screenplay. The part I love about the story the most, is the way the we get it told by one of the main characters, Louis Pointe du lac, as he is being interviewed by a reporter (Christian Slater). It is also interesting to see a vampire story that shows how important it is that these people really need a family to feel happy, not unlike us mortals, is it?The cast of this film is also of the finest quality. Tom Cruise proves why he is such a great actor in his role of Lestat de Lioncourt. He is a really impressive vampire, with his character's subtle humour a real highlight. Lestat makes a vampire out of Louis Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), who is as equally as good as Cruise. I really like how his character shows that he is extremely uncomfortable in the immortal phase of being a ¬ëvampire'. The way Pitt tells the story was really interesting. I am glad I have found roles that Cruise and Pitt were good in, as I have had mixed feelings towards both of them as actors in the past. Their performances in this film have in some way vindicated themselves to me.Yet the actor that was the best from my prospective is the very young Claudia (Kirsten Dunst). She is a real revelation as the old vampire that never ages. I mean however young Dunst was when she played this role (12 I have heard), she did a remarkable job in such a complex role. She reminds very much of what Haley Joel Osment was like in ¬ëThe Sixth Sense'. Having had a mixed opinion about her career in the last 12 months or so, it is great to see that she got it off to a good start. I also liked the vampire Armand (Antonio Banderas), and although he had a small role, he was still very affective.The people behind the scenes of ¬ëIWTV' also need to be commended. The make-up department, headed by Stan Winston (with Michelle Burke) did a remarkable job with the actors playing vampires in the film. Cruise, Pitt and Dunst all were enhanced by make-up, which made them look all so wicked and evil. The cinematographer, Philippe Rousselot and production designer, Dante Ferretti, both did amazing jobs in this film. The look of the story being retold was terrific, as it had the feel of something like ¬ëSleepy Hollow'. This was due mainly to the way the camera looked at the many things, especially the way these vampires act in the world with normal humans, and how depressing it could be, to be a vampire.I really am kicking myself, considering that this movie was made 9 years ago, and I have only watched it now, which is almost criminal. I believe that Anne Rice's book ¬ëInterview with the vampire' would have to be a great read and I might try and get around to reading it, as I do have one of my own vampire novel, that was a really good read. I especially like the conclusion to this movie, as it is not only satisfying, but surprising as well. The main reason for watching this film was so I could get to see 2002's big hit ¬ëQueen of the Damned', a film that is once again based on Anne Rice's story and looks into the extraordinary world of vampires. I have seen ¬ëQOTD', and to tell you the truth, it was a terrible movie, nothing like this one. It is well done to all involved with this film and it has become part of my growing movie collection.CMRS gives ¬ëInterview with the vampire': 5 (Brilliant Film)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Dark & Sophisticated Tale With A Special Message,"One of the greatest things about Anne Rice is that when you read her material, she has all this strange symbolism hidden and tucked away in every corner of her stories.  And like she says in the beginning before the movie starts, this movie is about us, and not just vampires.  In truth, I didn't really quite understand that, but I guess now I have a distinct idea of what she means.Anyhow, I love ""Interview..."" for it's haunting message and the sophisticated and old fashioned image that surrounds this film.  Vampire films are usually like this, and they are also romantic in their own way. This movie isn't as romantic as ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (I mean the 1992 one), but like ""Dracula"", it's dark, it's haunting, and very suave.  Anne Rice has a very sophisticated imagination, and who knows what runs though her mind to expand her creativity.  Whatever it is, it turns her work into masterpieces.For me, reading Anne Rice is like staring at a painting.  When you stare at modern painting in an modern art museum, you try to figure out the meaning behind the painting, and when you read Anne Rice, you try to figure out the meaning behind each story she writes.  Of course, you can expect that from ""Interview..."".I loved the set to this film, especially the Theatre Des Vampires, and the costumes are just brilliant!I thought that Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt gave wonderful performances as the playful Lestat and the gentle Louis.

Initiative take on the life of a vampire - a must see!,"When I first sat down to watch IwTV I had no idea what is was about and no expectations so I was overwhelmed by the amazing plot, direction and of course acting. Dunst shows strength and depth of emotion in her role as Claudia which I have never seen from a child actor/actress and which is often lacking in many adult performances. Dunst and Pitt portray the very ambiguous relationship between Claudia and Louie with such aptness that even after Claudia has been killed I was still changing my mind and trying to decide whether as a couple they were father and daughter, siblings or lovers. We cannot of course forget the characterisation of Lestat de Lioncourt by Tom Cruise - truly magnificent. Cruise and Pitt together offer the compelling difference in attitudes, towards the Vampire existence, of Louie and Lestat without over dramatising the characters. The characters written by Ann Rice here truly excel: Louie, grieving his dead wife and child has nothing but contempt for his new found life, power, eternal youth and sees it only as a perpetual hell of damnation; and Lestat on the other hand sees his existence as his saving from the dull and meaningless human existence and approaches everything with an optimistic outlook which is rarely disappointed but Louie starts to bring him down and Claudia appears to be the solution. That she is until she becomes ""insane"". The way the plot then twists the characters around so Louie sees reason for life with the `rebirth' of Claudia and Lestats loss of passion due to the arguments with Claudia and Louie followed by the dramatic scene of the attempted take on his life. The story stays realistic though as no one does a full 180 in personality terms however long they live so the characters are brought right back to their original mind states when Louie meets Armand and Claudia is killed and when Lestat feeds upon the interviewee. Masterful script writing on all counts. If you are a person that prefers the thrills and spills of big screen action then you may enjoy this purely from the action and gor side but for those who are intrigued by original and interesting script writing, superb acting and powerful visual effects and images to empower the previously mentioned this is the movie for you and very much the movie for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I have never been a fan of Tom Cruise, but think his betrayal of Lestat was brilliant, by far the best I have ever seen him. Brad Pitt as Louis, while good, did irritate occasionally, for example, in his final scene with Armand his continuous monotone became wearisome. Kirsten Dunst also put in an exceptional performance as Claudia the child vampire.Although I have never read the book on which the film was based, I understand the portrayal of Armand by Antonio Banderas was contrary to his description in the book. I have read however, that the director Neil Jordan stated that this was because of the sexual undertones between Louis and Armand. With there already being undertones between Louis and Claudia, Jordan felt that an older Armand would be preferable. That having been said I think that Banderas turned in a captivating performance and truly conveyed a vampire that was ""powerful, beautiful and without regret"".You can keep the Twilights and New Moons etc. ‚Äì this is THE vampire movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Tom Cruise is lovely irritating and my favourite; Brad Pitt is more desparate than ever and has a real character and Kirsten Dunst acts everyone off the screen as little Claudia.

They had only escaped the serious/campy vampire identity via farcical vampire films. But, for the most part, I felt like I was watching ""Pretty Hair of the Pretty Vampires"", or yet another farce. Brad Pitt was pretty then, though, have to admit. But the mistakes, horrid makeup, and strange editing (like they had something to hide in the sets/effects) had me turning it off halfway. Not to mention all the gore, which I didn't remember, and much of it is gratuitous, but I guess the true horror fans will love that. Granted, I am more picky than in 1994, but no reason this movie should be this bad. Even the script (adapted by Anne Rice from her novel) had a lot of sad moments (perhaps the reason I never got through the book). Oh, and don't get me started on Tom Cruise's accent and acting flaws. Brad Pitt is actually out-acting him, which I did not think possible. Of course they were kids then, but still...",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
When Dracula Turns Philosopher and Brad Pitt Sulks in Louisiana,"Imagine being stuck in 19th-century New Orleans: it reeks of rum, voodoo, and humidity. Perfect for a vampire who wants to sulk about his miserable existence for two centuries. Louis, played by Brad Pitt, is the ultimate lord of melancholy-the kind of guy who'd rather starve to death than sink his teeth into a fresh neck. Spoiler alert: he gives in, but with more existential angst than a high school senior during a philosophy exam.Lestat is basically the vampire equivalent of a coke-fueled Wall Street trader. He's arrogant, sadistic, and steals the spotlight in every scene. Tom Cruise cranks up the performance to eleven, but honestly, that's exactly what's needed. The guy's a walking masterclass in manipulation, treating Louis like a glorified intern. Special mention goes to his frilly shirts, which perfectly complement his decadent aristocratic vibes as he drains humans like Capri-Suns.If you thought vampire kids were cute, think again. Kirsten Dunst absolutely crushes it as Claudia, a child-turned-bloodthirsty monster trapped in a young girl's body. Her performance is so chilling even Chucky would feel inferior. She delivers lines with unnerving maturity, constantly reminding you that immortality is a nightmare when you're stuck at 4'6"" forever.This isn't Twilight with sparkles. Anne Rice is the high priestess of romantic, tortured vampires, and the film stays faithful to her source material. You can feel it. The dialogue is razor-sharp, almost poetic, without ever dragging. It dives deep into themes of death, eternal life, and moral dilemmas. Sure, it's about vampires, but it could just as easily be a senior-year philosophy dissertation-except it's visually stunning.Neil Jordan has turned every shot into a living painting. New Orleans is a slimy cesspool of decadence, and the costumes are so elegant they'd make Met Gala attendees jealous. The atmosphere is dark but never gratuitously grim. Every candle, every billowing curtain serves to remind you that you're watching a masterpiece.Interview with the Vampire isn't just a film-it's a lesson: don't become immortal if you're already prone to existential despair. With a brooding Brad Pitt, a demonic Tom Cruise, and a terrifying Kirsten Dunst, this movie grabs you by the throat and drains all your cheerfulness-but with so much style you'll beg for more. It's a work of art disguised as a horror movie, and even 30 years later, we can't get enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent vampire movie. *****,I love this movie with all my heart.  This is my all time favorite horror movie.  It is based on my all time favorite novel series too.  I can't say enough good things about it.Anne Rice is a gothic master of the American novel.  Her work has been captured perfectly in this film.  Tom Cruise and Kirsten Dunst did EXTRAORDINARILY good jobs in their roles.  Brad Pitt was good too.  I have to say I imagined someone different from Antonio Banderas as Armand (but that doesn't mean that I think he did a poor job).I would advise anyone who likes a good vampire movie to see this one.  Just don't expect any trashy blood and gore here.  It is all done tastefully and elegantly.  I can't wait until film versions are made for all of Anne Rice's other novels.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Will Survive the Test of Time,"After seeing the movie at a friends house I instantly went out and bought the novel ""Interview with a Vampire"" by Anne Rice.  Allow me to say that the movie, though missing some key elements, was true to the book in many ways. The characters were brilliantly cast (Brad Pitt as the melancholy immortal Louis de Pointe du Lac, Tom Cruise as the flamboyant Lestat de Lioncourt, and the admirable Kirsten Dunst as the hateful Claudia) and the scenery was created to perfection. An obvious 10 out of 10 that would make even the toughest man alive weep with passion.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

For Those Who Like Vampires,"Interview with the Vampire is an excellent horror movie that sheds light on the emotional and humane aspects of a vampire who is disdainful of his powerful nature to hunt down and kill mortals for their blood in order to survive. While living in New Orleans in the year 1791, Louis, the wealthy owner of a plantation encounters an attractive French vampire named Lestat who understands his desire to end his miserable life after the loss of his wife. In exchange, he must become a vampire so he can live for eternity. Lestat doesn't feel any kind of remorse when he kills people including ""evil doers"", unlike Louis who prefers to feed on rats and other animals instead of taking lives. Things take a different turn when he finds Claudia and accidentally feeds on her which causes his maker to turn this young girl into one of their kind and keep her as their loving daughter. The tormenting questions that Louis and Claudia have always been asking during these long years are: what is the cause of their nature? Why can't they change as the years progress? All these seem to bother and anger Lestat who withholds information from them, which prompts Claudia to plot his death so she and Louis can escape and find other vampires in Europe and other parts of the world. Neil Jordan and Anne Rice deserved so much credit for presenting this great novel to the big screen, as well as Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea for their outstanding performances which were set in San Francisco, New Orleans and Paris.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best Vampire Film ever made!,"I've never been very fond of Vampire films in the past-I like very few of them.most of them are just plain silly(Dracula 2000,Dusk til Dawn,Vampirella,Queen of the Damned,Fright Night,Vamp,Buffy the Vampire Slayer,John Carpenter's Vampires -just to name a few, I think you get the idea)Although I normaly find Vampire films silly -This has got to be the Best Vampire Film ever made! When you compare this film to other Vampire films(see titles listed above)this film is in a class by itself. however this film falls more along the lines of a period drama than a horror story, and it's spellbounding to watch. I got so into this film that I didn't want this movie to end. Several great actors and they all did a terrific job.Tom Criuse gave the best ever performance of his career as LeStat, Brad Pitt also had his career best performance in this film too. The music score is fantastic, the costumes are great, but this film keeps a somber feeling from start to finish. you can't take your eyes off of this film,You dont simply watch this film, you EXPERIENCE it. I missed this film when it was playing at the theater, and I didn't bother to rent it when it came out on video. I was at my brothers house and my sister-in-law played it in thier VCR (The movie had been out for at least 4 or 5 years) So I was a late bloomer to this film.-And I was captivated by it. I went 2 days later and purchased the film. It is one of only 2 Vampire films I have ever purchased for my own personal home video library(Bram Stoker's Dracula-1993 being the other -I also like the Blade films,but I consider them to be action films and not a true Vampire film). Upon watching this film the 2nd time, I realized what a great movie experience Interview with the Vampire is and what I had been missing out on all these years. I LOVE THIS FILM. I give it 5 out of 5 stars- A perfect film",,Anonymous,Horror
Can one adore all actors in a movie?,"'Evil is a point of view. God kills indiscriminately, and  so shall we. For no creatures under him are so like him, as ourselves' (-Lestat)I adored this movie. At first I wanted to watch it because I'd previously liked Dracula with Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins, but this vampire movie was so different! I always thought Tom Cruise got to the top thanks to his looks, but after watching IWTV I know this is not true; this guy is talented to the toes. Some people considered him a 'lightweight vampire' in this movie, but I thought the opposite was true. He did a perfect job in his French haute couture and golden hair. The only thing that could be improved was his accent. Not a very convincing Frenchman, but ok. And he doesn't really reflect Lestat's remoteness, his loneliness and despair for a true lover and companion. Although I've read the Vampire Chronicles, I prefer the movie to it, as it breathes a very rare type of style; Neil Jordan's ""certainly outdone himself"". Antonio Banderas did a perfect job as Armand. He's got this special vibe over him, earlier noticed in 'Philadelphia'. I enjoyed his appearance very much. Kirsten Dunst was the real surprise in the movie. Her eerily precocious character Claudia is perfectly played, only sometimes she read it out straight from the script, that was a pity. Brad Pitt, as usual in a passive though beautiful role was magic as ever, but I think he plays this kind of role too much. Prefer Fight Club and Snatch to it. Lestat de Lioncourt's character was the best, and Tom Cruise played it really well. He was the ultimate one who could scream, bleed, be rebellious and evil. For me, that seems the best role in the part. Nail Jordan's movie was magic. Big compliment to Dante Ferretti also who made the costumes, the actors looked great in French decadence.Yours, Claudia",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I especially loved Tom Cruise who I thought not to be suitable for a role like this. He proved me wrong, he's the best one in this film, his speeches and scenes in this movie (like dancing with that corpse) I'll alway remember. I like to come back to see these movie every once in a while to see the greatness of the acting, the mood the film has, the way it makes you feel.

the world of human immortals,"i came across Anne Rice's original novel before i caught the movie on TV last year(long enough, huh?^^yeah i know it's rated R(A) here and i was not yet 18 then...too much blood, i guess^^) well anyway, i watched it. it was thrilling, but lacked a certain atmosphere of mystery as the novel, nevertheless they did a good job in bringing such a story to life. i guess the mesmerising quality is in the story itself: immortals, eternally young and beautiful, with supernatural powers, walking in darkness with pride, no longer the appalling monsters with fangs. but they are suffering emotionally, once or now (yes even including Lestat) because they all WERE mortals, and some of them never get free of the past.personally i like the art design the most: the buildings, the furniture, the costume (lace, lace, lace^^), and my favourite goes to Armand's Theater, exactly as what i thought when i read the book!the cast was, too, excellent. anyone who says Brad Pitt is not as good as Tom Cruise should go and check the scene when Louis saw the ashes of Claudia and Madeline. i think Brad Pitt was perfect for our most human, tender, weak, guilty (and sometimes fanatic) Louis; Tom Cruise was Lestat the Brat Prince himself, the cunning and devilish boy enjoying his immortal powers; Claudia was an amazing doll-like woman (the performance was almost flawless); Armand, in physical appearance, was not quite the one (he was supposed to be 17 when he became immortal as in the novel), but Antonio Bandreas gave a brilliant interpretation of the experienced yet innocent being (Armand, in my opinion, is the most passionate vampire of all, despite his oh-so-cool looking in this movie^^). as a whole this movie dazzled.but (as i have mentioned, the book was certainly better) there was too much sentimental stuff. (i guess the director wanted us to pity the vampires, but...?) and a large part of the original novel that describes Louis and Claudia's journey to Paris was cut. i thought that part was too good to miss. the later part of the novel was a bit too fast and the story seemed to end in a hurry...after all it was a splendid movie. yet still i strongly recommend the novel to those who want to explore the world of the human immortals. the complete CHRONICLES consist of 5 novels, with INTERVIEW as the 1st. personally i like the 2nd, THE VAMPIRE LESTAT, the best, and really hope that it would be made to a movie, too. there's also the NEW TALES OF THE VAMPIRES, which consist of the beautiful THE VAMPIRE ARMAND and PANDORA so far.and i would like to comment a bit on the *homo* side of the movie that was mentioned in one of the comments...^^well, i guess it was sort of a very strong emotional attachment between the vampires (think of how few there were of their kind). but Lestat and Armand did have some special relationship in the past (no dirty stuff, i guarantee, but very interesting to read) mentioned in THE VAMPIRE LESTAT, and Armand himself was deeply attached to Louis, too. but no relationship parallels the bond between Armand and his maker, the legendary Marius (mentioned in THE VAMPIRE LESTAT and detailed in THE VAMPIRE ARMAND), it was a bit bold, but very touching^^essentially there is NO physical relationship between any vampires, so i hope people get clear of the picture that they are only strongly attached and felt for each other, especially between a maker and his fledgling(s). (maybe not for Lestat: he makes vampires out of fun sometimes^^)so all in all to those who love the movie: read the novels, and i'm almost sure that you'll fall for at least one of the vampires (mine is Marius, for example^^). they're simply lovable.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not bi enough,"It's a good movie, it's well shot, well directed, well acted and the costume and set design is amazing. However it's not entirely accurate to to book as some would claim. Anne Rice's vampires have always been explicitly very bi and queer. The movie had to tone it down in the 90s. Also Armand's inaccurate to later Rice books, Babette is cut, as is Paul (Louis de Pointe du Lac's brother) as is Antoine (a lover of Lestat's) and several book canon very bi Louis and Lestat canon scenes. Overall a good movie and if definitely normalized the bi sympathetic vampire (which Anne Rice did) but it's still not bi enough for me personally as a bi person.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

An Honest Review,"I guess you are supposed to hate this now that AMC changed it and Jordan kept it relatively true to the novelOn one hand, I always Hated the Anne Rice take on vampires...OK, sure, ""Queen of the Damned"" was an awesome and fun book that read like a comic book. It was really good but...but beautiful vampires...no.I applaud the Gay thing. It was written in 1976 well before even don't ask don't tell. It took brass to do that and shame on Neil Jordan for leaving it out. The book, I feel could possibly have done a lot for civil rights, normalize it in the mind of Americans and the movie, with Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and Antonio Banderas, well it could have been as hard hitting as Rage Against the Machine if they left it in.It took pure brass to write in that way in 1976 and feet of clay to leave it out of the movie. And after ""The Crying Game?"" Shame on the producers. That's probably more their fault than Jordan's.Still, beautiful sensitive vampires? No. They feed on blood, wouldn't they have every BBP on earth? Look when it was set? Louise and Lestate should have syphilis.Besides, they are evil, right? Vampires are evil and that is why Blade and Buffy and Harker hunt them and kill them. They aren't beautiful creatures that you pity and love. They are evil creatures that you kill.Anti-Vampire rant aside...the movie is beautiful. Neil Jordan knows how to make movies beautiful and he pulls out all the stops in ""Interview with the Vampire."" It is just a stunning movie to watch.And, though I really do hate how Anne Rice writes vampires...I read her anyway. Her stories are always sublime...with the exception of ""Queen of the Damned"" which was the hard rock version of her otherwise cool jazz stories.Her stories are set in New Orleans--mostly--sometimes Frisco, but they always seemed to remind me of the coldest Chicago winters. It reminds me of when I find myself tucking against the frigid wind as I walk down a street that would otherwise be booming with people and action.Her stories are visceral and sublime at the same time and Jordan captured that well. Even people like me who hate how she writes vampires still read her because of how she writes.The story is as jaw dropping as Jordan's direction.My only lament is that it could have been a civil rights springboard and they passed on that chance to make the world a better place through cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
beautiful sexy thoughtful,I have seen this movie over 100 times. It's my favorite movie of all time. I love Anne Rice. I have gone to 4 of her book signings in Manhattan. I have read all her books. Even the Sleeping Beauty Books. This movie has some of the best looking actors in Hollywood in it. However it's Anne Rice's words that have forever hooked me. Seeing great looking actors say Anne's words was forever intoxicating in the best of ways. You can relate a lot of her lines to real life. Each scene in the movie was like a beautiful painting in a gold gilded frame. Especially when Louis walks in and finds Madeline and Claudia sitting in their home before Claudia asks Louis to make Madeline a vampire.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Bad acting and worse casting, with sparkles of bad dialogue and mediocre story","Tom Cruise is just not a good actor, but it was worse in a role just not for him. Brad Pitt was too young to make a boring role more than that, boring.Visually, is not that bad. It is fitting and the production value is there.But the dialogue and story are just not good. Some attempts to make the movie deep are left to die alone, between repetitive scenes of Lestat (Cruise) trying to convince Louis (Pitt) to enjoy life as ""above human"" vampires. Louis, a depressed human (lost his family) choose survival as a vampire, only to realize how empty life was without love and morals (contrary to the hedonistic antagonist, Lestat, his creator and savor). But again, nothing is really explored. Sometimes, biblical, philosophical and/or poetic phrases come out of the protagonist mouths, but they are so intermittent, they just are not believable. The protagonists IQ go up and down and ideas and themes go nowhere.They missed the chance to at least make a movie about homosexuality in those times (with vampires as the oppressed), because the subtext was there anyways. The vampire that gave eternal life was looking for a companion (a beautiful men) and the man that accepted had lost his wife. But Brokeback Mountain this wasn't.Or maybe it is deeper and I just didn't get it (I won't waste time forcing myself to find meaning, like some vampires did in the movie)Regardless and above anything else, the movie is just too boring.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Of course, Lestat being my fav and all, I think that Tom Cruise was the best actor in the movie. If I had ever had a picture of how Lestat looked in my mind, Tom Cruise looked it.

Great sophisticated vampire film,"So what did I learn from Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles? I learned that Twilight could have been awesome. Interview with the Vampire is the heavily romanticized story that chronicles the life of vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac. It takes place in the present day but is told through flashbacks as Louis tells interviewer Daniel Malloy his life story. The film strongly romanticizes the vampire story, but in a very respectful and successful way. Really, this film is awesome.The movie starts out pretty slow and I wasn't happy with it at first. It seemed too pretty boy and melodramatic for my taste. This was mainly due to the leading actors Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. I found the film ridiculous to begin with, but it slowly picked up and just got better and better as Louis' life grew more tumultuous. The film delves deep into the psyche of a vampire and it is a very unique and fascinating interpretation of the eternal vampire life. The narrative style itself is also interesting because of the way it switches between past and present. The movie keeps your attention from start to finish and any time you think you might lose interest something exciting happens to grab it once more. The film really seemed to take off after the introduction of Kirstin Dunst's character who added a whole new conflict to the film. Looking back I can't think of a time when the film started to drag after it really picked up. I was hooked as soon as a lot of the romanticized BS had filtered through and the film started to get really good.The movie also stays interesting because of its diverse cast of characters that appear and reappear throughout Louis' life. The film boasts quite the A-list cast. Brad Pitt plays the main character Louis. It isn't his best role but he does a decent job for what its worth. Tom Cruise also plays a major role as Lestat, the vampire who first bites Louis, turning him into the undead monster. I was tired of him and his character pretty quickly, but I can't deny that he plays a crucial role in the story. He also plays into the end of the film which is incredible and very unexpected. Other important characters show up throughout the film such as Kirstin Dunst and Antonio Banderas. Christian Slater plays the interviewer and although he isn't in the film much, he's great when he is there.One thing that is so interesting about the film is the amount of time it spans. Louis' story begins in the 1700's and ends in the 1980's. The majority of the story takes place in the late 1700's and early 1800's, making this a period piece with vampires. What more could you want? The filmmakers took this time period and did a lot of good with it. The costumes and sets in this film are fantastic and very fitting for the time period. The research that went into this film is very evident when watching all the visual aspects come together and create a fulfilling period piece experience. The music also compliments the time period very well. The film has a great score anyways, but it is enhanced by the visuals accompanying the time period. Interview with the Vampire is a visual treat.This movie starts out very slow and it can get a little annoying, but give it some time and it will be extremely worth it. This film is a vampire story done right. It isn't for the kiddies and doesn't ever try to be. The film is extremely graphic which is good to be but I'll mention it as a warning for others. If you want a taste of the true potential of the modern day vampire story, watch Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
8 out of 10,"I'm still kind of confused.  Now don't get me wrong, it's not like I didn't like the movie and I have never read the book.  I just heard so much about this movie, that I borrowed it from a friend and watched it right away. Hmmmm...I really don't know what to say, it was great acting in the movie by Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, just nothing really to go WOW about I guess. Kirsten Dunst was adorable as a young vampire.  Honestly I wanted to hug her, she can be my daughter anyday.  Tom Cruise was pretty good pick.  I didn't really enjoy Brad Pitt's character.  He did however do a good job playing it but his character just could've been cooler.  I don't know what everybody is talking about making stomach's churn.  This movie is not that gross at all.  In fact, I had a recent bet with a friend saying this movie is bloodier than Sam Raimi's Evil Dead.  You have got to be stupid or an idiot to think this movie is bloody.  I was expecting much more.

A gothic classic,"POSITIVES:1) Tom Cruise is deliciously wicked and brilliant as Lestat
2) The film is more of a realistic character study than a ""vampire film"" with deep themes explored such as family and aging
3) I love the juxtaposition of Louis' two central relationships. One is his father figure and their relationship is aggressive whilst he is the father figure to the other and their relationship is loving
4) The dialogue is almost Shakespearean; being dramatic whilst also being realistic and relatableNEGATIVES:1) Some of the special effects look goofy and dated
2) It's 15-20 minutes too long, the Antonio Banderas stuff in particular could've been cut down
3) Because the film is mainly a realistic character study more than a ""vampire film"", it felt odd that they chose to keep in the silly vampire cliches of sleeping on coffins, reading minds and having super speed
4) I always hate when films have characters playing an instrument but then shoot the scene in a way where it is obvious that the actor is not actually playing the instrument. This happens with both Cruise and Dunst when they are playing the piano",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"great film, flawed casting","I read and loved the book years before the movie was made. Of course, I painted myself a pretty detailed picture of it in my head, what the characters looked like, the location and atmosphere, etc.When I heard Tom Cruise had been cast as Lestat, I felt like starting a riot on Hollywood Blvd. Blaspheme! And Brad Pitt? Yuck.But I couldn't help myself and had to see the movie all the same. And I was pleasantly surprised. The ""look"" of the film was very close to what I'd pictured, with deep shadows and saturated colors.Even more surprisingly, I enjoyed Tom's performance. He successfully embodied Louis' hedonistic, egomaniacal abandon. Brad, on the other hand, produced exactly what I'd feared: a shallow, pouty performance. I had pictured someone much taller, and more elegant. Brad is cute and all, but sophisticated he's not.And then there was Antonio as Armand. Antonio is a pretty good actor, but the book described Armand as much younger, more innocent-looking, like a choirboy.But Kirsten as Claudia was perfect, and everyone else fit the bill nicely.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bored for eternity,"48 years ago my friends told me to read this new book by Anne Rice , they said it was brilliant. For some reason I didn't and have still not read it of any of her books.

With little else to do tonight I decided to see what all the fuss was about so many years ago and I must say I don't understand it.I give the film 2 out of 10 for the cinematography.The story is trite, unexciting, uninspired, plodding. The acting awful. There is no soul no passion in the performances the actors are just reading the words in a dull way seeming totally uninterested in the whole thing.This is one of the worst films I have seen.Don't waste your time it's not worth it.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best,"I absolutely love the movie ""Interview with the Vampire"".Brad Pitt looks so good with long hair.I think he is so great in this movie he really brings out Louise.The movie just really brings out the book and I think its great",,Anonymous,Horror
Cruise and Pitt make it a fun journey,"Dreary and dark and still fun to watch. I think that's the key here when saying Tom Cruise was the wrong choice... it may have been to over dramatic in the boring way without him. With Cruise, it was over dramatic in a nice, fun way. For all it's faults, the film is entrancing because of the amazing atmosphere, detailed sets, and charisma of the leading actors. They do a little bit too much harping on the same subjects over and over again, or maybe its just the screen writing being too repetitive in how they explain Pitt's characters constant inner struggles. The ending also feels out of place and forced, however, it's not enough to ruin an otherwise interesting watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of The Best Vampire Movies,"I liked this movie, the story is excellent and well class actors, such as Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. I thought that for the most part he took the show all the way. One of the best vampire movies that I have seen. So for this being one of the good vampire movies out there with all-star leading actors, and just delivering a great story, Interview with a Vampire becomes one of the best movies that I have seen, Director Neil Jordan captures an excellent way to tell us a story that we enjoy and just letting this actors do their own thing, I really enjoy this film.

Brad Pitt vs. Tom Cruise,"Very interesting movie. Perhaps not good, at all. And perhaps you shouldn't even see it. But for a Brad Pitt fan like me, I thought it was an exceptional viewing.A man down on his luck is throwing away his life. A vampire invite him to either death, or becoming a vampire. He chooses the life of the vampire. The two vampires then join together to learn what this new life is really about.There's really not much more of a story than that. It's a really gothic film, and dark. The acting is not very good by Brad Pitt, and it's definitely not a good movie, if even average.Watch if you want. I definitely would for Pitt.3 Stars",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Haunting,"A Vampire who wanders in eternity.Louis(Mr Pitt) seems more a doomed immortal man.He hates his condition.This kind of vampire reminds me of the angels in the German film ""Wings of Desire"",we should call it ""fangs undesire"".Louis is in constant company with a young ambiguous girl,played by Kirsten Dunst and she was brilliant,all that professionalism in that short age(she was only 11)and then she appears in ""The Virgin Suicides"",one of the greatest film of 1999.Dunst became a cult actress with honors,this year she impressed me again in The Cat's Meow,I think this is her first role as a woman,maybe she could transcends(as Jodi or Kinski did) to a more grown up actress without losing her charm.Ah! Kirsten is a lucky girl too Did you know that her first kiss on screen was with Brad Pitt? yes,in interview with the Vampire.Kirsten was blessed from the start!.",,Anonymous,Horror
"wrong reviewer, right movie...","OK..I am a Rice fan, and a huge fan of the novels. I have nearly all of them memorized. And you are also correct in saying Kirsten Dunst WAS Claudia..she crushed this role. The rest of the cast acted well, they just lacked any physical resemblance to the characters in the books, I can forgive that.I do however have to take you to task for saying this movie lacked depth, and as such was just the story of a vampires life. Did you not pick up on the irony Louis endures? When faced with death, he's offered immortality, he accepts like 99% of people would, only to find his new immortal life is even more miserable than the one he was about to leave. He must kill to live yet with every killing he wants to die himself, only that is damn near impossible now. Granted the film didn't outwardly show this as a conflict, if you had read the book you'd know that was vitally important to the story of that book as well as subsequent books.Also, the creation of Claudia is a sub-plot, that has more bearing on the entire Vampire Chronicle series than anything else in that story. Claudia and the defiant creation of Claudia bears importance all the way to the newest book of the series. Again you would have had to read the books for that to mean anything more than what the film portrays...Had you read the book you would have also known exactly why Armand and his band lived as they did, where they did, and who was really behind their ""revenge"" and eventual death sentence to Claudia..all of this adds up to a film that was deep without appearing deep, because the depth comes later. Anne Rice wrote the books much like Quinton Tarrantino directs movies, not in chronological order..Interveiw, takes place in the 80's and tells a story 200 years in the making...Yet in later books she goes back over 6000 years and gives the complete synopsis of dozens of characters, leading up to Louis and his ""interveiw"" they also tie all that together allowing you to ""know"" why louis is the way he is, and why Claudia was significant..By the way, I found interest in the series after seeing the movie first, and even having never read any of the books previous to the movie, I could tell there were reasons behind everything. That was what drew me to the books was because I wanted to know the ""why"" of it. In hindsight, I think the screenplay was written like that on purpose. Anne Rice helped write it after all.You aren't a Rice fan or a fan of the chronicle series, so forgive me for my bluntness when I say you aren't the one who should review this movie. Instead of looking for a ""self contained summary on the meaning of life""..look at this movie as chapter one of nine.This movie was light years ahead of the next movie Queen of the damned, which IS the Hollywood glitz-fest written by idiots for idiots...",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Adaptation of an Interesting Novel,"This was a film that I remember watching when it first hit the movie channels back in the 90's. I think I've only watched it all the way through a couple of times. It was one that thought that if I saw it was on, I'd jump in and watch it. I've read this novel that it is based on, as well as others from the series as well. There is such a deep, rich mythology here that makes me enjoy this story. I should point out that my most recent watch was at the Gateway Film Center for their vampire winter series.Synopsis: a vampire tells his epic life story: love, betrayal, loneliness and hunger.We start with Louis (Brad Pitt) in a room with Malloy (Christian Slater). He is a writer and this is an interview that Louis wanted to do. He reveals in the first minute or so that he is a vampire. This shocks Malloy who at first doesn't believe, but Louis shows his abilities to prove it. He then starts telling his story.It takes us back to 1791 Louisiana. We learn that Louis lost his wife and child during birth. He is in a deep depression and looking to die. That brings him in contact with Lestat (Tom Cruise). He gives him what he wants but makes him an offer of a dark gift. Louis doesn't fully understand what that means but accepts. He is made into a vampire.We then see Louis sink into an even greater depression as he tries to cling to his humanity. This brings him to the decision to feed on Claudia (Kirsten Dunst). Lestat forces Louis to make her into a vampire. When he can't, but also doesn't want her to die, Lestat changes her for him. This creates a little family of sorts for a time, until they grow to see the monster that Lestat is. Claudia tries to rid themselves of him. They then flee to Europe in search of others of their kind.They finally do in Paris, where they find vampires who are much older. One of them mimics Louis, Santiago (Stephen Rea). This leads him to Armand (Antonio Banderas), one who is even older than Lestat. The problem is that there are rules that these vampires from America have violated and the punishment is severe.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. I wanted to go a little bit vague in my review, because this packs in quite a bit. As I stated, I read the novel and this film runs for two hours. The interesting thing is having the writer of the novel, Anne Rice, be the one who penned the screenplay. I thought she did well condensing things down while getting the heart of her book. Something that struck me with is that these vampires are what Twilight was going for and failed. Rice envisions them to be pansexual and just in love with beauty. It is interesting that they downplay it here as this is a theme she revisits throughout the series. This captures that being changed makes you the most beautiful version of yourself. I can respect that.Another aspect of this story that I love is taking a timeless creature like the vampire and showing them living through different eras. This film has Louis as a slave owner. His slaves believe there is an evil spirit around them and they're right. This causes them to lose the plantation. We see them dealing with the plague in New Orleans, which to be honest, I didn't know this disease struck there. I'm not shocked though either. We then see them moving through Europe as well. There is an intriguing duality from the vampires that Armand and Santiago are with. There is a decadent and being of an old world. This will move into my next point, which is why Armand falls in love with Louis.Having someone as depressed as Louis is great for this story. He is of a new world. He doesn't want to feed on the humans that are around him. He is clinging to his humanity, even though he's a creature. He isn't of royalty like Lestat was before he was turned and he wasn't a boy lover to the rich like Armand or even a child who doesn't understand like Claudia. He is from a world where he knows better and he is stuck in that mind-set. It would make sense he would seek out a human to tell his story to like he does.From here, I think I should shift to the acting of the film which I think is excellent. Pitt brings pain to his look to bring this role to life. He conveys things with his eyes, even though they are altered due to being a vampire. I could still see so much pain in them. He did a great job and you can see how good of an actor he is. I have to say that Cruise is amazing in bringing such arrogance to Lestat. Having read other novels in the line, you realize he isn't as bad a character as he is in this novel, which is interesting. I think from the point of view of this film, it is dead on and the performance is wonderful. Dunst is so young here, but her performance is great. After she's been turned, she channels an older feeling through her character which is crazy due to her age. Seeing the rage is quite believable. I do want to commend Rea, Banderas, Slater and the rest of the performances as well as they rounded out the acting as well.All that is left then to go into is filmmaking. I'll start with the effects. I always forget that Stan Winston was behind them. I love the look of the vampires here. When you turn, you become the most beautiful version of yourself and this captures that. I like that when they're lacking blood do they look pallid and sickly. The eyes are using contacts or at least that's what I'm assuming, which are quite gorgeous and creepy at the same time. There are monstrous looking moments that I was down with. I do know there are probably computer effects moments, but no issues. This has great cinematography and sets to capture the feel of the past. That helps make this feel even more grand. Things are framed well, which helps with the effects as well. I also thought the soundtrack fit what was needed.In conclusion, this is a film that I've thought was good the first time I saw it and it still holds up. There's a lot here with deeper meanings which I appreciate it. I like moving through the eras through the eyes of a vampire and seeing how they survive as well as adapt. It isn't an exciting story so keep that in mind. The acting is amazing and carries it. This is well made well with solid cinematography to capture the settings. The effects are good, which I expect from Winston attached. I must warn you that this is a two-hour long run time. It moves at a good pace though so that helps. This won't be a vampire film for everyone. I do love the take that we get here though.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Whimsical, Sensual, & Romantically Gothic","I love the whimsical, wistful gothic horror it brings to the table. It almost feels like a fever dream with its luscious sets and often uprooted, changing setting, but it's still cohesive enough to be a story through and through. The dream-like quality is accompanied by an excellent soundtrack. I remember finding the ending so fun, but definitely not the main reason for watching the film, as that role is taken by the intriguing relationship dynamic between the given characters. It fits right into this sort of romantic gothic genre, like Wuthering Heights, where there's certainly things being explored when it comes to the depth of human consciousness and bonds between characters, but the plot points that outline these things aren't particularly inventive, and they don't need to be in order to capture interest. The focus is on how dramatic a given scene can be, how dramatic the characters can act, and what their lives are like, being both powerful and othered by their afflictions.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

i loved it!,"What's not to love about Lestat? I think, most appropriately, the movie ""Lestat the Vampire"" should be made. Rejuvenate Tom Cruise into more subtle roles, roles where his acting is first, and not his body. Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst are also awesome. Most importantly, however, is the question that this movie explores: who is more evil? Lestat or Claudia? or Louis for his cowardice? Try this movie. Trust me, it is worth it.",,Anonymous,Horror
The performances are uniformly excellent.,"Anne Rice's ""Interview with the Vampire"" is a gothic masterpiece that delves into the complexities of existence, mortality, and the enduring power of human connection. Narrated by Louis de Pointe du Lac, a centuries-old vampire, the novel unfolds as a chilling confession to an unnamed interviewer.The story begins in 1791 New Orleans, where Louis, a disillusioned plantation owner, is transformed into a vampire by the charismatic and enigmatic Lestat de Lioncourt. Initially horrified by his new existence, Louis grapples with the moral implications of feeding on humans while forming a complex and often tumultuous bond with Lestat. Their lives are further complicated by the introduction of Claudia, a child turned into a vampire by Lestat.Rice masterfully explores the psychological and emotional impact of immortality, portraying the ennui and existential dread that accompany eternal life. The characters are richly drawn, their internal struggles and conflicting desires laid bare with unflinching honesty. Louis's internal conflict between his lingering humanity and his vampiric nature is particularly poignant, as he grapples with the loss of his human identity and the guilt he carries for his actions.The novel is also a testament to the enduring power of human connection, even in the face of monstrous existence. The relationships between Louis, Lestat, and Claudia are complex and multifaceted, marked by love, resentment, and an undeniable sense of family. Their interactions are often fraught with tension, but also reveal a deep-seated affection that transcends their vampiric nature.Rice's prose is both lyrical and evocative, creating a vivid and atmospheric world that draws the reader in. The novel's exploration of themes such as mortality, identity, and the nature of evil has resonated with readers for generations, solidifying its place as a cornerstone of gothic literature.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Regarding those who suffer from apathy...,"Whenever comes the time where a novel is made into a film, I would find it helpful to actually READ the novel before criticizing the movie. Personally, I think the film did an OK job. I do not expect many films to portray the essence of the novel it is based on, if that is the case. One must take into regard the fact that this IS based on a novel, and no one on this Earth can portray Monsieur de Lioncourt EXACTLY how he is in the novel. Cruise did well in getting Lestat's dark humor, his ferocity, and all the other things that make Lestat, Lestat. To those who thought this movie was boring, one must take into account that these vampires are not the mindless, bloodsucking, otherwise stereotypical ones we know of. Anne Rice has given her vampires a mind, a humanity AND an answer to all those questions our stereotypical vampire stories/movies fails to answer. What IS it like to possess immortality? To see everything change around you while you remain the same? To never feel pain, to never see or feel the warmth of the sun? To have to kill another just for you to live yourself? This is what the novel and the movie (to an extent) provides. I pity those who rate the movie badly because they find it boring, or dull, or they don't understand it. READ the novel, THINK about it. But anyway, I give this movie an 8. It is quite good, however, of course, it does not portray the intensity and complexity of the novel itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pitt / Slater,"Before there was True Blood; before there was Twilight; before Buffy, Angel and Vampire Diaries (pah!), there was Interview with the Vampire. An excellent adaptation of Anne Rice's first novel, Tom Cruise's 'Lestat' leaps off the page in all his pomp and swagger. Pitt's 'Louis' is the ideal foil, righteous and idealistic, their partnership melded by Kirsten Dunst's 'Claudia' ‚Äì a terrific performance at the age of twelve.Neil Jordan has a good cast and employs them all well, brilliantly capturing the scope of the story and the essence of its characters. The soundtrack also deserves star billing, a spellbinding collection by Elliot Goldenthal that captures not only the action, but the locations and the era.To me the cleverest layer in Rice's story, from which she adapted the screenplay herself, is the commentary on the inability of some vampires to change with the times, ably highlighted in the closing scenes and the final moment on the Golden Gate Bridge, one of my favourite uses of popular music in film, and so very, very right for that wonderful closing line reprise. There is beauty and ugliness in equal measure, and a grand sweep of storyline that beautifully captures the span of time and the weight of years, the excitement and the ennui.Interview... is a great watch, a thrilling journey full of anguish and melancholy, glamour and guts ‚Äì showing that vampires are by no means the 'youthful', glossy, beautiful creatures that the networks and studios now want you to believe for the purposes of prime-time. So many 80's movies do not stand the test of time, but this is one that will never grow old ‚Äì a must for your list if you have never seen it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"about ""Interview with a vampire"" not being a horror","I had seen the movie and that has determined me to read the book. Both movie and book are miles away from the horror genre. Both are exceptionally profound. The book is better, tough. That may be because of the power of the word. Example: read the section where Louis is awakening to his new vampire ""life"". The sensations, the intensity of perceiving the sounds, colors of the night are astonishing described. One does not need a psychological book after reading ""Interview with a vampire"". Yet those pages are quite impossible to be visualized. The movie, I am keeping in my mind as excellent and quite unique. And I remember that Tom Cruise has searched a way of uncommon vampire biting. He has founded that in the lions attack, he moved half a circle around, then the bite. So professional attitude.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A great film that drags in places but still delights,"Interview with the vampire is a great idea that effortless entertains throughout. Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and a young Kirsten Dunst are brilliantly entertaining throughout the film. Uniquely focusing on the vampire's trauma instead of their victim's trauma, the film allows us to sympasise with what are essentially indiscriminate murderers, but is it really murder if an immortal kills a person instead of one person killing another? Banderas' role especially is a unique one. The film gives the audience the difficult decision of deciding who is a goodie and who is a baddie as we get to emphaise with various characters, with nobody really being in the right. A film this good that does not have a clear hero or a villain is a rare film indeed, and therefore worth a watch.8/10: A unique twist on the vampire genre, where we follow the vampires as the protagonists instead of the vampire hunters.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Concept? Great! Execution? Not really!,"I'll be honest, the idea of making a book and later on a movie about the vampire's past and how he lived throughout the centuries sounds amazing. Especially if done in a form of an interview, so, it's from the first person point of view. Besides, vampires are one of the most popular creatures in pop culture, so it definitely has a lot of potential to be awesome! Not to mention that the cast itself has 2 biggest stars that are still well known today - Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. So, what could possibly go wrong?The story itself is about Louis, who decided to become a vampire because he was upset due to sad events. He meets Lestat that offers him a brand new life. Louis agrees and sadly, this is where the movie goes downhill. So, for the next 15 minutes, it's all just drinking blood, which is supposed to be creepy and set a mystery mood. But it drags on for so long, that these scenes become really boring. And they don't serve that much to the plot. Also, Lestat and Louis later meet a little girl named Claudia, and she also turns into a vampire. What's really weird, is that after Claudia decides to poison Lestat with 2 dead boys' alcoholic blood, and later on drowns him in the swamp, Lestat somehow comes back like a zombie and gets mad at both Claudia and Louis. So both decide to travel around the world.This movie has a lot of shocking scenes, like drinking blood or a naked woman scene in the theatre, in the context of the play. Yet, none of the scenes actually shocked me, they were mostly boring. But it did some things right.First of all, the concept of a mature woman being trapped in a little girl's body was executed well. It's due to the fact that vampires don't age physically, yet still age mentally. I really liked how Kirsten Danst managed to do this role in a realistic way. And I especially liked her piano performances, which are definitely one of the best scenes of the movie. And technically, the film itself was made well. The locations like the theatre look great and so are the costumes, they definitely capture the 19th century style, which makes the film more immersive. It also has some similarities to the Twilight franchise, where vampires have special abilities, like Lestat's mind reading or Armand's walking on the ceilings. Sadly, it's far from perfect. Both Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt didn't act too well, it was very dull, like they weren't invested in the plot. But I can't blame them too much, since it was poorly handled to begin with. And the ending didn't make much sense.I'm actually upset that a great concept like this got wasted on this boring feature. Sure, the female lead actress Dunst definitely tried her best to make the film less boring and I also liked the scene, where Louis sees the sunrise on the big screen for the first in 110 years. Sadly, it had a lot of problems like mediocre acting from the male actors, prolonged shock scenes that aren't creepy, but rather dull, and a not so good plot. Even though I didn't like too much, I'd still recommend it to some fantasy fans, since I'm sure somebody will enjoy the film, maybe they will find something interesting that I didn't. So, it's probably just me with a rather unpopular opinion.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
My Comment,"This was an amazing movie, but if you were to read the book and then watch the movie, you be a bit disappointed.  For one thing, Lois never had a wife, it was his brother who died from falling off a balcony.

But even though those things are wrong, its a very good movie and I liked it a lot.",,Anonymous,Horror
Coolest vampires!,"I was not at all offended that Tom Cruise was to play Lestat de Lioncourt. I was just a kid when it showed in 1994 and I'm so glad that TV showed it in 2005! I love everything, especially Louis' dark mood contrasting with Lestat's bright, crazy spark. And my favorite moments are when the two of them interact: where Lestat says ""Perfect! perfect! Just burn down everything we owned..."" as well as the piano parts. And not to leave out the times they were an unholy family. The costumes were commented as being weird, but I adore them so much.I really think the film followed closely to the book. You should read her books, coz I was hungry for more Lestat after the movie! I dunno about Queen of the damned, though. I would have preferred Brad and Tom to act that too. Queen tried to combine both TVL and the third book, which was bad.

The ultimate vampire experience from an amazing book!,"Inspired by the first book of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, the film Interview with the Vampire is the story of the bicentenary vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac (played by Brad Pitt), a young farm owner from the 18th century colonial New Orleans who, after losing his wife and daughter in childbirth, falls into disgrace and loneliness until he is found by Lestat de Lioncourt (played by Tom Cruise), a vampire from the Old World (Europe) who becomes fascinated by him and ""gives him the choice he was never given"" after attacking Louis at night: accept being turned into a vampire or die. Louis, tired of living, accepts the ""tempting offer"", but ends up entering a depressive spiral of melancholy, sadness and regret, developing a homo-affectionate love-hate relationship with Lestat over the years they spend together. The two hundred years of Louis' life are introduced to the viewer through an interview Louis is giving to Daniel (played by Christian Slater), a San Francisco journalist from the 1990s whom he meets on a ""hunting night"".It is as Louis recounts the events of his life to Daniel that the viewer learns more about vampires and Louis' experiences with Lestat, where we realise that while Lestat is a masochistic and sadistic vampire, a lover of luxury and the ""blood of aristocrats"", Louis has kept his humanity, preferring to feed on the blood of animals rather than humans. Various characters also appear, such as the young Claudia (played by Kirsten Caroline Dunst) and Armand (played by Antonio Banderas). The film, like the book, transforms the monstrous idea of the vampire creature into a sophisticated and sensitive singular individual, serving as a metaphor for the experiences of people within minorities who are seen as outside the social norm. Anne Rice's Vampirism is emphasised by the presence of strong emotions such as Love, Melancholy, Anger, Sadness and Revolt against a society that doesn't allow them to exist, as well as drawing heavily on the ""classic"" elements of the mythology that the creature carries (very present in the film Dracula by Bram Stroker), also placing it as something desirable and attractive to the Human spirit, using the concept of Immortality as a force against moral and social issues.Following Anne Rice's definition of a vampire, the characters present are more human than the stereotype usually associated with vampires (so much so that the current definition of a vampire in POP culture is the one constructed by Anne Rice). The film has a reasonable soundtrack (enough to immerse you in the film), careful lighting work and beautiful sets that depict the two centuries in which the narrative takes place (between the end of the 18th century and the end of the 20th century). With superb costumes in Gothic and Victorian styles and a strong cast, Interview with the Vampire respects and honours the literary work, serving as a chalice of ""fresh blood"" for fans of Vampires and the writing of Anne Rice, despite the fact that some decisions in character development have not aged well with the passage of time and the narrative developments of fiction. I therefore conclude this review with a rating of 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
passionate blood !,"I love this movie, based on the book by Anne Rice. I may have seen it a lot , but it is still one of my favorites! Tom Cruise was the best Lestat by far with his intense passion and fiery anger ! He captured the essence of the character ,and then there was Louis the vampire with humanity. Resenting the dark gift that was bestowed upon him. So in a way they balanced each other out! In this turn of thecentury vampire movie. Of vampires who are trying to find themselves, in society! Surviving on thenectar of life. In order to find salvation, but there is a lot of sacrifice. Betrayal , hate and love. Along the way, lurking in darkness like phantoms in the night. But there was one factor who tried to tear them a part besides Lestat's insanity ! And that was Claudia a sadistic spoiled brat, who wanted Louis all for herself ! A seriously twisted triangle!

What I thought,"I watched this film with preconceived expectations that it would be a masterpiece seeing as how it derived from the masterpiece that is Anne Rice's novel and due to the cast that's brimming with talent. I, however, was bitterly disappointed. The regard by which I esteem Anne Rice for her amazing storytelling capabilities makes me refuse to believe that she took part in the making of this movie! Yet I can't quite pinpoint exactly where the movie went wrong. At times Brad Pitt's acting seemed exquisite and perfect yet at other times it was over-dramatic. One thing for sure this lad was certainly out of his area of expertise. Tom Cruise as Lestat was wonderful. Kirsten Dunst also played Claudia skillfully and so the only thing i can attribute the fail of this movie to is the directing. Also the editing and music choices were awful and over-dramatic.

Pretty Good Vampire Movie!,"The reason I saw this movie is because two great actors star opposite each other in this film. They are the great Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. They were nothing short of spectacular in this movie. I don't know why they won a Razzie award. The other aspects of the movie are good, just ordinary.Louis tells a story in 1991 about how he became vampire back in 1791 and his life between then and 1991. He talks about the vampire, Lestat who blooded him and a bond he made between a young girl named Claudia.Tom Cruise is magnificent as the evil vampire who blooded Louis. His character is very surprising in this movie.The set design is probably the second best thing about the film. The tone is for the most part eerie. Overall, this is a good movie that would be great to play on Halloween. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interview With the Vampire,"The movie was excellent, when i first watched it i was amazed with all the special effects, and the actors Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise, they were great taking part as vampires, they did a good job and made it a good movie. the movie was great! The movie was really good, to good for words really. It was a good horror movie by Anne Rice. All the things what happened in the movie was excellent and amazing how they did it. i think this movie was a better horror movie than all the other horror movies i've seen, and if the makers of this movie are planning a sequel for this movie, then my advise would be, go a head! because the first movie was excellent, and i would love to see Christian Slater as a vampire, that would be great!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ah the olden vampires, how i miss them....","This movie was incredible and amazing display of both Anne Rice's vision and the creature that seems to now fascinate everyone, the vampire. Truly, after watching this I can't understand how anyone could find Twilight to be that amazing. The books were good, slightly addicting but not nearly as enthralling as Anne Rice and her beautiful, fragile and complex vampires. And of course let us not forget the actors of the movie, Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas and Kirsten Dunst all of which made their characters alive (in the theatrical sense, of course). I loved this movie and it encouraged me to seek out the other books to further immerse myself in their world. But overall everything was superb, acting, the attention to detail in costume, set, accents, chemistry. Nothing I would have changed, not even Antonio's obvious departure from what Armand should have really looked like. Let's face it, he was hot, had a sexy accent and he was a terribly good Armand.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best film about Vampires ever made!,"Interview With The Vampire is flat out the best vampire movie ever made. In Interview, we see vampires more as people, who have feelings and are not just the bloodsucking zombies that the orginal Dracula made them out to be. I felt pity for the misery of Louis (Brad Pitt) and unlike others saw Lestat (Tom Cruise) not as a villain but as a vampire who has accepted who he is. Unlike any other film on the subject, we see that vampires can be compared to us.  That during all our lives we feel like an outcast at some point, and vampires are the outcasts of ""demonic"" fiction.  It was also a nice surprise that we saw most of the vampire ""rhetoric"" done away with.  The garlic, crucifixes an stakes through the heart.  It is more realistic to see that vampires can be killed in conventional ways like any human, and not in absurd gestures created to add shock value.  Overall Interview With The Vampire is a ""mature"" vampire movie with characters we can all relate with, the movie actually portrays a sense of relevence.  And to quote Louis when inquired by the interview, Malloy (Slater) about the myth of dracula ""The demented ravings of a drunk Irishmen.""",,Anonymous,Horror
Beautifully Dark!,"I absolutely loved 'Interview With The Vampire' and it is now one of my favourite films of all time!This film has a beautifully dark aesthetic. You become apart of furniture in the protagonist vampire's life. Additionally, I absolutely adored the film's soundtrack. It was both melancholic and otherworldly, which reflected the emotions of the vampire characters.Despite being worried that Tom Cruise would not hold a candle to Sam Reid's Lestat, he was in fact great as the irresistibly charismatic vampire. Kirsten Dunst gave one of the best child performances I have ever seen! She perfectly captured the old soul trapped in a young body.This is such an exceptional film, and I cannot recommend it enough! I hope to get my hands on the books as soon as I can.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
My critical review of my Fav movie,"Since 1976, Anne Rice has kept us wrapped in a world of vampires, and now in 1994 she brings her creations to life. From the director of 'The Crying Game', Neil Jordan, assists Rice as they spin the life story of Louis De Pointe Du Lac, a French-Louisiana aristocrat in the year 1791, his vampire maker and companion Lestat De Lioncourt and their ""daughter"", a child vampire by the name of Claudia.The film starts in modern-day San Francisco, where a reporter is seated, talking to a shadowed figure that is standing by the window. The figure, we quickly learn, is Louis De Pointe Du Lac, a 200-year old vampire. Louis wishes to tell the story of his life to the reporter, Daniel Malloy. With Louis' introduction, he begins his tale. Pulling Daniel and us into the decadent world that is Louis' way of life.Throughout the film we are arrested by an array of stunning sets, beautiful costumes, and ravishing actors. Tom Cruise is Lestat De Lioncourt, a French aristocrat, and an arrogant and ruthless vampire. Brad Pitt embodies the emotional and conflicted Louis, while Kirsten Dunst attacks us with her ability to play a child and then an adult trapped within a child's body as Claudia. Antonio Banderas jumps onto the scene as a vampire coven leader that threatens Claudia's very way of life, whose beauty and youth chill Claudia's already cold heart. And Christian Slater not only plays the role of young Daniel Malloy, but he is also our pathway into this underground world of terror, death and even love.Brad Pitt brings the emotional Louis to life. Pitt expresses Louis' loves, hatred, and pains perfectly. Louis is a man of gestures more than words, instead of yelling at Lestat that he hates him, he glares at him or gives him a cold look. Pitt perfects all of Louis' traits.Called the ""Brat Prince"" and for a good reason. Lestat is a vampire that pretends to be all knowing, when in fact looks more to his creation Louis for answers then explaining things himself. Tom Cruise brings Lestat's superiority to fruition without losing Lestat's inner loathing. Cruise never looses Lestat's arrogant air, even when he's torn between loving and hating Claudia.The ""Demon Child from Hell"" is an excellent title for this pint-sized terror. Kirsten Dunst rocks the scene as the child that will never grow up physically, eternally imprisoned. Dunst balances the swirl of girlhood to womanhood, expressing beautifully how Claudia grows from loving Louis and Lestat blindly as her parents, to falling in love with the ever-brooding Louis. Arrogance, Claudia radiates with the same arrogant air that Lestat holds, both using it to pretend that they know more than they truly do. Dunst is not only acceptable, but, like Cruise is perfect as this blonde terror. The vampire ""family"" could not have been better cast.Known to fans as the ""Botticelli Angel"". Armand is an age-old vampire that scares Claudia because even though he is young, he still is older then her. Antonio Banderas personifies the knowledgeable vampire coven leader. Bringing Armand's knowledge and beauty to the forefront of the stage. Armand makes Louis forget about Claudia for the sole reason of knowledge. Armand is the breaking point for Claudia, for even though she hates and fears Lestat, she wishes to have him back¬ótormenting her¬órather than to have Louis fall in love with Armand and leave her. But, he is no where near the actual age range, for me as a fan of the books,this is completely unacceptable. However, as a whole, I also love the movie.Interview is essentially a tragic love story, with every character playing a domino-effect role. Not only playing their part, but becoming it; sweeping not only the audience away, but also themselves into the decadent and dangerous world of the vampire and Lestat's ""One happy family"". This movie is a must see for any Anne Rice fan, or any fan of the vampire occult.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Existentialist Vampire,"Anne Rice has written a real good book. But as a universal dilemma of book stories being adapted into the screen, there's always the danger of interpretation and it will either by abhorred or adored by those who read the novel. Such is the case with this film because in some parts , it was mellow acting and one can't help but miss the intense fear when reading it. The performances of Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and the young Kirsten Dunst borders on the forgettable for I can not recall a sc√®ne that has left its imprints on me.

Brad Pitt, as usual despite the stigma of him as another ""pretty boy"" gives an awesome performance as Louis, an aristocrat looking for a way out of his painful life. This movie can be summed up in one single line delivered by Tom Cruise on several occasions: ""I'm going to give you the choice I never had."" If you want a movie that is entertaining and delivers a powerful message, that is, the weaknesses and strengths of humanity, give this one a go and pay attention. It's worth it, I guarantee it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Bloody kisses and fancy hair,"""Interview with the Vampire"" is a 1994 horror drama directed by Neil Jordan starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. I've always been fascinated by the myth of vampires, undead and soulless wanderers of the night and and all the small details that belonged to the lore. For now 122 years, mostly influenced by Bram Stoker's infamous novel ""Dracula"", the stories have been retold and adapted ever since. I've almost watched every film that's related to this legend. So it was about time I got to watch this classic as well. First of all it's strange to see such a top-class cast playing in this film. Next to the leading gentlemen we have Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater and a young Kirsten Dunst. Especially the last one gave an excellent performance and managed to stay on an equal level with the others throughout the whole run time. It's just wonderful how said actors harmonise on screen and no one ever steals anyone's show. They all undeniably share a genuine chemistry. Nevertheless, the screenplay shows both, brilliance and slight flaws. The dialogue and how it's written is sheer impressive, just the way it's worded, but the plot also fails to fully give the viewer the chance to sink their teeth into the characters (pun intended). At times they're too distanced and I never managed to reach the level of sympathy for them I hoped to reach. It's not like I didn't care for them, but also the slow storytelling provided that the film suffered from its length at times. A shorter run time would have done better. It may not sound like it, but that's not actually a big deal, there are countless aspects that make this film great. The way this whole production is filmed is just eerie and the cinematography creates a saddening atmosphere. It's a melancholic tale, philosophical and poetic, about life and death, loneliness and love, morals and values. Mostly the character Louis caught my curiosity. He has a lot in common with BTVS' Angel and you know I like that a lot, although it sometimes appears that the film wants to show off how handsome Brad Pitt is with his fancy hair. But he's not the only charming aspect of it: The sets and sceneries are impressively authentic and the costumes are extremely noble and well crafted. Furthermore, the effects and makeup are surprisingly brutal in the first case and seductively modest in the latter case.
Also the ambiguity of the whole vampire theme is clearly noticeable, it has a lot of erotic undertones and sexual innuendos. All in all, this stylish and handsome drama knows how to impress with looks and overshadow its flaws. It's enough to make it an enjoyable entry to the sub-genre, it has the phenomenal cast and exceptional design. It's good, but could have been a true masterpiece instead.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sadness of the vampire,"Maybe the vampire life isn't all it's cracked up to be. The chance to live forever, that's a good deal right? But that deal comes, of course, with complications. Foremost among them being the need to kill. This is something Louis never really comes to grips with. Louis has been a vampire for 200 years. As we meet him, in modern-day San Francisco, he is about to tell his story to a reporter. And what a story it is. But it's a story tinged with melancholy and sadness. Some may embrace the vampire life. Louis though mourns the life he once had, the humanity he long ago lost.It all began in Louisiana in 1791. Mourning the loss of his wife and newborn child Louis just wants to be put out of his misery, to die. Instead, when he crosses paths with the vampire Lestat, he is born to a new eternal life. And immediately regrets it. Lestat more or less embraces his vampire existence. Louis never does. He soon finds himself feeding on the blood of rats. Better that Louis thinks than taking human life. But eventually Louis will have to accept what it is that he has become. He may accept it but he doesn't have to like it. This is one morose vampire. Perhaps what he needs is a companion to shake him from his doldrums. So Lestat gives him one. A child, Claudia. A young girl turned vampire. Louis loves Claudia and protects her. Not that she initially seems to need much in the way of protection. This girl's a killer, she loves the taste of blood. But what happens when she realizes she will never grow old? Will she accept her eternal childhood? No, she will not. And the ramifications for the happy little vampire family of Lestat, Louis and Claudia will be severe.This is a movie with a dark, gloomy feel to it. Necessarily the story unfolds entirely in the nighttime which only adds to the foreboding darkness. The vampire life we see here is anything but glamorous. As modern-day Louis tells his centuries-long story it is obvious he does not feel he really lives. He simply survives. When he had Claudia to love things were better but that story never seemed destined for a happy ending. Ultimately Louis is a lonely man, walking the Earth, feeding on those who cross his path and cursing the dark ""gift"" he was given. Brad Pitt does an excellent job in the role of Louis, capturing all the melancholy, the weight of 200 dark years. As Lestat, Tom Cruise gets a much more flamboyant part to play and he does very well with it, taking the opportunity to chew some scenery but also doing some notably fine acting. Antonio Banderas, who pops up as a mysterious figure late in the proceedings, and Christian Slater, playing the reporter to whom Louis unburdens himself, both turn in good performances. With all the gloominess the film could use a lighter touch here and there and Stephen Rea plays a character who provides a few fleeting moments of levity. But there's a darkness in that character too. The vampire life is not one of fun and games. Perhaps the best performance in the film comes from young Kirsten Dunst playing Claudia. She's a real scene-stealer. Claudia's a woman, with decades of life experiences, trapped in a child's body. She has a maturity which belies her appearance and the actress playing that part had to show that same quality of maturity beyond her years. Dunst does so wonderfully. There's a lot of life that has been lived behind Claudia's young eyes and Dunst captures the essence of the eternal child perfectly. But as good as Dunst and Cruise and all the rest may be it's really Pitt's movie to carry. This is Louis's story. And it will prove to be a rather fascinating story indeed. Louis may not embrace his vampire life but you can definitely embrace this very entertaining movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Mixed bag, great sets and atmosphere","I had watched this in the 90s and remembered it was just OK. I had recently liked some Gothic movies as well as Neil Jordans other movies. I liked The Crying Game in particular and thought it may very well be one of the greatest movies of all time and Ondine wasn't bad at all either. So I decided to take another look at this too as it was available on Netflix. I liked it more than I thought, but it's not a 100 % winner. Not a perfect vampire movie nor a perfect Neil Jordan movie.There are a few really great things about this movie and they are the sets, art direction, as well as some acting (Cruise, Dunst and Rea). They all do absolutely wonderful roles. On the other hand, I didn't like Pitt's acting at all nor Banderas'. Overall Brad Pitt's portrayal is not that bad, it's quite consistent, but in the details it suffers. Many lines are delivered either really stiff or with a theatrical fashion. It looks as if he had trouble with the make-up and not being able to control his facial movement at all, which makes his acting look really unnatural and forced. But he does have his moments and he creates a somewhat likable overall portrait as an opposite to Lestat. (For someone not having read the books.)On the other hand, I really enjoyed Cruises Lestat and would've loved to see Stephen Rea do a bigger role, his small role was absolutely wonderful.One thing I wasn't too fond about this movie either is the fact that it plays like a serious movie, but ends like a blockbuster with a contemporary rock song. It's uneven, feels like something you get when the director and the studio don't quite have the same vision.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Lame, Base, Pretentious","Pale, well-dressed men with long hair go around killing beautiful scantily clad women while delighting in their beauty. They believe themselves to be deep and sensuous and the viewer is supposed to believe that too but, well, there is nothing to impart that belief: slow movement and big ego doesn't suddenly make you deep and sensuous.Perhaps an outcast teenager would enjoy this movie: Louis, 'a vampire with a human heart', tells us that he feels out of place everywhere. The oldest vampire in the world tooks a like on him: guess what, Louis is the only one who can connect the vampire world and the human world! 'You feel out of place, Louis, and this is precisely your strength, you are the only one who can bridge the vampire and the human world, you, Louis, you!' See what I did there?'We mistake our barbarism for sophistication, and our isolation for having special qualities.' The audience can now satisfy its lower instincts and delight in the cruel scenes and in the ego inflation scenes, all quite innocently, because of the fancy shmancy decor and top actors on the cast - surely this must be some quality art? No, it's not.Lame would be an understatement, but the producers clearly knew what threads to pull in order to produce a box-office hit.Why the 3 stars? 3 good things in this movie: The opening scene. Brad Pitt's clothes - really amazing, a delight to watch! Red velvet jacket's my favourite, I think. And Antonio Banderas, who somehow manages to not be horrible despite looking ridiculous with the long straigth hair and no colour on his face.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dunst is fantastic,"This film has to be one of the best vampire films I have ever seen. Not only are the cast fantastic but the set and costumes are brilliant. I don't understand why so many people are angry about Tom Cruise, Brad Pit and Kirsten Dunst being in this film because I think if anyone else played these roles it just wouldn't be the same and they all do an excellent job with their roles. I'm not a fan of Pitt or Cruise because I don't think either of them are excellent actors but after watching this film I realised what talents they do have and it's just a shame that the roles they have played since (especially Pitt) haven't been very good. Dunst on the other hand is fantastic and I think this is an excellent role from an excellent actress. I am dissapointed however that her more recent roles haven't been very challenging at all and they have just been parts in pathetic teen movies (apart from Drop Dead Gorgeous which I think is hilarious and I love Kirstey Alley... I think that's her name). I would really like to see Dunst in more challenging roles because after watching Interview.. I think she could be in a lot more films and she could have excellent parts to play and pull them off wonderfully.

The best Vampire movie ever,"Not very many movies about Vampires are as interesting and unique. First of all I have read some reviews of this film and would like to set somethings straight. The vampires in the movie are supposed to be as graceful and women like because it is in their nature as french men and Vampires. They are very elegant and gentlemanly in there own unique way. The fact that louis and Armand look like girls is only because they are white with death and their eyes are supposed to be that color. Vampires are supposed to be sexual characters that is what gives them half the interest they have. If you have not read Anne Rice's books then you will most likely Not understand this movie because sadly enough the movie does not follow the book but the characters in it do. It is best to have a liking for vampires and their unique charectoristics before seeing such a movie. I enjoyed this film quite a bit, the costumes are beautiful and the makeup is extrodanary. I do suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys Vampire movies at the highest levels. I hope you enjoy the movie as well as I did.

You will be impressed.,,Anonymous,Horror
The best vampire film of all time?,"Surprisingly close to the book, the faults the film has are those of the book.  We might ask for example how come the vampires appear not to notice the first or second world wars  even though they are in Europe at the time.Louis' hair is also a curiosity - a man simply could not walk round in early twentieth century Europe with long hair in a pony tale and not be stared at at the very least.  Since a vampire presumably wants to be inconspicuous this is a problem.There is an obvious homoerotic charge between Louis and Lestat and Louis and Armand, but this is even more marked in the book, and I understand it was reduced in the film to protect the sensibilities of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. Brad Pitt's flat delivery is ideal for the world-weary Louis, though I do think it a pity Anne Rice's suggestion that he should play Lestat was not taken up.I already knew Brad could act, having seen Kalifornia.  This film convinced me that Tom Cruise really was an actor, not just a pretty boy trading on his face.  But the honours have to go to Kirsten Dunst as Claudia, an utterly believable child vampire.",,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty Good,"This is, visually, a stunningly beautiful film.  However, I must agree with Lestat that the whining of Louis (which goes on for centuries) is most annoying.Louis, a poor-me twenty something plantation owner in 1700s New Orleans, is a reckless drunk, devastated by the death of his wife and unborn son in the throes of childbirth.  He spends his time gambling in seedy taverns and whining about his miserable life.  So, instead of putting an end to his sorrow and committing suicide, he decides to become immortal and spend eternity whining some more.  This gets on the nerves of vampire Lestat, the one who made Louis a vampire in the first place.  Tom Cruise (who only ever seems to play Tom Cruise) is an unlikely vampire, though he doesn't do a completely awful job in his interpretation of the arrogant, sadistic Lestat. Dunst is the Vampire Claudia, the eternal child who plays her part flawlessly, enjoying her immortality, her bloodlust and the power of being an immortal.  She gives Lestat a run for his money in the sadism department, merciless as she cuts his throat and instructs Louis to dump the corpse in an alligator-infested swamp.  She is the fiercest and most frightening of the vampire trio.The second half of the movie is where the true power lies, as Louis and Claudia arrive in France and are greeted by the ghoulish Theater des Vampires, led by Armand.  Antonio Banderas in no way resembles an angelic red-haired seventeen year old boy (which is, according to the Book Purists I've spoken to, how Armand was described in the books) but he plays his part with grace and elegance.  Stephen Rea as Santiago is wonderful, a cold, cruel killer who enjoys every second of his sadism.  The theater itself is a wonderful set, filled with catacombs and dusty skeletons.  The plot explodes as Claudia is found guilty and sentenced to death for her execution of Lestat, and the Theater burns to the ground as Louis finally gets a backbone and exacts a brutal revenge.  This scene alone is almost worth suffering through an hour of self-pitying slop from Louis.  The ending was also most welcome, virtually turning Louis, the thus-far established hero, into the butt of a very long joke.I didn't love this movie, but I liked it, my only large complaint being the whining of Louis.  But my personal preference has never been for incessantly complaining Pretty Boys anyway.  I never cared much for the books and have never been a Book Purist anyway, even with books I truly loved (i.e. The Lord of the Rings).  It was a decent vampire film with some truly stunning moments.  It was better than most.",,Anonymous,Horror

interview with the vampire is so cool,I first saw this film when I was about 14. I then read the book although I like the film I proper the book. I think that Neil Jordan should be prasied because the book is such a hard act to follow. The book shows you thoughts and feelings that a film cannot yet show.When reading the book and remembering the film I wasn't sure the actors where really suited to the charaters. But the more I watched it the clear it became why the actors were cast.Anna Rice made the right chose in chosing the scenes for the film. She know the charaters and knew the right way in which to show them. Although I think she should have put in the scene were Lestats dad on his death bed that would have proved just how insencitive he really is.the movie is so cool it is one that i have to get on  video!!!,,Anonymous,Horror
Credit where credit is due,"First of all I would like to say that I was so disappointed that this movie did not get more praise. I think that this is one of the best vampire movies ever! Secondly, if you haven't seen this movie already - where have you been for the last 7 years?! The entire cast is brilliant, and Tom Cruise showed for the first time that he was more than just a pretty face. The costumes, make-up and scenery are wonderful. Having read the book (and many other Anne Rice novels), I must say that this is one movie that I feel surpassed the book itself. It brought the characters alive and maintained the atmosphere throughout. Some may object to the violence or ""gruesome"" bits but to be perfectly honest, what kind of vampire movie would it be without it?! Personally, I think that it is an essential part of the genre and would have been somewhat disappointed without it. An all over great movie that I cannot fault. I even liked the long hair.

amazing is the only word that comes to mind......,"amazing is the only word that can describe this movie...i am an Anne Rice fan, and i have read all her vampire chronicles and most of the rest of her books...since the screenplay was written by her, the movie captures everything about the book that should have been captured...Lestat is finally portrayed in the flesh, a chance for all us Lestat admirers to see what he really might look like (though i doubt he looks like tom cruise) tom cruise plays lestat brilliantly, and brad pitt captures every little depressed mannerism of louis....and the most surprising performance was that of kristen dunst...her portrayal of claudia was absolutely horrifying (in the best sense of the word) her character was supposed to be horrifying, a mature woman trapped in a child's body, and kristen was perfect....her make-up made it all the more real. i believe this is one of the most amazing movies of all time, and truly it tells how it is, not how we think it is!",,Anonymous,Horror
"Interesting, but didn't understand some things","It is an interesting movie, but I didn't really understand what is the moral of the movie.
However, some of the reviews here on IMDB can explain it a little better. 
This movie is definitely better for people who read the book and they will probably understand it better, however, as some people have pointed out here, it is probably about a vampire searching for meaning of eternal life.The movie nicely portrays old times, the decorations, costumes, scenery are quite nice. 
Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt acting are nice. The main actor in the movie is Brad Pitt.There were some confusing moments in the plot and I'm confused why the characters made certain decisions or certain things happened, so that's why I give it a 7, because even if you didn't read the book, you still should pretty much understand everything that happens. Great example are LOTR movies, where the story is explained quite well.",,Anonymous,Horror
Great adaptation of Rice's novel,"*** 1/2Starring: Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, and Christian Slater.A plantation owner in New Orleans has lost all of his life to live.  Then, a vampire offers him to turn a vampire, and he accepts.  The story then follows the rest of his life until he does the interview about his life.If you have read the novel, you will probably like watching the movie better.  It is a wonderful adaptation and I highly recommend it.",,Anonymous,Horror
More Than Your Average Horror Offering,"A story of love, betrayal, loneliness, regret & hunger, Interview with the Vampire is a strangely alluring, wickedly amusing & surprisingly poignant gothic horror that chronicles the centuries-long wanderings of a tormented soul after a vampire blesses him with a cursed life. Driven by solid inputs from its mesmerising cast, the film is as rich in atmosphere as it is melancholic in content.Directed by Neil Jordan, the film employs an interview setting as its narrative framework and is instantly appealing on both visual & emotional fronts. However, the interest begins to fizzle out once our protagonist leaves the American shores and his initial curiosity about his new identity turns to sorrow & longing that suffocates the whole story. And while it fits the tone & themes in play, it is still lacking that gripping flair.Its rich look & resonant feel is achieved by the wonderfully lit set pieces, exquisite camerawork, period details & splendid score but it is the charismatic ensemble we have in Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas & Christian Slater that gives the film its magnetic energy. Cruise steals the show with a lively & restless input. Pitt starts with a lot of promise but he isn't committed to his role. And Dunst also impresses with a fiery support.Overall, Interview with the Vampire has a lot of elements working in its favour but it is the star-studded unit that makes the most lasting impression with their collective charm & undeniable presence. The story is at its best when it is exploring the love-hate bonding between Cruise & Pitt's characters and also loses its vitality whenever the former isn't present on screen. Deftly scripted & skilfully directed, this vampire chronicle is more than your average horror offering.",,Anonymous,Horror
One of the most interesting films ever...,"I absolutely loved the film, it captured all of the major contents of the book which is wonderful as most movies tend to change quite a lot from the original book which is often a disappointment. I thought the cast was absolutely brilliant too, especially Tom Cruise in the way he played Lestat as I thought he captured Lestat perfectly, just as i imagined Lestat to be from the books. Kirstan Dunst captured Claudia wonderfully also, her brilliance and her strength and everything that went with the character. I thought Daniel was played very well too as he is one of my favorite characters. The little problem with the cast was the character of Armand as i imagined him to be a 16 year old boy with curly auburn hair, but even with the physical differences i thought he was wonderful still in the movie.The story line itself was rather good too, a very captivating story without being too boring. I would recommend this movie to almost anyone with an open mind and a love for beauty as i would describe this movie as almost beautiful. This is my all time favorite movie and i would give this a nine and three quarters out of ten.",,Anonymous,Horror
Sheer disturbing brilliance,"This film both disturbed and enchanted me.... the acting was amazing and in keeping with the attitude and feeling of the books... ok so there was a little less homo-erotica but hey that's not a *totally* bad thing. i wasn't expecting a lot from Tom Cruise but he really amazed me, this is by far his best performance to date. Brad Pitt was, as usual, indredible and kirsten dunst was just really spooky.... Basically it's a great movie and you'd be a fool not to go see it. like now.what are you waiting for?GO!",,Anonymous,Horror
"OK: some good points, some bad points","I became a Tom Cruise fan after I saw ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" which came out much later than this, so I've been slowly trying to catch up on renting videos of his back movies.  I had put this one off for a long time, because I was afraid it was going to be scary and my husband didn't want to watch it with me.  Now maybe it's because my TV has only a 5"" screen, and maybe it's because I'm getting jaded in my old age, but this just didn't seem at all scary to me.  I notice some other reviewers thought it was, but I didn't think so.  So, if you, like me, are putting this off because you're afraid of being spooked, maybe you needn't wait any longer.Anyway, I thought that the movie was more philosophical than scary.  Tom seems to like stories that examine the inner workings of the human soul and that show moral complexity.  This movie fits into that pattern ... not that it is really profound, mind you, especially if you've seen ""Dark Shadows,"" where a lot of these issues are already examined.One thing that disappointed me was that I was mislead by the cover photography on the video.  I thought that because Tom had the largest photo he must be the lead.  WRONG.  Brad Pitt is the lead.  Tom is a supporting actor here.  This was frustrating to me as a Tom Cruise fan.  The shots of him were too short.  He moved too fast.  I didn't get to focus on his face long enough.  Now, Brad Pitt is a fine actor, and there were several lingering shots of his face, which should appeal to HIS fans ... BUT I'm not into blonds, so that didn't do too much for me.  Tom is also wearing a light colored wig, which was a bit hard for me to look at.The pleasant surprise was Antonio Banderas, who isn't even a tiny bit blond. I spent all his scenes wondering where I had seen him before.  Then I went on IMDB and saw that he was the goofy dad from Spy Kids II.  What a contrast, seeing him as a vampire! This guy can really act!  For my money he out-acted both Pitt and Cruise, and was better-looking than both.  He is definitely an under-appreciated talent.Another pleasant surprise was gorgeous period costumes.  I'm really a pushover for those old clothes, particularly the beautiful dresses that some of the female vampires got to wear: just oceans of shiny satin.  I loved that.Now this is going to be boring for those of you who are not big Tom Cruise fans, but you can really see that Tom's nose has changed if you look at this movie after seeing ""Vanilla Sky"".  I see three possibilities: 1.  he had a nose job; 2.  his nose has grown, dramatically (A doctor once told me that our noses keep growing throughout our lives, so that older people have larger noses than younger people, so that could have happened.); OR 3.  sometimes he wears a fake nose as part of his makeup. Does anyone know which of these is the case or is there some other possible explanation?",,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent film,"The problem with most book to film projects is that it is almost impossible to capture all of the essence and meaning of the original work onto the screen.  I think IWTV is perhaps one of best translations of this. Although there are many parts of the novel that have been excised from the film I feel it managed to keep everything that was integral to the original story. The Homo-erotic scenes are significantly down-played, I assume for the sake of avoiding controversey.  Too much of that would have just made viewers regard it as whoring trash and realistically, I doubt that either Cruise or Pitt would have agreed to display themselves in overt homosexual themes. This works out fine because the heart of the story is not just about sex or love.  (Although it is the driving motivation for many of the characters) This is not the type of film to see if you are looking for a grandiose villain with a nefarious plot who meets his end in a gruesome display of blood and gore.  It's more than just splattering eye-candy.  The story is about Human exploration.  Rice initiated a romanticized theme in Vampire lore that has been imitated in almost every medium since.  I think the film is about re-evaluating ones values in light of tragedy and testing the boundaries of immoral hedonism.  It paints the vampire in a portrait that I think others have either never dared to or never succeeded in capturing. My only complaint is the casting choice of Antonio Banderas.  He is way too old and much too masculine to be playing the role of Armand.  I think a much better choice for the character would have been (if he lived) River Phoenix. I think he would have been a great Armand.  Many viewers ended up having a lot of complaints about various characters.  Most notably, Louis.  The only defense that I can offer is that you must read the written story.  And not just Interview, but the follow ups as well.  They lend so much into the nature of the characters that it explains their actions in their first film/novel.  All in all....a very good film.",,Anonymous,Horror
Gorgeous and Gothic,"I can't understand why people don't like this film.  I'm not a fan of Anne Rice, but I still love this film.  All of the homo-erotic talk aside, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise prove that they are actors as well as pretty-boys during the course of this movie.  Pitt's performance as the guilt-ridden Louis is subtle and powerful.  The best aspect of this film is still the cinematography by Philippe Rousselot.  This is the most beautifully shot movie of the decade...outside of The Thin Red Line.  Also, Elliot Goldenthal's score is both haunting and moving.  The opening song, Libera Me, sets the tone for the entire film.  I actually hope that none of Rice's other books in the Vampire Chronicles series ever get made into films...they simply would not work on the level that this film does.",,Anonymous,Horror
Great flick by Neil Jordan...,"Too bad he only has a handful of his movies that are even close to this caliber of direction.Very gothic, very dark.  Cruise is exceptional.  Pitt excels in his follow-up performance to Legends of the Fall.This movie has a fantastic soundtrack that compliments the film very well. It is the same story as Anne Rice's first Vampire Chronicle title, and luckily she was still alive to write the screenplay.  She did change it up significantly for the movie, and I think it flows a lot better than her novels...which I regard as the Danielle Steele of vampire romance.  If you're into the factual basis of any of this and are expecting it to give a true depiction of vampirism, then this isn't for you.  Yet another romantic glorification, without any concrete explanation for anything.  She gets into those aspects a bit more in her books, but they are still just romantic notions.  If you can ignore this fallacy, then the movie is wonderful.Pitt and Cruise play their roles extremely well, as does Antonio Banderas and Kirsten Dunst.  This movie is one you can watch over and over again...unlike Queen of the Damned, which I deleted from my hard drive 6 minutes into the movie (I download and preview movies before I purchase them, rent them, or see them in the theatre...very useful with the quality of movies Hollywood has been presenting to the public).The only thing I like about Anne Rice is her characters and her ability to tell a tale...when she wasn't involved in Queen of the Damned, I was skeptical.  And rightly so, it's probably the worst movie attempt to mix The Crow and Blade together, soundtrack included.  I would say it's on par with The Crow 2/3/4 and however many more they churn out before someone puts a stop to the mockery.VHS or DVD, this movie is great.  Not enough to warrant the DVD scenery-wise, but definitely for the sound quality.",,Anonymous,Horror
Wrong casting bites,"The vampire-crowd are so thirsty for material that they often wind up reviewing the subject more than the actual film.So here are my feelings: Anne Rice was right to have initially complained, publicly and bitterly, about the casting of Tom Cruise as LeStat -- and why she took back such criticism as the film was being released theatrically, I'll never understand.I have nothing against Mr. Cruise, but he's all wrong -- in fact, terrible -- in the film. And Brad Pitt, duller and flatter than I'm accustomed to seeing him, is at least a tad better as Louis... But if you HAD to cast these two actors in ""...Vampire"", they're playing each others' parts!: Pitt would have been far better as LeStat than Tom. (As would several other stars)... I was hoping for a kind of ""La Jetee"" feel to the empty netherworld the story was attempting to portray, but these actors, especially Tom, simply weren't the ones).The film is directed with some style, but the wrong casting keeps the movie a bit shrill and at arm's length the entire time.A missed opportunity, nearly-ruined by Hollywood...",,Anonymous,Horror
