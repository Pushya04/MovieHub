Loved this film when I was younger and still love it now,"The Little Mermaid is one of those films I grew up with when I was a kid - something that the whole family can watch and never really get sick of. The imagination brought into this fairy tale (despite the fact that the ending is vastly changed from the original to please the kids) is simply superb. Songs, music, characters are all terrific.While I think Beauty and the Beast stands as Disney's best animated film, The Little Mermaid is still one of the top ones to check out. A story about Aeriel - the young mermaid curious about the human world who ends up falling for Prince Eric of the human race.And all the other cute characters such as Sebastian, Flounder, not to mention a very sinister villain with the Sea Witch. It all makes for a great time and has a good deal of emotion in it too.I really miss Disney films made in this era - they were done so well and I will always be a huge fan of them. The ones nowadays - while they aren't horrible, just seem to be a bit too modern and hence don't have that magic as the old ones - probably because they focus more on doing references to other things rather than coming up with original ideas that felt fresh.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
May Have Saved Disney's Movie Franchise.,"Disney animated films had become somewhat second-rate by 1989 and it appeared that one of the great genres in the cinema was on life-support. But that all changed with ""The Little Mermaid"". The film is a cinematic classic that tells the story of a young mermaid princess who just wants to be human so she makes a deal with an evil sea witch to get her wish, but she loses her beautiful voice in the process and she must be kissed by her true love to get it back. A really great motion picture that has some really memorable songs in it. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
This is my favourite movie of all time...,"I probably never would have seen this movie if my mother hadn't persuaded me to take my little brother to see it. I enjoyed it a lot the first time, but it was only when I saw it again a couple of years later on video I realised just how superb a movie it is. It's not a clever or complex movie, it's not the kind of film which works on an adult level as well as on a children's one. However, three aspects of it make it truly great:1: The music. 'Under The Sea' richly deserved its Oscar, but 'Part Of Your World' deserved it even more.2. The animation. Quite simply, it's absolutely gorgeous. The underwater scenes in particular take your breath away.3. The Story. How can you resist a love story that touching?I urge anyone with even a touch of sentimentality about them to set their predjudices aside and see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
An incredibly romantic movie!,"Yeah, yeah... It's the little mermaid, the same cute barbie-like character little girls love so much... But the movie is great. If you just free yourself from the sissy pink image of the movie you're in for a treat.The songs are great, by the same team who gave us Little Shop Of Horrors: Alan Menken and Howard Ashman who teamed up in Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin as well. Aladdin was their last project together with Ashman's untimely death from AIDS in 1991.The story is funny and romantic, so who cares if it's not following the original tale?

The magic Disney once created,"In a time Disney releasing one heartless live action remake after another, fortunately losing a lot of money with them, the only possibility to get the old Disney magic is by watching the classics. Yes, I have not seen The little Mermaid until today, shame on me.The combined power of a great story, consisting of adventure, danger and of course love worked back in 1989 and is still working in 2023. The songs hit immediately, you wanna dance with the rhythm.This was a time, entertainment was the highest priority of making a movie. No political agendas pushed, no race swapping, no bad cgi, just a great story to tell.With this sad, if you want to feel the good old Disney magic watch The little Mermaid.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Under the Sea with Disney,"""The Little Mermaid"" revitalized Disney's animation department and would make it a force to be reckoned with over the next several years, before Pixar came along and picked up the mantle.""Mermaid"" isn't one of my favorites (I prefer ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"" over it), but it is a beautiful and now nostalgic throw back to hand-drawn animation, and it does boast one of the best scores written for a Disney film. It kicked off the trend of show-stopping production numbers that every Disney musical must have; in this one it's ""Under the Sea.""Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Life must be great under the sea!,"The Little Mermaid is one of the best Disney films of the 80's! It's such a wonderful film and is such a tear jerker, lol. The songs, the story, the animation, the voices, were just so wonderful and perfect. This is the film that I'm sure will go on for generations to come, I just showed it to my cousin recently, he's 6, and he just loves it as well. I remember watching this movie when I was a little girl and I just wanted a friend like Sebastian, he was so much fun, even though he's somewhat of a buzz kill, he can really get the party going. Just the whole story is a blast to watch and is so beautiful.Ariel is one of the many princesses of King Triton's mighty kingdom under the sea, but she has a different dream. She goes up constantly to the shore to collect human items and wonders what it would be like to be a human instead of a mermaid. One day when she gets into a nasty fight with her father, Ursella, an evil octopus woman who wants to take over King Triton's kingdom, grants Ariel's wish, but she can only stay human if she can get her crush, Eric, to say her name, sounds easy, right? Well, Ursella takes her voice away, but her intentions are for Ariel to fail and make sure that she takes over the kingdom.The Little Mermaid is such a fun Disney film and is a great treasure of our time. I just love the song ""Under the sea"", it's so much fun to sing and dance too, I admit it, I'm a dork, I still sing and dance to it when I see it. I highly recommend this movie for anyone, it's a true Disney classic that is so much fun, I guarantee you that you might shed a tear when Ariel says ""Daddy"", you'll see what I mean when you watch it.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Little Mermaid,"Medium movie for Disney movies. I loved Sebastian. The movie's songs were great, especially Ariel's songs, who had a beautiful voice. I was hoping to show people the bad side. Ariel's character was not excellent despite her beauty and being one of the most beautiful Disney princesses, but her character was bad",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Wait a minute - there are actually people who HATE this?,"I was definitely no kid when I saw ""The Little Mermaid""; in fact, I was 20. I was thoroughly captivated by this movie - one of the last real delights from Disney's regular animation crews (before they had to get help from Pixar and Tim Burton) - and the Mouse couldn't have wished for a better movie to get them back on the proper road, animation-wise. (Of course, after this, ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" they've slipped a bit - though they're still better than DreamWorks.)Though not exactly loyal to the original story - Hans Christian Andersen was much more keen on unhappy endings - it's doubtful it would have worked as well if it had. The movie has just about everything going for it... lush animation, spirited musical numbers (this started Alan Menken's run of success for Disney, and he's surely had enough time to refresh himself by now, and for us all to forget ""Pocahontas""), wonderfully evil villain, likeable supporting players, and my all-time favourite Disney heroine, the endearing and lovely Ariel (remember the episode of ""Cheers"" when Norm said he fancied her? She got a lot of real life guys' hearts - beat that, Princess Fiona from ""Shrek"").And as a plus, the subsequent TV series (set before the movie) even managed to capture some of the spirit of the movie. But go for the original... a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the greatest things ever to come from Disney!,"No other Disney movie is a good as THE LITTLE MERMAID. It is one of my favorite Disney films of all time. It is truly a classic film that will forever live in film history. While I didn't really enjoy the songs, I still love the remainder of the movie. I like the ending most of all. It is one of the darkest endings ever seen in a Disney film. I really don't have much to say on this film at the moment, but if anything is going to be said about this movie, let me say this: If you haven't yet seen this wonderful movie, see it now! Having not seen it is a crime! This one gets 5/5.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
a bubbly and thoroughly enchanting classic,"The Little Mermaid harkens back to the simple, straightforward qualities of Disney's golden era. A classic celebrating the impulsivity of youthful love and the search for a new identity. It's a faithful and brilliant showcase for animation as an enchanting, lively medium; and ushered in a new era of masterpieces from Disney. There's certainly some nostalgia attached to my love for this film but I don't even care...it's a wonderful little movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the greater classics beyond Walt Disney himself.,"This is one of the greater full length animated feature films that was made after Walt Disney. A story about Ariel the Little Mermaid, who yearns to be part of the human world and who fell in love with human Prince Eric in the process. She makes a deal with Ursula the Sea Witch and traded her voice for legs so she could rise to the surface of the waters. What follows is a romantic story in how Ariel tries to win Eric's heart without her voice and an exciting race against time to ensure Ariel remains human, otherwise, returning back to the ocean and into the evil Ursula's custody.Ron Clements and John Musker did an outstanding job in directing this movie, grasping the audience's attention at the start of the film with a musical sequence on the Prince's ship, and then a spectacular entry under the sea when we are introduced to the mermaids, helped by a powerful music score. The solid plot quickly identifies the story's main issue, Ariel, who is tired of being treated like a child by her father King Triton. The issue is then expanded as Ariel struggles to win Eric's heart when she goes to the human world while, at the same time, not knowing that Ursula has devious plans of her own to control the sea. All these plot elements and twists make this a very exciting Disney movie from start to finish.The characters are very lovable and memorable, especially Flounder, Sebastian (my favorite) and Scuttles. They added humor and spirit in the movie as they help Ariel with her issues. The music score and songs are some of cinema's best work - Alan Menken and Howard Ashman did a marvelous job. ""Under the Sea"" is a very lively and dynamic Calyso-type song and ""Part of your World"" is a moving and commanding song; Jodi Benson had the perfect voice for Ariel - very soothing and serene. And, the artwork and graphics are some of the best I have seen in an animated film.Overall, one of the best movies from Disney and remains a timeless fairytale for all ages.Grade A",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The studio finds its feet.,"'The Little Mermaid (1989)' pretty much acts as a blueprint for all the Disney musicals that follow it, establishing the studio's 'modern day' formula from its story structure to its song choices. There's no denying how influential the picture is, really. Having said that, its own influences are equally as evident and it's clearly an extension of its predecessors. The film tells the tale of a young mermaid princess who longs to be on land and so, in a moment of pure face-palming naïveté, makes a deal with a soul-collecting sea-witch. Along the way, there are several catchy songs and plenty of water-logged chuckles. The thing has oodles of charm, which mostly mitigate its few story issues and typically predictable nature. It's vibrant, well-animated and lively, as fun to look at as it is to listen to. I mean, 'Under The Sea' is an absolute bop, and Sebastian's face-off against an angry chef is almost just as enjoyable. As a whole, the flick is constantly entertaining. It sits in the upper tier of Disney's catalogue, for sure. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Great fantasy about breaking away,"This film is great fuel for those who fantasise about breaking free. This is all due to Ariel who longs to see the world and feels trapped by her strict father. It's not the only Disney film with this plot, but it's an effective one as she expresses her longings through music and collections. The music in particular stands out in this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Among the best fantasy films of all time,"The mermaid herself is charming.  She is animated with real passion - and voiced with real passion too, by Jodi Benson, who provides a powerful argument that whoever provides the speaking voice should also provide the singing voice.  She is an innocent heroine but by no means a colourless one. That the prince should fall in love with her, on just seeing her and hearing her voice, is entirely credible.The same could not be said for Andersen's original mermaid, who is a very cold fish indeed, solely concerned with grabbing immortality, considering the prince as no more than a handy means to it.  It's this (and the high value placed on Christianity at the expense of decency) that makes Andersen's ending so insufferable.  Obviously, another ending had to be found; and while it must be said that the big ending Musker and Clements came up with is a weak one, it must also be said that it's an improvement.Musker and Clements still have a problem with their finales (witness `Aladdin' and `Hercules'), but they have countervailing strengths, and those strengths are most apparent here.  The songs are all exceptionally staged (the well-known `Under the Sea' actually being the least effective), the comedy is sharp and well-timed, and - more obviously here than anywhere else - they really believe in what they're doing.  They give credit to Howard Ashman for this and they could be right; whatever the reason, an air of innocence and sincerity pervades `The Little Mermaid' which makes it - and her - utterly irresistible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The beginning of Disney Renaissance,"The movie itself is great. The story flows whether you agree on the moral of it; the animation is realistic especially scenes in the water with the effects of wave; 'Part of Your World' and 'Under the Sea' signals the advent of 'Disney songs'. However, the story is not relatable anymore. Like Sebastian said, the seaweed is always greener in somebody else's lake. Ariel is a 'hopeless child' who throws away her talent, her family, and her life for the boy she has met for seconds. She is impetuous and selfish, putting others in danger with her with stupid contract. As the movie heads toward the ending, it loses focus; the storyline becomes childish and excessive. 'Little Mermaid' tried its best at that time, but it does not impact today's audience that much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Good Disney Film,"A good family film with a cute version the story. As it is written so it is said, Disney's movie is *loosely* based on Hans Christian Andersen's story - so you cannot compare Andersen's story with Disney's film. Disney's film is a colorful tale with quite a few comical characters.I enjoyed this film quite a bit but I would have liked to have seen this movie a bit ""darker"" in tone (animation and story). Under ocean is a mysterious place - so I would have preferred this movie with more of a ""gloomy"" atmosphere and story instead of being mainly a bright place to live. Of course it's just a matter of personal preference.Yes The Little Mermaid is a wonderful film. You could make this a double feature with movies like: ""Sleeping Beauty"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"".8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"""The Little Mermaid"" Surprised Me","It has been ten years since ""The Little Mermaid"" was released.  Back when Disney originally released the film, I was both excited and apprehensive. Excited, because it is one of the best children's stories and one of my favorites.  Apprehensive, because I knew Disney would change the ending and give it a happy ending, which is understandable but still unfortunate. When I first saw it, I liked it much more than I thought I would, and after each repeated viewing, I have liked it more and more.  I am now convinced this is the second best American Animated film, after ""Beauty and the Beast"".  The music, story, writing, and animation are superb as others have stated, but the villainess, Ursula, is also a major factor in the success of the film. She is the best written and performed of all Disney villains.  She is purely evil but totally believable.  Pat Carroll, who I have often noticed but never really considered, did a fabulous job with Ursula's characterization. The music and songs are consistantly very good.  There is no deep thought to this one, but ""The Little Mermaid"" is artfully near-perfect entainment.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Absolutely superb!,"I also recommend the TV series, but not the sequel. I still think that Tarzan is the last great Disney movie, but pretty much everything else after lacks the magic that Disney once had, as far as I'm concerned.(with the exception of the surprisingly good Fantasia 2000, Bambi 2 and Emperor's New Groove) 10 years ago, this was one of my all-time favourites. I remember, every time I went swimming, I felt really inspired to be a mermaid. That's the effect this movie and the TV series had on me. The animation is absolutely gorgeous, especially the underwater scenes, and the storm. The script is intelligent and witty, and everyone involved did a marvellous job putting it across. The songs are fantastic, as always with Alan Menken. In fact, the only score of Alan Menken's I don't like is ""Home on the Range"". My favourites are ""Part of your World""(my sister is always singing it around the house) and the wonderfully energetic ""Under the Sea"". The characters are probably the most memorable in a Disney movie, especially Ariel, a beautiful and feisty mermaid, with a dream of being a human. She has a beautiful voice also, well we have the talented Jodi Benson to thank for that. Sebastian is so funny here, a he was in the series, but as well as Flounder(another great character)he was ruined in the sequel. Kenneth Mars's Triton is an inspiring father-figure, who reminds me of my grandfather. The best character is without question, Ursula, who scarred me for life after watching her. Likewise with The Evil Manta from the series. Whilst her song is probably the least memorable song of the movie, it still works. Flotsam and Jetsam are also really creepy. Miles better than Ursula's really bland sister Morgana at any rate.To round off, I can't forget Louis the chef. He is so funny here, unlike in the sequel, where the same joke was repeated but badly underplayed. I can't believe some people hate this movie. It is one of Disney's best along with ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Lion King"", ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"". Highly recommended for all ages. 10/10.

The start of the Disney Golden Age!,"The Little Mermaid is stunning. It's absolutely beautiful. This is a movie that I liked and couldn't place my finger on why. I found it bothering that it seemed to give the message that looks are more important than personality... but as the story progresses I think it becomes obvious that Ariel isn't a hero and has been making childish decisions the whole time and that to me is what makes this so spectacular. Throughout, you buy Ariel as a character in such a beautiful story. This movie so perfectly portrays innocence. It also shows her father have a great arc about learning to let go. Aside from having a well told story, the music is some of the best Disney has to offer. Every one I could listen to on repeat. Lastly, the art Disney offers in the Golden Age is breathtaking. The Little Mermaid has such beautiful visuals (especially Ariel ;)) that put you ""Under the sea."" Definitely see this masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Under the Sea, Disney Gets Back to Basics","Disney gives us the breezy story of a quixotic young princess who throws away her regal underwater status to... become a princess on land, instead. At the time, this material represented a fresh return to form for the studio, after thirty years of floundering with overwrought talking-animal adventures and off-brand fantasy epics. In contrast to those more ambitious undertakings, The Little Mermaid is intentionally light and airy - a simple fable that doesn't stretch beyond its own limitations - and there's a certain sense of comfortable familiarity to that. After all, aren't the best fairy tales finished in twenty pages or less?Clarity of vision and creative restraint might seem like easy concepts, but continually hitting those targets over the length of a feature film isn't nearly as easy as it might seem. This particular effort is aided by a rousing villainess, a handful of spirited musical numbers and a bright, colorful visual identity. The animation can be weirdly inconsistent at times, but the most important moments all hit their marks and the major character designs have proven their staying power.An inspired, back-to-basics effort from a then-desperate studio that ushered in a widely-regarded period of creative renaissance, both behind the scenes and upon the silver screens. Maybe not one of Disney's very best, but it does well enough for an eighty-minute kids' film and its broader importance can't be overstated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Pure brilliance,"There is (in my view) only one criticism which can be levelled against this film, and that is that it plays fast and loose with Andersen's original in terms of the ending. I first read Andersen's stories as a child, and The Little Mermaid had a fairly typical unhappy ending. Personally, I thought the Mermaid deserved better and, on taking my kids to see this movie when it was first released, I was delighted to see that the people at Disney had given her the ending I always wanted for her.The very first sequence, of Prince Eric's ship looming out of the mist, took my breath away.I can understand Under The Sea getting all the attention - it is, after all, very jolly and colourful. But, to me, it pales into insignificance next to Kiss The Girl (soulful, and with a far better vocal performance), Poor Unfortunate Souls (where sinister turns into nightmare, with a sensational vocal performance from Pat Carroll delivering clever lyrics) and, most of all Part Of Your World.I think this may be the most perfect song sequence ever committed to celluloid - the song itself intertwines several plot elements, teenage angst and the generation gap, and bucketloads of emotion in a complex rhyming scheme loaded with clever wordplay. Jodi Benson's vocal is sublime and so are the visuals - it still brings tears to my eyes after repeated viewings. And the reprise... choreographing the final ""world"" to an orchestral crescendo and the crashing of the wave behind Ariel in Copenhagen mode may be corny but, by heaven, it certainly works! Howard Ashman is sadly missed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Somewhere Beyond the Sea,"Following in the wake of Disney's Bronze Age (Dark Age) with a series of mixed results. The studio eventually returned to the traditional format of musical adaptations. Ushering in an era of critical and commercial successes starting with The Little Mermaid. Based on the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. The Little Mermaid follows the story of a young Mermaid princess named Ariel who is fascinated with the surface& spends her days exploring the depths gathering trinkets. One day she travels up the surface during a shipwreck saves a human named Eric from drowning, and immediately falls in love with him. To be with him she strikes I deal with a Sea Witch Ursula who plots to steal the power of Ariel's Father Triton the King of Atlantica. Little Mermaid is often considered one of the best-animated films of all time too many. It returns to that formula it thrived on in the 50s and 60s. With colorful and details sets Memorable Songs and well-written characters. The story while your classic love-at-first-sight premise works into a charming narrative Ariel while she is disobedient never makes you feel like you can hate her. She is tired of her old life and the overprotectiveness of her Father and wants more. Which from Disney itself is a cliché all on its own, but you argue that Ariel was the first, and overall, it works She's Naive and is driven by dreams, but never does come off as Selfish. I found the scenes of her with Eric and without her voice very charming just going off the expressions she gives. I also really the setup between her and Father Triton. He comes off as a great father figure he's loving with a soft tone of voice calm and reasonable. The chemistry between him and Sebastian is funny in and now its own. Then all of a sudden, he starts yelling when he puts his foot down voice echoes with such a presence. He has regrets about how harsh he is towards Ariel, but at the same time, you see why he has such worries for his daughter and the human world. As for the Villain Ursula, she is good well much of the film is bright. All of Ursula's scenes just ooze ominous and atmosphere just how wicked her design is. How her legs form into a dress the use of shadows and the expressions on her face. She gives this creepy present. The rest of the side characters are all right. Flounder's, OK. Sebastian is probably the best character of the three. He starts a trend for the rest of the Renaissance film of the leads always having an animal companion. The soundtrack is good with classics Part of the World and Under the Sea. It offers a variety of styles from Caribbean to Sea shanties.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Enchanting Myth Movie,"I'm a big mythology buff, and there is enough to hold my interest in this movie.I have to also leave it Disney to make a movie that both child and adult. Ariel has the cartoonish qualities that makes little girls want to be her, and a bit of Marilyn Monroe-like sexual innocence that attracts male fans. For mythology buffs, the figure of Triton, son of Poseidon, has been inserted along with several outlandishly named daughters from the sea-god's numerous wives. Even Ursula from a long line of successful Disney villains seems to fit in. While Scylla or Thetis might have fit it, Ursula could have easily come from the pantheon of Russian sea witches. At times in the movie though, it almost forgets it's underwater as these figures talk and move with little or no distubance, but the weightless look of the figures from odd angles augments the look at other times. I also love the repeated images that give homage to Denmark's Little Mermaid statue. The voice to role comparison also is excellant and Jodi Benson excells in her songs. This movie produced a great soundtrack and a great retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen tale by simultaneosly updating the myths of the Greeks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Disney at it's best,"The Little Mermaid is one of Disney's best animated motion pictures. It tells the classic Hans Christian Anderson story of a mermaid who wishes she could be human in order to capture the love of a human prince. The animation is beautiful, in fact I think this is one of Disney's most flawless films. It features lovable characters: Ariel the little mermaid is one of my favorite 'Disney girls', Sebastian the crab, Scuttle the wacky seagull, Flounder the... flounder, Triton Ariel's father the Sea King and of course prince charming- Eric. And don't think I forgot the most despised octopus of the oceans- Ursula and her two eels Flotsam and Jetsum. Great beginning and great ending... and of course a lovable story. The music is beautiful (and rightfully won the Oscar for best score and best song). The score is by Alan Menken (who also provided us with the scores of Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast). Some of the most beautiful Disney songs are in The Little Mermaid- Part of Your World, Kiss the Girl and for a little bit of dancin' Under the Sea. A movie for all ages, you will be enchanted by Ariel's world under the sea, by the wacky characters, the cruel but in a strange way lovable Ursula, the score, the songs, the story and the animation.

Sebastian was for me the real star of the movie and made me want to see the movie over and over again. It's not only what he does but also his expressions and the way he talks making him my favorite all time Disney character. Especially his scene with chef Louis is hilarious.

To put it from a child's point of view they're not going to watch this and think oh hang a minute I'm going to do exactly what Ariel is going to do blah blah.And of course not they are children.I was 9 years old when this came out and it instantly became my favourite Disney film because of .....................the music!!
That's right the music is what stuck with me. It wasn't the message I was interested in after watching it was the singing and songs.
Plus my favourite animals have always been Dolphins/Whales, so therefore I loved this film straightaway.
As for the film itself as a 40 year old woman I still do not see why people are still getting offended it's just an animated film. I still love this film now as much as I did 31 years ago. It's a fun colourful film to enjoy any day of the year and if I do ever have children I'd definitely would show this them. My 6 year old niece loves it as much as I do",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A beautifully animated movie,"One of my favorite Disney classics of all time, I must have seen it about 100 times or more. This movie is about the sweet little mermaid Ariel who is dreaming about becoming a human so that she can be with her dream prince.This has got to be one of the best animated movies ever made by Walt Disney Studios. I know the original novel of Hans Christian Andersen and the movie does not follow the novel completely. This doesn't affect the movie and the magic in a bad way, it just makes the story more dreaming and sweet.Jodi Benson is the voice talent behind Ariel and she really does bring adventure and charm into the character. She has a very characteristic voice and sings beautifully, no doubt about that.This movie is probably cherished and loved by all the little girls around the world. It has great music, sweet characters and a fabulous storyline. Simply fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Fun!,"The Little Mermaid is a fun, classic movie! However, since I've been rewatching all the Princess movies, I've noticed that this one is the weakest so far. It's music is catchy and the animation is gorgeous, but the story felt weak. The best part was the characters. I loved seeing Ariel and Eric. Even the jokes were pretty funny.Overall, it's always fun to watch Disney movies again!",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Bright and cheerful, and that's the problem","Let's just hope that the Disney people never decide to do to Shakespeare or Sophocles what they've done to Hans Christian Andersen and Victor Hugo (I'm alluding to The Hunchback of Notre Dame), among others. Romeo and Juliet? Just a misunderstanding. They live happily ever after and so do Montagues and the Capulets. Hamlet? He marries Ophelia and then we get 'Hamlet II: Back to Elsinore.' Oedipus? It's all a mistake; he didn't really kill his father and marry his mother, he was really an orphan adopted by the Queen, everything's okay, and the Sphinx was really just unhappy because she was misunderstood; she moves into the palace with Oedipus and they become great friends, and then comes 'Oedipus II: Sphinx's Pride.'There's always seemed to be a cinematic schizophrenia at the Disney studios: Amid all the saccharine goo, there were moments that were darker, even shocking. In particular, I'm thinking of the death of Bambi's mother, and more recently the death of Mufasa, Simba's father, in The Lion King. But there seems to be this rule at Disney that even if a major character dies halfway through, the ending has to be all smiles. I mean, what is the point of doing a story with a sad ending like 'The Little Mermaid' or 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' if you trivialize the entire point of the story by changing it from dark to light and fluffy? Oh dear, Andersen's rather bleak Nordic vision is just too much of a downer; let's have fun with it! Let's move the story to the bright, happy Caribbean. Ariel sacrifices her life for love at the end? Oh dear, we can't have that; instead, let's let her have it all; typical childish wish-fulfillment, right?After my 7-year-old daughter saw this version of Mermaid, as an irritated consumer, I obtained for her a more faithful adaptation, with an ending more true to Andersen's original. It didn't damage her delicate little psyche. Who can use that as an excuse these days? Have you checked out the video game shelf at your local computer store lately? Not to mention REAL LIFE? Three thousand American children a year die violent deaths. And that's only in this country. In this age of drive-by shootings, when parents, unlike in my ever more distant childhood, are afraid to leave their kids unguarded on their front lawns, much less roaming unchaperoned either in or outside of their own neighborhoods, does it make sense to sweeten (and thereby render meaningless) the ending of a fairy tale? Only if you're venal enough to be planning a sequel.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Gorgeous,"Ariel is a fiery, independent teenage mermaid who falls in love with a prince. She literally makes a deal with the devil to get her man.

One of the best!,"My now grown-up daughters wore out only 2 VHS movies when they were children: This movie and the original movie version of ""Annie"". (It takes between 60 to 100+ ""runs"" through a typical good-quality VCR to do this.) Their favorite song was ""Part of Your World"" which my (at the time) 11 year-old daughter sang on stage in full costume, at school. I still have this on a VHS ""home movie"". Truly amazing in every respect: Animation, adaptation. original story, songs and orchestration. Great voice actors. Still a favorite to this day; now with my grandkids. Is it a ""girl's movie""? Yes and no. As a (male) adult I thoroughly enjoy viewing it, even today. Their grandmother enjoys it as well. It was somewhat controversial in 1989, with the exaggerated-impossible ""teen-age figure"" of Ariel. Buddy Hackett as the seagull and Sebastian the Crab (Samuel E. Wright) steal every scene they appear in. Pat Carroll is deliriously evil as Ursula the Sea-Witch who comes to an explosive end (which some critics deemed too violent.) Entertaining and fun with a beautiful, happy ""Disney Ending"", which is far superior to the Hans Christian Anderson tale, which doesn't end well at all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Color Animated Film Brought Disney Back,"This animated film brought the Disney company out of its long slump and you can see why it spurred a comeback: there is a lot to like in this movie.It features outstanding animation: brilliant colors and beautiful scenes, along with interesting characters and pretty good songs. Frankly, I didn't care that much for the lead character, the young girl, but the little crab was the show- stealer, at least for me. He spoke with a West Indies accent and did a couple of cool musical numbers....and was easily the funniest and most-entertaining of all the characters.I have only one major complaint about this story. The message that ""parents should let the kids go,"" inferring they know best, that if you let them decide what is best, they'll live happily ever after....is irresponsible and just plain wrong. Hollywood loves to show little kids are smarter than their parents, which might sound nice to the young audience but it is a very dangerous message. Too bad, because than that this would have been a super film for all ages. It's still pretty darn good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney's human+nonhuman formula continues growing further.,"The Little Mermaid (1989) :
Brief Review -Disney's human+nonhuman formula continues growing further. Walt Disney's animated filmography cannot be fit into this brief review, even if I decide to exclude mediocre films. So I won't talk about all those animation classics from the 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s. Putting it short and different from others, I'd like to discuss the formula they have been taking forward for years. Humans meeting non-humans, or vice versa. When Disney got finished and tired of this formula, a sensation called Pixar emerged from nowhere and built their own universe of fictional characters that weren't anywhere close to Disney's fantasy films or characters. The Little Mermaid was yet another sweet animated feature from Disney, and I have seen the film and the TV series so many times in my childhood. Today, after watching more than 7000 films, when I look back at those memories and re-watch the film for the review's purpose, it's something like how my mother described seeing me off in school days to seeing me off in job days. I changed, but the mother remained the same, and for her, I am still the same. It's just me becoming more intelligent over the years to understand other shades of the same thing. I'd want to see a lot of changes in The Little Mermaid today, but how fair is it? If Pixar were to make their version of The Little Mermaid, I'm sure they would make an intellectual and emotional classic from the same story. But what Disney has done can't be forgotten. The Little Mermaid is all that a kid or parents would want to watch together on a weekend. The positivity, the nostalgia, the iconic musicals, and the memorable characters-they are all unforgettable. In short, The Little Mermaid is the big animation movie. I won't say much here, as I'm saving a lot of things for my review of the live-action remake. Rewatching it was needed to relive those childhood days and for a fair comparison as a reviewer. 80 minutes spent well, again!RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney Adaptation of the Classic Hans Andersen Fairytale,"I love the fairy tales from Hans Christian Andersen, and ""The Little Mermaid"" is one of my favorite fairy tales from him. Like I said, I like a little twist in a fairy tale now and then, like the ending: The little sea princess gets her prince; it is a change from Andersen's original ending.Yes, I love this film. The animation and backgrounds are very beautiful, and the characters are appealing. Also, I thought the casting was very good. I love Ariel; she's one of my favorite Disney Princesses, along with Aurora from ""Sleeping Beauty."" Ariel's voice actress, Jodi Benson, has an excellent singing voice for the film, which also suits her character. And, you know, it's kind of hard to choose which film version of the story is the best. But I would say that this version and the Japanese animated version made fourteen years ago are the best versions; I'm not one to take sides, you know.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A beginning of the Disney renaissance era...,"So this is the film that apparently reignited an era of prolonged box office success for Disney and it's a perfectly charming romance epic.This film is definitely geared towards little girls and the more romantic audiences who enjoyed Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. However Ariel is a far more engaging lead who yes is in love with a prince but she has far more spirit and agency about her. She is a hopeless romantic but she has a very adventurous spirit compared to the previous princess types before her.All the characters are excellent and yes even the prince who unlike previous character types has a more dynamic and well rounded personality and never once seemed in danger to take advantage of Ariel when she was mute. He seemed like a decent guy if a little bland. Sebastian and Flounder really shone as did the superb Divine inspired Ursula who was an absolute scene stealer.Of all the princess true love films Disney have had up till this point this is my favourite as all the characters just seem more well rounded and engaging for the most part.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The First of Its Generation And Still The Best,"A whole new era of Disney classics was made possible due to the success of this film. And 21 years later, it's still the best. The tired formula that ""The Little Mermaid"" inspired hit some highs (Beauty and the Beast) and some lows (Hercules) but it was never quite as fresh and magical as it was here. The story is also told very well. Disney later tried to pull off more complex stories and that almost turned out too complicated and confused (Pocahontas). The movie owes a great deal of its success to its music which is superb, cause top-notch animation and great characters can only take you so far in a musical. I am so grateful to have experienced this film way back in its original theatrical release. It is a genuinely first rate Disney classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Film That Rescued Disney,"Sixteen year old mermaid princess Ariel dreams of becoming part of the forbidden human world. When she falls in love with the handsome (and human) Prince Eric, Ariel makes a bargain with the wicked sea witch Ursula  in exchange for Ariel's voice she is made human for three days during which time she must make the prince fall in love with her and seal the deal with a kiss. Unfortunately for Ariel the path to true love doesn't exactly run smoothly.The Little Mermaid rescued Disney at a time when animated films were a dying breed. The movie is beautifully drawn, the characters brought to life by a team of talented animators. Aside from head-strong yet lovable Ariel the audience will fall in love with her naïve sidekick Flounder, her scatter-brained seagull friend Scuttle and the ever-watchful Jamaican crab Sebastian. The sea witch Ursula is a brilliantly evil, slimy squid who should strike terror in the hearts of children everywhere and on land gallant Prince Eric is surrounded by a bevy of colourful characters to keep everyone amused, from his stuffy adviser Grims to the insane French cook Louis.The story is fresh and constantly exciting, helped along by the amazing and catchy musical numbers. Songs such as Part of Your World and Under The Sea have become timeless Disney classics and the score is beautifully executed.With enough double entendre humour to keep the adults amused and enough colour and magic to keep the kids entertained, this is a true Disney classic  a gem that paved the way for more Disney animations such as Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. The Little Mermaid is a visual treat and a wonderful film, enjoyable for all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Pretty much follows the how-to-make- a-movie-for-kids formula to the letter.However, anyone else is likely to find this quite boring. I certainly did.(The score I have given tries to take the two sides into account. if it was just based on what I think of it, my score would be lower, probably a 3/10).The polarisation doesn't have to occur. It is possible to make movies both adults and kids can like. Movies like Up and Bambi and series like The Simpsons have shown us this.Anyway, a good movie to keep the children busy.

Best movie ever made.,"I love The Little Mermaid! I used to watch this movie on VCR everyday when I was a child, sometimes I even rewind it and watched it again on the same day; we had to re-buy it a couple of times since it was watched so many times it broke! I always dreamed to become a mermaid when I grew up. The songs are fun and will be stuck in your head forever, the characters are funny and Ariel is someone to really relate to. Wanting more out of life than what is handed to you and that your parents won't always support you in what you do but will love you anyway is a really beautiful thing to grow up with. Some jokes are even funnier when you grow up. I am now 20 years old and I still watch it very often and I know all the words and can sing along with all the songs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
eh,"This movie was wonderful I watched it when I was younger in 1998 and I loved it but when I was even younger my dad bought a different earlier anime version that was so much better than the singing and dancing and happy endings in Disneys version of The Little Mermaid. This version of Hans Christian Andersen The Little Mermaid is about a young beautiful mermaid named Marina with her sisters, grandmother, father and her best friend Fritz the dolphin and she gives her voice to a sea witch to have legs so she can be with her beloved prince that she saved in a huge storm. But the cost was she had to give the sea witch her beautiful voice and if she did not marry him she would die and turn to sea foam of his wedding night. Well at sunrise she drinks the potion and painfully gets her human legs and she stays with the prince for a little bit over a month and he thinks that some other girl saved him well he cannot find her so he falls in love with Marina but his parents are forcing the prince to get married to another princess (which is the black haired girl that he thought saved him) He soon finds out that she is the princess he is forced to marry and he is happy and she realizes there is no hope for her and then her best friend Fritz the dolphin tells Marinas sisters and they went to the sea witch to help Marina and in exchange for their long beautiful hair they got a magical knife that was to be used to kill the prince in his sleep and when the blood touched Marinas feet they would turn back into fins and she could return to the sea but she stops because she says if her prince is happy she is happy and this sweet girl throws the knife into the sea and she dives over the boat into the water and drowns herself as she turns into sea foam while her prince stands there too late watching with a scale that she gave him and a pearl shell hairpiece of Marinas. At the end Marina turns into sea foam while her friend Fritz chases her while yelling Marina! But she is sea foam and in the Disney version there is a happy ending which I think is wrong that they copied this beautiful anime version of the little mermaid and made it into a happy movie instead of the original one.

Truly Spectacular,"What a magnificent achievement. I went to see this film in a theater in 1989 after seeing all the critical praise it had received, and was blown away by Alan Menken's score, its stunning visuals, talented voice cast and energetic musical numbers. Today we may take its adventurous nature for granted, but back then it was very different and new. Ariel was the first Disney heroine to take some action and drive the plot, instead of being dragged through it. More than 20 years later and it's still the best. No subsequent Disney film managed to be as original and heartwarming. The Little Mermaid goes straight to your heart, and stays there forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Little surprised that I liked this one,"Subjectively speaking, I'm always going to like The Jungle Book more than this, but I'd say they're about on the same level of quality for me.The music is a vast improvement over anything from Snow White or Peter Pan (except the first song with Ariel, that one wasn't that good), the voice acting is a lot better and certainly much less annoying, and I felt the direction improved quite a bit too.Story's a bit cliche, granted, and it's still not a directorial tour de force or anything, but hey, I can't pretend it wasn't a hell of a lot less boring than some of Disney's earlier stuff.And it was nice that they didn't make fun of Native Americans this time around as well.However, it's the next Disney film I plan on watching that will probably never be beaten in my eyes...",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
My all time favourite childhood movie since I was a kid,"When I was a little girl I loved mermaids and fairy tales. I was so fascinated with this movie as a kid and here is why.The Little Mermaid is directed by John Musker & Ron Clement who also directed Aladdin and most recent The Princess & the Frog. The story is about a 16 year old mermaid who is best friends with a fish named Flounder and a funny crab called Sebastian. Ariel is a very lovestruck/optimistic girl who dreams of being part of the human world. Her father doesn't want that as he has something against humans and thinks that they are barbarians. One evening Ariel hears fireworks which is the Prince's ship and as she sees him she begins to fall in love with him despite the fact she knows nothing about him. So when she goes to the sea witch she turns her into a human for 3 days,problem is she can't talk as she gives up her singing/speaking voice to Ursula(who is the villianess in this movie). Packed with great music and a nice story not to mention the colourful charcthers, The Little Mermaid will always be an instant classic in my heart as I grew up watching it in the late 90's. I recommend this to all the Disney lovers out there.10/10 for me as I loved it so much,i've got the merchandise(well I used to have an Ariel doll but she broke)and I will always love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
not as good as I expected,"But what do I know, I'm not a kid anymore.As an adult viewer, I have to say I was dissapointed with this movie when I saw it recently on video. If I had kids, I wouldn't be overeager to share this with them - but kids like what they like. What stuck in my craw the most was the storyline of Ariel thinking she needed to give up her family, home under the sea, and a part of her body for this guy (okay, he's a Prince and ""The Love of Her Life"", yadda, yadda, yadda...). Maybe it's just the millenium talking, but it's not a message that needs to be promoted to all the little girls out there.Feminist rant aside, it wasn't as funny and magical as say, Beauty and the Beast. I really enjoy the humour in Disney animated films. Mulan was entertaining in that way. All in all, The Little Mermaid is, by now, a little dated for my taste.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The film that returned Disney back to power is a fantastic example of how to make a great animated film.,"The Little Mermaid is without a doubt a classic. The animation is wonderful, the characters are likable, the music is some of Disney's best, and you feel the romance very well. Things like the animation of Ariel's hair floating in the water must have amazed audiences when it first came out. It doesn't have as many likable characters as some other Disney movies, but the ones that are likable are very likable. The music is fantastic. ""Under the Sea"" is one of Disney's best, and most famous songs. It is just so catchy. Then there are a few other great songs. Ursula's song ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" is really cool. Then there is ""Kiss the Girl"" which I think may be just as good as ""Under the Sea"". The romance is very well done, and you feel a lot of happiness from it. I'm a guy, and I'm willing to admit that I think this film is fantastic.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Under the Sea!,"Singing sea animals+mermaids+humans=The Little Mermaid!I enjoyed The Little Mermaid, like a lot when I was a young girl. When I went swimming, I pretend to be Ariel and sing ""Part of Your World"" with my horrendous singing voice (yes, my singing voice is very off key, monotone, or too pitchy). But I did it so YOSO (you only swim once). Ariel (Jodi Benson) has a voice like an angel and Ariel is my favorite princess EVER- she may be stubborn and spoiled, but she's determined, curious, and adventurous! I Love Ariel; she's just like me in some ways (I wanted to be a mermaid when I was younger!) So let's get back to the movieThe songs are freakin' awesome! When Sebastian and his animal friends sing ""Under the Sea,"" I want to be in the sea singing along and be with my sisters down there. That would be awesome! ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" sung by the fantastic villainess Ursula blew me away! It's just how she presented the song is so memorizing and freaky especially if you are part of that situation. ""Part of Your World"" is a showstopper, it's brilliant! All hail Jodi! She should be my singing coach if I had all of the money in the world. ""Kiss the Girl"" is cute, not as strong as the other 3, but I'll take it. The songs are some of the best that Disney has ever done, nuff said.The Little Mermaid has great and lively animation, Ursula is one of Disney's best villains (she and Scar from TLK are my favorite Disney villains of all time!!!!), Flounder is the cutest fish ever, it has a great plot, plus Jodi Benson as Ariel!

Disappointment,"The Little Mermaid is considered by many one of the best films by Disney. I was looking forward to see this movie because I respect Disney's earlier movies very much.The Little Mermaid is a disappointment. The story is based on a wonderful text by danish writer H.C. Andersen. I must warn all who are interested in this movie because of Andersen's text. It is by no means a strict screen adaption. The story is only loosely based on the original text and has lost almost all of its charm. Of course Disney has always treated its stories in its own way. Before the Little Mermaid however it has succeeded much better with its Americanizations, even with Robin Hood and Jungle Book.For my taste the animation style of the movie is another annoyance. Compared to almost any other Disney Classic The Little Mermaid's animation art is inferior. It is somehow ironic how clear the lack of legendary Disney artists in this movie is. The parameters which define almost every other Disney Classic up to and including The Fox and the Hound are gone: The Little Mermaid looks flat and lame. It's colors look artificial and characters are somehow unsympathetic, uninteresting and superficial. It all reminds me of a terrible animated series from the 90's: The Biker Mice from Mars. (Ok, I exaggerated - It is not THAT terrible.) To sum up: The Little Mermaid may be a nice movie for little kids, but is not artistically ambitious anyhow and its storyline is flawed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

And I, for one, am getting a little sick of seeing the same old thing over and over.Aside from that, the one major critisism I have about this movie, this is a reasonably good nostalgia buzz.

Great movie for little kids,"I saw this movie when I was very young and I loved it. It had a perfect fairy-tale ending and totally followed the formula for Disney movies in a great way. It really got it's message across with catchy tunes and fun characters.On the down side, while it had a great message, it didn't stay true to what Hans Christian Andersen wrote. I hadn't read Andersen's version until very recently, but I loved it. I thought it had a much better and far more realistic message than the Disney movie. Andersen said that if you're a good person, while you may not get your reward in life, being good is it's own reward. Disney, on the other hand, said that if you risk everything for the one you love, things will work out in the end. While that's a nice message for little kids that is very unrealistic. Good people are hurt all the time.I've heard people say that if girls grow up watching this, they will learn that big breasts, a small waist, and having a man by your side are what's important in life. This movie was made the year I was born, so naturally, I grew up on it. I don't hold myself to unrealistic standards or feel like I must have a man to go on.

Lord only knows,"Lord only knows why I don't like this Disney film as much as some of the others. There's nothing inherently wrong with it. It marked the beginning of Disney's renaissance. It's lively. It's hip. It's vibrant. So what's wrong? My personal tastes, I guess. The songs are big, but a few got on my nerves, as did a few of the characters. It has neither the charm of some of the classics nor the grandness of some of the later works, especially Beauty and the Beast. The things Ariel does to find happiness are a bit strange, such as her selling her voice to a complete stranger or her falling in love with someone who falls in love with her just for her voice. I also thought this movie was a bit too derivative of earlier classics like Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty. It's the same old fairy tale formula with nothing new added except better animation and bigger, but not necessarily better, songs. But don't let all this stop you from enjoying this movie.

I was again captivated by these same things, and learned to love the awkwardly adorable character of Eric (he makes me laugh n.n) I still find myself knowing the words to the songs, and singing along with them. The chemistry between him and Ariel when she can't speak is charming, and sweet to watch. I believe this is one of the last good Disney movies, and it will always be my favorite.With Disney releasing all of the classics on DVD, I hope to acquire all of my favorites, and raise my children on movies such as this, just as I was raised.

Watchable or unwatchable,"I did not find this production catchy, or original production. Overall, it's an average production.Talking about the script of the production: I think the script is quite predictable and far from fluent. He tells what he wants to tell well, but he cannot present it well. I think the biggest reason for this problem is that the characters, whether the main character is ""Ariel"" or ""Prince Erik"", are empty even though they are the main focus characters. There are two favorite characters: ""Sebastian"" and ""Scuttle"". These two characters are both fun and fast-paced. It certainly doesn't sting or faint while watching. Apart from that, our bad character ""Ursula"" is a good character from the cliché. The best part of the production is probably the songs. The work of the voice actors is great here.Here is a production that you will not lose anything if you do not watch, and you will not regret it if you watch it.

One of Disney's best,"""The Little Mermaid"" is a wildly entertaining movie. I saw this movie when it first came out (MovieWorld, Douglaston, NY) and many times since. Today was the first time I watched it in many years. Shame on me. It's terrific. The characters, artwork, story are all top-notch. The music is off-the-charts . Every song is great. ""The Little Mermaid"" also packs quite the emotional punch. It's a great movie that I'll be watching again soon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
This Movie made Quite a Splash,"""The Little Mermaid"" is both a return to form for Disney Animation, and the groundbreaking trendsetter that began the Disney Renaissance. Throughout Walt Disney's life, the Disney company was known for their revolutionary animated movies. After his death, the decades that followed saw a noticeable drop in quality in their animated content. Both critically and financially Disney was not performing well. In the 80's, Disney's movies were continually out grossed by the competition at the box office. Don Bluth had successfully stolen Disney's thunder. ""An American Tail"" beat "" Great Mouse Detective"" and ""Land Before Time"" beat ""Oliver and Company"". Heck, even ""The Care Bears Movie"" did better than Disney's animated film that same year. Disney had to rise to the challenge or face elimination. Their answer...""The Little Mermaid"".The movie was a huge hit, beating down Don Bluth's ""All Dogs go to Heaven"" and winning two Oscars. Disney was back on top, and this began a wave of success that saved the company's animation studio. But, enough of the historical context of the film, how is the movie itself?It is really good. The music is an absolute highlight. Most musicals may have one number that stands above the rest as being the big show stopping number. Mermaid had four. ""Under the Sea"", ""Part of your World"", ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" and ""Kiss the Girl"" are all great musical sequences that deserve all the praise they receive.The animation is also top notch. The company finally gave the studio the attention they needed to make this film a classic. Ariel was meant to be a combination of an Anime Girl and a Disney Princess, and it totally works. This would be the last Disney animated film to be painted, after this they would switch to digital coloring.People may criticize the morals that the movie teaches. Ariel is a rebellious teenager that runs off with the first guy she sees. And Disney does alter the original fairy tale in such a way that it changes the moral of the story. But it is a fairy tale, I think people should not look to this for advice on how to handle their love life.A lot of my critiques may stem back to my experience watching this as a kid. Where most times nostalgia helps for these films, sometimes it works against it. I saw this film as the ""girly movie"", and I didn't like romances or songs, I wanted dinosaurs. A little childish, but I can still feel those gripes all these years later. It follows a lot of the classic romance tropes. And the character of Ariel does not really change or grow as a person through the story. But she is very likable, energetic and willing to do what it takes to get what she wants. She does lead to the change of other characters in the story. The ending also feels out of place compared to the rest of the movie, but as a kid, that was usually my favorite part.It may not be perfect, but it is a very important animated film. It's animation and music set the standard for what animated films were supposed to be. Take some time and make this movie part of your world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Hans Christian Andersen must be rolling in his grave,"There are many things I like about ""The Little Mermaid""; the beautiful music, the lush colour and pageantry, the excellent voicework (though all would eventually be outclassed by later, better Disney efforts), and there's no denying that Ariel is someone your average adolescent girl can identify with. Indeed I could almost say it is great were it not for one simple (and catastrophic) error: a happy ending! The story of the Little Mermaid is a tragedy; she sacrifices her life to save the man she loves, even though he doesn't love her. It's a simple, cathartic tale, meant to raise a tear and redeem its audience. By giving the story a happy ending, the filmmakers have undone the very purpose for which it was originally written!",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

a dazzling undersea adventure,"Sweet, straightforward Disney concoction set under the sea about a lovely and rebellious young mermaid named Ariel who, though forbidden by her father (a strict ruler who despises humans), is fascinated by life on the surface and falls for a human prince.

With only a limited amount of time, Ariel must rely on skittish fish Flounder and crabby crab Sebastian if she hopes to make her dream come true.

The last movie of Disney's golden age!,"The Little Mermaid is truly a masterpiece among all of its followers in the Disney canon. I can remember seeing this movie in the theater when I was six years-old and being completely mesmerized by the story,songs and characters. Even as I watch it today, I can see why it has remained so popular for all these years. The Little Mermaid ushered in an entire new era of Disney movies,yet took us back to the golden age of Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. What makes this movie so great is its simplicity. It is entertaining to both children and adults. It is a timeless love between two unlikely heroes. The songs in the movie are beautiful and truly enhance the story. Not to metion, they get stuck in your head for days. As a child I remember walking out of the theater and singing the songs all the way home. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman are the modern-day Rodgers and Hammerstein of movie scores. As the last Disney movie to be entirely drawn by hand, it holds a special place in Disney history. The animation is truly breathtaking. The characters have the wonderful combination of both depth and lovability. There are so many elements that make this movie a classic, i would be here for days if I went into any more detail. Bottom line, this is a must see movie for all ages.

Great!,"I actually enjoyed this film. I liked how the plot was entertaining and managed to keep my attention as a viewer. I love the characters in this film they are really charming, and know how to make the viewers feel with them, the villain is a great one who is capable of making herself seem like she is simply just trying to save the main character, but wants to use her in order to rule the sea. The songs are fine, and really thought out, but in my opinion the films strongest aspect is the animation, I feel that the animation is fairly detailed and is really able to help the viewers know how the characters may be feeling via looking at their body languages or their face.

Colourful and Creative Animated Movie,"A favorite since early childhood, The Little Mermaid is truly one of Disney's most distinguished classics. Based on the Hans Christian Anderson story of the same name, this movie is a timely and fun almost-masterpiece.We meet Ariel, a rebellious and passionate teenage mermaid, who is the daughter of the ruler of the sea, King Triton. While at first she seems happy we soon learn that she has a yearning for another world - the human world, above the sea. She is obsessed with humans to the point that in a mad desperation she strikes a deal with Ursula, a sea witch, who will give her human legs in exchange for her voice. Ariel has three days to kiss a human prince or else she will belong to Ursula.The songs are catchy and memorable; tunes such as 'Under the Sea' and 'Part of Your World' are instantly recognizable and you can't help but sing (albeit badly) along to the irresistible melodies. The music itself is also rather grand, too.The characters are fantastic, the main character Ariel is impassioned and surprisingly (for Disney) realistic teenage girl. You completely relate to her problems, and in hindsight her decisions are understandable given her situation (Yes I disagree with complaints about her character - I think she's great). Also, Ursula is one of Disney's finest baddies. Her control over the story and elegant charisma create one of their greatest villains. My only issue is that perhaps if Ariel had shown more remorse for her actions, she would have been more of a good character (she doesn't really learn a lesson).All in all, while not their best film, The Little Mermaid truly ranks up with some of Disney's highest classics, a personal, fun and dramatic animated adventure. Filled with sing-along songs, beautiful animation, spritely and memorable characters and an intriguing plot, The Little Mermaid is not to be missed :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney's best....EVER!,"Ariel is a bright, fiery young mermaid princess, who loves to explore with her friends Flounder, a fish, and Sebastian, a bossy crab, the adviser of her father King Triton. Exploring often gets Ariel into trouble, and she must sneak around on the sly. Ariel is hugely fascinated by the human world - and she secretly visits old shipwrecks and other places, and collects old human possessions. Despite knowing that humans are ""dangerous"", Ariel cannot stop herself, and is enchanted by this different world. She ends up saving the life of a Prince named Eric, after his ship as destroyed by a hurricane as she was watching it.After taking Eric to shore, Ariel sings to him with her beautiful voice. As Eric opens his eyes, Ariel flees, as she does not want to be seen, afraid of scaring him. Ariel falls for Eric, and he too, for her, just by her singing. When King Triton finds out Ariel loves a human, he is furious and forbids her anything to do with him, and smashes all her secret human possessions. Hurt, and very angry, Ariel visits the sea witch Ursula, and exchanges her beautiful voice, in return for human legs. Ursula's magic allows Ariel to be human for 3 days, and if Ariel can make the Prince kiss her before the sun sets on the 3rd day, she will be human forever...I first saw this movie when I was six years old, and it has been my favourite Disney movie ever since. It was my first Disney film, and is still my all time favourite. I grew up singing the songs, talking like Ariel, I craved to be a real mermaid for years! The story, direction, animation, and character portrayal in this movie absolutely amazing - I loved every second. The best part I would have to say, is the music. My favourite song is ""Part Of Your World"", followed by ""Under The Sea"" and ""Kiss The Girl"". All songs are melodious and catchy, and tug at your heartstrings. Even ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" sung by Ursula was great. Even watching today, my opinion is the same. And I still remember all those memories I grew up with, thanks to this one film.One of the best Disney has ever produced. Thank you.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Everything is different when I grow up,"Watching the Little Mermaid as an adult, I couldn't help but reflect and judge while watching. I can not be like a child, desperate for love. I think the Little Mermaid paid too high a price, abandoning her family, betraying the bottom of the sea, for a false bubble. Seems to help her witch, hidden in the heart of a huge conspiracy, men's love and loyalty is really unreliable, she finally rely on her family to solve the problem for her. When I was young, my attention was attracted by beautiful pictures and beautiful music. When I grow up, I become a woman, I hope girls don't be deceived by sweet words, it is ok to pursue love, but don't abandon everything, it is really love brain. While I was watching, I was wondering if there was a better way to educate children, like sea king could expose Ariel to humans in a way that would shatter her delusioned fantasies, and then she would study humans as an underwater anthropologist. If Ariel really wants love so much, then let her have a try, let her experience the real human world without hurting herself. Well, grow up to see fairy tales really different, in any case really can't be love brain.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Not only a notable milestone in The Walt Disney Company's storied history, but a memorable tale and an incredible musical in its own right.","'The Little Mermaid' is the film that paved the way for a decade of releases from Walt Disney Animation which restored the studio to consistent commercial and critical success, the formula for which was distilled in this unforgettable adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's classic fairy tale.While also known for its use of culturally familiar characters and testing the waters of cutting-edge animation technology, Disney's Renaissance period is characterised by its Broadway-style musical numbers and captivating scores. 'The Little Mermaid' executes both perfectly in the first instance here, with 'Part of Your World' being amongst composer Alan Menken's most beautiful ballads created by him for the studio, while the insanely catchy calypso-reggae number 'Under The Sea' sinks a hook into your ear and never lets go. Famous scenes and iconic shots are all accompanied by an emotionally rousing swelling of the orchestra, from Ariel's first sighting of Prince Eric's ship to the reveal of King Triton's flawlessly gleaming castle. It isn't the songs alone which render the Renaissance period the pinnacle of Disney's relationship with music, but also the way in which they seamlessly flow throughout the story, creating an arresting sense of pace that defies even the relatively short (by modern standards) run time of Ariel's adventure.While a contemporary lens might highlight that Ariel's personality and questionable choices render her an inappropriate role model for young female viewers, one might argue that her flaws not only make her relatable, but also offer valuable lessons on the consequences of emotional, impulsive decision-making. Jodi Benson owns the role in all its facets, from the blindly headstrong teenage mermaid certain that she loves a stranger, to the princess who is too sheltered and naive to recognise that she truly knows nothing of the world above.Taking advantage of this lack of wisdom is Pat Carroll's sea witch Ursula, debuting as the first of a pantheon of classic villains who serve as a foil for Renaissance protagonists such as Ariel. The studio's commitment to making Ursula a genuinely intimidating and powerful villain solidifies 'The Little Mermaid' as a story with high stakes, her fearsome nature a gentle (though in no way inappropriate) introduction to the concept of terror for younger viewers.Timelessly animated in the hand-drawn style but still prettier than anything ever rendered on a computer, 'The Little Mermaid' is not only a notable milestone in The Walt Disney Company's storied history, but a memorable tale and an incredible musical in its own right.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"A solid film, just not one of my own favourites","Another one of the studio's films I hadn't previously seen, this one has a huge following even today. Whilst I don't personally agree it's top tier Disney, it's definitely one of the better ones from their early decades.It has catchy songs, memorable characters and a fun premise so I can see the reasoning for its hype. Jodi Benson does very well in the lead role of Ariel, while Pat Carroll (Ursula) and, most so, Samuel E. Wright (Sebastian) both give unforgettable voice performances. The latter is great, as he also has the best song in ""Under the Sea"".'The Little Mermaid' merges together for a solid film, just not one of my own favourites.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the Best Disney Classics,"The Disney Renaissance is one of the best recognised periods of the Disney animation studios, where Disney released many of its most creative, successful and all round incredible films. Whilst the start of this renaissance could arguably have its roots in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the Little Mermaid is definitely the film that led Disney towards its focus on a Broadway musical style and brought Disney animation back to the high quality that it had been lacking in previous years. It brought to life an incredible fantasy world though a mixture of great characters, stunning animation and quite possibly the best soundtrack that Disney has ever had.We get to follow Ariel, the youngest daughter of king Triton, who has become enamoured with the creativity of the human world and set her eyes on the dashing prince Eric. Whilst she longs to be part of the human world she becomes forbidden by her father to ever make contact with them. However in defiance of her father, she turns to the evil sea witch Ursula who creates a spell where she may walk on land to find her true love, but on the condition that if she fails to get the kiss of true love will become a slave to Ursula.Ariel is well above any Disney Princess that had come before her, with a genuine desire for adventure and her willingness to defy her father making her a very endearing and lovable figure. Just watching her childlike innocence and wonder as she discovers more of the human world makes her a real delight to watch. Similarly, Ursula is also up there with some of the best Disney villains. She comes over as being such a sinister Machiavellian character who manipulates emotions exploiting Ariel's youthful recklessness and longing for love in Poor unfortunate Souls. There's also a lot of great supporting characters like Flounder and Sebastian that keep the laughs coming in fast and strong.All of the animation in the film is nothing short of Disney magic. Every painstaking detail that must have taken countless hours to draw the stunning underwater environments was truly worth it creating something superior to anything that had come before it. From the small details of bubbles floating up to the sight of the sunlight hitting the ocean floor, no expense was spared and a true thing of beauty was created because of it. Beyond this the way in which the characters move throughout is also something to behold. The lifelike movements of Ariel as she gracefully flows through the ocean is wonderfully detailed with incredible touches of how her body sways through the water to her hair floating as she moves.Then there's the soundtrack and from the jig score you hear when Ariel first sees Eric to the big song pieces, the entire film is packed with some of Disney's most memorable and enjoyable songs. One highlight is obviously Under the Sea, being one of the catchiest tunes for kids to sing and working as a lively upbeat reggae tune. Though as great as Under the Sea is, Part of Your World is quite possibly one of the most stunning musical sequences put to film. It is quite possibly my favourite Disney moment as every emotional beat of the song really hits its mark and is a great song to showcase the stunning animation the film has to offer with the image of Ariel reaching to the surface being given a special place in my memory.I loved this film as a child and I have only grown to appreciate it even more with age. It's music and imagery are worthy of all the acclaim it receives, being just as strong today as it ever was.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A slightly overrated but overall impressive Disney flick,"I was only three years old at the time of this animated Disney movie's release, and can remember seeing a lot of it quite a few times back in the early 90's, but don't recall ever actually seeing the whole thing from start to finish. I don't think I ever watched any of ""The Little Mermaid"" after the early 90's, until this month, when I finally decided to rent it. (Before that, I didn't even know how the film ended, and the last bit of it didn't ring any bells.) Although I hadn't seen any of it since I was a little kid, and there are obviously many things which entertained me then but wouldn't now, I knew it was a popular Disney effort, so I had relatively high expectations. These expectations weren't quite met, but it has enough for me to give it a good review.Ariel is a sixteen-year-old mermaid and one of the daughters of King Triton, the Sea King. Her best friend is a yellow and blue fish named Flounder. The teenage mermaid is not happy with life underwater, and wishes to be a human, living up on the land. However, her father believes that all humans are ""barbarians,"" and forbids Ariel to ever go up to the surface, though she sometimes does. He assigns his assistant, a crab named Sebastian, to keep an eye on her, but this doesn't turn out to be easy. When Ariel sees a ship at the surface, she goes up to observe the human activity. She sees Prince Eric, and immediately falls in love. When a storm comes and destroys the ship, the young prince nearly drowns, but Ariel rescues him and takes him back to shore. After more conflict with her father, Ariel goes to see Ursula, the Sea Witch, and makes a deal with her, but doesn't realize that the evil Sea Witch intends to use her to try and take King Triton's place as the ruler of the sea!There are reasons why this particular Disney effort failed to absolutely blow me away, and one of them is the main character. Sometimes, Ariel's naivety can be excessive, and sometimes, thanks to her, the story doesn't seem quite right. It's certainly not the greatest love story ever told. ""The Little Mermaid"" doesn't have the greatest bunch of characters ever featured in a Disney film, and the script might sometimes be a problem as well. Fortunately, despite these flaws, there are quite a few things to like in this film. As usual with animated Disney films, there's humour here, provided by the likes of Scuttle, Ariel's seagull friend who tells her things about the human world (even though they are incorrect), as well as Sebastian, and sometimes other characters. There are also several memorable songs in this film (I can remember them from my childhood), which aren't bad, plus there's some excitement and nicely colourful animation, as usual for Disney.It seems many people absolutely adore this 1989 Disney flick, and apparently, it turned out to be the most successful film Disney had made in quite a while. I think I've made it clear that I'm not one of the film's strongest admirers. In fact, around the beginning, I might have even been a tad puzzled about all the hype. Nonetheless, it is pretty good family entertainment. I'm unfamiliar with the original fairy tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen, which this movie is based on, so I don't know how good this Disney effort is in comparison. As an animated feature from the Walt Disney Company, it's weaker than quite a few others in this category, but if you're a Disney fan, it can be very entertaining. It's definitely a lot better than ""High School Musical"", and probably certain other recent trash from the Disney Channel, which I haven't seen, and probably don't want to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

It should've stayed 'under the sea'...,"A Disney pacifier for children. Perky mermaid Ariel longs for life outside the ocean, acquires legs and ventures forth on land to meet a boy. The swirling colors and Broadway-styled musical numbers are pleasant and upbeat for the first half of the picture, yet even they take on a chintzy/glitzy ambiance that nullifies the old-fashioned tale, bowling the audience over yet numbing them at the same time. It is not ""the greatest thing ever put out by Disney"", although the film's creators would like you to think so. As cloying as the Disney output could be while Walt was alive and overseeing product, the worse everything got once he passed away. ""The Little Mermaid"" is hectic and mildewy, with a ready-made villainess and non-dialogue spouted by the vocal actors as if they were truly underwater. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
As Good as You Remembered It,"Just got the Diamond Edition and watched this in Blu-Ray, so what better time to review it than now.For the maybe one of you reading this who hasn't seen The Little Mermaid: it is the tale of Ariel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid who falls in love with the dashing Prince Eric, much to the dismay of her father, King Triton, who forbids her from going up on land. So what is she to do but make a deal with the sea witch, Ursula? Having three days to- without her voice- make Eric fall in love with her or join Ursula's posse of poor, unfortunate souls, she tries her hardest and is helped by the King's hand, Sebastian the crab, and her friend, Flounder the... um, flounder. But Ursula does not play fair, and has a sleeve full of tricks.I won't spoil what happens, but again, you already know.This is the film that kickstarted the Disney Renaissance, that brought The Studio That Walt Built back from the brink of oblivion and to artistic and financial prominence. Imaginative to the core, it was a major step forward for Western animation. All modern Disney movies are built off the Little Mermaid as much as the Bambi or Snow White, perhaps more.I'd go into the songs, but what's the point: you all know how good they are. My personal favorite is Part of Your World (also Ariel's leitmotif, if you listen) but everyone has their own favorite. They have become cultural touchstones for everyone over a certain age, a light in a pit of darkness. Alan Menken is one of the greatest composers of modern times, and I will hear no word to the contrary.Ariel is my favorite Disney princess of all time, and certainly my favorite of the 2-D era. They do not try to make her too much of a role model for girls and thus too perfect. She is imperfect and there is nothing wrong with that. She has so much personality, so much energy, so much curiosity. Anyone who doesn't like here has always struck me as someone that I want to stay far, far away from.If you were wondering, the Diamond edition is definitely worth it. The animation was beautiful for its time, and it still holds up today, but with the boost of digital restoration, it pops. The water is so blue, Ariel's hair is so red, Flounder is so yellow, and so on and so forth. If nothing else, it's worth buying just for that ten-second clip on the menu screen, of Ariel bathed in the light of a full moon. This movie is eighty-five minutes long. I could stare at that clip for that long and then some.If you expected me to say something negative about this, sorry to disappoint you.

Solid disney film,"This is my first time watching this film and although it was enjoyable and I liked it, among all the disney movies I've seen this wouldn't be considered my favorite. Like I said I liked it but I found this one a bit underwhelming and Ariel's character was kind of irritating to me. I mean the way she seemed so desperate for that human though.

"The bright creation of ""Disney""","The Little Mermaid in 1989 is a vivid and memorable cartoon that became a real milestone in the history of animation and brought with it a new era of Disney classics. It immerses viewers in a magical underwater world filled with colorful characters, exciting adventures and unforgettable melodies.One of the main advantages of the cartoon is its heroine, Ariel, a little mermaid with an unshakeable thirst for freedom and a desire to explore the world of people. Her pursuit of the new and unknown, along with her sincerity and curiosity, make her an incredibly likable and intimate character for viewers of all ages. Ariel's emotions and dreams reflect everyone's aspirations to find their place in the world, despite obstacles and limitations.The visual style of the cartoon is impressive even years later. The animation was done with great attention to detail, and the underwater world literally comes to life on the screen thanks to a rich palette of colors and smooth animation. Underwater scenes where light and shadows play create the atmosphere of a real fairy tale. I especially remember the scenes with marine life, each of which adds its own flavor to the narrative.It is impossible not to mention the musical accompaniment, which has become an integral part of the success of The Little Mermaid. Songs by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, such as ""Part of Your World"" and ""Under the Sea"", became real hits and still remain in memory, sometimes starting to play somewhere in the subconscious. The music highlights the emotional moments of the cartoon, helping to delve deeper into the story and feel all the emotions of the characters.The antagonist Ursula is one of Disney's most charismatic villains. Her image and manner add a special dramatic element to the cartoon. Ursula is not only an evil witch, but also a complex character full of cunning and energy. Her scenes are filled with tension and humor, making her one of the most memorable villains in animation.It is worth noting the development of the plot, which, despite the fabulous surroundings, touches on important topics such as the search for oneself, sacrifices for love and the struggle for dreams. ""The Little Mermaid"" shows how strong aspirations can change not only the person himself, but also the whole world around him. Ariel does not just dream of becoming a part of the human world, she is ready to risk everything for this dream, which underlines her determination and fortitude.The animated ""The Little Mermaid"" (yes, yes, because now there is also a film of the same name) is not just a beautiful fairy tale, but a story about the desire for freedom and self-expression, which resonates with every generation of viewers. The cartoon brings a lot of new elements to the Disney world that made it unforgettable. This is a work that continues to delight children and adults, bringing us back to the basic values of life and reminding us how important it is to follow your dreams. For me, this is a pretty good work by a well-known studio, of which there are many. I would not single it out as my favorite, but it is quite a worthy picture.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The shoot from which great things grew,This is a fascinating animated movie which rightly is known at the birth of the modern Disney animated movie (soon to be revived again thanks to John Lassiter). From a story point of view this is now thoroughly familiar fare with the main character and couple of comedy support characters having to overcome adversity before finding solace in the arms of the other main character. What is fascinating here is seeing the shaping of the modern Disney movie from some of the song themes that are re-used more successfully in later Disney movies to the beginning to experiment with 3D animation that was used to great effect in the next Disney movie 'Beauty and the Beast' . The film is itself I feel could be slightly better paces and for a Disney movie this is unusual as they are normally so tightly paced.

The Little Mermaid,"This is by far the absolute worst movie I've ever seen. An absolute flop for Disney at the box office, and it does NOT hold up today. Flat development on the characters especially the red-haired brat, a storyline that could use better development and music that makes nails on a chalkboard sound like Mozart. And need I bring up the controversies about a priest and a piece of coral. Kids, avoid this movie, it will traumatize you. The original fairy tale had much better story to it because it was dark and created by a genius.

Mermaid:  Queen of a Renniscance,"Before 1989, Disney had not had a successful animated film since the Rescuers in 1977. Disney entered a dark age in which I knew they would escape. But prospects seemed grim. Failures continued with Fox and the Hound and the Black Cauldron. In 1985, The animation staff began production on Hans Christian Anderson's, The Little Mermaid. They decided to turn Mermaid into a Broadway like musical. I think they began to build on to Mermaid by releasing the successful Great Mouse Detective, and Oliver and Company. The songs in Mermaid including Part of Your World, Under the Sea, and Kiss the Girl will never be forgotten. Mermaid was released in November of 1989 and became one of the most successful films of the year. I own both the 1990 VHS and the 2006 DVD.

Wonderful film and the songs are great,"Watching this movie as an adult, I realize that I could not have been more wrong. This film is a must see for all children, not only for the beautiful story of true love, but for the catchy songs, fun humor, and tear jerking moments. As an adult watching this film, I realize that this movie is not just a love story. In fact, the film isn't really about that. This film is about the father-daughter relationship between Ariel and King Triton.When Ariel falls in love with a human, Triton becomes angry and destroys her things because he is afraid of her being hurt. Ariel does not realize this, so she goes to the sea witch Ursula and exchanges her voice to be able to walk on land and be with her prince. The love story in this film, sweet as it may be, is only a bonus to this film. The story is really about Ariel and Triton, and Triton's love for his daughter, so proved when he sacrifices himself and control over the ocean to protect her.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

In my opinion, the animation holds up very well 26 years later.The cast of characters was extremely enjoyable - evil Ursula, funny Sebastian, loyal Flounder and of course, the man Ariel loved, Prince Eric.What truly made this movie a classic was the songs, particularly Under the Sea and Part of Your World, which Jodi Benson done a absolutely perfect job on.The Little Mermaid belongs in the top five all time Disney films in terms of both the movie and the soundtrack.

Groovy Movie with Mermaids and all that,"The Little Mermaid was a good film.

The songs are good; Jodi Benson has a nice voice. It's bizarre that Under the Sea won an Oscar. It's good, yes, but part of Your World was better. Anyway, this is a Disney classic. Without this film, you wouldn't have Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King. The Little Mermaid brought Disney back from the gutter. Man, this is a good movie.

The Little Mermaid,"Still a fine Disney classic. Filled with likable characters the Little Mermaid delivers another Princess story that works. With great music and a fantastic score than rightfully sticks around in your head.The music is upbeat and lovely, the whole conductor angle and having Sebastian take these elements and put them together makes it such a dynamic and enjoyable start to the ensemble. Combined with the creative animation and little characters it creates a instantly engaging scene. Most of the music is good here, I wouldn't say it has had my favorite music so far but there are a few ones that of course you simply can't forget like Under the Sea and Poor unfortunate souls.Characters are fine though I find them not to be as interesting or fun as some other entries. Scuttle and Flounder never really landed for me, fine but not really that engaging. Sebastian is great and Ursula as well, very memorable. Main characters, Ariel is pretty much perfect, humble, quirky, fun, all you need for a Disney princess really. The Prince felt more like backstory here, he doesn't have all too much screen time and we don't really get to know that much from him. Mostly in due part to the plot with Ariel's voice. Which I never saw coming and was curious how they were going to solve it. It made for a interesting section of the movie where the animation really had to work it's hardest. And it did. Having your main character not talk for a whole while isn't easy but they managed to do it pretty perfectly.Pacing felt good, never really had a problem where I'd find myself wandering off. Directing was solid some beautiful scenes, the swamp and final scene are great.Endings are always quick I'm starting to notice with these and again I wish we had a little more celebration than we did. The final fight was fine though, and the Prince finally got to do something. All in all very enjoyable. I'm having a hard time what to rate these movies but once I've seen more of them I think I will hone in on the right number.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Little Mermaid,"This glorious Disney take on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale is one of the company's most successful and beloved films. It was an instant smash right from the start and is equally popular today. It's easy to see why. The music is top-notch Disney: including Sebastian's two show stoppers (Under The Sea and Kiss The Girl) and Ariel's now-legendary ballad, Part Of Your World). The artwork direction is spectacular: beautifully animated characters against detailed backgrounds of mainly deep blues and aquamarine. Ariel is the first Disney princess who actually helps move the plot forward and Ursula is the ultimate Disney villain. We own this film in 3 editions (1990 and 1998 VHS; 2006 DVD) as this has been a favorite of ours from the get-go. The Little Mermaid is excellent entertainment which I recommend to everyone.

"A key turning point in Disney's history, but also the weakest of its Renaissance.","There's no doubt that The Little Mermaid (1989) was a turning point for Disney. It helped revive the studio into its Renaissance after struggling for decades. Some of their best films came in this era sparked by The Little Mermaid, in part due to its success. Its songs and animation were its strong points, both of which are remembered today. However, its lesson (if there even is one) seems to be either too lost in the details or perhaps a bit too old for the young girls who love watching this movie.Several of the songs in The Little Mermaid are Disney classics that most people can probably hum a few bars. Alan Menken established himself as the de facto songwriter for Disney movies with these hits. Watching this movie as an adult, I'm still blown away with Disney's animation techniques here. There were several moments that had me scratching my head, thinking, ""How did they get that effect to work?"" Surprisingly, it's easy to pick out the early use of CGI, but not so easy as to be distracting from its accomplishment.Having now seen this movie several times with my daughter, I think the B-plot in an already scant 83 minute movie is its weakest point. That the antics of a crustacean trying to help Ariel achieve her dream feel out of place is also likely because the message feels a little muddled. I'm all for little girls following their dreams, but I also think King Triton (Kenneth Mars) could have done a little better as a single father to explain the dangers of the surface. Is the moral to read the fine print on contracts? Is it teaching girls to be better at being seen and not heard? Whatever it is, I'm sure I'll have to sit through it at least a dozen more times.A key turning point in Disney's history, but also the weakest of its Renaissance, I give The Little Mermaid 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A splash of magic and melody,"""The Little Mermaid,"" directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, is a beloved animated classic that brought Disney back to the forefront of animated storytelling in 1989. The film tells the enchanting tale of Ariel, a curious and adventurous mermaid princess who dreams of living in the human world. Voiced by Jodi Benson, Ariel's longing for a life beyond the sea is beautifully captured through her heartfelt songs and spirited personality.The movie's standout feature is its unforgettable music by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, with iconic songs like ""Under the Sea"" and ""Part of Your World"" that continue to resonate with audiences of all ages. The animation is vibrant and fluid, bringing the underwater world to life with stunning colors and imaginative designs.Supporting characters like Sebastian the crab, Flounder the fish, and the villainous sea witch Ursula add depth and humor to the story. Ursula, in particular, voiced by Pat Carroll, is a memorable antagonist with her striking presence and menacing charm.While ""The Little Mermaid"" follows a familiar fairytale structure, its charm, music, and characters make it a delightful and enduring film that continues to capture the hearts of viewers worldwide.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
What's that word ... Excellence,"Greetings again from the darkness. The first of three true classics from the ""middle era"" of Disney animation ... along with Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994) ... this 1989 version of Hans Christian Anderson's 1837 story brought musical theatre to an animated children's fairy tale. It was also the 28th Disney film, and the final to utilize hand-painted cel animation.The Blu-Ray release to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary is truly stunning in color, brightness, clarity and sound. An explosion of sight and sound occurs during the incredible cacophony of joy and cheer better known as the Best Song Oscar winner ""Under the Sea"". The calypso style was a very creative choice by musical directors Alan Menken and Howard Ashman.Of course, the star of the show is Ariel, the rebellious 16 year old mermaid who dreams of walking on the beach and dancing with the Prince. Ariel's remarkable vocals (""Part of Your World"") are provided by Jodi Benson, who beautifully captures the innocence and longing necessary for the character. Samuel E Wright is the smooth voiced Jamaican crab Sebastian, who not only takes lead on ""Under the Sea"", but also on ""Kiss the Girl"". The other standout is Pat Carroll as Ursula the Sea Witch. She is the perfect villain vs Ariel, and is quite a commentary on the actions of those who are power hungry.Written and directed by John Clements and Ron Musker, the film was a bit different for its time because of the depth of Ariel's character. This was a typical teenager going against her strict parent and dreaming of a better life. Ariel has a mind of her own and is willing to chase her dreams ... even if it's a boy from the proverbial ""other side of the tracks"" and with a Faustian negotiation. From a technical perspective, the artwork is spectacular and movements are full and fluid (sorry for the pun). This came 5 years after Ron Howard's live action Splash with Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah. If you ever doubt the power that expert animation can possess, just compare the emotion and charm in those two.This latest Blu-Ray release has some very interesting special features. We are treated to interviews with the film's animators as well as a peek inside the Disney Animation studios, now on its third generation of animators. Much reverence is provided to The Nine Old Men ... the original group of animators hand picked by Walt Disney. The last of the nine men died in 2008, and their trainees are now mentoring the most excited new group that is kicking out some new classics like Frozen and Wreck-it Ralph.

The first sign of that old Disney magic,"Kicking off what is now known as the Disney Renaissance (following a brutal decade of flops and underachievers), The Little Mermaid reignited some of that old Disney magic, with some beautiful and lovingly-drawn animation and a good old-fashioned, yet familiar, story. Based on the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, it's a tale of a beautiful princess who falls in love with a dashing prince, with the snag being that the girl, Ariel (voiced by Jodi Benson) has a flipper, lives under the sea, and is best friends with a Rastafarian crab and a cowardly tropical fish.King of the sea Triton (Kenneth Mars) is obeyed by all in his realm, with the exception of the most important person in his life, his daughter Ariel. She has bigger dreams and is obsessed with the deadly world of ships and brutal men above the sea surface. One day, she swims to the world above and spots dashing prince Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes), who she instantly falls in love with. Desperate to escape her father who forbids her wild adventures, she is taken by two eels, Flotsam and Jetsam (both voiced by Paddi Edwards) to Ursula (Pat Carroll), a sea witch with tentacles like an octopus. In exchange for Ariel's beautiful voice, Ursula transforms her into a human, but she must receive true love's kiss within three days or else she will turn back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula's garden of creepy souls.The fact that The Little Mermaid is very much in the style of 'classic' Disney works both for and against the film. On one hand, it's beautifully drawn with memorable songs ('Under the Sea' is a particular stand-out), but it also treads the overly familiar fairytale tropes of princes, princesses, witches and the kiss of 'true love'. However, it brought Disney into the modern era. Ariel is not just a la-di-da maiden who enjoys cleaning whilst singing sickly tunes; she is independent and slightly wild, eager to explore the mysterious world she does not belong to. Her companions are also welcome, with crab Sebastian (Samuel E. Wright) providing many laughs, especially in his efforts to escape a pompous chef who wants to cook and serve him. It's perfectly likable throughout, but Disney wouldn't find it's true magic again until two years later.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
My favorite Disney movie even though I'm a boy,"I love The Little Mermaid. It happens to be my favorite Disney movie even though I'm a boy in 11th grade. I love the characters. My favorite being Scuttle the forgetful but funney Seaqull. I loved it when he sticked the fork thinking it was a dingle hopper into his hair and it made his hair stick up! I also liked it when he tried to sing during Kiss the Girl song but his singing sounded awful! Those were both hilarious scenes! John Musker and Ron Clements were smart to cast comedian Buddy Hackett in that role! I'm also a fan of Ursula the seawitch because I think she looks like my Aunt Pat. The one scene where I see my aunt as Ursula is when Ursula says to Ariel You'll have your looks! Your pretty face! And don't underestimate the importance of body language! That's where I say that's definitely my Aunt Pat! I also like the songs written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. I love Part of Your World. It's probably the best song in the movie! Filled with wonderful characters, animation, songs, and story Little Mermaid in my opinion is the best Disney movie ever! It will always be my favorite even though I'm a boy.

Swimmingly good,"Credited with really starting Disney's animated Renaissance, my wife was determined to make me watch this with her over the festive holiday. How could I resist?Adapted from the Hans Christian Anderson fairytale, it's excellent family entertainment, with a suitably sympathetic pair of young lovers at the heart of its story, a disagreeably bad villain in the guise of the wicked witch of the sea and a fine soundtrack of catchy songs perfectly in simpatico with the plot.Of course the under-the-sea settings with its exotic creatures give the animators plenty of scope for colour, imagination and flair and they don't let us down. I wasn't sure the story required that Ariel actually lose her voice for a significant period of time, but if it's in the original story (and I haven't checked) then fair enough, I suppose.There's nothing earth-shatteringly original in this movie which looks backward to Disney's glorious fairy-tale legacy of youthful innocence being corrupted by some evil menace going all the way back to Snow White, but modernised as here with some good jokes and today's music, it happily updates the studio's legacy and of course set the path for the great successes the studio and its PIXAR affiliate has enjoyed ever since.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Aside from a 'parents are stupid' m, a wonderful film.","I love ""The Little Mermaid"" and it's a brilliantly made film. It also represents the rebirth of Disney Studio--a film that firmly announced that they were once again a great producer of family full-length cartoons. This being said, I have one very minor quibble about the movie--very minor. The meta-message seems to be that parents are a bit stupid and kids should be encouraged to make their own choices. While this is sometimes true, it's a message too often found in films of the 1980s. Now I am NOT attacking Disney for this--too often Steven Spielberg and others promoted this message during this time, so why shouldn't the studio hop on the bandwagon? This is the sole reason the film only gets a 9 from me, not a 10. And, this is why I adored their followup film, ""Beauty and the Beast"", as it had a marvelous message from start to finish.

A complete classic... one of the best.,"THE LITTLE MERMAIDThis is one of my favourite Disney films.The movie is about a mermaid princess who dreams of exploring outside of the ocean. One day she saves a human prince from drowning and she falls in love. The problem is, she is a mermaid... so she signs a deal with an evil witch to change her into a human for 3 days. She now has a race against timer and has 3 days to make the prince fall in love with her, otherwise she becomes one of the witches weeds.The story is great and there are so many great characters in this film. Ariel is the main mermaid that falls in love with Prince Eric. Her friends are there to help her through her adventure though. Flounder is her little fishy friend, Sebastian is her crab friend and Scuttle is her seagull friend. Sebastian is my favourite character in the whole film. He is so funny... but then so is Scuttle.This is pretty much what you would expect from a Disney cartoon. It is a complete classic and is up near the top of the list in my mind near Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.What I liked about this too is they didn't use famous names to sell it. I have never heard of any of the people who did voices for this movie. Jodi Benson, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Jason Marin, Buddy Hackett, Samuel E. Wright and Pat Carroll do the voices of the main characters.This film is full of adventure, love and music. The songs are very catchy and you can't help but tap your feet along to the classic songs Under the Sea and Kiss the Girl.This really is one of the best, and it is made even better because it was drawn and not computer animated. I always did prefer the drawn cartoons.I will give this film 8 out of 10.""Somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor.""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
So Delightful... The Best Disney Movie,"A tough claim to make, but there are just so many reasons why I believe this to be true.

I find it to be unique compared to the other ""princess"" Disney films - something about it is a little edgier, a little funnier. The music is fantastic (Under the Sea and Kiss the Girl have to be my favorite Disney songs of all time - love that little Calypso singing crab). It lacks potentially offensive cultural stereotypes and traumatic moments that might scar a child for life (thanks a lot, Bambi and Lion King). Even the antagonists are fun (just look at Ursula's LBD) There's just nothing not to like.LOVE.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
superb,"A fully-coloured cartoon, comes from Hollywood and is superior to majority of its releases. It's smart, it's fun, it's huge despite 85 minutes length and it is a perfect entertainment for me (19), my mother (52) or a pre -school child.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Best film ever made!,"Ariel is the best ever character created by Disney. Glen Keane has surpassed himself. Ariel is beautiful, headstrong, and has the most enchanting voice (both singing and speaking). She is so brave as to stand up to her father and make a pact with Ursula, basically the devil to get her prince (who is very cute). The movie is filled with the best songs, written by the classic duo Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (1950-1991), and it's no wonder they won an Academy Award for 'Under the Sea.' Jodi Benson is brilliant as Ariel, and in my opinion has the most beautiful voice in the world. Jodi is a great actress! The Little Mermaid is the best film in the world, and I would recommend it to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Highest possible recommendation.,"This film was the first of the ""new generation"" (i.e. post-Michael-Eisner) of Disney animated classics, and remains the best of the new breed. Jodi Benson's voice as Ariel the Mermaid is unmatched in vocal quality -- she's literally the best singer I've ever heard. The animation is Disney-quality (i.e. wonderful), and there are lots and lots of little ""underwater touches"" in the movie, such as when Triton says, ""I consider myself a reasonable merman"" instead of ""reasonable man."" You don't notice them overtly, but they slip their way into your subconscious, so that you really believe you are watching what goes on ""under the sea"". Add to that a fabulous Allen Menken score and witty Howard Ashman lyrics, sung by Jodi's voice, and you've got what I consider to be the greatest musical film (of any type, including those with live actors) ever made. Highest possible recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Excellent movie!,"I rated this movie as a 10 because I absolutely love it. I think any little girl would watch it over and over again. I know I did when I was younger. The animation is incredible and the songs are fun to sing along to. ""The Little Mermaid"" shows that if you truly believe in something and work at it, there is a good chance it will come true just like it did for Ariel. For some girls, it's like a dream come true.I also like how it's got somewhat of a love story in it. Ariel was willing to do anything in order to be with the man she so quickly fell in love with. The characters really got my attention because they were so colorful. Kids really like that type of stuff. The backgrounds were also very attractive as well. I would suggest any Disney movie because they are all wonderful and great for the whole family.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Pure Perfection,"Of all Disney's animated movie, I think Mermaid is one of the best. Clemens and Musker really followed Walt Disney genius regarding story telling and adaptation of classic fairy tale. It is fun, charming, adorable, sweet, funny, and great. The characters are all very strong and unmemorable, especially Ursulla and Sebastian. The animation is beautiful. The score is THE best of all Disney's movie so far, and Menken had really been inspired. How many times i heard with great pleasure and smile ""under the sea"" ? The action is nearly non stop. Ariel is a pure beauty. It is actually difficult for me to ""review"" or comment this movie, as i think it so good. Clemens and Musker are pure genius, real artists and poets. Wonderful, inspired, magic. Perfect. Tks Ron and John.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Fairy Tale That Commenced Disney's Renaissance Era.,"The fairy-tale which began Disney's Renaissance Era must have been a classic flick of its time but looking back now, The Little Mermaid doesn't feel as impressive as it did years ago. The story is a typical fairy tale, this time set in the ocean & concerning a young mermaid who falls in love at first sight with a human prince on board a ship & aspires to become human so that she can spend her life with him. The sea witch offers to fulfill her wish but it's part of her big evil plan to become the new ruler.The 2D animation still looks fantastic & makes striking use of colours in portraying the underwater world of Atlantica. The now memorable characters of Ariel, Sebastian, Ursula & others are wonderfully drawn & rendered on the screen, the story is a let down to be honest & there is nothing special about it. Same goes for the music in my case & the only song I liked is the beautifully composed & magnificently executed 'Under the Sea' track.On an overall scale, The Little Mermaid will always be remembered for it marked the beginning of a new era that took Disney to new creative heights & commercial success and also resurrected some of the elements this studio had given up long ago. But as a standalone film, the plot & story is pretty weak and it no more looks like a film that viewers of all ages will be able to enjoy.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The musical numbers in this movie are very good,"The Little Mermaid is a great family movie that the younger children will get a kick out of -- even mom and dad might enjoy it too. The musical numbers in this movie are very good, including my favorite song ""Under the Sea."" Even the villainess has a good number to sing and perform. Romantics will get a kick out of the movie as well. The colorful underwater scenes are fabulous to watch, a real treat for the eye. The little mermaid herself has a stunning voice. The underwater creatures are adorable to watch and each presents unique personalities. My son had me read him the story several times until he was about 6 years old. So go ahead and pop some popcorn and get everyone a soda or a glass of milk for some good old fashioned musical and family entertainment.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the Best Disney Movies,"when i was growing up, the movie the little mermaid was my most favorite mosvie of all. today i still love it and i still today watch Disney movies like Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and so on. and its one of my top 10 favorite movies. if you didn't see this movie, I'm telling you that you have to see it. its a very cool movie for kids and so on. it may be a cartoon movie but its a good movie. i love the songs Arial sings especially ""part of that world"" and ""under the sea"". so if you did not see this movie, this movie is a must to see. you would love the songs they play and all those stuff. well i hope you will see the movie and enjoy it. bye =D",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney could not have done it better,"The Little Mermaid is Disney at its best. The film wowed audiences and critics alike back in its 1989 release. And rightly so- ""Mermaid"" provides some of the best animation ever seen in a Disney film. From the breath-taking underwater sequences to the truly spectacular sequences on the land. The Little Mermaid is also known for its excellent songs. ""Under The Sea"", ""Kiss The Girl"", ""Part Of Your World"" - need I say more? The characters are also hugely memorable - and Ariel is the ultimate heroine. Its excellent performance at the box office, with $111m (today adjusted to $217m) in the US alone, started a whole new golden era for the Disney company. To this day, ""Mermaid"" remains one of Disney's most beloved and popular films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Excellent Disney Classic,"I was never a fan of The Little Mermaid when I was a child, but after re-watching it, I find it to be a very funny, sweet and charming Disney film. It has everything that's typical of a good Disney movie - great music, a cool villain, likable protagonists, amusing sidekicks and a gripping plot.I like Ariel's headstrong nature. She's rebellious and passionate without being 'bratty' like the 'adolescents' we see in cheap direct-to-video sequels. There is not a single sidekick that I found annoying. They all had their fair share in the story, and weren't just there for the sake of it. Ursula is one of Disney's best villains. She has a fabulous song and believable motives. I think she's pretty much the standard that many Disney villains are judged by.The music is fun to listen to. The songs are unforgettable (if a bit too numerous for my liking). 'under the Sea' is especially catchy, but my favourite would have to be 'Kiss the Girl.' It's atmospheric without being over the top.The animation is a little dated, but aside from that this is a must see Disney movie. It brought Disney back up to the top and revived animation. Too bad Disney made a crappy sequel (and a third one is coming soon).",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Great Broadway style songs in a Disney animated classic,Ariel is a mermaid princess curious about the mysterious human life on land. She collects various objects with her fish friend Flounder which the clueless Scuttle the seagull misidentifies. Her father King Triton is not happy with her fascination. The crab Sebastian is the king's courtier composer and he is assigned to keep an eye on Ariel. Ariel goes to spy on Prince Eric celebrating his birthday on his ship. He's looking for the right girl. His ship runs into a storm and Eric is thrown overboard. Ariel rescues him and leaves when he regains consciousness. He remembers her beautiful singing. King Triton finds out and destroys her salvage objects. Two eels named Flotsam and Jetsam take Ariel to Ursula the sea witch who strikes a deal with her. She trades her voice for a pair of legs for 3 days. She must get a true love's kiss before the third sunset to remain human or else she'll return to be a mermaid belonging to Ursula. It turns out that Ursula has an even darker plot.This could be seen as a movie for little girls. There's validity to that viewpoint. It's just a very well made movie for little girls. There's nothing wrong with that. The songs are terrific. Ariel is one of the most lively adorable compelling Disney princesses. Ursula is a great villain. And the animal sidekicks are lots of fun.,8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A tail of never giving up hope,"The iconic scene of Ariel sitting on a rock, looking out at Eric and singing 'Part of Your World', obviously sums up what the film is all about- reaching your goals and never giving up, whatever the circumstances. A modernised adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson's classic, truly speaks for itself. With the production stylings of Howard Ashman and John Musker, they have truly achieved this beautifully and really makes anyone emotional, every time they see it.A story of a daring, sixteen year old mermaid, Ariel, who is fascinated by humans and what is beyond the water. When going against her father's rule that no-one was supposed to go above the surface, she sees the most beautiful thing ever- Prince Eric. With her side-kick, Flounder and the 'party pooper' Sebastian she goes to the sea witch, Ursula to get Prince Eric. However Ursula has other plans, that may ruin Ariel's chance with the Prince.With the vision of producers, Howard Ashman and John Muskar and the crew behind them, they have captured this epic tale in such a way, that is true poetry- no lie. True, they have changed the ending from the original, all they want is that everyone goes home relieved that Ariel gets her happy ending, as opposed to the Hans Christian Anderson version, in which the feisty mermaid doesn't get her happy ending.With a all-star cast, consisting of voices from: Jodi Benson (Ariel/Vanessa), Christopher Daniel Barnes (Eric), Pat Carroll (Ursula), Kenneth Mars (Triton), Jason Marin (Flounder), Samuel. E. Wright (Sebastian), Ben Wright (Grimsby), Buddy Hackett (Scuttle), Edie McClurd (Carlotta), Paddi Edwards (Flotsem and Jetsem) and Will Ryan (The Sea-horse), they have come together to make this creation come alive.Overall, I do not think there is any fault with this film, as with the other films Disney has made.

"""Rethinking Columbus"" offered some good insight","In 1992, when most of the country was celebrating the quincentenary of Columbus landing in the Americas, the educational organization Rethinking Schools published a study guide called ""Rethinking Columbus"", looking at the real effects that his legacy had. One of the things that it mentioned was portrayals of certain groups in popular media, and it mentioned Disney movies, including ""The Little Mermaid"". The three women in the movie are Ariel, Ursula and the maid. One exists only to be beautiful, one exists only to be evil, and the other exists only to get chores done. In short, not good role models for little girls.I guess that as long as we understand that, the movie is probably OK. I actually think that it sounds funny that religious wackos have found what they claim are sexual perversions in the movie. What's really interesting is when one sees the cast: Rene Auberjonois, Nancy Cartwright, Gerrit Graham, Buddy Hackett, Mark Hamill, Kenneth Mars and Edie McClurg. To rephrase that: the ""MASH"" priest, Bart Simpson, a cult flick star, Benji from ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", Luke Skywalker, the ""Young Frankenstein"" cop, and the woman who got cursed at by Steve Martin in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"".

A Disney treasure,"This movie was my very favorite movie when I was little. I used to watch it every day, and I fell in love with it. The beautiful Ariel is a spunky heroine. Now that I am 16, I have passed the movie love to my 5-year-old sister. I still love this movie very much, and my sister loves this movie too. Ariel is a wonderful heroine, and Eric is the perfect love interest, even though she is a mermaid and he is a human. I liked the sequel too, but nothing will ever replace the original treasure that is ""The Little Mermaid"".

Something's starting right now,"The end of the 80s was a good time for Disney Studios. They had managed to avoid closing down with The Great Mouse Detective, Oliver & Company had beaten The Land Before Time at the box office, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit had been a huge success. And it's that last movie that would lead directly to the creation of this one, and the beginning of Disney Renaissance, the undisputed Golden Age of Disney Animation. And the reason is that they managed to bring over a lot of the animators that had worked on Roger, thus bringing a lot of new blood and energy into their animation team. Add in the musical virtuoso Alan Menken and you had all the right ingredients for something magical.And this is the first result of all that labour, love and effort. Adapting a story of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen, it tells about a little mermaid - what a twist - named Ariel, the youngest daughter of the sea king. Ariel is the loveliest of the daughters and the one with the most beautiful voice. Nevertheless she's a problematic child to raise, for she's endlessly fascinated by the human world above the waves, which has long been the source of misery for the sea folk. Things start to unravel as Ariel saves a drowning prince from a storm, naturally falling head over heels for this tall, dark stranger. As Disney princesses do.The Little Mermaid is the source and well of a lot of things we have come to accept as Disney hallmarks. The Broadway musical style of songs, the fairy tale structure and source materials, the lavishly lush animation, the humorous side characters, the romance, the prince and the princess, the themes of yearning, acceptance, hope and dreams. Naturally other Disney films had had these things before, but in this film they all came together and took the shape and form we all recognize today.And it's a very good example of that classic Disney formula. Especially on the musical side of things. This film has one of the best soundtracks out of all the Disney films. All the songs are classics, they're all catchy beyond belief and instantly recognizable by any member of modern society. Kiss the Girl is probably my favourite, closely followed by Poor Unfortunate Souls, but they're all great.It's more than likely that you've all already seen this film, but if by some miracle you haven't What are you waiting for?",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Extremely well thought of movie by Disney!,"This is one of Walt Disney's most brilliant movies ever! It is pretty sad and suspenseful. All the kids around loved it and so did I.

The Best Disney Film Of All Time,"The Little Mermaid is a spectacular movie, and it saved Disney Animation from going under. It ushered in the second Rennassaince. Perfect songs, magical vocal performances, spectacular animation all in the highest Disney tradition.The Little Mermaid is the tale of a beautiful young mermaid named Ariel who longs for something more than what she has in her life, namely to live on land and to 'be where the people are'. She saves a young prince from drowning, and falls in love at first sight. It is her beautiful voice that wakes him. After her father finds out, and smashes all of her precious human finds in her grotto, she sets out to get Prince Eric, by making a deal with an evil sea witch. What follows is a frantic race against time, before the sun sets on the third day.Somewhere under the sea and beyond your imagination lies an adventure in fantasy...........This sums up the whole film really. Winner of two very deserving Oscars, and two Golden Globes, it was a winner with both critics and the box office. Ariel was the first immediately popular Disney heroine, and she has become an iconic figure with Disney. Jodi Benson (the voice of Ariel) is still doing voice work for Disney now, as part of the new Disney Princess line.This film has been loved since it was first released, and is a true Disney Classic in every sense of the word.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Ummm sometimes I think that people are crazy...,"really who comes up with stuff like that since the princess is skinny and has big boobs and doesn't listen to her parents and gives up everything for her man she is going to corupt the youth that watches it? I am a girl who grew up watching this movie (litterally everday) and I just want to tell anybody who thinks this movie is corupting, I am not anorexic, I don't plan on ever getting a boob job, I have never done anything that my parents have been strongly against, and I don't have a boyfriend nor am I going to give my soul to the devil in order to get one (even though it is kind romantic that ariel, to a certain extent, does that in the movie...yeah i don't think that translates to real life...obviously my judgement has not been impaired from watching this movie every day either) So to any parents who are worried this movie will corupt their young daughters, back off! it won't, Im living proof!Now to say, if you couldn't already figure it out, this was my favorite Disney movie. Great for both little girls (and boys for that matter) and 14 year-olds like me who still watch it with their three-year old sisters. Kiss the girl is my favorite song, it is so romantic! All in all, A great family movie for all ages!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Probably worst Disney film,"This film is totally overestimated. I acknowledge the songs. They are good,; Disney songs usually are good. But otherwise I cannot see any good points of the film.The story is only to be called crappy. The love story is superficial and in mine eyes not really persuading. The typical Disney villain is, well, typical but not really much else. The same goes for Triton; as a matter of fact there isn't much of character in him. The entire storyline is completely predictable. And the ending...When I saw it, about the last 5 minutes of the film, I only thought, like: ""That is the most ridiculous ending you have ever seen."" Finally, the animation. It may be personal preferences and such, but from my point of view it did quite well with the nonhuman things, but sucked portraying the prince or Ariel. Ariel was sort of the most hideously drawn main character up till then.Thus my opinion about the film: You can watch it one time, but you will never watch it twice.PS: Oh, and about the whole Disney classics thing: a film of 1989 is no classic! A film of the forties or fifties is a classic (and classics have a quality never reached since). Pray do not desecrate the holy classics of early Disney animation by calling every puny film after not even two decades a goddamn classic.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The best!,"This is, by FAR, my all-time favourite movie. I think it might have to do with the fact that it was the first movie I ever saw in a theatre. I had JUST turned 7 years old! I've wanted to be Ariel ever since then. April is close. My signature is even similar to hers! It is a requirement to watch it if you even KNOW me! I used to come home everyday after school and watch it.... and I was in HIGH SCHOOL!!! I even convinced one of my teachers to watch it in class instead of doing work. It was a half day, so our classes were only 90 minutes long. And as the movie is 84, I had 6 minutes to convince her. It took 3. :) We did end up righting an essay about it. It was a lot of fun!

The one that started it all,"I had the opportunity to see this again.  This is said to be the last of Disney's animation to be completely hand drawn.  Watching it now, I could just imagine how the movie would look like had it been made and released today.  Anyway, this movie helped spark Disney's annual full-quality animated feature in the 90's.Anyway, Ariel, the little mermaid, sports the largest eyes I've seen in Disney human heroines.  It seems to me this is the first time Disney used such large eyes on such a character (usually it's anyone but the heroine). The animators make full use of that as a window to her soul.  Though this is nothing new (in Japanese animation), it really brought out her character here.  The songs are very memorable without the benefit of hot artists singing their own versions. I just wish the tv series made more use of Ariel's many sisters.  They didn't serve much purpose here.The verdict: 4.5 of 5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Almost as good as I remember it,"Movies like this remain sterling in the mind of someone like me that watched them constantly as a toddler. I would not have admitted to it, but I loved this movie. Watching The Little Mermaid again at 17 years, I don't love it quite so much, but I can still say it's a very good movie.Ariel is the youngest daughter of the king of the mermen. She dreams of walking as a human and when she meets a prince named Eric, she falls in love and trades her voice with a sea-witch in order to become human.A plot summary like that makes this movie sound incredibly boring. Memorable songs and hilarious characters like Sebastian, a crabby crab that Ariel's father assigns to keep her in check, and Scuttle, a bird who thinks he knows everything but clearly does not, keep the story lively and entertaining.This Disney movie doesn't inspire me with as many feelings of praise as the Pixar films or Beauty and the Beast or the Lion King. But it's a fun movie, and I have to say it has some of the best music Disney's ever put to film. Part of Your World, Kiss the Girl, and Under the Sea are great songs and make the movie worth seeing in themselves.

My favorite Disney movie,"I used to watch this movie all the time as a girl, in Sweden we also got treated to the magical singing voice of Sissel for Ariel. A lot of great voices for the Swedish dub made this very enjoyable, most of the lyrics I remember even today.I won't give it a full ten stars, because I wish there had been more development between Ariel and Eric. He is heroic, kind and considerate, but much more than that isn't known about him. He remains pretty much out of the spotlight to make more room for Ariel. At least the movie did good by making him so caring about the dog Max, and that the dog isn't just there for a comedic value.The movie is fun, magical, frightening at times and the songs really lift up the movie.

This one is one of the best,"The Little Mermaid will always be remembered as the film which saved animation industry. Though the quality of animation had declined in the 60's, except for The Jungle Book, the real low quality and unsuccessful films came in the 70's and 80's. While 101 Dalmatians was still successful, something that I can't understand after such a breathtaking film as Sleeping Beauty, features like Robin Hood, The Aristocats, The Rescuers, The Black Cauldron and Oliver & Company did not fare as well, actually they are the last ones in the box office grosses. Simply because the animation was unextraordinary and sorry to say, disgusting, and the songs lacked the magic of earlier  films. The only one which really stands out is The Fox and The Hound which is visually very good and the songs are OK. The Little Mermaid was a quick return to Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. Featuring breathtaking classic animation, top-notch songs and emotionally haunting characters. The investment in Mermaid can easily be seen in such moments as the Main Titles scene and the storm, and actually every other scene. The songs Under the Sea, Kiss the Girl, Part of Your World and Fathoms Below are outstanding while Les Poissons gives a comic relief. The movie's greatness is its big critical acclaim, not to talk about the public one. While today's features, even Tarzan and 1992's Aladdin were mediocre critical successes (from what I have read and heard), Mermaid and 1991's Beauty and the Beast were a huge critical successes.The film is never disappointing. we own both versions and enjoy everyone of them.

A Masterpiece,"The Little Mermaid is quite simply the crown jewel of Disney's animated classics. 30 years after the studio's last ambitious project (with ""Sleeping Beauty""), it seemed like all the right elements came together in perfect unison, that 20 years after its original release, has become even more popular. The artwork style approached here is of beautifully detailed backgrounds and visually stunning underwater backdrops. Some of the scenes, especially underwater, would take your breath away (most notably the ""Main Titles"" and ""Under the Sea"" sequences). The two storms are also very well animated. The soundtrack for the movie is possibly the best and most memorable one for any Disney feature. It includes the calypso-flavored ""Under The Sea"" and ""Kiss the Girl"" and the beautiful ballad ""Part of Your World"". The score is haunting as well, especially effective in the main titles scene which really sets the mood for the rest of the film. As for the characters, Ariel, Sebastian and Ursula have taken on a life of their own. They're iconic and highly recognizable characters. Don't miss out on ""The Little Mermaid"".

Why can't we have more of this?,"This is such a wonderful story. I love this movie. I remember watching the movie when I was younger and laughing at the prate falls and other obvious funny moments. It wasn't until recently that I noticed all, well most, of the subtle lines of dialog and lyrics. To this day Under the Sea is my favorite song for the lyrics. It is just perfect! (As a matter of fact I'm listening to it as I write this.)With most Disney movies the songs are just there for fun, but with this, they help move the story along. Think about it. Bear Nessecities, what did that accomplish, except take up a couple of minutes. But if you listen to the songs of The Little Mermaid, they have something to offer the story. Just look at Kiss the Girl.Man I wish more movies could be like this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
What?,"It's a real shame I have to put in the first truly negative review, because this has to be THE most overrated film of all time.  It was cute when I was 9, but I'm all grown up now.The acting and singing are really lame, and the fact Menken and Ashman, who created the classic music for Little Shop of Horrors would stoop this low is beyond me.  This isn't even the first of the new classics, wither - that honor belongs to Oliver and Company, which is better, certainly underrated.The only things that comes remotely close to saving this movie is Buddy Hackett as the bird.  But he couldn't save this waste of 82 minutes.Bottom Line: Unless you're under the age of 12, AVOID this movie at all costs.  Otherwise, you will have that haunting reggae melody in your head for days, and it will drive you insane!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Good Idea, but...","Well as your read in the summary of the review, the concept of this movie is actually not bad, however there is one very big flaw in my opinion.I cannot stress this enough the flaw I have with the movie is completely subjective and also not one that most people seem to have, since this movie has a good rating of 7.6 as of now.Now the flaw is: Ariel. Yes that is right I really haven no idea exactly what it is that makes me dislike her character. Probably since she goes completely against her fathers instructions, especially since he has a point. Humans tend to fear the unknown, and her existence would cause a riot and would not only endanger her life but also the life of everyone in that city( I don't know the name, because I just couldn't sit through this movie), which makes her completely selfish. Finally it is funny to me that she wants to live in our world, which is hell compared to hers. I know that she eventually marries the prince, which makes this point invalid, but she wanted to live in our world before she even met Eric.Now lets talk about the positive the concept of a mermaid falling in love with a human is definitely interesting and the execution in my opinion is also good. For this reason I would award around seven to ten stars, and I tend to be rather lenient on animations, so it would get 10 stars, next there is the animation itself, which was really good as expected from Disney, and finally the music was superb, which was also expected back in those days from Disney.However this does not change the fact that characters are more important than any element, since a good story, such as this was spoiled, because of Ariel's character, while a bad story can still be saved by good characters. In this case that bad character also happened to be the one that got most screen time considering she was the story's main protagonist. Which is why my final review is 3/10 stars.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
This does not need a live-action remake. It's timeless enough on its own!,"This is the movie that helped launch the Disney Renaissance back in the Nineties.And its then-revolutionary animation (resembling Old School hand-painted style, but obviously computer-generated) made me go back to see it at least three times in a row.Half of the principal cast members are gone, now. Most recently, Samuel T. Wright. The inimitable voice of Sebastian! I remember seeing him on Broadway in the early Seventies. He had taken over the role of Narrator, in ""Pippin,"" from Ben Vereen.But, this movie will live up to Sebastian's prediction as ""de most spectacular"" thing he has ever done. Thanks, partly, to the digital restoration it was subjected to in 2018. But, mostly thanks to the original contributions made by Samuel T. Wright, Buddy Hackett, Kenneth Mars, Alan Menken, Pat Carroll, and Ben Wright.May all those talented graduates of the Old School rest in peace.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A masterpiece.,"I was never a Disney Princess fan, but in the last 1-2 months or so, I appreciate these originals way more. I went to the theater to see the NEW The Little Mermaid, which was very mediocre. It lost the Disney spark, and felt as if a different company had made it. This made me realize how much we need to value originals, for they always have the charm and spark that we can't bring back to these days. Ariel, in the remake, was not as fun and incredibly talented as the original Ariel. It was sad, and now I want to watch the original over and over again, to refresh my memory with the beautiful, original masterpiece. 10/10 stars on The Little Mermaid original, and we all have to accept that it was way better than the remake!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"If greatness was made of waves, ""The Little Mermaid"" is a tsunami ...","""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was a first step for Disney and a giant leap for animation. No other movie would share the same historical significance, until 1989, the year of ""The Little Mermaid"", less a giant leap than a big dive that would splash the audience and create a new wave of animated movies, a new age known now as 'Disney Renaissance'.And 'Renaissance' is the word because it's truly a rebirth of animation after thirty years during which cost-cutting, Xerox processes and images-recycling lowered the very standards of perfectionism that forged Disney's legend. ""Little Mermaid"" put an end to that period, starting with the story. Adapted from Hans Christian Andersen's most famous work, it is the first Disney movie based on a fairy tale after ""Sleeping Beauty"", 30 years before, which means a whole generation of kids was deprived from princesses and magical stories, and it was time to make a change.A darling for trivia fans, ""The Little Mermaid"" is the most expensive Disney movie made after Pinocchio and the first Oscar-nominated one since ""The Rescuers"" in 1977. It's also the film that reintroduced a new craving for musicals thanks to the fantastic Calypso numbers lead by Sebastian, the crab maestro, and the unforgettable ""Part of your world"". ""Mermaid"" would become the first Disney Golden Globe nominated for Best Musical / Comedy, a feat only surpassed by ""Beauty and the Beast"" two years later, not only nominated for a Golden Globe, but also an Oscar for Best Picture. Yet had ""The Little Mermaid"" failed at the box-office, we probably wouldn't have ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" or ""The Lion King"".But how could ""The Little Mermaid"" ever fail? It's infinitely superior to whatever was made after ""Sleeping Beauty"", the final masterpiece of an era where Disney had already pushed the envelope. ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" and its millions of dark spots was still an impressive work but then, ""The Sword and the Stone"" started recycling images, and Disney buffs know all about the dancing sequences from ""Robin Hood"" and ""The Aristocrats"". Don't get me wrong, Disney never made a really bad film, and my favorite, ""The Jungle Book"" happens to be from the 60's. However, as far as animation was concerned, there was no new Disney milestone, and most movies were made of sketchy images and stories lacking that universal appeal.The first serious attempt to recreate the old-school magic was ""The Fox and the Hound"" in 1981 but the film had a vague homely feeling that didn't bring the expected amount of escapism, there were no appealing songs and no risky moves à la Mufasa in ""The Lion King"". No matter how good the previous films were, something was missing, songs, animation, escapism, a sense of perfectionism on the form and universal appeal on the content, something that only exotic fairy tales could provide, ""The Little Mermaid"" awaited forty years in Disney's drawers, but it was worth it, the film was a tailor-made project to give animation its letters of nobility back. The film's success would multiply by 10 the working staff and would regularly bring home the two Oscars for Best Song and best Score.To think that the Studios were reluctant about including the 'boring' ""Part of your world"" or thought about Sebastian as an English butler, see, the film also had that sparkle of luck, projects-that-must-succeed all have. But it's not just luck, animation, music or special effects, the film had to prove its value on the storytelling department and for that, Disney designed one of their most endearing heroines, Princess Ariel, King Triton's youngest daughter, a rebellious red-head without that bankable bad-assness. In Ariel, we have a teenager, to which any kid or adult can relate, with a thirst for discovery and adventures, a hobby (she collects human's items), a dream (to visit land) and a poignant mix of vulnerability and courage. She's not supposed to be a feminist model, but she's not submissive either so whoever finds her desire to change for a man, something insulting, doesn't know the effect love has on someone, regardless of any gender consideration.I had –by the way- a huge crush on Ariel, and on Alyssa Milano from ""Who's the Boss"" so I was pleasantly surprised that she was modeled after her, she's simply sublime, and for a Disney heroine, the animators sure knew how to make her look subtly erotic, from my kid's perspective. And a figure like Ariel allows the film to explore so many cherished universal themes : coming-of-age, impossible love and the famous Faustian bargain. Ariel must trade her voice with the devilish Ursula, the octopus-like sea witch, to become a human and be in love with Eric. And what a Divine (from the original model) villain Ursula is. No other villain impacted viewers since ""Maleficent"" and ""Cruella"", with her body language, her voice and her smile, we wouldn't believe how evil she is, until the exciting and heart-pounding climax where she shows what a larger-than-life villain (literally) she is.""The Little Mermaid"" is great on every single department, it's full of colorful and unforgettable creatures, there's also the late Kenneth Mars voicing King Triton, Ariel's patient father, there's the two villainous eels, a buffoonish French cook and there's Sebastian who sings the film's signature songs, ""Under the Sea"" that would inspire one of ""The Simpsons"" most hilarious musical numbers, and the atmospheric and subtly erotic ""Kiss the Girl"", to which I would have given the Oscar. Never had a princess been so expressive with her facial expressions than Ariel in that short segment, more than a plot device, her muteness inspired some of the best drawing from any Disney movie.Thanks for Disney animators for giving another milestone in Disney movies and on its own, all trivia put apart, one of the greatest animated movies and musicals ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The start of the Disney Renaissance,"""The Little Mermaid"" is the start of the Disney Renaissance. From then on, Disney makes ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"", ""The Lion King"", ""Mulan"" and a lot of other animated musicals adapted from fairy tales.In terms of quality, ""The Little Mermaid"" is rather mediocre. It may be the worst Disney film produced during the Renaissance era. Particularly, it changes the tragic ending of Andersen's tale to a happy ending, almost completely destroying the themes and motifs delivered by Andersen.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

The little mermaid is an amazing film but have a secret...,"the little mermaid it's a Disney classic, is a love plot where a little sixteen years old mermaid called, Ariel who was able to overcome her difficulties to get her prince and live happy forever, it's a movie that is impossible to say you aren't going to watch it again, for the catchy songs like ""under the sea"" or ""part of him"", about Ariel it's the typical teenager looking for her dreams but... what's the difference? she is a mermaid and she has to become human, subject that her father hates, for that I consider that she is very brave and turn the movie excited and the viewer can involved with it.But what is it behind this? the famous little Mermaid of Disney magic story of fantasy comes from an old book which them was extracted, but the plot was changed according to the child viewer because the plot of the book was dedicate to readers with a mature age, because:first the little mermaid has not a happy ending. It would be a Disneys without its ""happily for ever"", second she made a deal or contract with the witch where she indicated that each time she walk. she'll feel a lethal pain and if the young man gets married with another woman she'll die becoming foam. then Disney modify the plot making it in the version we know today as a little mermaid, it is completely recommended as child as adults people because, whatever will be your age, you will get captivated by the magic of the sea.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A Return to Form for Disney,"The Little Mermaid (1989)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Mermaid princess Ariel always dreams what it must be like being human and after getting in trouble by her father, the King, she decides to take an bet with an evil witch. The deal allows her to be human for three days but she must make the man she loves love her in return.THE LITTLE MERMAID was an incredibly important picture for Disney because they animated features were really lacking any classics but this film came along and put them on the map and it would kick off a tremendous run of titles that would include BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, ALADDIN and THE LION KING. This here was certainly a return to the highest form for the studio and it's easy to see why this was such a hit back in the day and continues to gather new fans with each passing year.All of the classic Disney things can be found here. You've got a good story. You've got a beautiful princess who wishes for something more. You've got a terrific villain. You've got a great group of supporting characters. Then there's the beautiful animation, the wonderful songs and of course there's just a good-nature that runs throughout the picture. The fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen certainly fits in well with Disney as it contains a story that's easy to follow and the studio just gave us characters to like and care for.The Ariel character is just so sweet-natured that you can't help but hope she gets her dreams. Then there's the crab and Flounder who are both funny in their own way and of course there's a rather dumb seagull who can't really do anything right. The animation is some of the best stuff the studio did since their films in the 1940s as it's just so colorful that it really does creature a terrific world and the ""Under the Sea"" song really captures a certain spirit that makes it one of the best songs from the studio.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Everything that makes a great animated movie can be found in this endlessly enjoyable masterpiece,"Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" is a case study of a great, classic animated masterpiece. Everything that makes a great animated movie can be found in the endlessly joyful eighty-three minutes of its running time. Gorgeous drawings, a smart and witty screenplay, instantly memorable characters, and a soundtrack which is packed with some of the most enthralling ear-worm pieces in motion picture history. ""The Little Mermaid"" was a favorite of mine as a kid. I hadn't seen it in a long time (I'm guessing at least half a decade) until just now and now that I have, I realize that span of time was far too long a one.The story is based on the classic fable by Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen about a mermaid who falls in love with a human prince and longs, for more than anything, to become a human herself. Her name here is Ariel - one of the more lovably rebellious movie heroines - and despite the fact that her father commands her to stay away from ""fish-eaters"" she makes a Faustian bargain with a sea witch. Trading her voice for a pair of legs, she struggles to make the prince fall in love with her before her time runs out. Unlike the story, however, she has some friends in the form of a gullible, misinformed seagull, a skittishly fearful fish, and an ostentatious (in a good way) crab.""The Little Mermaid"" is rich in every detail. It ranks alongside the other Disney classics such as ""Pinocchio"" and ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""Fantasia"" and ""The Jungle Book"" for this very reason. Everything about the picture was developed to the pinnacle of the creative potential. First of all, the drawing style. The movie is gorgeous to look at and admire. The oceans, the skies, the backgrounds both under the sea and on the land are not blank walls or phony backdrops, but a maze of captivating detail. The bubbles that form beneath the water and drift in and out of frame are a wonderful touch that makes you greatly appreciate the patience and enthusiasm of the artists. The characters are not sketched out, but also richly outline and hued with a plethora of colors. King Triton and Ursula the sea witch are two especially wonderful animation marvels as their expenditures (the wavy beard for the king and the tentacles for the witch) glide and motion with the water around them. And Ariel is one of the most beautiful Disney heartthrobs.The soundtrack is also what never fails to grab me in ""The Little Mermaid."" First of all, the musical score by Alan Menken is absolutely wonderful. Then there comes his rich and captivating songs. Although ""Under the Sea"" stole the Academy Award, but personal favorite is ""Part of that World"" where Ariel sings about her wishes to shed her fins and become human. Ursula has her own number and so do the crab Sebastian. These are not hack-job songs thrown together overnight. These were thought-out and rewritten again and again so that not one lyric seems misplaced or out of order.But of course, the most important aesthetic qualities are the story and the characters. Ariel is a winner from the beginning for her rebellious, yet lovable attitude in which she does not come across as a brat, but as a visionist with a hopeful dream that forces us to follow her. King Triton is also a marvelously-written character with his conflicts both inner and outer. Ursula is one of the more gleefully enjoyable villains in recent movie history - as are her two minions, a pair of moray eels - and much attention must be paid to Sebastian the crab, who steals every scene that he's in. Then there are the humans. Prince Eric, despite his relative lack of screen time, is more memorable than Prince Charming was in ""Cinderella"" or the prince in ""Snow White."" There's a comical butler, a lovable maiden, and a gut-busting interlude with a chef wanting to serve Sebastian on a platter. Rich, wonderful characters in this rich, wonderful movie.I'm a real sucker for love stories, but you don't have to be to be moved or touched by ""The Little Mermaid."" Even if you do not buy into the concept of true love...well, this movie might revision your outlook. And if not, well, it's just a darn good motion picture. It seals the attention of the younger generation and continues to work wonders on them as an adult. To me, it's even more admirable now because I'm older and wise enough to pick out the other really great things about it. In the early 90s, I would claw for it whenever we visited my aunt and uncle's house. Now that access to it is easier for me, it will be more frequent.

A triumphant Disney gem,"The 28th animated Disney classic is said to be responsible for Disney's renaissance after a dark period during the 1980's decade. Back then Disney was in a delicate situation. I wonder what would have happened to Disney if ""The Little Mermaid"" hadn't been made or if it hadn't been a success.""The Little Mermaid"" is one of the greatest animated films from Disney. It has fine artwork and palette colors, classic humor, adventure, darkness, great animation, awesome songs, enjoyable characters, romance... in other words, the crucial gradients that make Disney classics. Some mythology is here either, considering it's a movie about merpeople.The soundtrack is fresh, with jaunty songs such as ""Under the Sea"" and ""Les Poissons"", the romantic song ""Kiss the Girl"" and the somewhat sad song ""Part of your world"". Even Ursula's song, ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"", is good.As for the characters, the goofy seagull Scuttle and the Chef Louis can be perfectly considered a comic relief, although Sebastian is often hilarious too, especially in the kitchen where Chef Louis is (Sebastian's facial expressions of horror and panic are priceless).Scuttle has a comical way to teach things about human artifacts and respective cultures. For example, he refers to a fork as a ""dinglehopper"" and says that it is used as a comb. He also calls a smoking pipe a ""snarfblatt"", telling it is used to play music as if it was a trumpet. Scuttle also sings terribly, but he sings much better than many self-claimed artists in the world of music. Although goofy, Scuttle is smarter than he seems. He discovers, for example, the true identity of ""Vanessa"" and he does a hilarious destruction of the wedding (with the help of other birds and animals).Prince Eric is one of Disney's coolest and most charming princes. He's handsome too. Grimsby is funny at times. Ariel is a pretty mermaid and she looks even better as human. Ariel is one of my favorite Disney princesses, for her sexy looks and feminine personality. Ursula, the evil sea witch, is one of Disney's biggest villains and one of the most eccentric too. Max, Eric's Old English Sheepdog, is a cute fellow.I wonder what kind of fish Flounder is. Maybe he is not a particular kind of fish. Perhaps he was just drawn that way, fruit of the artists's imagination. He is a cute little fish, friendly and cool. He is also very nervous, shy and gets frightened easily.I don't know where or when this movie takes place, but I suppose it is somewhere in Denmark.As for the cast, there are many talented voices here: the inimitable comedian Buddy Hackett aka ""Tennessee Steinmetz"", Ben Wright, Rene Auberjonois, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Jodi Benson, Jason Marin, Samuel E. Wright, Kenneth Mars and Pat Carroll.This should definitely be on Top 250.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Colourful and fun; watchable and quite enjoyable for adults but really not layered well enough for my money,"King Triton rules the underwater world with his four daughter  all respectful and musical beauties, except youngest daughter Ariel, who has an unhealthy obsession with the world outside of the ocean. To try and make sure she cuts this out, Triton assigns his trusted aide Sebastian to keep an eye on her. However when Ariel visits the surface of the ocean she spots a beautiful prince on board a ship  minutes before the ship sinks and she is forced to rescue him. Naturally she falls in love with him from that moment on  much to the anger of her father. With his words still stinging her, Ariel accepts the offer of sea-hag Ursula to become human for three days and either a) make the prince love her and thus stay human or b) fail and return to the ocean and belong to Ursula.Being quite a cynical, acerbic person I must admit that I prefer modern animated films that deliver lots of adult humour along with a good emotional story and often I struggle to enjoy films that take the more traditional Disney route. However, having greatly enjoyed Beauty and the Beast the other night, I decided to give this film a try as well but must admit that I didn't take to it as much as I had hoped. The story is good enough to provide a narrative flow but I didn't buy into it emotionally as much as I had expected. The story didn't quite have enough of a sense of maturity or wonder as I needed and I didn't find enough else to distract from me. I was never bored you understand, but it was more that I could watch it with kids rather than really enjoy it and get something from it on my level.The songs are quite good and featured one or two that are pretty catchy and stuck in my mind. The animation is good but is very big and colourful, full of soft edges and non-threatening shapes; this results in the film having feel that it is really for kids rather than adults  an impression not really helped by the story that never goes deep enough into the emotional aspect for adults. The voice work is reasonably good and doesn't feature many famous voices  a practice that is not so common now but maybe helps from distracting from the material by spotting the stars. Benson is quite nice, Mars is firm and warm, Wright is good and the choice of accent in this film but it was quite nice. None of them are that distinctive and it is only really the late Buddy Hackett that stuck in my mind.Overall this is a colourful and enjoyable film but one that didn't do enough in terms of material and emotional content to really engage me. The film will be great for kids and provide more than basic laughs and I did enjoy it for what it did well but I did want it to do more  perhaps watching it in the same week as the much classier Beauty and the Beast was a mistake but this is a good film, not a great one.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
why this movie sucks,"""'The Little Mermaid' is a prime example of an overrated animated film that fails to live up to the hype. From the very beginning, we're presented with a shallow and unrealistic story of a young mermaid named Ariel who's willing to abandon her entire world for some random human guy she barely knows. It's a weak and unconvincing premise that lacks depth and leaves the audience questioning Ariel's judgment. The characters are one-dimensional and fail to leave a lasting impression. Prince Eric, in particular, is a forgettable and uninspired love interest who adds nothing of substance to the narrative. The songs, often praised as iconic, are forgettable and lack the emotional resonance that one would expect from a Disney musical. Even the animation, touted as groundbreaking at the time, feels outdated and fails to capture the beauty and fluidity we've come to expect from modern animated films. Overall, 'The Little Mermaid' is an overhyped disappointment that offers little more than a forgettable tale of superficial love and sacrifice.""",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Few movies ""for kids"" age this well.","I've loved this film ever since I saw it in theaters just after I turned two. I don't remember it but my family tell me that I could quote it and name all the characters after a single viewing. I was obsessed, lol.I hadn't watched it in several years but had to tonight as a palate cleanser after the huge disappointment that was the live action remake.What struck me most during this viewing is how well the humor has held up. None of the jokes made me cringe, and in case you think I'm biased, my husband had never seen this before and he agrees with me. The humor is timeless. Several of the bits played for laughs in the remake made me cringe. It'll be unwatchable in ten years, to say nothing of how it'll come across in 34 years.The story holds up as well, and the dialogue, even in seemingly unimportant scenes. The characters' motivations all make sense too. That shouldn't be hard to accomplish, writing-wise, but dammit if Disney doesn't keep finding new ways to prove how little they care about quality writing.Learning from behind-the-scenes interviews and such, it's incredible how much of this film's most memorable moments were conceived by Howard Ashman, the film's lyricist. He was the heart and soul of this film, he made it timeless. I wish the people behind the remake had shown a bit more respect for Ashman's contributions.

"The weakest of the big three, but that makes it Disney's 3rd best film ever.","The big three that I am referring to are the three films that sparked the revival of Disney after a 20-year dry spell following Walt Disney's death: Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and the very first of the Renaissance, The Little Mermaid. Mermaid is a wonderful film, with a great feel-good story, lovely artwork, fun characters, and some of the best music in Disney history.Why then do I think it to be the weakest of the big three? There's nothing inherently wrong with it. What makes great Disney films great is that besides all their technical aspects (in which this film is perfect), they have a certain spunk, an unexplainable phenomena that makes you admire them all the more. This film definitely has that. In fact it has a lot of it. Unfortunately, as much great spunk as Mermaid has, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast have even more.Nevertheless, this is Disney's third best film ever.

My favourite as a child!,"I was obsessed with this growing up! I remember singing like Ariel on my way to school and driving my mum up the wall.Watching it as an adult, I now realize how it plays in how I understood music. The crab, Sebastian, introduces new sounds so you can hear it come in. When all is played on time, an orchestral moment is created. It's a great way to teach kids about music in my opinion. You can always follow this up with ""Fantasia"", but ""Fantasia"" always made me drift off as a child.However, watching this with my husband for his first time, he was not as impressed. I guess he was hung up over Ariel wanting more, and never happy until she gets what she wants from daddy, like a spoilt child. That part never stood out for me as a kid, and I have always been described as being too kind. Rather, I was in love with the love story and swooning over her dreamy prince charming! Little girls and women in general will always fantasize about meeting their perfect someone and having the perfect wedding.I also enjoyed the way the sea was explained. It doesn't go heavy on the pirates element, but rather it focuses on all the sea creatures that lurk below, whether real or mythical. My husband does agree that the barracuda is the most vicious sea creature, so that was good, but it disturbed him that an oil painting was not destroyed by the sea water, in Ariel's cave. But it's true how those who work at sea believe in mythical creatures like the black virgin.The villain was also awesome, in my opinion. I always remembered her as a giant octopus, but my husband corrected me saying that she is a mythical creature; a kraken. Thinking about it now, Ursula comes across as a little b*tchy. In the same way as if a real life woman would fight over a guy, or rushing towards her beloved sale item. There would be pushing & shoving, hair pulling, nails, screaming, and maybe even stilettos used as a weapon.Overall, this is a love story for the girls! Although Cinderella is a girly Disney, some boys like this one, including my husband, surprise surprise!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Just Friendly Crustaceans Under the Sea,"Seeing that a live-action remake is now out I thought it was best to watch the animated original. I haven't seen it since I was in primary school so my memories were vague, so it was pretty much a new experience for me.The Little Mermaid was the film that kick-started the Disney Renaissance and it was certainly a good film, although I prepare Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. The Little Mermaid had the cartoony look of Beauty and the Beast and at times it felt like a Saturday Morning Cartoon with a budget because of the art style, the humour, and some of the characters, i.e. Flounder being a wimp. The films also felt like a classic Disney film, like from the Golden Era. This was due to the opening and the choir music used sometimes. It was based on a fairy tale like other Disney classics.The music was where the film truly shined with some recognisable classics like ""Part of Your World,"" ""Kiss the Girl,"" and of course ""Under the Sea."" Sometimes the film did play like a horror film due to Ursula harvesting souls, and the chef scene being terrifying for an animal.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Yet another great animated classic from Disney!,"I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities. The animation in My opinion was crisp, clean, and really clear.

In fact, The things that goes on in this series' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do!

And since Disney isn't making any more animated movies this may well be the last good Disney movie ever. Sorry all you Lion King and Beauty/Beast fans, they just didn't do it for me.It's sad to witness an end to an era of creative genius but I'm glad they decided to close their animation offices rather than keep putting out things like Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. I haven't seen any of the video sequels, thank god.Oh, and by the way, when I talk about the Disney movies made in my lifetime, I'm not counting Pixar, which I think makes great films.

Oh, there is adventure, betrayal, bravery, dancing, songs, high sea action, and some pivotal father/daughter moments, but all these elements come together to create one fine love story in pure Disney Romantic Comedy Adventure fashion.This film is probably one of the sweetest love stories in the Disney vaults, and a must have in any Disney collection.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

An Amazing Film,"The film follows a headstrong, mermaid, Ariel as she falls in love, despite her fathers rules, with a human man, Eric. Because of her fathers hatred towards these 'cannibals' she makes a pact with a sea witch in order to be with him.This is my definition of the perfect animated film. Everything about it is gorgeous. I remember seeing it for the first time and being blown away by the opening sequence. The appearance of the first merman against Alan Menkens score is beautifully done and the film just goes uphill from there.The art, the songs, the characters, the music. Everything is perfectly done in this film.Ursula is by far the scariest villain ever to cross the big screen. Based on a drag queen she really does completely freak out all audiences, I remember being terrified of her when I was little and I still feel the same way. The whole Poor Unfortunate Souls sequence is the scariest 'villain scene' I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. The rather bouncy song along with a haunting setting and shadows Hitchcock would be proud of is amazingly done and is only beaten by Ursula's terrifying performance later on in the film crawling along the ships deck after Ariel.The soundtrack is spectacular. The score as I have mentioned before is superb and each of the songs is an instant classic, Part of Your World, Under the Sea, Kiss the Girl and Poor Unfortunate Souls are all songs everyone can recognise and sing-along too.One last thing I have to give credit to is Sebastian the crab. He is one of the main reasons I love this film so much. The reggae crab will win you over. He is the perfect support to our heroine, dishing out lovely songs and providing us with may comic moments.Disney really hit a high point with this film, and it totally deserves its status as one of the best animated films of all time. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Classic Disney Film!,"The Little Mermaid is the very beginning of the Disney Renaissance that began in the late 80's. This film is a heartfelt film that is pure magic and one for the entire family to enjoy. It has some beautiful, magical songs such as the much-heralded ""Under the Sea."" The animation is light and actually pretty clear for an 80's animation film. This film is going to be impossible to resist and is one of the better Disney animated films ever made.Based of the fairytale by Hans Christensen Anderson, Ron Clements film is about how a mermaid named Ariel makes a pact with the evil sea witch, Ursula to become human and she has three days to kiss her true love or else she will turn back into a mermaid and endure being her servant for eternity.This film really has no famous voice-cast but I truly must single out Jodi Benson for her exceptional voice work. This is her first big voice role and she hits it spot on. She truly has a voice and proves it singing all these magical songs.Overall, this is a classic Disney film that harks back to the olden days of Disney. This begins the classics that were spawned out in the 1990's. A film of pure magic and a family delight. It's funny, romantic, and more emotional than one would expect. A very good film indeed. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Film That Ushered In the Disney Renaissance!,"Walt Disney Animation's The Little Mermaid is considered the first film that initiated the Mouse's animation revival in 1989. For the first time in quite some time, Disney finally had a box office success, and the rest is history. As for the quality, this is a fun, charming film that was a huge part of my childhood. My sister adored this movie, and the songs were played in my household over and over again. One can't argue how great ""Under the Sea"" and ""Part of Your World"" are. The hand-drawn animation still holds up. Ursula still gives me nightmares as the villainous goddess. There are silly moments that the kids will gobble up, but there are enough enjoyable moments for adults. Ariel is a great Disney Princess that belongs in the pantheon of great Disney princesses. Who can resist the charm of Sebastian's crankiness? He made a worthy sidekick for Ariel.The Little Mermaid is seen as the transition from old school Disney to new style that would take over the Mouse. Although it uses some CGI such as the wrecked ships in the final battle, this is the last Disney film to use hand-drawn animation. The next Disney film would use more digital composition. In terms of special effects, this film required the most special effects ever done in a Disney film. More than a million bubbles needed to be drawn for the underwater sequences. The production team, headed by director Ron Clements, did a fantastic job with the characters, the animation/special effects, and the story.Speaking of story, the film was meant to be in production in the 1930's after Snow White and the Seven Dwarves as a vignette for a film based on the Hans Christian Andersen. For reasons over the years, the film never happened. Ron Clements became interested in the mid-1980's. Jeffrey Kateznberg gave the film a greenlight but prioritized Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Oliver & Company first. In fact, fairytales were not seen as profitable during the 80's which gave the suits some hesitation. Of course, this movie changed everything. When the script was being written, Clements and co-director John Musker were surprised because they envisioned the story as it was originally conceived in the 1930's but with more modern updates. Alan Menken, who would become synonymous with Disney Animation, boarded the film as the film's composer. He created songs that would live on forever in the hearts of many. An interesting tale about ""Part of Your World."" It was almost taken out of the movie because it did not test well with children but thankfully, as a major part of the film's story, tested well with subsequent children's groups.The young, beautiful, and rebellious Ariel (Jodi Benson) lives in her father's undersea kingdom. Her father is the powerful King Triton (Kenneth Mars), so she happens to be the kingdom's princess. But she yearns for life on dry land especially when she falls for mortal prince Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes). Ursula is a terribly cunning sea witch, and Ariel comes to a bargain with her to win over his heart. Yet, there is a price. Ariel only has three days for Eric to fall in love. Ursula, being the intelligent and devious being she is, definitely has some tricks up her sleeves.During this era of animation, the films did not rely on big names to draw in the crowds. Not saying today's animation films are terrible, but it was different back then. The best voice for the role was cast and it was shown in every single character. I cannot imagine anyone else playing the animated Ariel other than Jodi Benson. The same can go for Samuel E. Wright as Sebastian, my favorite cranky sea creature. Pat Carroll as Ursula is enough to give me nightmares. The character of Ursula was inspired by drag queen, Divine. I did not know that until I wrote this review but now I cannot unsee it.Overall, The Little Mermaid needs to be seen for the bright, vibrant Disney classic that ushered in the Disney Renaissance. Some may associate the world beneath the ocean as vast, dark place. I liked how they made the world anything but. It is a world of visual wonders. In addition, the music is fantastic, and all the songs are worth listening to. The reggae-inspired ""Under the Sea"" gives me positive vibes. The story is a simple love story and one about a woman who wants to live her own life despite a title. The story can venture off into kid-friendly territory at times but there are enough for adults to enjoy.My Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Disney Animation At Its Best,"Released in late 1989, this Disney classic instantly became a huge hit with everyone, critics and audiences, breathing a whole new life in the animation genre, which up to that point (since the early 1970's) was considered poison in the movie industry. ""The Jungle Book"" (1967) was the last great animated flick to grace the screen; since then, lesser known films were released and though some of them performed nicely with the public, they were a far cry from classics such as ""Bambi"" and ""Cinderella"". That all changed in 1989, with the release of ""The Little Mermaid"". The animation in the film is spectacular. The film looks like no other film before it. The colors are rich and vibrant and the picture is full of detail. The scenes shot underwater are breathtaking but so are the ones on land. Eric's castle looks jaw-dropping. The music is top-notch. You probably know the Oscar-winning ""Under The Sea"", which  in my opinion is the best song in the film. The characters are very memorable and some of Disney's most beloved, with Sebastian the crab providing both a side-kick and an important role. He's actually featured in one of the most memorable scenes in the film: of all the rooms in Eric's castle, he has to fall right into the kitchen, where Louis the chef tries to cook him. All these make ""The Little Mermaid"" the classic it is today. Everyone should be a part of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
What a Coral Anniversary!,"It's hard to believe it's been 35 years since this movie at the shore up above made history and saved Disney from financial troubles alongside other greats like Cinderella, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and The Princess and the Frog. This animated masterpiece not only introduced us to the enchanting world but also redefined Disney's Golden and Silver eras.Celebrating its milestone anniversary with a watch party hosted by the one and only Jodi Benson (the voice of Ariel) on Disney's Instagram, I've got a chance to relive this amazing moment. I quite a bit disappointed when I was watching this on live since I used Central African Time (CAT) since Disney used Pacific Standard Time (PST). The movie started at 17:00 PST, that's like 03:00 here in Africa. Anyways, at least I had the chance to interact with other people from the world. So to pay homage, I made two drawings and posted them on Instagram and listen to all the songs and scores from the sequel, broadway and live action.The epic sequel expands Ariel's world with charm like Melody is like her mother but in human version and I loved her and her movie so much, the emotional prequel dives into her origins and just like Mulan 2 with the 3 princesses, I adored Ariel's 6 sisters and their unique personalities, the Broadway musical offers a fresh perspective with show-stopping performances and similar to the prequel, which were both released in 2008, we got to see more of Ariel's Sisters, King Triton, Flounder and of course Prince Eric (and his song Her Voice, which the ending gives me chills, and the live-action adaptation breathes new life into this beloved tale with moving performances like For the First Time has been played repeatedly on my music platforms ever since.The Little Mermaid is not just a film-it's a classic that continues to teach us that the world is full of untold treasures. Thank you, Ariel, for being part of our world!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney's defibrillator,"In 1979, while Disney's unremarkable Bambi-retread The Fox and the Hound was under production, Don Bluth quit his job in righteous indignation at the then 37-year slump in Disney's animated features and, with eleven talented young animators in tow, hared off to MGM and created a near-masterpiece, The Secret of NIMH, in little over two years. Although the movie-going public ignored the film at the time, Bluth's subsequent films, An American Tail and the marginally superior The Land Before Time both broke box-office records for animation and routed Disney competition.In 1989, Bluth's fourth, All Dogs Go to Heaven, was released on the same weekend as Disney's latest, The Little Mermaid, a musical in the style of the Golden Age cartoons. Bluth's new film boasted an interesting and original premise, whilst Disney's was yet another sweetened fairy tale. Bluth and his cohorts could hardly be blamed to maybe shoot for fifty million this time around, and Disney fans would have been either in denial or omniscient to expect The Little Mermaid to be other than lackluster.The Little Mermaid raked in $84,000,000. People tell you that the business a film does doesn't matter, but it does: it matters a helluva lot to the films a studio makes after it. Without The Little Mermaid's extravagant success, the resurgence in American animation might never have taken place, and we have audiences' uncharacteristic discernment to thank.Above all, what is important about The Little Mermaid is what a superlative film it is. A penny saved might well be a penny earned, but a few billion pennies spent wisely can be millions and millions of dollars earned. This is The Little Mermaid's approach, and but one of many ways in which it returned to the Disney philosophy of the Thirties and Forties, when art was exalted above immediate financial gain, when no expense was spared in the pursuit of excellence, and when animation was considered a medium and not a genre, when an animated film was more than a 'kiddie movie'.Computers eased the burden on the animators and the studio's pockets, making the sort of dazzling imagery that characterized the early Disney films practical again, also enabling certain wildly impressive sequences to be brought to the screen in a manner that would have had Uncle Walt selling his multi-plane camera for scrap.And then there was the duo of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. The pair made The Little Mermaid's score Disney's best since Dumbo, and truly animated Broadway for the first time. The songs are longer, better placed and more important to the plot than ever before, and not a dud among them. ""Part of Your World"" is the obligatory ballad, but, refreshingly, it's not a love song--even more refreshingly, The Little Mermaid doesn't really have one of those; ""Kiss the Girl"" is far too witty and entertaining to be one, and is more concerned with making out than love anyway. ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" is deliciously wicked, and ""Under the Sea"" is pure entertainment, a showcase for Samuel E. Wright's magnificent crab, Sebastian, and a virtuoso display of animated choreography. The use of song might seem unsubtle as compared to the great animated films of the Nineties, like The Iron Giant and the Toy Story films, but it is never less than enjoyable. And by the way, it was co-producer Ashman's idea to make Sebastian a Jamaican-vizier-crab as opposed to an English-butler-crab. Masterstroke, that.Remember how scary Pinocchio was? (The movie, not the puppet.) While The Little Mermaid does not quite plumb those depths, it is bold in its occasional darkness: Ursula's grisly garden and many forms, the seriousness of Ariel's situation and the despair that accompanies it, ensure that, for all its humor, the film never suffers from the childlike levity that Disney films, for time out of mind, had been trying to make adults take seriously. When it means to be funny, the film is funny; when not, not.Certainly Disney's finest villain since Cruella De Vil, and perhaps even before, Ursula, a half-octopus half-purple-human, voiced by Pat Carroll, is darkly funny while never letting one forget that she cannot be trifled with. Ursula, like most of the great Disney villains, manages to be funny as well as intimidating by being rather aristocratic in her manner, a la Cruella, Shere Khan and Scar.Another unprecedented quality of The Little Mermaid was the presence of an excellent main character as well as an excellent villain. Ariel, voice of Jodi Benson, remains the studio's most endearing heroine. Rebellious and often foolhardy, she thinks for herself and makes mistakes--she is no passenger. She is, in fact, the catalyst for the events of the film instead of the antagonist. She is also funny and makes you want to actually listen when she speaks, which Disney had always seemed to think could never work in a main character.Even Prince Eric isn't relegated to automaton status--for a Disney movie, the central conflict seems to almost have an excess of character. A rather frustrating love interest he may be, but he is, at least, a character, and always a likable one. Kenneth Mars' King Triton is another excellent supporting character, and Buddy Hackett steals the show entirely as worldly seagull Scuttle.I need say no more than that the film is about a mermaid princess who falls in love with a human and strikes a deal with a witch for a pair of legs. The Disney version of The Little Mermaid is so different from Hans Christian Andersen's tortuously Christian parable as to be an entirely different story that happens to share some plot points with the fairy tale. Disney's version is better. I state this without compunction, and do not feel the need to list my reasons. Read the story, then watch this film, and tell me which you like better.Or don't read it. But do watch the film. It is a remarkable experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The best animated film ever,"I watched the Little Mermaid with a sense of trepidation (to quote one of the characters)as I find Disney's movies to be on the whole too sugary and cutesy cutesy. The Little Mermaid, however, managed to avoid this trap by making the characters, including the villain, larger than life. Sebastion, particularly, is a brilliant little fellow and I defy anyone not to warm to Ariel, probably the loveliest creation Disney has ever made. I loved the songs, all of which added to the films charm and stood on their own as good compositions. I first saw this film two years after its release and for weeks after I couldn't stop singing ""Part of your world"" It's not an exaggeration to say that Ariel became part of mine and remains my favourite screen heroine. I love Shrek and it's ilk but they don't hold a candle to The Little Mermaid.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Love it...,"The Disney blockbuster that started a remarkable winning streak, which would stretch through an entire decade. The Little Mermaid has all the familiar ingredients you've come to expect from Disney. But keep in mind, this is the one that established that formula: a spunky heroine (she's by no means the first Disney heroine but she's the first to take action), a Broadway-style musical with showstopping numbers (this time it's ""Under the Sea"") and state-of-the-art animation.The film is well known for its musical score and songs, and rightly so. The theme music in the main titles still sends shivers down my spine. And so is the rest of the score.Clearly, the Disney artists went to great lengths to create a believable underwater environment. Notice the bubbles, light reflection, light and shadow effects, etc.I know some people criticize the character of Ariel and that she didn't learn her lesson in the end. Or maybe she did? I always though (and still do) that she realized what she had done when she saw what happened to her father and Ursula taking over the ocean.

Based on the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen from 1937, the Disney movie is more family friendly than the fairy tale, which was darker, and after this movie there has been a lot more adaptations of this fairy tale.I love Ariel voiced by Jodi Benson; she is cute, pretty, and likable but I like her personality on being naive and cautious sometimes, but mostly curious about the human world. She has a singing voice that was pretty, and I liked seeing her collection of human objects wondering what they are and what they do. The second half of the movie she loses her voice, and I like that the whole movie she uses body language and facial expressions to get across what she is feeling or trying to say.The love interest Prince Eric could have been better by giving him more of a personality, but he is fine. The villain Ursula voiced by Pat Carroll, who is a great classic Disney villain, gives this character a sinister personality to the way the character sounds and acts, who also has a cool design. There are a few songs in this movie, but all of them are well-known and nice to listen to with great visuals both on land and under the water.We are used to 3D animation now a days, but the 2D animation in the movie is pretty, nice to look at, and colorful when under the water. Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989) has a likable main character, a nice romance between Ariel and Prince Eric, nice animation, some funny moments, great songs, and the visuals it uses during the song numbers are pretty. For fans of Disney, this movie is an essential watch, especially if you are a major fan of their older animated movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Great Message Told with Mythcial Sea Creatures and Mythology,"This was a movie that I probably hadn't seen in 25+ years. My sister and I had this growing up. It was one that we would watch periodically. It was showing it this time to my daughter, who didn't seem to care all that much. She is a year and a half so things like this don't hold her attention yet. Jaime and I were chatting while watching this, trying to remember what we knew from not seeing this for a long time.Now I did remember that this was based off a darker Hans Christian Andersen story. Its been a while since then, but parts of it did come back to share with Jaime. We have Ariel (voiced by Jodi Benson), who is the youngest daughter of King Triton (voiced by Kenneth Mars). Fun fact here is that he is a demi-god and son of Poseidon in Greek mythology. Ariel wants to live in the human world above.This brings her to meet Prince Eric (voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes). During a bad storm, Ariel saves him when she was forbid from going up. He falls in love with her. A sea witch, Ursula (voiced by Pat Carroll), sees her chance. She gives Ariel legs in exchange for her voice. The deal is that Ariel needs to get a true love kiss from Eric before the end of three days. If she doesn't, Ursula takes her as a prisoner for eternity.Now watching this as an adult and a parent, I can see interesting commentary. Triton is too hard on his daughter and he drives her to this bad decision with Ursula. We have Ariel not fully thinking of the consequences of her actions due to being young. It is interesting there that Jaime brought up making poor decisions at 18 and not factoring in what it will cost down the line. This adds a layer here for sure.What I'll then say is that I love the animation style here. This is nearing the end of Disney making stories that have darkness to them. I love how creepy Ursula is. It is clicking home as well that Disney made these musicals. You don't think about it growing up, but that is a way to hold children's attentions. There are great songs here like Ariel wanting to live above the water. Sebastian (voiced by Samuel E. Wright) trying to convince her that under the sea is better. Then there is also Ursula and the poor unfortunate souls songs. This is well-made, I did want to say that.I'd say that if you haven't seen this in a while and have children, give this a watch. There's good messages here and I love the mythical sea creature/mythology angle there as well. This is prime Disney for me.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Best Animated Movie I Have Ever Seen.,"The voices are great, the story is terrific, the songs are better than words and the animation is perfect.

She is in love with the world above the sea and wishes to go up there one day. She loves Prince Eric from the moment she meets him, but there are some nasty tricks from the scariest monster in the sea called Ursula.I just loved it. My rating : 10/10.

The Little Mermaid Review,"The Little Mermaid is a movie about a Mermaid, from a place that's name isn't quite mentioned in the film of which seems like Atlantis. It is a story about love, like many other films from the Disney Renaissance. As well there's plenty of singing just like other Disney Renaissance movies. Ariel's father Triton reminds me of Poseidon of Greek mythology, or of his Roman counterpart Neptune. The Little Mermaid isn't as Greek as the other Disney Renaissance film Hercules, but still has some Greek shown through. It is based on a story from Scandinavia, so if anything, the Little Mermaid might take place in the Scandinavian region. Each of the Renaissance films are based on a different place about a couple hundred years ago with Aladdin being Arabic in origin, Beauty and the Beast taking place in France, Pocahontas taking place in early colonial United States, and Hercules being in Greece. This one I assume is in Denmark. It goes to show back then, Disney was doing unique stories about different countries and help enrich the audience of different cultures. That's mainly what I have to say about the Little Mermaid.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the best,"Here we are, 20 years after its original release, and The Little Mermaid remains one of the studio's best works. This was, hands down, the best film to come out of the Disney studio in the 1980s and is definitely in the top ten of all time. The Little Mermaid works on almost every level: aesthetically pleasing, wonderful pacing, perfectly cast, wonderful score, and terrific musical numbers. The only minor complaint that I have is the inconsistency with Ariel. The studio had several animators contribute to her character, depending on the sequence within the story, and it shows. At certain points throughout the feature, such as her first encounter with Eric on the beach and their carriage ride through town, she looks, well, different; she has smaller eyes, frizzier hair, and sharper features. This is, however, more than forgivable, given the superbness of the rest of the production. This movie is awesome in virtually every aspect and still tugs at the heartstrings, even having seen it many, many times. Wonderful entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the most all time greatest animated movies in history,"In the 1980's The Walt Disney Company wasn't making a good success on the movies when FOX AND THE HOUND came out it wasn't a breakout hit but it was good. And then everything when downhill in 1985 with the release of the BLACK CLAUDRON which was a major flop and it lost everyone's spirit at Disney, until they choose make a long awaited project into a movie based on the tragic fairy tale The Little Mermaid.This movie tells the story of Ariel a mermaid princess who dreams of becoming human and soon to fallen deeply in love with a human prince so she traded her voice to get legs by a powerful sea witch who wants to rule the ocean and really using her as bait, unlike the ending in the original tale the mermaid gets what she wants and has a happy ending.This movie had save The Disney Company so much that they now making all time classics such as THE LION KING and ALADDIN and more to name it was a big moment for Disney. And it's now an all time favorite classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney's Hans Christian Anderson tale given stunning animation...,"The haunting legend of Ariel, a spunky mermaid who, against King Triton's will, falls in love with a human, has been brought to the screen by the Disney artists in full-blown animation that captures the spirit and charm of Hans Christian Anderson's fairy-tale with the additional grace of a memorable musical score.From the opening sequences under the sea (incidentally, ""Under the Sea"" is the big production number that won a Best Song Oscar), THE LITTLE MERMAID is a joy from beginning to end. Youngsters will love it for the appealing story of the Mermaid and the human prince, and young and old will succumb to the charm of the animation and the humor.The songs are a sprightly bunch, written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, and the background score deserved its Oscar too. In addition to the aforementioned ""Under the Sea"", ""Kiss the Girl"" is given inspired treatment and ""Part of Your World"" has a charm of its own.Inspired moments of comedy, romance and drama, THE LITTLE MERMAID restored respectability to the Disney studio for its artistic worth and lay the groundwork for the future success of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and TARZAN.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Yet another great Disney classic,"Disney has provides lots of incredible animation throughout the years, that would probably be an understatement when discussing the pioneers of animation - and whilst their films would not be academy nominated for Best picture until a few years later, this adaptation of a classic fairy tale is a joy to watch both as a child and as an adult.As one would expect when it has been Oscar nominated for best song several times, it offers a very memorable soundtrack - showcasing several genres, both deep and dramatic, catchy and funny and haunting.The animation is beautiful, and it offers some truly rememberable characters; cute and funny ones such as Flounder or Sebastian, and haunting and terrifying over-the top foes in Ursula the witch. The latter is definitely one of the better villains in Disney history, both in terms of animation which is very creative, the great voice acting and just her demeneor.Overall, a great piece of Disney filmography that is very much recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney's Under the Sea Classic,"The Little Mermaid is Walt Disney's 28th Animated masterpiece released in 1989 and has been hailed by many as ""The movie that saved Disney"" and began a new era in Disney animation known to Disney fans as the Disney Renaissance. This, like many other Disney movies is based off of a classic story. It's the story of Ariel (voiced by Jodi Benson), a beautiful, fun-loving, adventurous mermaid who dreams of living life on land even though her father, King Triton (voiced by Kenneth Mars), forbids her of having any contact with the human world. But one night a fierce sea storm destroys the ship that the man of her dreams Prince Eric (voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes) is on and he falls underwater and Ariel has no choice but to save him. She fell in love with him at first sight and in order to see him again, she makes a deal with the evil sea-witch Ursula (voiced by Pat Carroll) and gives up her voice for a pair of human legs. In order to regain her voice and break Ursula's spell, she must kiss Eric within three days and if she doesn't, she'll remain a mermaid. This movie has everything a Disney movie should have: great story, memorable characters such as Flounder (voiced by Jason Marin), Sebastian (voiced by Samuel E. Wright), and Scuttle (voiced by Buddy Hackett), a great villain (Ursula is by far one of Disney's greatest villains), and an Academy Award winning music score composed by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman with songs such as ""Under the Sea"", ""Part of Your World"", ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"", and ""Kiss the Girl."" If you haven't by any chance seen this movie in the last 20+ years it's been out, please watch it. It in my opinion is a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone, boy or girl. This, like many Disney Classics is one I own and is definitely one of my favorite Disney movies. The reason why I did not give this movie a 10 is because Musker and Clements could've done a better climax. Other than that, this movie is great family fun!!!

The Classic Mermaid,"The Little Mermaid is a classic film that is beloved my many and with good reason too. It is well written, well performed and well directed. The characters are interesting and engaging and though I am blind I've been told the animation is captivating. It's the type of movie that can be loved by people of all ages as well as people with all nationalities and I'm happy to say also loved by the blind and visually impaired community as there is a lot of talking in this one. But then there are in so many Disney things so hats off to them for that. I could write a whole review about hollywoods films being accessible or not but I shan't. Let's get back to the little mermaid though: it works so well as it's a story that all of us can relate too, in one way or another. Team Rebellion, a desire for acceptance, and doing anything to be with the one we love. All things that even if we have not experienced we can understand. Given to us of course was some wonderful songs. Songs that could even have you singing and dancing along so if you haven't seen it yet, do try checking it out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"The colours, the music, the animation, the villain! Everything is great.","As a whole The Little Mermaid is fantastic. It is not my favorite from the Disney renaisance, but it definitely is a fantastic underwater adventure.Comparing it to the later Disney greats I came to a conclusion on why I liked it: it made me happy. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is my favorite, because it was thought-provoking and made me think about life, but when in need of cheering up this Mermaid is what I turn to. 
The climax is one of the best in the Disney catalog with the great Ursula being defeated in a pretty awesome way actually!Under The Sea is only one of all the ridiculously catchy songs in the movie and it really deserved those Oscars. While Ursula's song maybe is my least favorite of the villain songs from the great 90's Disney movies it surely is entertaining just like the other songs.But the time Ariel spends on land really shows how passionately the animators worked on the movie. If you haven't, watch it! It is great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The movie that set the new animation standards for Disney's best work.,"After a few slow and disappointing years for the Disney animation studios, this movie marked their official comeback. The movie set the standards and raised the bar for the later and most classic Diseny movies, such as ""Beauty and the Beast, ""The Lion King"" and ""Aladdin"". After this movie a decade of successes follow for Walt Disney Pictures.The movie is perhaps not as childish and simple as the earliest Disney works. It makes this movie more accessible and enjoyable for people of all ages, although it of course will be the kids that will enjoy this movie still the most.Main thing that makes this movie such a great and memorable one are its classic characters. They are all memorable and entertaining in their own way. Ariel is a great main and likable main character that I'll bet many little girls admire. The comical reliefs of the movie are Scuttle, Flounder and Sebastian the crab. They mostly make the movie entertaining, although the movie lies its emphasis on the love-story between the mermaid Ariel and the human prince Eric, that is well developed and written in the movie. The love-story is very pleasant to watch, which without kidding makes this one of the very best romantic movies ever made, that never gets too sappy or not believable. But also the villain is a great and memorable. Ursula the sea witch is perfectly villainous that works of course as an entertaining one as well.Also a reason why this is a classic are it's great memorable sing along songs. This movie features some of the very best and most memorable songs out of all Disney movies.The imaginative underwater world is well made and works perfectly entertaining as the backdrop for the movie its story. The best sequences of the movie are also set underwater. The animations are superb.The voice cast is great. It doesn't feature any big names, with perhaps the exception of Rene Auberjonois but he plays a very, very little part in the movie. Ariel has a perfect girlie and signing voice, both provided by Jodi Benson. Pat Carroll is also perfect as the villain Ursula but perhaps the best piece of casting is Samuel E. Wright as Sebastian. His voice is what makes the character interesting and is the reason why his character works entertaining as well.The movie is of course not without its flaws. The movie is quite short with means that some things are too rushed and the story doesn't always get developed to the max. Some of the characters are underused in the movie as well, such as King Triton and the villain Ursula, who perhaps appears a bit too late and too sudden in the movie. The movie is also perhaps not as humorous as most other Disney movies but it really is the wonderful well written love-story that compensates for this.A great and wonderful bar raising animated picture, that marked the beginning of the decade of perhaps the greatest full length Disney animated pictures.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Disney's AMAZING rite of passage into modern times,"Where to start?  I have always loved this movie, and like all Disney, it probably had a lot to do with shaping who I am.  Is this why I am vegetarian now? who can say!I just celebrated my 24th birthday listening to a 3-volume set of Disney music, which I had bought at Disney World years ago, since they didn't have the Little Mermaid soundtrack by itself.And I gleamed something magical.  I felt like a chimney sweep on the London rooftops gazing into the soul of Disney:  Just as Mickey is the very heart of Disney, Ariel is the very-human voice of us Disney children.It all started with Mickey Mouse, all endless, innocent antics.  The characters in Disney movies hence became more diverse, but the style and music was fairly consistent.Now, I quiver at films like Return to Neverland, which make it seem like you HAVE to have rock stars re-hash the old magic since the times are a-changin' and you can't top perfection.But it isn't so!  Never has a fantasy character been as pure as Snow White and as introspecting as Hamlet, at the same time.  And never has a movie soundtrack been such a captivating symphony of all-to-familiar styles, with new-born heart-melting melodies.This movie proves that no matter what, Disney has an endless arsenal of pixie dust that can be taken to anybody's living room, ANY time.The world faces harsh times now, but if you listen, you can hear Ariel singing about the promised land.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Ariel is my Idol,"The Little Mermaid is by far my favorite Disney Princess movie. Ever since I first saw it back in 1996 I haven't stopped loving it and even though I've gotten older I still love it. I know it doesn't follow the original, but TLM is still a beautiful story that i can still relate to. Growing up with arguing with your father I could relate to Ariel and her longing to be treated like an adult and wanting to explore unknown lands. Put that angst together with the wonderful music and excellent voices you get a timeless classic the whole family can enjoy. I also applaud Jodi Benson for doing her own singing. I read that they almost cut Part of Your World which to me has always been my favorite and also is important to show how much Ariel wants to be out of the water and with Eric.

""Kiss the Girl"" was also nominated, and when two songs from the same movie compete for the same Oscar it's clear how great this soundtrack is.

Perfect,"The Little Mermaid revitalized animation and Disney. The art form had vacillated quite badly in the 80's but this film came along and once again proved that an animated film can be fun, entertaining and worthy of critical acclaim all the same time.A film in this genre needs to be judged by the characters, songs and imagery. Here we have them all at peak form. ""Kiss the Girl"" and ""Under the Sea"" are two of the best Disney Songs ever. Sebastian and Flounder and the lovable, timeless comic relief sidekicks. And the images - Disney still has not and may never top the sequence to the two aforementioned songs.But no animated film is can be great without a great villain, and Ursula the Sea Witch is one of the greats. Smarmy, sarcastic, evil, vengeful, arrogant, funny and everything else she needs to be, the character is brilliantly voiced by Pat Carroll and sings the single best ever Disney Villain song - ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"".Recently watching Shrek, Monsters Inc and Toy Story 2, I found it amazing that the most recognizable name in the credits for Little Mermaid is Buddy Hackett. Voice-over has been come hotly sought after work for A-list actors (just look at Shrek!) and they have this movie to thank.I love The Little Mermaid.

What Fun!!!,"This may be a little biased as I am a huge fan of the Disney Renaissance. This was the one that shot Disney back to where it belongs as one of the most beloved movie studios in Hollywood. And it is quite easy to see why. From the gorgeous animation to the wonderful characters (Sebastian, the rasta crab is one of my favourite characters ever as is Ursula one of the most charismatic and funniest villains). There is also the delightful story. Its hard to beliece that a film which is slightly longer than an hour can pack so much story in. The music also makes this a must see, from the great sing-a-long Under The Sea, to the romantic cheesy ballad kiss The Girl.

Ariel was honestly kind of whiny, but she acted just as a head-over-heels 16 y/o girl would. I know I would've acted that way at least.

An animated delight,"This Disney classic, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, tells the story of Ariel. She is a sixteen year old mermaid princess who has always been fascinated with humans and the surface world despite rules forbidding their interaction. One day she swims to a ship and observes the crew. Here she first sees Prince Eric and immediately falls in love. The ship is then wrecked but she saves him; he doesn't see her but when he wakes on a beach he remembers her beautiful voice as she sang to him. Triton, Ariel's father, forbids her from ever going to the surface again but when Ursula, the devious Sea Witch, offers her an opportunity to see Eric again she accepts. There are catches of course; firstly if she doesn't make him fall in love and kiss her within three days she will belong to Ursula and secondly it will cost her voice so she can neither speak nor sing. She is reunited with Eric but getting to love her will be hard; especially as Ursula will use many tricks to prevent it. Along the way she is joined by her friends Flounder, Sebastian the crab and a gull named Scuttle.I found this film to be a real delight; the story may be fairly simple but it provides thrills, laughs, enjoyable songs, a few scary moments and of course romance... all in a film that is suitable for viewers of all ages. The animation is of a high quality with character designs that are quintessential Disney... a pretty princess, a handsome prince, animal sidekicks and a villainess nobody will mistake for one of the good guys! The characters are nicely expressive; even when Ariel can' speak a work it is clear what she is thinking. The story plays out nicely with no scene outstaying its welcome; all leading to an impressive finale.

A Prefect Masterpiece,"This is one great movie. I first saw it years ago when I about five or six I think although I could only remember very minor bits of it. I managed to run into it again years later at sixteen. I decided to watch it again because I had nothing else to do at the time. I really didn't expect myself to like it as much as I did. The movie was an amazing piece of work. It has some of the best Disney songs ever made. It also has some great characters, prefect animation and an amazing storyline. The movie is based on Han Christian Anderson's fairy tale and Roger Allers, Ron Clements & John Musker has fitted it all nicely into a movie. Although I recommend who liked this movie to read the original tale which I liked just as much as the movie although it doesn't end the same way. The story is interesting, romantic, funny and very entertaining. The characters are excellent with their own personalities and everything including the villain who isn't brainless like some other villains you see. Some people say that's Ariel a brat but if you where in her situation I think you would do the same. The characters voices are prefect and really fit into their roles and appearance. I can easily say that Jodi Benson (Ariel's voice) has the greatest voice I have ever heard. Howard Ashman has created some of the greatest songs also. Under The Sea is my favourite which is sung by Samuel E. Wright (Sebastian's voice) but all the others are great too. This movie won and was nominated for plenty of songs in it. The animation is breathtaking which also won an award for it. Glen Keane (Ariel's main animator) is one of the greatest animators ever to walk the earth. He has worked on many of the Disney films before and after this movie. Anyway the bottom line is that it is one great movie that almost anyone should love. It is by far one of the greatest Disney movies ever, if not the greatest. I highly recommend everyone to see it if they haven't already. I must admit this wasn't 100% prefect thought (although very close to it). I didn't like the ending too much but everything else was beyond prefect.9/10P.S. There was a TV series for this movie which was very good. It was based before she had meet Eric and she meets Scuttle and a few other characters in the episodes. It was very well written and seemed as if it was created by the exact same people. There was also a sequel but it was nothing compared to this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Wright, That we unfortunately lost recently, A performance so great, It will never be forgotten, Even after hundreds of years, People will always remember his talents as a Disney legend, RIP Samuel, I'm listening to 'Under The Sea' while I'm writing this review right now, It's that good, Ariel's song is great too, Jodi Benson has such an adorable voice, I can't see someone other than her voicing the character, Ursula's song is pretty great too, Even though I still think 'Hellfire' from 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' and 'Be Prepared' from 'The Lion King' are much better songs and are more menacing and memorable in my opinion but still a very good villain song nonetheless.The humour is pretty great too and doesn't clash with the serious moments like 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' thankfully and the chef sequence with Sebastien is so crazy and funny, It really felt like something outta Looney Tunes, Really enjoyed it.I think the only real problem that I have with this movie is that I felt like the ending sequence was.. Not to say practically rushed or anything but I felt like it was too fast, I wish the third act was a bit longer but other than that, This movie is still a wonderful masterpiece from beginning to end, Just a very enjoyable magical adventure about doing what's makes you happy in life and not sticking to the rules, With such a phenomenal voice cast, Exceptional expressive animation and a lot of wonderfully memorable songs, You could never go wrong with The Little Mermaid, Easily one of my favorite Disney movies!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Great Disney Movie!,"This is probably one of the greatest Disney cartoons ever made. The soundtrack is great. The character and their personalities were great too. I like the ending where Triton made a rainbow for everyone. The songs ""Kiss the Girl"" and ""Under the Sea"" were my favorite. I recommend this movie for little kids and also for older people who just wants to relax.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the best Disney movies.,"This is one of Disney's great animation classics, released at a time when the studio has made some productions of great popular impact and critical acclaim. The story is very much based on a tale by Hans Christian Andersen about the impossible love between a mermaid and a human prince. I don't think the script is really worth mentioning, given that it is widely known, not only by admirers of fairy tales, but even by those who have never seen the film or read Andersen's tales.The film has a good set of actors who provide us with an excellent voice work. Personally, I would like to highlight the contributions of Jodi Benson, Kenneth Mars, Pat Carroll, and Samuel Wright's deep Caribbean accent. Some characters in the film become so popular that they were used not only for merchandising, but also for the Disney theme parks. This is the case of the protagonist, Ariel, one of the most iconic Disney princesses ever. Ursula is often singled out as an excellent villain, and she actually deserves that, but I can't look at her without seeing her as a kind of adaptation of the Bad Witch from ""Sleeping Beauty"", with a Mephistophelian touch.The film was beautifully designed, and the animations are of high quality, one of the best the studio did before massively abandoning traditional animation and converting to digital. The colors are vibrant, the film is bright and beautifully edited, it never seems to drag or take longer than necessary. In addition to all this, the film has one of the best soundtracks that Disney has conceived, signed by the master hand of Alan Menken and worthy winner of the Oscar for Best Soundtrack in 1990. Although everyone talks about ""Under the Sea"", a mellow, tropical melody that won the Oscar for Best Original Song this year, I honestly prefer ""Part of Your World"", but that's my personal taste.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the greatest,"I love many Disney movies. Some for their nostalgia, some for their humor, and then there's the ones I get strong emotions with. This is one of those. When Eric jumped off a lifeboat back onto a burning ship to save his dog he became my favorite male Disney character ever. When she saves him I get emotional, when her dad destroys her statue I get emotional, at the end I get emotional. Plenty of Disney movies have great songs but this is in the top 3 of all time. Under the Sea, Part of Your World, Poor Unfortunate Souls and Kiss the Girl, all in the same movie? Perfection. I'll never watch the remake because it just can't compare.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The starting point that saved Disney,"As there's a lot of buzz about the...other version of this film that is out right now I thought I'd make a review on the actually amazing one as well while hype was high. I mean why not when there needs to be something that is this astoundingly good?So, the Little Mermaid, I won't be spoiling things though if you've not already seen this movie why not, go see it right this second it's an amazing piece of animation history and a landmark piece of movie making that shows just how amazing storytelling can be when you aren't told lies your whole life.The little Mermaid is a toned down version of the story by Hans Christian Andersen as it's a Disney movie but for that I hold nothing against it, as the story itself isn't exactly the same one told by the novel, in this version we have an Ariel who is amazed by the world of Humans and has been interested in them for years, learning everything from words for things and concepts that cannot make even the slightest bit of sense to a girl living in a world full of water to the concept of dancing and collecting items by the score, all of this just because she is fascinated by a realm she can never enter.THIS is character and it's developed in less than 10 minutes of screen time where we're actually introduced to her, moving from this we have a wide, colourful and beautiful world at the seafloor that has its own amazing culture, there's reasons why things like 'Under the Sea' are remembered for more than just the song but the scene itself as we see there's many many different types of aquatic life that exists, from peaceful and music loving fish and merfolk to wild and obviously dangerous Sharks.All of this seeks to build upon the idea that there's a culture that Ariel is apart of and seems to think is inconsequential because of her laser focus on the Surface and Humanity.Add to that the complex nature of the Human world and the disparity between how the life under the sea see them to how those on the surface see those same merfolk, it builds to a crescendo in showing that there's both positives and negatives in the world and its people.Which brings us to the titular villain of the piece, Ursula the Sea Witch, a half Octopi being that can use magic and is the opposite end of the bell curve of power to Ariel's Father King Triton (actually from Greek Mythology btw, son of Poseidon) and of all the Disney Animation Greats, there's few who rival Ursula for just how perfect a villain she is, sure some will point to Cruella or The Wicked Queen for being evil or love Hades, but there's very few villains in Disney that we see that are the perfect form of evil not for vanity or revenge, but because they're evil and want more power, with that Ursula is sort of cemented as possibly the best villain in the Disney roster for a lot of their motivations.All in all the Little Mermaid (1983) is something near perfect in its execution, giving tones of seriousness mixed in with Disneyfied-fairy-tale storytelling and it is most definitely something anyone who wants to watch a movie with that as the name should watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

The harbinger of the Disney we know today.,"For Disney, The Little Mermaid was the start of their famous run between 1989 and 1999. And unlike many milestones in visual media it holds up to this day.The animation is absolutely teaming with life. The scenery is vivid. Emotions are masterfully portrayed. Movement is fluild. Combined with spot-on voice casting, it is very hard not to like any character in this movie.The story flows very, very well. Children's movies can easily become hollow from not enough meat. Or be too convoluted and pretentious. The writers did a great job of balancing fun and progression. And allow me to reiterate fun. It is a dazzling movie. But in terms of plot, there is not a useless scene in The Little Mermaid.As far as the score, one of the best (in terms of Disney movies). I never knew this movie won Oscars before rewatching it a few days ago. However, it checks out. There are two throw-away songs in the beginning, but they are short and meant to meld the human and mermaid world. The four songs after are immersive and catchy.My only gripe is towards the end. It's probably a little subjective in my personal taste, so I don't feel the need to write spoilers. But the movie moves past it well due to its general charm.Overall, The Little Mermaid will leave *most of you* glowing. It is easy to watch, relatable, and rewarding.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Perfection!,"I have to emphasise how of a masterpiece this film is, utter perfection, as a child I loved this and now as a adult I find myself more related to Ursula, her one liners are my utmost favourite.The storyline is brilliantly executed, the voice actors perform phenomenally, I have to give a massive shoutout to the legend that is 'Pat Carroll', her voice draws you into the character biography. Such a talented woman.The production of the animation is flawlessness, as I said everything about this is pure utter perfection. I myself isn't a massive fan of musical numbers, but I have to note how brilliant Ursula's 'Poor Unfortunate Souls' is, iconic in my eyes!33 years later & its still one of my favourite films & remains a iconic masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Pleasing and amusing,"The Little Mermaid is quite interesting. The music is unforgettable. The dialogue is very great, and the storytelling is amazing. Ursula is a great villain.

But I don't let that ruin the movie, because it's still a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A classic...,"After having sat through the 2023 live-action version of this classic animated movie from Disney, I opted to sit down and revisit the animated movie yet again. This was one of my all-time favorite animated movies back when it was released, and I have seen it many times.Writers John Musker and Ron Clements did a good job at turning fairytale writer Hans Christian Andersen's story into an animated movie. The storyline has something for just about everyone in the audience, both young and old. I've always been very amused by Sebastian, and I still am. Though when I was younger, it was a Danish dubbed version of the movie that I sat through every time, so this time around I opted to go for the English language version. Odd how the songs seem so strange now.The art and animation style used in ""The Little Mermaid"" was and still is good. The characters are outstanding and memorable, be it human, mermaid or animal. Lots of really nicely drawn art throughout the course of the 83 minutes that the animated movie runs for.I have to admit that I genuinely enjoy this 1989 animated movie more than I did the 2023 live-action version. But to each their own, of course.My rating of ""The Little Mermaid"" from directors Ron Clements and John Musker lands on an eight out of ten stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Nice Story/Great Music,"This is a masterwork for Disney Studios. The story alone would be enough to carry this. We have great undersea characters whose level of knowledge is restricted to their environment, naturally. We have a nasty villain, Ursula, who is jealous and pained by her own appearance and awful voice. We have a longing for something that is not easily understood by the other characters. Take a really neat plot and throw in some amazing songs. I mean Broadway songs. Animation has become its own Broadway with very little tweaking. Ariel is a fully developed character with wants and needs. She is a strong ""woman."" One may find the need for a man a bit sexist at times, but it is more of a longing. We then have a willingness to give up everything (her voice in particular) to experience what it would be like to be a woman. Looking back on this film, we see the die is cast for success after success with some of the best pop music ever written.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Charming Disney romance,"THE LITTLE MERMAID, in my opinion, is a charming Disney romance. If you ask me, Ursula (voice of Pat Carroll) was truly diabolical. In addition, she was very unattractive. On the other hand, Ariel (voice of Jodi Benson) could truly sing. Well, despite the fact that everyone in this film could sing, Ariel was the best. This was probably be because she did most of the singing. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this charming Disney romance to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One Of My Favorite Princess Movie,"This is one of my favorite Disney movies of all time, besides others ones of course, The Little Mermaid is my childhood movie, to my sister and myself, Is a really beautiful movie and yes its cheesy at times but what you expect is Disney, I love the music it has some of the most iconic songs that when you hear it somewhere else you will definitely know it's from The Little Mermaid, that being said The Little Mermaid becomes a Disney classic to myself and my sister and I'm pretty sure to other people as well, I love this movie, I give "" The Little Mermaid"" a 9 out of 10 Stars, and that's only because as well I consider Ariel to be the best Princess of Disney.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Start Of The Disney Renaissance Is One Of Disney's Best Movies.,"Walt Disney died in 1966, during production on The Jungle Book. For about 2 decades after that, the company made many good animated movies- The Aristocats, Robin Hood, The Fox and the Hound, and many more which were enjoyed, but not as appreciated as Walt's work such as Snow White, Cinderella, Lady and the Tramp, and so forth.Then in 1989, Disney released a movie called The Little Mermaid, and the Disney Renaissance was born- The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King made Disney king of animation once again. In fact, The Little Mermaid and All Dogs Go To Heaven, released by MGM, released in theaters on the same day (11-17-1989), and unfortunately the latter film flopped because of this.The titular ""little mermaid"" is Ariel, who wants to experience life on land with humans more than anything. Even though she is half-human, her father fears that humans are dangerous and forbids her from going near them. Ariel's curiosity still gets the best of her, and one day she discovers a prince named Eric.Desperate to meet him, she makes a deal with the sea witch Ursula to trade her voice for legs for 3 days, and if Eric falls for her before sunset, she will be with him, as a human, forever. Otherwise, Ariel will belong to Ursula. The deal is made, and the plot develops from there.Often when I review an animated movie, I start by mentioning the animation. It is glorious here- with the sea water, bubbles animated in China, and the details of the settings and characters- such as Ariel's wavy hair, or the castle in which Eric resides.The animation is very consistent- for example, I couldn't help but notice that Ursula's tentacles realistically moved and stayed at their size throughout. Hand drawing this must have been a challenge, and it was still done well.There is also a moment when Ariel and Ursula meet and Ursula puts on beauty products in a mirror. Her reflection is very consistent from the angle in which she is sitting, as if it were done in the real world rather than in an animated film.There are also bits of computer animation, like some stairs that Ariel runs down at the news of Eric getting married, that blend well for its time, 6 years before Toy Story, the first fully computer animated feature, was made.The voice work is done well too- Jodi Benson does a wonderful job singing and speaking for Ariel. Samuel E. Wright, who voices the crab Sebastian, has a very convincing Jamaican accent. Pat Carroll clearly has fun voicing the villain Ursula. Other notable voices include Kenneth Mars as Triton, Buddy Hackett as Scuttle, and Christopher Daniel Barnes as Eric- who was a teenager at the time.The Little Mermaid also has some fantastic songs- Under The Sea is probably the most iconic song, and for good reason- it's so catchy that when I watched the movie earlier today, I played it twice. My favorite song is a toss up between that and Ursula's song, Poor Unfortunate Souls.Part Of Your World is another iconic song, where Ariel sings about her desire to live with humans. My sister, who had mental and physical challenges, LOVED this song- so much so that when I wanted to sing a Christian song (called Blessed Be Your Name) at my Dad's funeral, she wanted to sing Part Of Your World. My Mom had it worked out for her to sing it as people walked in, before the actual service.It's no wonder that The Little Mermaid started a ""Renaissance"" for Disney. Not only was a part of many childhoods (hence my sister antedote), but it's wonderfully animated, voiced, and the story and songs hold up 35 years after its release. In fact, it's past 11pm right now, and I watched the movie over 6 hours ago. Even then, Under The Sea has repeatedly popped into my head.Disney has made many excellent animated films, and The Little Mermaid is one of the very best for the aspects previously mentioned. Whether Ariel is under the sea or part of our world, the elements are all perfect. The Little Mermaid is not only one of Disney's best movies, but it is one of the best animated movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Great Movie,"Review By Kamal KIt is a beautiful movie, with outstanding music and funny characters but, It is a eight -star rating because of the message. It gives two messages, You can do anything you want if you pay the price, but also, you can throw your whole life away for someone. The second one is partially true.

An animated classic that managed to overshadow the original tale of Hans Christian Andersen,"It must be said that as an adaptation of the original tale on which it is based, the film has many creative liberties that, as is common in Disney adaptations, discards many mature and tragic elements to offer a much more familiar and joyful tale. Despite those liberties, The Little Mermaid manages to be an amazing animated film. The story is almost the same as the original tale, but tells a different story that derives heavily from the original tale. That makes it a far cry from the source material as an adaptation, but as an animated film it manages to be amazing. The story of a young woman who not only wants to know the outside world, but also to meet the young prince who has stolen her heart and who is willing to sacrifice everything, including defying her protective father or losing her home. Ariel is a truly charming character, with a big heart and beauty both on the outside and on the inside. His companions Flounder and Scuttle are quite nice. Sebastian is a charismatic character and quite the comic relief. King Triton is a character who at times can be a hateful father for being too overprotective, but there is no doubt that his love for his daughter is great, although that leads him to make decisions that distance him more from her. Ursula, finally, is another of the best villains that Disney has created. A very elegant, eccentric and cunning villain who manages to be endearing, not forgetting to mention that she was inspired by the artist Divine. That makes Úrsula another of the great legacies that Divine has left behind. The animation is a beauty that offers a magical visual experience and the songs on the soundtrack are truly endearing. The Little Mermaid (1989) is a free adaptation that, even though it is detached from the source material, managed to overshadow it enough to become an iconic film and one of Disney's best animated works. My final rating for this movie is 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Once in a Lifetime.,"Movies for the most part are entertainment.  That is all they are meant to be.  A few times in your life, just at the right time, just when you are at a turning point --- a movie comes along that mirrors your own emotions, your own angst, and your own sense of self.  if this movie comes along just at the right moment, then the movie transcends entertainment and becomes an experience.The Little Mermaid, was an experience for me.  I sometimes think I may have been a little older than most people who it was meant for. But it's idea, of finding a place where you belong, of being part of something special, whether be it love, or something else was in line with my particular growing pains at the time.The movie's characters, both Ariel and Prince Eric had a common bond, in that they wanted to surpass everyone's expectations of them, and they did. When I saw the movie, I was also going through that.Never mind that this film is a CLASSIC. Perhaps one of the top 10 animated films ever made, I find it has a much deeper heart than Beauty and the Beast, and although it signified the beginning of a brand new Disney Empire, I find that it also signified the end of it.  A film like this, can be imitated but it can never be duplicated.  And animation has grown into a magnificence and technologically superior story telling medium.  But what the Little Mermaid had, it's still to be re-captured, and that's a heart as big and as deep as the ocean.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The film that changed Disney forever,"The Little Mermaid may very well be the most important film in the Disney catalog. Not only did it decisively save the studio from bankruptcy, but it ushered in the biggest era in its history: the Renaissance of the nineties. All that aside, it's nonetheless still an absolutely amazing film that never gets old for me. It takes massive liberties with the source material (especially the ending), but given what a colossal downer the fairy tale is, that's honestly for the best. The story it does tell is perfectly written, developed, and paced, with tons of great, funny lines to boot. Plenty have argued that the romance at the heart of the story feels rushed, but if you look at this film as less of a love story and more of an allegory for growing up, I'd argue it works a lot better than you think. Plus, Ariel and Eric still have great chemistry, and their culture clash romance has plenty of charm to spare.The cast of characters is excellent from the top down; yes, that includes the divisive heroine. Sure, Ariel is a protagonist with quite a few flaws, but honestly, I prefer that over someone who's basically perfect. It makes her feel more real and, for lack of a better term, human. Plus, she's still likeable, charming, and played perfectly by Jodi Benson. Meanwhile, Eric is a great love interest who's surprisingly gutsy, given some of the things he does. Ursula is one of the greatest Disney villains, equal parts funny and scary, with a great design and voice. Sebastian, Flounder, and Scuttle are all hilarious comic relief. Even Ariel's father, who I'm not a huge fan of, is helped by a great design and Kenneth Mars' commanding voice.This film marked the end of an era for Disney animation. It would be their last film that was inked and painted by hand; starting with their next film, The Rescuers Down Under, it would all be done by computer. As the last film of its breed, it goes all out in every conceivable way. The scenes underwater are all gorgeous, with vibrant colors, various sea creatures, the awesome kingdom where Ariel lives, and the designs and movements of our main characters. The scenes above water aren't as grand, but there's still plenty of scenes and sequences that make them stand out, especially the storm sequence and one of the best climaxes in all of Disney. And the songs, what can I say about them? Part Of Your World, Under The Sea, and Poor Unfortunate Souls all rank among my favorite Disney songs. And the rest are excellent too.Overall, The Little Mermaid's status as the biggest game changer in the studio's history alone earns it the title of one of the best animated movies ever. Beyond that, though, it's just an amazing, fun film that ranks among my top ten favorites. I've seen it a million times and plan to watch it a million more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Disney princess film that hit many audience's.,"So Disney was continuing making one of his greatest gems like he did with the first Disney classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia, Bambi, Cinderella, Lady and the Tramp, 101 Dalmatians and The Jungle Book. That's one of Walt Disney's greatest works. The audiences love his magical gems and magic come to life. Magical story's and animation the whole family to enjoy again and again. This is one of Disney's continued works and the reason I said that is because Walt wanted to feature length films that can grow audiences big, I mean really big! He wanted to make the songs so memorable and so catchy and Alan Menken is the one who made the songs so beautiful, compelling and catchy and it really makes the animation so amazing. The songs Part of your World, Under the Sea and the one that got me excited and gripped is Poor Unfortunate Souls. Ohh, and also the french song witch really makes me laugh just like other songs from Disney classics. The characters however are memorable, the Disney princesses again continued, they'll be continued after I finish The Little Mermaid. The villian is so brilliant, Ursula has the power of Ariel and these people who she called them like I mentioned before Poor unfortunate souls. Jodi Benson is the main voice of the Disney princess Ariel. She wanted to be in the human world but her father forbids her to go out there alone because it's dangerous but found a true love of her life called Eric. Flounder and Sebastian are the side characters with Ariel. The chef is hilarious and Sebastian is scared of him cause he cooks fish and crabs and Sebastian escapes from the chef before he cooks him. Now that's slapstick. The animation continued to be brilliant and fresh just like all animation is. That's all I gotta say about it. I think my remembered Liam and Jacob quoting from it so that's why I doing the next Disney animated feature. Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
It Triumphs Over Live-Action Rival with Timeless Charm and Character Flexibility.,"1. Concept: It's about a young woman who falls in love and risks everything to be with that person, even in the face of her father's anger.2. Plot: Unlike the live-action version, this story omits many details about the past of both the main and secondary characters. In retrospect, it's better not to mention a character's past unless it will be developed further, so the movie primarily focuses on the two main characters without delving into their backgrounds. Another critical error in the live-action version is the alteration of several aspects of the story and the omission of scenes crucial for understanding the king's perspective, creating dynamic situations with Sebastian, or providing more meaning and continuity to the plot. For instance, Ariel meeting Scuttle out of the water, which is crucial in several details in the animated version, appears as abrupt cuts in the live-action version. Therefore, the animated version is much more engaging, leaving little room to question motivations or backgrounds, flowing seamlessly in narration, with a consistent narrative pace throughout the film.3. Characters: Sebastian and Ursula deserve mention for their distinctive personalities and style, making them entertaining, while this doesn't apply to the two main characters or the rest of the cast.4. Complexity: This story lacks complexity, with no dark past or difficulties explaining the characters' personalities or attitudes. The gradual change expressed by Sebastian and King Triton regarding Ariel is a notable aspect, adding emotion and empathy to the story.5. Performance: In contrast to the live action, the animated version features voices that perfectly represent the characters and their personalities, with animation allowing for more expressive gestures and body language, which is absent in the live-action adaptation.6. Aesthetics: The animation style reflects the era, with a certain simplicity in textures and environments that, at times, highlights actions, emotions, and the story effectively.7. Audio: Overall, I preferred the songs in this version over the live action, although it's not my top preference. I appreciated the Caribbean and French influences in the music in some scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Set the formula for the 90's Disney films,"The Little Mermaid is the start of Disney's renaissance era which would continue throughout the 90's. It established tropes that would stay with the majority of the company's film there on out: Don't isolate yourself to your own kind ; Go out and meet new different kind of people ; Don't always obey your overprotective family ; True love conquers all ; Princes and princesses are cool.It's a great kids movie that I enjoy watching to this day. Sebastian the crab is one of the better side kicks. The action scenes in the third act are energetic. It has the classic songs like ""Under the Sea"". Ursula is one of the more unique Disney villains. She, unlike later Disney's villains, doesn't invade by force, but rather manipulates and persuades Ariel with a Faustian bargain. Some will find Ariel's character, who puts the pursuit of a man over her own voice, dated - I understand. But it's nonetheless a really entertaining watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

When Ariel ventures to the surface to view the birthday celebration of Prince Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes), a storm throws Eric overboard and Ariel saves him by bringing him to shore. Ariel realizes she might have romantic feelings for Eric much to Sebastian's horror, but unbeknownst to Ariel, Ursula (Pat Carroll), the sea witch and banished former member of King Triton's court sees this as an opportunity to get her revenge on Triton.Based on the story of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen, The Little Mermaid had been considered for adaptation to Disney feature animation as far back as the 1930s after the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The idea of adapting the story was revisited once again in the mid-80s during the Katzenberg/Eisner era of the studio. While Katzenberg initially didn't approve the idea due to prospects of the company producing a sequel to Splash and fearing the two would be similar, the film was approved for parallel development with Oliver & Company. Although production slowed due to the more pressing issue of releasing Oliver & Company, after Oliver's release progress on development was re-ignited with composers Howard Ashman and Alan Menken of the Off-Broadway smash Little Shop of Horrors writing the songs and score of the film. The film had more money and resources than any other Disney animated film in decades especially in regards to the underwater scenes that required extensive animation on the environmental effects and the film was also the last to use the traditional ""hand painted Cel"" method as beginning with The Rescuers Down Under the studio would switch to a computer assisted process for the animation. While initially Katzenberg thought The Little Mermaid would be less successful than Oliver & Company due to being a ""Girl's film"", Katzenberg believed at the tail end of production this could be their first animated film to break $100 million domestically. While the movie didn't meet Katzenberg's lofty expectations it still did great building upon the success of Oliver & Company and leaving Don Bluth's All Dogs go to Heaven in the dust. The movie was also a critical darling with critics hailing the film as a return to the standards set by the Golden Age of Disney praising the animation, the character of Ariel, and the music by Ashman and Menken.While The Little Mermaid is undeniably a return to the ""Princess"" movies of Disney's past like Cinderella, Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid differs in that its titular princess is considerably more active in the story than previous Disney princesses who while kind, pleasant, and patient mostly waited for things to happen to them rather than take any active participation in the narrative. Ariel in the movie is a lot more defined as a character as while she's still kind, she's also adventurous, slightly mischievous, and headstrong. It's a good interpretation of the character as it is relatable to adolescents who find themselves in conflict with their parental figures and that's a major crux of the story with the relationship between Triton and Ariel. The romance between Prince Eric and Ariel is given much more development in comparison to the previous ""love at first sight"" relationships seen in Disney's previous princess movies and unlike those we do see them build their relationship before they're a done deal (granted over the course of three days, but still). The movie features a strong cast of voice actors with Jodi Benson effortlessly embodying the headstrong Ariel, Kenneth Mars playing the intense and stubborn but very concerned King Triton, but stealing entire scenes is Pat Carroll as Ursula the Sea Witch whose motivations of revenge against Triton may not be the most complex, but the charm and humor that emanates from this character along with the very threatening atmosphere makes her a great villain in the Disney Pantheon.The music by Ashman and Menken per the standards established in their prior work such as Little Shop of Horrors is really good. The music in Little Mermaid deservedly won two Academy Awards for Best Original Score and Best Original Song (Under the Sea) respectively and with an impressive array of songs that covers all of the emotional spectrum from silly to serious you can definitely see why. The animation is also very impressive with the underwater scenes beautifully animated with details like bubbles or shimmers of light adding to the illusion of being underwater, and little details like how the hair of the merpeople moves under water are greatly appreciated. The animation is very important to this movie because there's a lengthy section where Ariel loses her voice and because of that the animation has to convey her character and it's a really great sequence with a lot of humor and pathos, and with lesser effort wouldn't have struck nearly as hard.You can certainly point out some criticisms of validity such as Ariel not really having much of an arc through this story as she wants her prince, she gets her prince being the lion's share of her purpose in the story with the most dynamic character being King Triton who learns to soften his edges to Ariel after he ends up pushing her away, but these seem like fairly minor criticisms especially when you consider the massive leaps the film takes in comparison to its forebearers in this same story setup.The Little Mermaid is seen as the beginning of the Disney Renaissance for good reason, it's an energized and emotional story with lots of crowd pleasing moments and memorable music and characters. The animation is absolutely beautiful with scenes above and beneath the sea carrying their own visual identity that makes them memorable. The story is pretty traditional and straightforward with only King Triton experiencing much of a character arc, but it's really good stuff for the time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Disney Animated Renaissance Begins...,"With ""The Little Mermaid,"" Walt Disney animation began a new renaissance comparable to Walt's beloved classics.  Disney's adaption of Hans Christian Anderson's tale introduces us to ""Little Shop of Horrors"" musical composer Alan Menken, who begins his juggernaut victories every other year. Deservedly so!   Menken's co-collaborator, Howard Ashman, outs him in fine form.  The songs are simple, yet brilliant. As for Ariel's story, it's pure fun and frolic, with a bit of danger swimming on the side.   The film's pace never lets up.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney rebirth,"""The little mermaid"" is an impressive adaptation of Andersen's tale. A young mermaid is curious of the human world and her special feelings for a human being meet her father's - who is incidentially sea king - intolerance for humans.Not only drawings are beautiful, but direction is strong too, as I can think of at least two nice moments: the opening with the ship, followed by ""camera"" moving underwater to undersea creatures, and eels' eyes watching Ariel and melting into Ursula's orb.Soundtrack is very good as well, with several memorable songs, and side characters all work very well: while Flounder is a bit too childish, Sebastian might be the best addition, Scuttle's so-called knowledge of humans is funny, chef Louis is very funny and even Eric's dog Max makes sense in the story.King Triton, on the other hand, is perhaps the character where this movie shows its age the most: old-fashioned father who first vetoes his daughter being in touch of humans, then harshly punishes her, regrets it and gives his soul for her and grants her eventually freedom, he wouldn't be portrayed this way nowadays.What is most interesting here is the contraposition between an ignorant girl's curiosity for a different culture and her father's intolerance.WhatGenerally speaking, it is a beautiful and interesting movie which marks the beginning of Disney golden age.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
I would like to have Ariel as a friend.,"I haven´t read H. C. Andersens fairy tale ""The Little Mermaid"". Of course I know who he was and is, especially because my home country Sweden and Denmark are neighbours. I also know that there is quite many differencies between the fairy tale and this movie. I don´t know if my love for this movie would change dramatically if I, in the future, would read Andersens version.Yes, I do love and enjoy this movie. I think that Ariel is strong, brave, rebellious, a bit quirky, funny, beautiful and adventurous. I would like to have her as one of my friends, mainly because of her personality. I´m also a fan of the songs! I don´t know if I have a favorite among them, maybe ""Part of Your World"", ""Under the Sea"" or ""Kiss the Girl"".

Too much Broadway,"Visually this movie is beautiful. I like that they suck to the original story line and some scenes were perfection and exactly like the original movie (shipwreck, Ursula as a giant stirring up the ocean, kiss the girl scene)What ruined the movie was the extra songs and Broadway feel when dancing. Also, the hip hop song didn't go. Either you go all out original or change it complete. This back and forth between being true to the original and then wanting to be modern just didn't work for me.Also, the movie is really long for kids. Half way through the adults and kids were bored and I saw many people on their phones.

This is one of those movies where there is a very happy ending and you are really happy you stayed to watch the whole thing.

Ursula is has lots of depth despite her limited screen time. Bu the MVP is Sebastian, who arguably has the most character growth and is the most relatable character for any parent.I recently watched this with my three-year-old, and found it was very suitable for her.

Good musical,"Good musical I can understand Under The Sea getting all the attention - it is, after all, very jolly and colourful. But, to me, it pales into insignificance next to Kiss The Girl (soulful, and with a far better vocal performance), Poor Unfortunate Souls (where sinister turns into nightmare, with a sensational vocal performance from Pat Carroll delivering clever lyrics) and, most of all Part Of Your World. I think this may be the most perfect song sequence ever committed to celluloid - the song itself intertwines several plot elements, teenage angst and the generation gap, and bucketloads of emotion in a complex rhyming scheme loaded with clever wordplay. Jodi Benson's vocal is sublime and so are the visuals - it still brings tears to my eyes after repeated viewings.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of my favourite Disney films of all time,"I think I've watched this Disney animated film from the early 1990s about few times. It's absolutely wonderful. I always adore it.

My favourite characters are Ariel and Ursula. I still have a great crush on Ariel just like when I was a kid and teen as well. Its songs, Part of Your World, Under the Sea, Poor Unfortunate Souls and Kiss the Girl are timeless classics and they're probably the best.I know it is based on the 1837 story by a Danish author Hans Christian Andersen.I always love mermaids. If you're a fan of mermaids, you'll love this!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Little Mermaid,"I was 7 years old when ""The Little Mermaid"" was released in 1989, and it became an overnight classic. I never got to see it in the theaters, but once it was released on video, I mooched off the opportunity to see from anyone who happened own it. I was caught up the aesthetic trappings: the dazzling bright colors, hummable songs (Under the Sea won the Oscar for best song who knew?), and the refreshingly spunky heroine Ariel, a nice antidote to the more passive Disney princesses of yesteryear. And you should have heard all the off-key renditions of ""Part of Your World"" that every girl under the age of 15 were belting (raises hand guiltily).Now that I'm 24, older and more cynical, I recently watched the brand new 2-disc DVD of ""The Little Mermaid"" and must say that it does look better than ever. The older side of me appreciates the mechanics of the animation. Hand drawn animation is becoming a rarity these days and ""The Little Mermaid"" is easily right up there with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""An American in Paris"" as one of the best-looking and most colorful films ever made. The character animation is also superb, especially on Ariel. She spends a good portion of the movie silent, so the animators really live up to the challenge of giving her face emotion. I especially love how they dare to allow her to look silly with her facial expressions from time to time (unlike Botox-faced Cinderella or Aurora).I especially love the villain Ursula: lusty, histrionic, and bad to the bone, she's the most entertaining Disney villain in many a moon. Not to mention the most competent: she has henchmen who actually do her bidding correctly, and Ursula is so resourceful and calculating, she practically wins at the end! Pretty impressive, I must say! Pat Carroll deserves special praise as Ursula, whose croaky voice brings to mind Lauren Bacall in a particularly foul mood.The North Carolina-born Samuel E. Wright gives Sebastian a delightful Caribbean accent that never becomes too stereotypical. The late Buddy Hackett, with his decidedly grating voice, as a seagull; c'mon, casting doesn't get any better than that! Yet the real star is Jodi Benson as Ariel. Her sweet, Broadway-friendly voice is packed with feisty innocence and wistful longing. Like Judy Garland and ""Over the Rainbow"", you can't picture anyone else warbling ""Part of Your World"".Now for the cynical side of my review: It's understandable that the good folks at Disney wanted to make a happy ending. After all, in the Hans Christian Anderson tale, the mermaid not only trades her voice for legs (by having her tongue cut out ouch!), but also loses the prince to another woman, so she throws herself into the sea and dies (but at least she goes to heaven). Yet the ending goes out of its way to be happy and it borders on downright saccharine, ending not only with a wedding but also with a parting shot of a rainbow. While I appreciate how the character of Ariel paved the way for the more modern, headstrong Disney female characters (especially my favorites, Belle and Mulan), she's hardly the exemplary ""Woman of the '90s"" critics make her out to be. Let's not forget that our spunky heroine essentially sells her soul to the evil Ursula just so she can hook up with some guy she's never had so much as a conversation with. And Prince Eric just never seemed worth it to me, he's so vapid and void of personality. I always root for Ariel, at least up to that point, and then I can't help but think, ""what an idiot!""All in all, ""The Little Mermaid"" is a guilty pleasure and is a perfectly good addition to your Disney library.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Disney Classic,"Walt Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" is a jolly and inventive animated fantasy - a movie that's so creative and so much fun it deserves comparison with the best Disney work of the past. It's based on the Hans Christian Andersen tale about a mermaid who falls in love with a prince, but the Disney animators have added a gallery of new supporting characters, including an octopus named Ursula who is their most satisfying villainess since the witch in ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" The movie opens far beneath the sea, where the god Triton rules over his underwater kingdom. All obey his commands - except for his daughter, Ariel, a mermaid who dreams of far-off lands. One day Ariel makes a forbidden visit to the surface of the sea, and there for the first time she sees a human: a handsome, young prince. He hears her singing, and falls in love with her voice. Triton is angry at Ariel's disobedi ence, but she can think of nothing but the prince, and eventually she strikes an unwise bargain with the evil Ursula, an octopus who can disguise herself in many different forms. As the plot thickens and the melodrama unwinds, the animators introduce a gallery of new characters who are instantly engaging. Ariel is accompanied most places, for example, by Sebastian, a crab with extraordinary wisdom, and by Flounder, a fish who cannot always be counted upon. They provide comic relief, especially in a sequence that mixes comedy and danger in the best Disney tradition, as Sebastian finds himself captured by a French chef who attempts to cook and serve the little blighter. There has been a notion in recent years that animated films are only for kids. But why? The artistry of animation has a clarity and a force that can appeal to everyone, if only it isn't shackled to a dim-witted story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A classic that gets a little lost in translation,"I rewatched this film with two young girls and their mom, who had never seen this Disney classic (How did that happen? Well, two of them hadn't been born when it was released in 1989). This was a film of it's time in production, character and acclaim. It set the stage for a resurgent series of highly successful animated features from the Disney Studios with it's beautiful animation and it's lively tone. It reflected a ""princess"" culture that would be a hard sell in our 2019 understanding of the hopes and aspirations of young girls. It introduced some unforgettable characters and was a template for future Disney characterization mixes (princesses, larger than life villians, loveable sidekicks, scene stealing attendants). And, it garnered a lot of critical acclaim, winning Oscars for Original Song ""Under the Sea"" and Original Score for Alan Menken (""Kiss the Girl"" was also nominated in Best Song category). On my first viewing in 1989, I probably would have given the film a 9 (superb) out of 10, but it didn't weather well, for me (it just hit some cultural dissonance with me). This time, but I still give it a 7 (good) out of 10. So, for an overall rating I'll split the difference with an 8 (great). {Animated Musical Feature}",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

One of the best Disney movies ever,"The first of Disney's 'renniacanse' films. And arguably the best Disney film of the 1980's.

And bring more of a human element to a film series that had been swimming in stories about mice and dogs and other-worldly tales for 10 years.Like all good Disney films, this one has an extensive and hilarious supporting cast. Everyone from the eccentric Skuttle, to the serious Sebastian and fearful Flounder seem to care about what's going on around them, instead of just being goofy caricatures that are only good for a laugh.Though the whole idea behind 'love at first sight' is a little far-fetched. The characters and their vocal performances make it more believable. Ariel, Eric and Ursula's ambitions guide the story along, as opposed to the three of them being victims of what happens.The character of Grimsby is one of my personal favourites from any Disney movie. He provides a nice grounding for Eric. (Particularily his line ""Far better than any dream girl... is one of flesh and blood."")

Another excellent Disney Princess movie from Disney. That's good!,"Yup, this is NOT the Hans Christian Andersen story and neither it had any pretense of being its official, definitive adaptation from the first 50 seconds on. This is simply an engaging Disney Princess movie with the same beats of the other previous Disney Princess movies and the same underlying, inspiring concept that if you can believe in achieving something you'll achieve it, no matter how hard it can be or how much other people will be against your own will. Either you like/love the Disney Princess concept or you don't, and if you love it like I do (oh, look! Other women characters to take as an inspiration! Wait, I'm an hetero man, I shouldn't do it! Who cares) you'll find this worth of your time. Just don't ask this what it doesn't want to be from the very beginning, and if you like the little mermaid story eventually read the original Hans Christian Andersen novel and watch the 70's anime Masterpiece by Toei, which is closer to the original novel albeit with some changes in there too.

Saved Disney.,"The question to ask with any post-Walt Disney animated film is:  W.W.W.D? (What Would Walt Do?)  Having seen this with my goddaughter recently, I can safely say that Walt would have done  *The Little Mermaid*, and he would have done it in much the same way that director John Musker does it here. (Though ole Walt may have looked askance at Ariel's flirty seashell bra, to say nothing of her frank sensuality.)  So how did this film save the Disney Studio?  By going Back to Basics:  tirelessly detailed animation; Hans Christian Andersen; clearly delineated heroes and villains; hilariously inadequate male love interests; amusing sidekicks.  It is no accident that this movie resembles  *Snow White*  more than any other  ""modern""  Disney cartoon:  it is clearly attempting to mine, once again, the Old Stuff, the Classic Motherlode.  It was a triumphant return to form, after two decades of forgettable attempts to be more  ""relevant""  (*Black Hole*, anyone?)  to post-Sixties audiences.Every one of the 84 minutes counts in this picture.  Not a scene is wasted, not even the musical numbers, which -- for once -- build character or advance the plot.  Lean, mean, and to the point.  Doubtless, the hand-drawn animation provided the incentive for brevity and clarity.  More recent Disney films, relying on cheaper and easier computer graphics, have shown a marked tendency of bloat.  The story's  ""deadline""  of 3 days -- during which Ariel is magically granted legs in order to pass as human and hence make the Prince give her a true love's kiss, thereby making her human forever -- also tightens things up.  More suspense is added when the evil sea-witch Ursula, as a further condition for granting Ariel's wish to be human, removes the mermaid's magical voice -- the one thing that the Prince would recognize about her.  It should be added that evil Ursula is truly nasty as well as comical, providing just the right foil for the sweet mermaid.  Simple Good vs. Evil, here -- no  ""Golden Bough""  moral complexity of, say, *The Lion King*, in which the animals worship the birth of the very creature who will likely grow up to eat them.  *The Little Mermaid*  keeps it simple, stupid -- Walt would've approved.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Too Many Songs,"The Disney version of the little mermaid is 10 times better then the original Hans Christain version.

One thing i'm shocked about, how in the world was this movie rated G for general audience. In the scene of Ariel's transformation, it's implied that she's totally nude except for the breasts; bare buttocks were briefly shown.

Least objectionable of the new Disney movies,"This movie has a lot of enjoyable features to it, and is not too badly tainted by Disney's now omnipresent anti-male, anti-tradition bias.  Ariel is for the most part a genuinely appealing character, and only occasionally falls into the California brat style that Disney movies usually present as their ideal.  The anti-male bias comes out in the treatment of her father, King Triton, who is presented as a bigoted blowhard, but he also is allowed to be a popular and kind-hearted ruler, and genuinely fond of his children, which balances the picture to some extent.  On the other hand, he is the one who has to learn that he is wrong, not Ariel, whose foolishness puts everyone in peril.  When she disappears to pursue Prince Eric, it is her father who is left worried and regretting what he has done, while she is having a carefree adventure on dry land.  The handsome prince is a bore, as is usually the case in these movies, but Sebastian and Ursula are presented with a lot of energy and provide the funniest moments in the film.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"I prefer ""The Lion King"" or ""Aladdin,"" to be frankly honest.","The Little MermaidA good Disney film about a mermaid who dreams of becoming a human and metaphorically sells her soul to Ursula (a.k.a. Satan) to become one, only to find out that she was somewhat duped by the Queen of the Ocean--who means to steal the prince she loves. Some good songs and decent animation, but it's not as good as people have made it out to be. My father loves this film and I had to sit through it dozens of times--that may explain my somewhat unenthusastic outlook upon it. I prefer ""The Lion King"" or ""Aladdin,"" to be frankly honest.**** / *****",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The life of a teenager,"A film I recently saw was the The Little Mermaid. The movie is about a rebels teenager name Ariel. Ariel's father is King Triton who is the king of the sea. She always wanted to be living on the surface, but she was a mermaid. Her father was against the idea of his daughter becoming a human and was told that she was not allowed to travel to the surface. Disobeying her father's rules, Ariel swims to the surface. When on the surface, she falls in love with Prince Eric, who is a human. An evil sea witch, Ursula, came to an agreement to trade what they both wanted but couldn't have. Ariel becomes a human, but not without many troubles in her way.Walt Disney was trying to show the audience, of all ages, a different way to look on life. The movie shows a young, verbally female looking for a better life then what she already has. Ariel represents any young teenager that wants to experience life but, can not because of restrictions. Walt Disney wanted to show adults but, also make it understandable for children how life is when you want to be apart of something and belong to it as well.As a reader, you are probably thinking on why I choose this movie. It showed many different stages of a young child's life. I liked how the movie showed Ariel as a 'wild child'. All kids of the age of sixteen want to disobey their parents. Ariel reminded me a lot of myself when I was a child. The crab, named Sebastian, was like Ariel's self concision, telling you what was right and wrong. This movie can teach many people a lesson no matter what age you are.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney Film; the Divergence from the Andersen's The Little Mermaid,"Hans Christian Andersen The Little Mermaid has invited people into an imaginary world, a sea world is more charming, enchanting, and fascinating than people could imagine. Andersen's tale has been loved by readers all over the world for years. Disney transformed the book into an animated film which is full of rich music. Both are a 'love story' between a pure little mermaid and a good looking warmhearted prince. However, the film departs from its book version in its characters in the nature of the conflict between goodness and evil, and their endings to reveal another world of creativity.The film approaches its supporting characters differently than the original. The film introduces more a dynamic sea witch called Ursula as another main character. While the sea witch plays only a minor in the book, Disney's Ursula uses Ariel, the little mermaid, as bait to catch her father in a plot for revenge. Moreover, the animated movie invents attractive supporting characters such as Sebastian, the crab who always enjoys giving advice, Flouder, who is a close friend of Ariel, and Scuttle, who is considered a clumsy expert in the world of human. In addition, Max and Grimsby are the faithful supporters of Eric, the prince whom Ariel saves from the wrecked ship and falls in love with. These charming characters help audience numbers to enjoy the film.Both versions also differ in the nature of the conflict between the main characters. While the book explores the conflict of the little mermaid with herself, the movie focuses on the conflict between goodness and evil to reveal the meaning of justice. In the film, Ursula represents evil, taking any cruel action to gain whatever she wants. She is portrayed as a half-human and half-octopus witch banished by Triton, like Satan was banished by God. Ursula seduces the little mermaid in a spell for her revenge and takes away her voice. She even disguises herself as a pretty lady to hold back Ariel's love. On the other hand, Eric, King Triton and Ariel's friends represent goodness. For example, Eric realizes Ariel was the one who rescued him and loves her with all his heart. So he fights against the sea witch to keep his pure love. In the case of Triton, he is willing to sacrifice his life for his headstrong daughter, showing an unconditional parents' love. In addition, Ariel's friends understand Ariel's pure love and help her. These symbols such as pure love, unconditional sacrifice and deep friendship are always supposed to win at the end and overcome any obstacle. Disney wants to give the audience of a valuable lesson.There is also a different ending story in the film. While the book has a sad ending, the film concludes its happy ending: ""They live happily ever after."" For instance, in the book, the little mermaid is willing to give her life up for her unrequited love and becomes foam in spite of her sibling's earnest request. Her love story is gloomy and melancholy. It gives the message to readers to adopt fate and not to defy it. On the other hand, the movie reveals a different vision at the end. The film works toward its happy ending, encouraging audience members to have courage and be willing to fulfill whatever they really desire instead of warning us not to dream about what we don't possess. In the long run, both versions have their own different visions of fate. One tells that fate is given; the other tells that fate is made by people themselves.The Disney film is willing to change the well-known fairy tale to conclude with a happy ending with its own point of view. In this respect, it is meaningful that the Disney film shows entertainment of changing the old-fashioned fairy tale into a new dynamic film filled with unforgettable music. Furthermore, the differences in characters, conflicts and endings in both versions explore that an imaginary world is always unlimited and changeable. Thus, when people read books or watch movies, if they give full play to their imagination instead of accepting the story itself literally, they can gain more abundant pleasure and enjoy their own exploration in the story. Now, it is time to spread a stretch of imagination and enjoy another fairy tale.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Wonderful Disney Animation, Very Colorful!","The Little Mermaid (1989)The Little Mermaid is again a perfect score for Disney. The film's setting under the sea had very colorful animation. The movie was interesting, funny, colorful, and all the much entertaining! I give it a 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Worthy of The 'Disney' Name,"NOTE: The following is the opinion of a very tired person at work.  He has a horrible head cold and has been 'doped up' on Nyquil for three days now. Please keep all of these things in mind while reading this review.I love Disney films.  I always have.  When I was a kid, my family used to go to every Disney film when it was released.  I was in awe of the animation and the songs. Even now as I watch the Disney Classics over & over & over again with my daughters, I still think they are some of the best movies ever made...even after watching them five times in one day, like my daughters like to do at times.But, sad to say, during the 1980's, Disney released some movies that I would not even try to call 'Classics'.  Movies like 'Fox & The Hound', 'The Black Couldron' and 'The Great Mouse Detective' had some redeeming moments, and I still feel are decent movies, but they lacked most of the things I expected from a Disney movie.Then there was 'Oliver & Company'.  To be totally honest with you, the only reason I even saw 'Oliver & Company' is because Billy Joel's voice was in it.  That's it!  I still enjoyed it, but did it deserve to wear the Disney name?  Not in my opinion.Along comes one of the greatest years of my life...1989. I'm a Senior in High School, a 'Batman' movie had been released earlier that Summer and I happened to be playing Orin Scrivello, the Dentist in the school musical 'Little Shop of Horrors'.We hear that Howard Ashman, the man who wrote the music for 'Little Shop of Horrors' wrote the songs for Disney's 'The Little Mermaid', so we decide to go see it for that reason alone.When I left the movie theater on a cold winter night in December 1989, I realized that the Disney that I grew up loving was back in a big way.  'The Little Mermaid' had everything I have grown to love about Disney films.  A princess, beautiful colors, singing and dancing animals and a really evil villain.  I loved it!'The Little Mermaid' is my favorite Disney film and ranked in my personal Top Ten of All-Time Movies.  It was the beginning of a bunch of Classic Disney films that are worthy of wearing the Disney name.FUN FACT: The song ""Part of Your World"" is very similar to the 'Little Shop of Horrors' song ""Somewhere That's Green"".  When you see 'The Little Mermaid' with most of the cast from 'Little Shop', you catch things like this.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Pure Genius!,"How can anyone not love this film? I don't think there is a girl/mum/woman/granny/sister/daughter out there who has not dreamt of being that feisty teenager who has nothing to loose, but her voice! The musical score that accompanies this film is pure genius and is performed to perfection. Now, I love most Disney films I have to admit, and I am not going to pretend that this is THE best but it's certainly one of them, up there with Beauty and The Beast and The Lion King, so anyone who says that this film is no good, has obviously not seen it! The despair that we see in Ariel's face as she watches her beloved Eric announce his engagement to Ursula (of all people) just shows why this film has stood the test of time, and I can guarantee that any child who likes Disney now, if shown The Little Mermaid, will go the swimming pool twice as often as before and start trying to swim like Ariel, or sing like Ariel, or dream of finding their very own Eric! I could sit here and compliment the animation, and the direction, and the voices, and the music of this film until I am blue in the face but I would still not account for the most important thing that gives this film that little extra........and that's the magic of Disney. The magic of make believe and wonder, and that feeling you get when you are a child of how anything can happen. You really get this feeling from The Little Mermaid, a feeling you don't get from other Disney films, like Bedknobs and Broomsticks, or (to some extent) Mary Poppins. Finally, I know I can vouch for all my family when I say that the ending, is masterfully done the way only Disney know how, there was not a dry eye in the house, honest! Now I am 15 years old and I am not a mother, and I don't have any little siblings, so I haven't seen this film in quite a while, but it has stuck with me for this long, and I am not ashamed to say this, but I can still sing along to all the songs, and I do sometimes, when I am alone and I feel happy - 'I Want To Be Where The People Are' suddenly pops in my head. So, don't underestimate the potential of this film, if you are looking for a little touch of magic, of childhood, look no further.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
i love it,"I have always loved fish, and underwater scenes ever since I saw The Little Mermaid. it Opens up a new world for kids and shows you what the ocean really contains and how the fish really act. The animation was very cool, too. i highly recommend this to anyone who likes the ocean or likes disney movies. The Little Mermaid was probably the best disney movie in my opinion, anyway. One of my favorite movies of all time.I loved this film! 10/10",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A classic!,"THE LITTLE MERMAID(1989)**** Voices of Jodi Benson, Chris Daniel Barnes, Pat Carroll, and Jason Marin.In this disney picture, a mermaid named Ariel(Jodi Benson) is interested in humans and goes to sunken ships and stuff to look for human belongings. One day, Ursula(Pat Carroll) gives Ariel an offer. Ariel could become a human in exchange for her voice.This is by far my favorite disney picture of all and almost my favorite picture of all time. I love everything about the little mermaid. The scenery is spectacular, and the actors are great, too. A mezmorizing picture that will still be enjoyed 20 years from now! Recommended to anyone from the ages of 1 to 100!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
