Statham  & Style Elevate The Action,"I still rate this pretty high even if the last 10 minutes got totally out of hand and went crazy, action-wise. By ""out-of-hand,"" I mainly refer to the usual excessive action and bad guys-keep-missing-good guys-even-from-short range-type mentality. Actually, a lot of the film is that but it's such a fun movie that I didn't care.Jason Statham is very cool in the lead and it's he that makes this a decent film. I also enjoyed Shu Qi, a very pretty woman; the witty dialog of Francois Berleand and some stylish, tongue-in-cheek directing by Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen. Another director whose films are known for their hip styles also co- wrote this: Luc Besson.Some of the action scenes are outrageous. To Statham's credit, he did most of the action scenes himself. I guess he's a tough guy in real life, too. He's pretty amazing.A no-brainer-but lots of fun movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Jason Statham action star.,"The Transporter (2002) was a fun action film that was directed by Jet Li's fight director Corey Yuen and it starred Jason Statham. Jason stars as Frank Martin. He's a hired gin who does driving jobs for a hefty fee. For his services he'll use his superb driving skills to get his paying customers out of a jam. He asks no questions and needs precise instruction in order to perfectly time his getaways. His number one rule is to never ask questions. One day he takes a gig from a sleazy and shady man named Betancourt (Matt Schulze). Instead of delivering the goods, he breaks his number one rule and peeks inside the package...A fun action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts. People have unfairly slammed this movie for being unrealistic. What do you expect? The action scenes are performed to flamboyant ans stylized you have to suspend belief. It's one of those movies that doesn't throw in realism all of a sudden to make the movie more interesting. Jason Statham is pretty cool as well as the Transporter and he seems legit, not another tough guy phony. HE looks like he can knock the tar out of you in a real fight. Co-stars Shu Qi (she learned to speak English phonetically for her role in this movie).Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A few bumps mar an otherwise decent outing in ""The Transporter""","There's no question that Luc Besson is one of Europe's biggest action producers. I mean with the cult classics ""La Femme Nikita"" (1991) and ""The Professional"" (1994) behind him, he's basically been given the green-light for every big action picture he comes across. One of his latest and most ambitious projects was ""The Transporter,"" released in 2002.I have to admit this is one flick I approached with a very open mind - very open. I mean, I like Jason Statham. I think he's a pretty cool guy and at first, even I questioned his casting as Frank Martin in ""The Transporter."" But the problem is, and I'm assuming this is the result of the quickly edited action scenes (which were toned down to make the film ""PG-13""), he's not being given the room to really be the best he can be.As the lead character, he's a transporter. He can get you, your associates or your property anywhere, anytime, on time, no questions asked. But you know what? Common sense tells us that it was curiosity that killed the cat, and the cat in this picture thankfully doesn't die some horrible death but instead, curiosity yields him a break - a beautiful woman named Lai (Shu Qi) - bound and gagged, and in the trunk of his BMW.It's not spoiling much that she and Frank get together and as a result, are forced to do battle with shady and vicious American businessman Wall Street (Matt Schulze) and his army of high-kicking, disposable assassins. There's a little more to the plot and Lai, and the circumstances surrounding her appearance in the trunk of Frank's car, and it involves some smuggling of poor Chinese immigrants from China to Europe, where much of the action takes place.Speaking of action and there's plenty of it, Statham does display some pretty impressive moves but the frantic editing just doesn't do him justice. He obviously worked out for this part and there are frequent moments when his ripped torso is on display. He also (barely) manages to shy away any possible accusations that he's just a British novelty to American audiences. Director Corey Yuen (whose work on Jet Li's 2001 action film ""Kiss of the Dragon"" I admired), is behind it and Besson's got a producer credit.The problem may not be Statham because I think he's a really cool actor with a raspy British accent, but the script is worth some deeper examination by more thoughtful minds. There are plenty of holes and unanswered questions (i.e., the extent of Frank's military training and experiences, Lai and how she wound up with Frank and her quarrelsome relationship with her father who is played by Ric Young, and the plot with the Chinese smuggling).But why am I making such complaints? ""The Transporter"" is an action movie; no plot required. Despite some bumps in the road, ""The Transporter"" is pure action fun from beginning to end, and I got my free ticket to see ""The Transporter 2"" on Friday.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A B-Movie for the MTV generation,"Back in the 1990s Luc Besson was a top action director in the US and France, best known for films like Leon and Nikita. In the early part of the 21st Century, he turned to producing and one of his major hits was The Transporter, the film that made Jason Statham into an action star.Frank Martin (Statham) is an ex-military man who turned into a driver for hire in the South of France. He lives by three rules: No.1 never change the deal, No.2 no names, No.3 never open the package. But on a job he opens the package to find a Chinese woman (Shu Qi) tied up and gag, resulting with him crossing an American gangster, Bettencourt (Matt Schulze) who wants Frank dead. Frank has to work with the woman, Lai, and a police detective, Inspector Tarconi (François Berléand), to bring down Bettencourt and his operator.The Transporter takes a basic B-Movie plot and story and gives it an MTV flash. The highlight of the film is action sequences which director Corey Yuen injected a load of fun elements with martial arts, gun battles, an axe fight and the famous oil fight scene. There are flashy moments like when a gun is in the air and the downwards camera on a gun when a machine gun magazine clip drops to the ground. There is some weak CGI but it is rare and the best parts of the action is the practical effects and stunt work. The real problem with the action is at times there was too much quick cutting which made some of the action sequence and it made them hard to follow: this was the particularly the case with the fight in the bus which was too tight, too close and overly edited. The best sequence for me was the highway chase because it was easier to tell what was happening and for the most part the fighting and gun fights were well done.The Transporter was Statham's first leading role outside of Guy Ritchie's films. He had the action chops with his physique and his martial arts ability and he was already showing his shy wit. But he gave his character a weak American accent which kept slipping. Likely Statham had enough charisma and was able to give Frank enough menace in his look. Statham also had very good chemistry with Qi who did have charm as Lai. The pair worked well and were surprisingly believable in the context of their world.The Transporter lacked a threaten villain: Schulze played his role more as a man who is partier then a ruthless crime lord who will kill anyone who crosses him. Schulze's performance also did not help giving the character smug, frat boy characteristics. The film also introduces a character called Leon who was able to beat up and knock out Frank, leading you to think that there is going to be a showdown between the characters: but it never comes about, which is very disappointing.Stanley Clarke gave The Transporter a more modern, techno score which was fitting for the most part, especially when it becomes pumping for the action sequences near the end. The score combined by the French setting reminded me a little bit of The Bourne Identity. But The Bourne Identity is a much more intelligentially stimulating film.The Transporter is a very paced actioner that does not rest. There are fine action sequences throughout the film and a decent start to The Stath's action persona: but this is a film for Statham fans.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
An excellent action movie!,"All action movies should strive to be this imaginative!  OK, the plot was not particularly intriguing, but what action movie's actually is?  But the plot was secondary to the action, it only served to make the bad guys bad and the good guys good.  The rest was up to Jason Statham's considerable fighting talents.There were some unbelievable yet jaw-dropping stunts, a terrific fight scene in oil, and some great car chase scenes.  There were no smarmy one-liners making light of good action sequences as is too often the case in American-directed action flicks.  The hero was cold, yet compassionate.  He didn't kill unnecessarily, but when he had to, he was ruthless.  There are many great action sequences, some so unbelievable you have to just shake your head and remember that action movies are not supposed to be based on reality.  There is even a great shot of the hero jumping off a speeding semi while it races over a bridge onto the back of a bus going perpendicular to the truck under the bridge!!  I mean, come on!  It would never happen, but I have to give credit to the stunt coordinator who imagined the possibilities.There is another hilarious scene where the hero chases down an airplane on foot, hijacks it, jumps out of the plane at great altitude in order to land on the back of a speeding transport with a conveniently located borrowed parachute!  I am glad all crop dusters carry such indispensable equipment and that it is so easy to land on the back of a truck speeding down the highway at 130 KM/hour.All in all, 90 minutes of sheer enjoyment.  Even with the predictable ending, I have to highly recommend this movie.  If you can suspend belief for a little while, you will be rewarded.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Die Hard IV  Do Not Think, and You Will Have an Enjoyable Action Movie","Nearby Nice, Frank Martin (Jason Statham) transports and delivers illegal cargoes. His business is supported by three basic rule: Rule no. 1  The deal is never to be changed; Rule No. 2  No names; and Rule No. 3  Never watch the cargo. The day he breaks his own rules, he realizes he is transporting a Chinese girl, Lai (Qi Shu), and he gets in many troubles due to his fault. This movie is pure action having all the usual clichés: car chasing, explosions, fights when nobody uses guns, the lead actor gets some kind of involvement with the victim etc. But the choreography is excellent and the action scenes are great.

All Quiet on the B-action Front,"A hard-boiled ex-soldier (Jason Statham) runs a private 'transporting' business in which he moves goods for clients from point A to point B, no questions asked, no packages opened and no names exchanged. One day, he breaks his own rule by opening the large bag he is transporting and finds a beautiful gagged woman (Qi Shu) in it.Jason Statham of Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels fame slips into the buff testosterone-fuelled action-hero role with almost effortless conviction and the perfection with which he delivers his cheesy lines deserves credit (""All right, that's enough juice for now.""). From the campy winks, the fast-paced drop-kicks and packing punches and just generally badass attitude, Statham clearly masters the B-action genre. He knows what he needs to do to entertain the audience, and he does it like he means business. Hardcore, in other words.However his ""American"" accent clearly deserves less credit. If you were BLOWN AWAY by Kevin Costner in Prince of Thieves or Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta, you will like his efforts. Ditto Qi Shu whose performance keeps us guessing (mostly about what the hell she is saying). In all fairness, I thought she was really cute as Lai  the woman who complicates things by popping up from the bag, but also viciously annoying with her little high-pitched girly screams and submissive approach. Thankfully, Statham and Shu's on-screen chemistry makes up for this and facilitates the whole plot on an important, fundamental level. Because they are so different (macho-man vs. girly girl), they somehow look great juxtaposed.This plot never strays from its template story. Ever. It's simple. It's straightforward. It's action-packed and amazingly fast-paced. Twenty minutes fly past like five. But enough praise, because ""The Transporter"" really isn't a good movie. Even if you're looking for cheap adrenaline kicks this would not be the first film I'd recommend (it's probably be Poseidon [2006], ha) -- this simply lacks 'oomph' and the good guys are too GOOD and the bad guys are too BAD. Nothing new -- next, please!6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not Very Good.,"Hi, I've just finished watching The Transporter.One question. Why would Jason Stathan sign up for this?

The best and worst of the action movie genre.,"The Transporter is directed by Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen and written by Luc Besson (who co-produces with Stephen Chasman) and Robert Mark Kamen. It stars Jason Statham, Shu Qi, Matt Schulze & François Berléand. Music is by Stanley Clarke and cinematography comes courtesy of Pierre Morel. Plot sees Statham as ex-soldier Frank Martin, a much respected courier in the underworld who is dynamite behind the wheel of a car and electric with his fists and feet. Living it up nice and cushy on the French Riviera, he lives by a set of rules that should not be broken, but during this particular ""transport"" job, he breaks his rules out of curiosity and gets embroiled in a fight for life.The Transporter made back double its production budget, enough of a financial swing to ensure that sequels would follow (two so far, with the first sequel easily the best of the three). With Stallone et al on the wane, and the likes of Diesel and The Rock yet to convince, The Transporter gave ex-model-turned actor-Statham the chance to flex his muscles and make a mark in the action genre. Which he did, with great physicality, deft of movement and rugged good looks. Which is just as well since all those around him are rather bad. He's helped enormously by the choreography of Yuen, who gives the fight scenes plenty of zest and originality to leave them memorable. The spirit of Hong Kong action movies reigns supreme in The Transporter, with the added bonus being that of Morel's pleasing photography. But strip away the action and there's nothing left, the plot is boorish and the dialogue just dreadful, worse still is Clarke's music score, where instead of adrenalin boosting urgency we get leaden comedy. Very poor, and indicative of the production. It seems that the makers had themselves a bunch of great action set pieces to begin with, and then built the film around them, without due care and attention.It does what is expected of it as an action piece of popcorn, but it's pretty shallow outside of that. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Jason Statham satisfies all your cool fighting needs,"Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a hired transporter willing to deliver anything with simple rules. Never change the deal. No names.

However on the way, he opened the package which turns out to be a Chinese girl.Written by Luc Besson, this has all the cool people who looks cool, and does cool fighting. And Jason Statham is great at this. From this point on, he becomes the go to guy for all your cool fighting needs. François Berléand does well as Inspector Tarconi and Qi Shu makes a good looking kidnap victim. However, it's not really about any acting. It's all about the action. And director Corey Yuen is an expert at the HK action style.My biggest problem is that people keep losing or not bringing their guns. So it's a lot of kung fu fighting when gunplay would make more sense. However sense has little to do with this. You must leave reason out of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Energetic, stylish and breezy action flick","I saw ""The Transporter"" with my brother and sister while holidaying in Scotland. I was expecting a formulaic and predictable film with bad acting and mechanic action, but what I got was the complete opposite. There may be some weak spots in the script, and Shu Qi doesn't always convince as the beautiful captive. But the film is beautifully filmed with lovely cinematography and gorgeous scenery, and has terrific action sequences that help the film go along at a fast pace. The story is a good one, and the soundtrack is energetic. With the exception of Shu Qi, the acting is not bad at all. Jason Statham has a cool charisma that does shine through, and Matt Schulze seems to be having a lot of fun as the lead bad guy. The direction is efficient enough, overall this is a fun action flick if a tad on the short side, helped enormously by a confident sense of style and the action. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

High-speed action from start to stop,"Jason Statham plays Frank Martin a man works as a professional transporter. That means delivering or driving anyone without asking questions.Statham is an unlikely action hero. From chased in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to boxing promoter in Snatch and now energetic action star challenging ""actors"" as Van Damme for the role as hard-kicking bad boy.And he does a fine job too. Statham has a lot of presence and a lot more acting talent than other action stars. He might not be a Kevin Spacey but he can definitely get into character. Even if it happens to be the generic ""ex-special forces"" unwilling hero that just happens to be good at just about everything, except giving up that is.French action movies are plenty in numbers now a days. This movie isn't bringing life into a stagnating movie industry. If anything this movie is contributing to it. This is, pretty much, a standard generic template. Some cool action stunts, fight scenes, car chase and some, but not much, snappy dialog.In the end The Transporter is nothing more and nothing less than a good action flick. With Jason Statham as the main contributor that is.This is also another one, albeit rather early, movie that carries the ""Luc Besson Label"". He was indeed involved as a writer and producer his name even puts director Louis Leterrier on the side. A director who, as a note, got to direct The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton. That these movies, with Bessons involvement, act as a springboard for directors and upcoming action stars is likely but also sets the standard for movies to come.Still, Transporter was one of the earlier action movies, not groundbreaking or anything but very well worth viewing and by all likelihood even enjoying.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The melee fight choreography was pretty well done for early 2000s, and the race sequence was also decent , in the typical 2000s style.Acting aint great but you dont expect great acting in such movie. Saying that, the acting is not bad either. It's fine. Script is pretty plain, but they did manage to deliver few good jokes. Maybe the reason is that it's not exactly hollywood production, idk, but it was funny at times.The missile VFX were probably the worst thing about the movie, but that's just one scene so it;s fine.Actually, the only real bad thing was the sound. While we do have decent and very prominent surround sound, the movie do lacks of bass , or more precise - during explosions and shootings. We do have bass in the quite nice soundtracks they have in the movie, but explosions were very lacking.Overall, not a bad action movie, good for chill time.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good watch,"Just saw this one today. It was interesting, the script was intelligent and the idea is unique. For a 12yr old movie, i guess it met its standards well. Except since i watched it in 2014, i found many loose ends to it. The most obvious were the fighting sequences, the acts were poorly choreographed and designed. I could see the non-reality element in them. Even otherwise, keep aside the lack of reality the stunts were also weak n laid back. Otherwise, the movie is quite enjoyable. The story flows smoothly. I loved the work of Jason Stathom and the actress Qi , both made a good duo. I hope the sequels r better, i plan to see them sometime very soon.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
""" I make it a practice to keep my promises.  It's one of my rules! ""","This action packed story is written by Luc Besson and directed by Louis Leterrier and is exactly as Besson envisioned it. Jason Statham plays an ex-Special Forces soldier named Frank Martin. Living quietly in a secluded, and isolated house on the Mediterran. Frank was hoping he could retire without conflict. Unfortunately, his unusual private practice of hiring out as a special delivery man, puts that dream in jeopardy. The Movie is called "" The Transporter "" and relates Frank's story of being able to deliver anything from point one to point two, providing his simple rules concerning his employment and his safety are not violated. Such is the tale until a man code name "" Wall Street "" (Matt Schulze) requires Frank to deliver a certain 'special' package (Qi Shu) without question. His personal rules violated, Frank becomes involved in more that just a delivery. When the heavies decide to reciprocate with violence, Frank is introduced to Inspector Tarconi (François Berléand) who believes that Frank is certainly a 'Person of Interest.' The rest of the movie becomes a fun filled adventure of high flying street chases, explosions and physical action involving Martial arts of the best kind. The result becomes the basis or foundation for future films in like manner or a series as I certainly would be interested in seeing more. Jason Statham is certainly the right actor for this movie, one that you certainly want to see more of. Excellent film and readily recommended. ****",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good action film,"In defense of 'Transporter' i will say this. It wasn't Michael Bay, and at least in this first film (haven't seen the others), it used real stunts and not a lot of CGI stunts. I miss the old days when a stunt or an explosion was done for real and not just done with CGI (even when it's state of the art you can always tell it's CGI). It was to the 'Transporter's' credit that they actually staged pretty much all the stunts unlike 'Transformers' which had a lot of the action inter-spliced with CGI effects.I didn't think the plot was so bad or nonexistent, it was just kind of simple. But it had a good message about not treating human beings like slaves or commodities. It was solidly directed if not a little too ""busy"", and the actors were likable and sexy and, let's face it, Jason Statham is outrageous to watch in action. A sort of European Bruce Lee.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Imperfect but Worth Watching,A very imperfect movie that is the perfect vehicle to showcase Jason Statham's talents as an action star and leading man. A transporter breaks his code to never look in the package and it changes his life. The film is low budget. The music is horrible and dated. Statham is closed to the vest. He is cool and dangerous. He has a sharp wit and a big heart under the rough exterior. This is a lot of fun and basically launched Statham's action career and a series of these movies. The movie is filled with some interesting characters. Statham's fighting is great but the fight choreography leaves a lot to be desired.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Transporter delivers!,"Frank Martin, provides the platinum standard among couriers: he will deliver any package, any where to any one, on time, no questions asked. Understandably,  his rates are a bit steeper than FedEx and his rules a bit more stringent. When he agrees to deliver a duffel bag Frank breaks Martin rule # 3  never look in  the package  only to discover that the contents are alive, kicking and beautiful.  What's a guy to do ?  Throw her back in the bag and complete the contract of course! Unfortunately Frank's employer is unhappy the indiscretion and his idea of a customer service complaint is to eliminate the server.The opening frantic car chase through the streets and along the boardwalks of Nice, sets the tone for the for the rest of the movie  infused with equal parts action and humor you quickly realize  that this is not a film that  takes itself seriously.  Co-written and produced by  Luc Besson (The Professional and The Fifth Element) it follows in the vein of his earlier films:  reluctant protagonist who bends the rules to do his job, shows a little humanity inadvertently becoming a champion for the oppressed, and having to dodge bullets, bombs and badmen along the way. .   The lead captures this spirit.Jason Statham's Frank is a no nonsense ex-special services minutia obsessed professional who refuses to be rattled even as the world is coming down around him (literally in one scene). Statham, best known as the fast talking Turkish in Snatch, possesses both the bulk and matter of fact glib finesse necessary to be an action hero.  The intricately choreographed and numerous marital arts sequences  - the best I've seen in a non Asian film  bear the trademarks of its Hong Kong predecessors and confirm that he also possesses the requisite physicality to carry a film in this genre. Statham may well turn out to be the next Bruce Willis (or at least his British counterpart.)There are several glaring problems with this film: the people smuggling subplot seems to have been an afterthought,  the dialogue is often unintentionally laughable, and then there are those pesky laws of physics  But none of that matters - I wanted high octane fun and pyrotechnics, and I wasn't disappointed..

"Lots of action, no grace, no class","In Jason Statham's first starring role he plays Frank Martin, an ex-something or other who now lives in the sunny French Riviera delivering packages for shady gentlemen. He likes the quiet life and has imposed a set of rules upon his underhanded deals to maintain the tranquility.His latest package contains Lai, an Asian lady who can only speak in broken, phonetic English. For whatever reason he opens the package and throws his work ethic into turmoil. A million bad guys with a bad aim come after him but he always manages to come out on top despite the fight scenes being a blur.The plot is nonsense. The only thing worth watching (or so I used to think) are the fight scenes, but they are so poorly edited (as is the whole film) that you never feel the impact or the excitement.The Transporter is good enough if you want to switch your brain off and veg over some tame action against a scenic backdrop.

"Nothing special, but still entertaining.","The Transporter movies all share the same basic elements. Fantastic action scenes, barely-there stories, and Jason Statham. In the original Transporter, we're introduced to Frank, Statham's character, and the absolute bare minimum of his background. The rest of the movie is car chases, explosions, and fights.I won't go into the plot, because it's pretty much only here to give Statham a pretext to hand out his butt-kickings. My favorite thing about these movies is that Statham is never really in danger of dying or being beaten. If he's fighting someone, they MAY get in a hit or two before puts them down. Even if it's like, 20 guys with machine guns, and all he has for a weapon is his shirt. The fight scenes are pretty cool, you can always rely on this series to add a few new wrinkles to the standard old sequences.There's some kind of smuggling going on that Qi Shu's dad is involved in, and Matt Shulze is somehow involved in it too. And François Berléand plays some kind of cop who is also Jason's friend, or something. Qi is the eye candy/damsel in distress/love interest, Francois helps move the plot along, and the rest of the cast are bad guys. That's pretty much it. Seriously.Don't watch The Transporter if you're looking for a well-written script or some compelling character development. Pop it in when you want to see some bad guys get the crap kicked out of them, pretty explosions, and a pretty girl.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not always logical, but a lot of fun!","Frank is precise. Frank is prompt. Frank is dedicated. Frank is a one of a kind transporter - for 'special' deliveries.And Jason Statham is good as Frank Martin. At least here, one can't accuse him of being type cast (because in all his films to follow he would portray similar characters, making me question his acting ability). He is agile, fit, has great martial arts skills, and a really great physique. Fortunately, the film finds quite a few excuses to show off his muscular body, and I'm not complaining!Back to the film. Frank Martin has rules as a transporter, but when he breaks his own rules just once, all hell breaks loose when he gets in way over his head. Frank takes revenge on a corrupt group of people out to kill him, but this ex marine has a few surprises up his sleeve as he outwits and outfights the gang. There's lots of action, and lots of humor - mostly dry humor thanks to Statham. And there's plenty of close-ups on his body....Erm, yes, the movie! The film features a nice soundtrack, and some great action sequences. It's not always logical or believable, but it certainly is a hell of a lot of fun. The cliched romance interest is present, as well, but it actually was enjoyable this time around. Shu Qi was rather cute as 'the package'.

Top notch Statham action...,"The 2002 movie ""The Transporter"", from directors Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen, is a movie I have watched several times over the years since it was initially released.I have to say that the movie proves just as entertaining with each viewing as the very first time I watched it. And that is a great testament to the writing skills of Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. But then again, Luc Besson has always been known to write amazing scripts for his movies. And ""The Transporter"" from 2002 is one such movie.Not only is the movie blessed with a great storyline, but it most certainly also has a great amount of action that really works wonderfully in favor of the movie. From the high speed car chases to the fight sequences and everything in between. It is nicely choreographed, executed and filmed, which makes ""The Transporter"" a very dynamic and adrenaline-filled movie to sit through. And that is one of the things that makes the movie so watchable.Then there is the cast ensemble in the movie. Jason Statham certain carries the movie quite well, and you know what you get when you sit down to watch a Jason Statham action movie. And boy does he deliver. But not only is Jason Statham the one to carry the movie, because the talented Shu Qi is so nicely cast to act opposite of Statham, and she really steps up to the task with skill and excellence. She certainly also makes the movie quite enjoyable to sit through, and she also brings a sense of humor opposite of Statham's serious role. François Berléand and Matt Schulze were also nice additions to the movie.If you enjoy action movies, and if you enjoy Jason Statham action movies, then ""The Transporter"" is definitely a movie that you cannot let slip past your screen. The movie is through and through a great action thriller, with emphasis on action.

Hamlet it ain't but of its - very limited kind - better than many,"Films such as Transporter (and, I should imagine, Transporter 2 and Transporter 3 unless there has been a dramatic change of heart by their producers) highlight one of the dilemmas of IMDBs user ratings system. All the films I come across here have, without exception, been given the 8/10 and 9/10 ratings which only the truly devoted award. And each of of those films has also earned the very pitiful 1/10 and 2/10 ratings.On the one hand, praise such as 'awesome, dude, truly awesome' and 'real genius, dude, this is the real sh*t' are bandied about like beer at a truckers convention, on the other those same films get also '90 minutes out of my life I'll NEVER get back!!!', 'this SUCKED big time, man!!!' and 'this would get 0/10 if the system allowed it' from other, less enchanted viewers. All that is only to be expected and - cliché alert - wouldn't the world be a duller place if we all thought the same. But what do you do when you see a well-made, entertaining piece of complete schlock which stands head and shoulders about its peer films and then a well-made, very moving and thoughtful film which is unlike the schlock as cheese is to chalk? In all honesty there can be no comparison, yet both deserve a high rating.Of its kind, Transporter does stand out. But it does so without characterisations and plot entirely. What vague storyline there is simply the help the hero, in this case Jason Statham, roar from one fight to the next. In in Transporter's case it works. Why, I have no idea. Certainly, the producers hired good talent, not least Luc Besson who has latterly made this kind of film his stock in trade. A great deal about this film boasts 'class', except, it has to be said, the film itself. But the point is it doesn't matter. You don't go to your neighbourhood hamburger joint and expect haut cuisine and you would be thought of as dim-witted if you then criticised the joint for not reaching haut cuisine standards.So those who like this kind of thing, the Transporter movie will get their money's worth and then some. And it would be futile, not to say ineffably silly, to criticise Transporter for being utterly and ludicrously over the top. Because, of course, it is meant to be utterly and ludicrously over the top. It succeeds and stands out for several reasons. One is Jason Statham, the Transporter. I like Jason. I have now seen him in three films and I'm on his side. If Jason gets through his day job by not taking it seriously, he doesn't show it. But nor does he give the impression of believing himself to be 'an artist'. He has a certain quality about him which, if not unique, is rare. He knows what he can do and, presumably, what he can't do, and doesn't pretend. With Jason you feel what you see is what you get. And I like that. I could, of course, be completely wrong, but somehow I don't think so, and it is that certain honesty which comes across on camera and helps to raise what is at heart pretty mediocre material rather higher. Jason gives value for money. If Jason flipped hamburgers, you could be pretty sure they would be stand-out, top-dollar hamburgers. And it is that quality which carries the film as far as I am concerned.In another's hands the role he takes would go bear-shaped quite soon (although that is not to say there aren't other men about with the same quality as Jason. There are other 'hard men' out their - Vin Diesel and Steven Seagal, although I haven't seen a film by either - but I doubt whether any of the others would carry it off as Jason does. So there you have it: Transporter is not The Merchant Of Venice, On Golden Pond, ET, Schindler's List, The Godfather or any of the other films which get consistently good ratings. It is just another macho piece of b******s. The important difference is that, of its kind, it is rather more impressive (in that way rather like anther Luc Besson scripted film, District 13). Hence my high rating.",,Anonymous,Crime

Fast action and paper thin characters...,"There are certain action movie premises that never go away despite the fact that they always produce movies that are clones of countless unimpressive action movies that came before. The kidnapped child, the raped and murdered wife, the otherwise wronged family, or in this case, the crusade against corrupt businessmen, smugglers, drug dealers, etc. Take your pick, they generally all turn out about the same, don't they?Jason Statham is inarguably today's fastest rising action star. He blasted onto the scene with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (a smashing action movie despite what I can't get over thinking is just the goofiest title) and soon followed it up with other action movies like Crank and Snatch which are absolutely overflowing with awesomeness.The Transporter movies are great vehicles for Statham, although this one was hardly an impressive first outing. It starts out great, with four guys scrambling madly out of a bank they've just robbed and jumping into his car, where he calmly sits motionless and informs them that there are four of them but the deal was three and then proceeds to list off all the reasons why four guys just won't do, including that it throws off the weight calibration of his suspension and will exceed the amount of gas that he has allotted for this particular delivery.The situation is, ah, resolved, and he puts the pedal down and leads the French police on an exaggerated high speed chase through the streets and alleyways of Marseilles that is so overblown that it promises to become one of those movies like Wanted or Shoot 'Em Up that are soaked in every excess imaginable but are nevertheless tons of fun.And for a lot of the movie that's what we get, but unfortunately its also populated with paper thin characters and cartoonish villains involved in a preposterous human smuggling plot.But I'm getting ahead of myself. Statham is, as the title informs us, a Transporter by trade. He makes his living by delivering things without asking questions and commands a conspicuously massive salary. The shadiness of his clients is to be expected, hence his insistence on never giving his or learning their names. He has three rules about his services  I forget the order, but they involve never changing the deal in any way once an agreement has been made (hence the tense confusion at the beginning of the movie), never giving names, and never looking in the package being delivered.When you're dealing with the kind of people that he deals with, it's generally best not to really know much about what's really going on. Especially when you have a friendly but attentive police detective making occasional house calls to your beautiful beach house and wondering about things like getaways being made in cars exactly like yours and when that last car later gets found blown to pieces with two police officers in the trunk. If nothing else, the French seem pretty generous with the benefit of the doubt!But despite this string of good luck, he breaks one of his own rules on his latest delivery, accidentally buying an Orangina for the contents of his package and then letting her go off into the woods to pee. We never learn much about why he was asked to deliver this stunningly sexy Chinese girl in the first place, but it soon becomes clear that her family is involved in a massive smuggling operation involving smuggling bedraggled Chinese people out of China. Incidentally, I watched the movie last night in China with a bunch of my Chinese friends. They were not amused.The rest of the movie, unfortunately, is an exercise in Action Movie-making 101. It's flooded with action clichés and predictability, which is disappointing even though there wasn't really a time in the first half of the movie where it promised to be anything different.But the bigger problem than the clichés and the predictability are the sheer lack of thought put into the script and the senselessness of the entire premise itself. You see, the Chinese girl's father is currently smuggling ""400 people in a container"" through Marseilles. Is this for real? 400 people in a container the size of a semi trailer? Shipping through Marseilles? I had been under the impression that a container traveling from Hong Kong to, say, America takes something like 4-6 weeks. But to travel ""through"" Marseilles on its way to somewhere else? Such a trip would take months and I'm just going to go ahead and guess that roughly 0% of the cargo would make it through alive. I don't know much about the logistics of human smuggling, but I'm guessing that such a percentage would do some damage to your profit margins.But no matter. The evil criminal scheme behind the action is beside the point, it's little more than a catalyst to differentiate between the good guys and the bad guys and give them something to fight over. Jason Statham is cool as hell in the movie, but his costar may be a good Chinese actress (she's much more famous here than she is in America, so's you know), but she just can't act in English. She reminded me of the horrendous performance by the heroine in First Blood Part II.At the time of this writing I've seen half of The Transporter II, which immediately comes off as a much better movie than the original, which places it in the diminutive category of sequels that surpass their original movies. Statham fans and hardcore action fans may get a kick out of The Transporter, but behind the high class action gloss and Statham's star power it's a b-movie at heart.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Gloriously ridiculous,"The Transporter is peak early 2000s filmmaking and one of the strongest Jason Statham star vehicles.

It's smart but in a dumb fashion.Jason Statham's titular Transporter doesn't have a lot of depth and yet it's more than enough for the Stath to work with. He's still effortlessly cool, physically competent and as always, he's in complete control of his persona. He's supported by Shu Qi and François Berléand who both have an endearing chemistry with Statham in their own ways.Corey Yeun's direction starts as it means to go on with a thrilling car chase that has all the necessary speed and carnage.

No one even believed that ""The Terminator"" would cram itself into American culture so willingly. If you have noticed, or whether you have not, most excellent ""surprise hit"" action films are the humble type, or low budget action flicks that suddenly become box office hits, then spawn sequels that sometimes are as good, but most of the time are not.And then there are the films that try to be ""the next big hit,"" and do not become a hit at all. ""The Transporter"" is a good example of this. The film obviously wanted to become the next ""Die Hard,"" but it was not. It turned out to be a disappointing action ride filled with all testosterone and no brains. And unlike ""xXx,"" ""The Transporter"" was not even dumb fun. It was no fun.Frank is your average military hero-turned-criminal. His job involves a Mercedes, a set of rules, and transporting criminals or packages from place to place. This all changes when Frank disobeys his own rules and becomes involved with the package he is transporting - a Chinese woman named Li, or Liu, or something like that. Anyway, the average plot involves Frank getting romantically involved and taking on the baddies.When the movie first started I thought ""Wow, this is great!"" But soon, after the nice car chase, the film goes downhill and never gains enough momentum to climb back up the hill. The ending is definitely adrenaline-pumped, but not really fun, or smart.

The Transporter films are know for their OTT action, and this definitely lives up to its reputation. The opening car chase is awesome, the house fight scene is excellently done, and it's accentuates by some interesting music. The house attack is explosive and cool, and the rocks figh and bus/warehouse fight are legit. The warehouse fight is just insane. Statham fighting dudes in a Jackie Chan style before sliding around in an oil-covered room while fighting. The final action scene on the truck is legit. Great way to end the move.One of Luc Besson's best films, and one of Statham's best too. Please watch it now. This movie goes hard.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Transport me out of here,"NO SPOILERS BECAUSE YOU SHOULD NOT SEE THISCaught this on cable recently, and I have to say avoid it all costs.  I think it is probably one of the worst films I have seen in quite sometime, though I am guessing Transporter 2 might surpass that.Lots of rapid-fire editing (think Robert Rodriguez on PCP) cannot cover up how lame and ridiculous the car chases---he is THE Transporter after all---are.  The actual fight scenes, as mentioned by other reviewers, are also hilariously bad as well.Even worse, though, is the story, or lack of one.  As likeable as Statham is in Guy Ritchie films, he is given nothing but horrible dialogue and no plot to work with here.  This should not be surprising, considering Luc Besson wrote and produced this.  Watch The Fifth Element sometime and try to figure out just what the story was there.All in all, an utter waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Vin Diesel can kiss my ass  this film is weak but at least it is FUN to watch,"Frank Martin is a transporter  a man who drives and delivers on behalf of criminals.  On one job he opens his `package' to find a young woman, Lai Kwai.  Despite this he completes the job and picks up another package from his customer, Wall Street.  On a break from driving his `package' then explodes.  He returns to his client and steals a car, unwittingly taking the girl with him.  Martin then finds himself the target of this gang and is put in a position where he must do the right thing.I'm not really a big action fan and the last few things I watched were disappointing, not living up to the hype.  XXX was a major let down for me. However the Transporter seemed to offer low-key action without a big Hollywood marketing campaign behind it.  First of all let me deal with the plot  it is nonsense from start to finish!  The film sets up Martin as a real pro in the exciting opening scene  but then expects us to accept that he opens the package and lets the girl escape scenes later, it just doesn't wash for me.  The rest of the plot sort of falls into place heavily and, when it needs to explain things, feels very slow and ponderous  it's better if you don't think about it.Despite the weak plot the film is very enjoyable simply because of the great action scenes.  They are a mix of well choreographed fights and OTT action. The OTT action is a little much but is enjoyable none the less (and doesn't look that OTT beside the excesses of XXX).  The fight scenes are very cool and Statham is very physical, doing some very cool moves.  It's these martial arts scenes that really make the film.  The soundtrack is pumping hip-hop.  It isn't great music but the pumping nature of the music fits well with the onscreen action most of the time.Statham is really good and is much tougher than Vin Diesel was.  Physically he is very impressive and he can really move when he wants to.  His cool, professional look is really good and had me hooked from the first scene.  Qi Shu is OK in the support and is quite playful, while Schulze is a standard bad guy.Overall this is the perfect film for a Saturday night.  It isn't great, the plot is weak and the ending is a little bit of an anti-climax with it's happy sunny ending, but the action is good and, more than some over hyped films, it is actually FUN to watch it  just don't expect all the bits to be good.",,Anonymous,Crime
a fairly good action film IF you turn your brain off,"Jason Statham is Frank Martin, an ex-Special Forces operator who is now a transporter who has his own set of rules that he strictly abides by until he breaks them and opens a ""package"" he's transporting that contains Qi Shu. This film is entertaining enough, if wholly unbelievable. You'll enjoy it if you turn off your brain and just roll with the action. Personally I expect more from Writer Luc Besson, but then again since 1995 he's only made fun and entertaining but not great films (with the two obvious exceptions of the original ""Taxi"" and ""Danny the Dog"" which were almost as superb as his pre-1995 movies)My Grade: C+DVD Extras: Both widescreen & Fullscreen editions of the film; Commentary by actor Jason Statham and producer Steve Chasma; a 12 minute Making Of featurette; 3 Extended / Uncut Fight Sequence with optional commentary; and Theatrical Trailer",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Frank Martin,"it's just quite refreshing to see an action movie like this one where the main character it's cold, determined and bad ass. Cool during any trouble and never giving up , even when he is fighting 10 guys with nothing more than bicycle's pedals and motor oil, or having to kiss a guy underwater to breathe...Perhaps it's a little cliché in the argument but yet again it's balanced with the action scenes, special effects and the plot which it's never lost or has weird unexplained questions, at least for the first view, also the choice of car goes well with him , i mean , i wish i could drive that way¡¡¡",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great action; where's the story?,"Everyone involved with this film has gone above and beyond their minimal duties in crafting an action film, save one; sadly, he is the lynch-pin of the entire production.First, the good: Jason Statham is in serious competition with Vin Diesel as THE cool action hero of the post-Arnold age.  He has incredible screen presence, he can handle the action, and he can actually act.  He also has a great regular-guy feel to him that reminds one of Bruce Willis when ""Die Hard"" hit the screens.  Director Corey Yuen does a terrific job of creating a western approach to the Hong Kong action film; the action sequences are uniformly exciting and interesting, even when they're being thoroughly ridiculous, a hallmark of Hong Kong cinema.  The supporting cast all do their jobs admirably, namely making the hero look good.So the problem?  Luc Besson.  Is it just me, or has this man been coasting on the goodwill created by ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""Leon"" for too long now? He seems to have no clue how to construct a story, or convincingly develop characters.  There is so much left unexplained, unexplored and undeveloped at the end of this film that the plot is reduced to a meaningless excuse for action sequences.  When the action is this good, that may be somewhat forgivable, but I still fail to understand why a few rewrites were not in order.  It's one of those scripts in which the hard-bitten hero has a change of heart just in time to save everyone, not because he's learned a valuable lesson, but because it's time to do so.  The girl he finds in the trunk of his car is the hinge on which the entire story swings, but it's never fully explained why she was in there.I give an 8 to the director and cast contributions, and a lowly 4 to Besson for his lazy screenplay, leveling the film out at a 6.  See it if you like great action, but don't expect to be told a story of any worth.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great film!,The Transporter is an excellent film in My opinion. Jason Statham is excellent in this film! He performed very well. He is a good actor and he has a tremendous physique.

Don't hurt yourself by seeing this!!!,"What was Statham thinking??  I was excited to see this film, as I liked him in ""Snatch"", and ""Two Smoking Barrels"".  However, this was full of such implausibility's the action was overshadowed by the idiotic scenarios. Take a cookie cutter plot (rescue girl, fall in love, help her save lives) was very poorly implemented.There were good things in the movie.  The fight scenes were very good and original.  If you can ignore the fact that one car follows him and he gets attacked by at least 10 people, you will love this movie.  If you can also ignore the fact that the police chief hints at Martin's (Statham) illegal activities, but does not develop it, but will put his life and job on the line to assist him for no substantial reason.  If you can ignore the fact that in the opening minutes, Martin is stopped right next to some police officers who see him in his car and then he goes through a very elaborate car chase scene, but still no one can identify him.  If you can ignore the fact that he breaks his rules of opening the package for no good reason, but rescues the girl, and she is a subservient non-entity, who uses sex (""What we did last night was real"") for her own reasons.    If you can ignore all those things, then go see this movie fast, or wait until it goes to video (where it should have started).",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Didn't age well. Avoid.,"I wanted to like this one, being as I am a sucker for Statham movies. But no. Inane dialog, wooden acting, and absurd (and bizarrely choreographed) action just spoil the fun. This feels like an action movie from the 80ies, there is no rhyme or reason to the nonsense in this flick, even by the very modest standards of its genre. I can't believe this absurd flick started a little franchise, although its sequels are a little better, which isn't saying much (it helps that the female leads in them are much hotter in this reviewer's opinion). Even the romantic interest doesn't spice it up, (tiny spoiler) he should simply not have looked in the bag. Not worth it.",,Anonymous,Crime
Skeleton of Quality,"This movie had a lot of the right elements, especially the action.  For some reason though, it never really clicked.The background music is bland, and most of the acting is lacking emotion - leaving the viewer very detached.  The chemistry between the actors also seemed forced, with the possible exception of the cop and the transporter. You can't really blame all of them; the Chinese father/daughter spoke broken English like you would expect from a Jet Li movie.The strong points were the action, but many of these scenes were overdrawn and too controlled (you'll know what I mean from the final battle in the container yard).The plot was very thin, but it took so long to materialize that you might not realize it.

A revving start for an a Nascar-like action career,"Probably the first movie with Jason Statham that I saw deliberately. Of course he had pretty iconic roles before this, although they didn't bring out the legendary masculinity that is praised all over the world.Luc Besson has created the image of a somewhat ideal man: a confident guy capable of doing almost everything, wearing neat stylish suits and driving fast gorgeous cars. Almost James Bond on a secret mission to deliver whatever you desire. The set of rules professed by the Transporter gives a certain charm as operating within boundaries requires a quick wit and ingenuity, plus it always looks badass when you break the rules with righteous intentions.The movie is a perfect example of a well balanced action flick that incorporates an interesting story with incredible choreography of fights and smart scene planning. In my opinion this film is an official breakthrough for Jason Statham and a solid beginning of a franchise that makes all men produce buckets of testosterone and forces women to open windows to reduce a sudden temperature spike in the room.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Leon on hot, smoking wheels","Somebody's comment included ""action-by-numbers"" well that must mean it has been accurately made to the correct formula. This movie takes all the clichés and standard elements of modern action movies and adds a twist of just possible reality. With the expected plot turns and the main character's charming bit-of-rough standard action hero script, it could easily be merely one of hundreds but the skill with which the recipe is followed produces an outstanding piece which succeeds without too many flashing lights and impossible supernatural feats.Yes it is unlikely that such a man exists but it is well within the realms of possibility and he is never meant to be perfect, just plausible. It has Luc Besson stamped all over it but is different enough from his more renowned work to enjoy and the user ratings show that female voters in all but one age group rated it, on average, more highly than did their male counterparts; so it seemingly caters to an audience different than most would assume and that is probably due to Jason Statham's style.On an entirely personal level: I think Statham's acting is superior to that of many over-hyped, over-paid Hollywood stars, he has the journeyman's trait of doing a good job without overstating his own importance and is often under-rated. It is good to see him in a leading role. Of course I have no idea if he really is a nice bloke, let's just hope so.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Statham begins,"So this is the breakout movie for Jason Statham and the first movie where he plays as the lead role. I didn't much think of this actor when this film first debuted. But he really built himself up to be one of the most well known action stars out there. I remember watching this movie as a kid and thought it was alright, maybe because I was a big Jet Li fan back then. Sure this film can be slightly corny in today's standards and the chase and action sequences are ridiculous. But a movie like this shouldn't be taken seriously. And it seems to get even more ridiculous and even more over the top with each installment. So the plot is about this guy named Frank Martin who is a Ex-Special Forces Operator and topnotch driver that transports people or objects from one destination to another for a fee. Even if the task is dangerous, so in a way he is a getaway driver. He has three rules. Rule One: Never change the deal. Rule Two: No names--Frank doesn't want to know whom he's working for, or what he's transporting. Rule Three: never look in the package. The last two rules puts him at a disadvantage in my opinion, especially since he works for dangerous guys. From the dialogue to the anti-hero to bad guys interactions is very cliché, but it's one of those action movies that because of the simple and yet fun action sequences. Even if the characters directions and decisions doesn't make much sense either. Mainly because it doesn't try to be more than what it is, while it having effort and well choreographed sequences in it mixed in with humor. This is a cool (although a bit corny now) and stylish action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. So overall, this movie despite the mediocre character development and story it connects well enough with the cool action sequences to make it worth a rental and made it worth a watch in the theaters when it came out.7.1/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Impossible and Lame  Superstunt Re-Write of a Classic,"I had a hard time sitting through this masterpiece of modern impossible action untertainment and wasn't the least entertained.Others have made enough comments on the impossible stunts, so I'll spare details.When a movie goes overboard it becomes unbelievable - this one breaks that line big time. Even some Schwarzenegger flicks and the impossibly surreal ""Chronicles of Riddick"" worked better than this one!Conceptually the whole thing is similar to a 1977 (TV movie?) ""The 3,000 Mile Chase"", which is also listed here at IMDb. Except that I found that original courier chase story far more enjoyable.In today's video game culture something is missing - a good reality check!Hollywood has always managed to do the impossible, but things have gone too far out of reach for a real human being with even half a brain and a little basic physics education to imagine being part of the story. Never mind ""character development"" - bland or psychotic, I see people every day that make movie characters seem real by comparison, ""developed"" or not :)But for the entire action thing going here: Thumbs down!I think modern directors and writers need to watch some of the classic flicks like Burt Lancaster's ""The Crimson Pirate"" to understand what really good stunt and action work is all about - make it real with and for real people and forget computer animation!",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Instead I've got a poorly thrown together clichés and scenes with absolutely no point. The lead female character barely speaks English (they TRY to explain this fact in the movie), and needs to spend much more time in acting school. That probably goes for at least half of the actors in the film. The soundtrack is horrific. The music in and of itself is great, however it seems as in the sounds somehow were mixed up and the wrong music was played at the wrong scene. There are times where techno is playing during a slow scene, and a nice slow song plays during an action sequence. The dialogue is forced, the story is cliché, and nothing whatsoever stands out from this movie to write about. The only decent scene was the car chase at the beginning of the movie and the fight scene between Jason and the many villains in the warehouse. It did manage to show off Jason's potential as an action hero, as well as had some creative fighting moves. However, this movie has nothing to offer.

He's a relaxed and easy to watch action hero, and as long as he's engaged in kicking butt he easily carries the film, but he doesn't have the charm of, say, a Jackie Chan, and he doesn't do as well with the scenes where he's actually required to speak.

The Transporter had 'Macho Duck' written all over it from the opening scene and I'm afraid that was enough for me....yet another example of modern movie maggot husbandry where 'action' and ""Look at me...look what I can do!"" (like some little brat sat in an amusement arcade racing car/fighter jet) is all that matters. Dennis Weaver in ""Duel"" never felt the need to wave around his ketchup coloured Plymouth Valiant like an extension of his penis...so it became a 'cult movie'...a very good one at that. It also had the decency to let you sit down before the action began...what is it with movie makers today thinking that you've got to start a bloody film before the credits are through??",,Anonymous,Crime

Jason Statham's Accent Sums Up This Movie....,"... because it's a complete mess.It tries to be James Bond directed by John Woo, but in the end it seems more like a budget video game made by first time developers... that couldn't afford decent voice actors!!!!Jason Statham could probably hold his own as this type of actor if he wasn't made to fake an ""American"" accent, it simply makes him sound as though he has a speech defect! The other actors were basically either annoying (the ""girl"", her father and the main ""bad guy"") or bland (the ""cop"")The fighting was innovative at times (the docks/bus station) and laughable at others (in the truck) but overall it served it's purpose well and probably saved this movie from getting a 2!",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"nice first half, but after the break it's going down hill","I saw this film in a sneak preview, so i didn't konow what to expect. When i saw the name Luc Besson i thought by myself that this could be a nice movie, you remember films like taxi, yamakasi, wasabi or kiss of the dragon.The story of the transporter is pretty simple; jason statham play's a guy who delivers packages for criminals. He has simple rules that shouldn't be broken, not by the criminals who give him the assignment or himself.Then he brakes the rule himself, he opens a package. and in that package he finds a chinese girl. from that moment there after the criminals who are smuggling people in containers from asia to france.this film has disappointed me a bit. When you know the luc besson movies, you expect something fast. this movie is fast but only in the first half after that it's turning into a soft story about trust and real love. So my conclusion is that if you like films from Luc Besson you shouldn't watch this, because it's a little disappointing. if you are a fan of Luc Besson you probably gone watch it any way.I give this film a 6. greetings to all of you movie lover's",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Jackie Chan wannabe movie,"I hired this movie because our video shop has a deal- hire 1 overnight Mon-Thurs and get a free weekly. As they only have about 300 weeklies, my options are getting limited. Soon I'll be hiring Never Ending Story 3.I picked this one because (a) I saw they've made a sequel, which means either the first one was good, or lots of people went to see it (b) it has Jason Statham in it, who hasn't let me down before.The movie follows the Transporter (Statham), which is a much better name than ""The Courier"" or ""The Parcel Guy"". The Transporter's mission statement basically reads do the job, do it smart, don't break your rules (think DeNiro's character in ""The Score"". When one inadvertently gets involved in one of his jobs, his simple business is turned upside down. He's not going to get uninvolved without lots of flying kicks, explosions, oil and a cool cop.Kept me entertained, but a pretty shallow script, weak supporting cast and some ridiculous action sequences that would make Jackie Chan wince.

High-speed thrills in the transporter,"""The Transporter,"" directed by Louis Leterrier and Corey Yuen, stars Jason Statham as Frank Martin, a professional ""transporter"" who specializes in delivering packages without questions. The film kicks off with a bang, showcasing Statham's impressive action chops and delivering high-speed car chases that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.Statham's portrayal of Frank Martin is stoic and disciplined, embodying a no-nonsense, action-hero persona that fits well within the movie's fast-paced narrative. The plot revolves around one particular job that goes awry, leading Frank into a web of danger and deception. Alongside Statham, Shu Qi provides a compelling performance, adding a layer of intrigue and emotional depth.While ""The Transporter"" excels in its action sequences and slick production, it falls short in terms of plot complexity and character development. The storyline is relatively straightforward, with predictable twists and minimal character backstory. However, the film's adrenaline-fueled pace and stylish action scenes make it an entertaining watch.Overall, ""The Transporter"" is a solid action film that delivers on thrills and high-speed excitement. Despite its narrative shortcomings, it offers a fun, escapist experience for action enthusiasts.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Then he gets involves with his latest package (QiShu) that unexpectedly gets in his way but when those mysterious people... who hired him double-crossed Frank. Which they tried to kill him and the package. Now he finds himself protecting his latest job, while she has agenda of her own.Directed by Corey Yuen (DOA:Dead or Alive) made an entertaining action-packed thriller that has an amusing sense of humour. Statham is a lot of fun (especially to watch) in his first lead role. Louis Leterrier, who credited as Artistic Director. Leterrier is best known for directing ""Transporter 2"", ""Unleashed"" and the upcoming sequel of ""Hulk"".The original DVD has an terrific anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an OK commentary track by the producer:Steve Chasman and actor:Statham, Deleted/Extended Scenes with optional commentary by the actor and filmmakers and more.The new DVD has the same anamorphic Widescreen transfer but it has an new audio track in DTS 5.1 Surround, which is terrific. The DVD has same extras but adding also an new half-hour featurette, ten minute featurette on ""Transporter 2"" and ""Transporter 2"" trailer as well.

Nicely done Jason Statham,"This isn't a very good movie, but I still enjoyed Jason Statham's performance in it. He just stood there, and keeps it cool through out the whole movie. He plays the tough guy well, and I really hope to see this British hunk in more leading roles.His martial arts are actually VERY good. He performs nice fast snap kicks, and seems to be a pretty high jumper. The problem? Well the biggest problem with the martial arts in this movie is that you can pretty much see each opponent waiting for the kick or punch from Statham - which makes the martial arts in this look weak.The best fight scenes in this are:-The whole Bus sequence-The whole oil wrestling scene-Statham knocking down the door, and taking on the guys with axes.I really dont want to comment on the rest of the movie, cause this movie is seriously all about Jason Statham, and I say ""Nicely Done!""",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Thin plot + badly constructed action scenes = boredom,"First of all, I feel I should point out that it was actually CORY YUEN who directed the movie, NOT Louis Leterrier (who was actually the ARTISTIC director). This fact is listed on the DVD box and in the opening credits. Still, I can understand why who originally submitted the credits to the IMDb may have been confused, because you would be kind of hard pressed to successfully compare this to Yuen's (usually superior) Hong Kong product.Before that, a look at the plot. We have an extremely thin plot here. All that's going on is more or less a simple smuggling operation. The bad guys behind it are simply greedy gloaters who will kill if it's necessary - and that's ALL that's done with them! Even with the two ringleaders; about all that's different about them is their ethnicity. It isn't much better with the protagonists. Jason Statham looks good and throws himself into the action well, but he can't do much more than that, playing the same old tired hard-lined loner with a murky past. Shu Qi is pretty, though sometimes has problems with her English dialogue, and her character is even thinner than Statham's.Now back to the action. The scenes did have the potential to be great - a fight in oil, struggling all over a transport truck speeding down a freeway - but they are ruined by what quite often ruins action scenes in Hollywood movies (despite the fact the creative part of this particular movie is non-American):(1) Too-quick camera movements (usually hand-held)(2) Unbelievably fast editing, that chops up the action instead of holding sight of it and playing it out like a ballet of sorts (what you will find in the best Hong Kong action movies.I also need to point out that the editing in this case is even worse, sometimes cutting out ""links"" that result in people or cars all of a sudden jumping from one place to another.No need to rent this, when there are plenty of good action movies already sitting in the catalog sections of your local video stores.

It also includes one of the funniest battle scenes I've ever seen: Frank (Statham) is fighting off a bunch of bad guys in a pool of oil in a parking garage.

"Almost, but not quite","This movie reminded me of a Van Damme movie (before he completely went downhill) with a little Jackie Chan. Jason Statham was really fun to watch and I see him doing well in the future if he avoids doing more movies with completely useless plots that exist only to feature the far-fetched action scenes, like in this movie. (You might say that the same is true of J. Chan films, which I love, but they are at least humorous and extremely entertaining.) The supporting actors for the most part were bad and the storyline was weak. I liked how the movie started by showing us the transporter's job, but then the crap he gets in later is just an excuse for some ridiculous, although often entertaining action scenes. Do not see this movie unless your only expectations are to see ONE watchable actor doing some interesting action scenes. If the story or overall acting matters to you at all, then do not waste your time.

( Easy to watch, engaging.
It's set in the beautiful French riviera where we are once again reunited with Jason Statham in another action/crime packed movie. Personally, this is one of my favourite examples of how to make a good action movie. All you need is likeable characters, excellent bad guys, the right amount of action, fighting, stunts, cars exploding way too much for no reason, romance and one man against the world story and you have made an iconic movie. It doesn't work every time but it worked this time.Sound design - (Excellent. When I watched all the fight, action scenes the special effects gave satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out. Everything music-wise felt just right like you would expect.)Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that Transporter vibe to everything.)Stunts. ( I was expecting many satisfying stunts from this movie but it still managed to surprise me with quite a lot of amazing stunt work starting the mansion till the bus depot. I'm still amazed.)Overall I think quite a lot of people will enjoy it and very few won't.

Flash & Panache wheel in this basic action film.,"Jason stars as Frank Martin. He's a hired gin who does driving jobs for a hefty fee. For his services he'll use his superb driving skills to get his paying customers out of a jam. He asks no questions and needs precise instruction in order to perfectly time his getaways.As the lead character, Statham's a transporter. He can get you, your associates or your property anywhere, anytime, on time, no questions asked. But you know what? Common sense tells us that it was curiosity that killed the cat, and the cat in this picture thankfully doesn't die some horrible death but instead, curiosity yields him a break - a beautiful woman named Lai (Shu Qi) - bound and gagged, and in the trunk of his BMW. The day he breaks his own rules, he realizes he is transporting a Chinese girl, Lai (Qi Shu), and he gets in many troubles due to his fault.It starts with a wild car chase in France, & introduces some memorable phrases. There are no smarmy one-liners making light of good action sequences as is too often the case in American-directed action flicks. There are some unbelievable yet jaw-dropping stunts, a terrific fight scene in oil, and some great car chase scenes. The Statham is cold, yet compassionate. There is even a great shot of the him jumping off a speeding semi while it races over a bridge onto the back of a bus going perpendicular to the truck under the bridge!! I mean, come on! There is another hilarious scene where the hero chases down an airplane on foot, hijacks it, jumps out of the plane at great altitude in order to land on the back of a speeding transport with a conveniently located borrowed parachute!There is plenty of action, Statham does display some pretty impressive moves but the frantic editing just doesn't do him justice. He obviously worked out for this part and there are frequent moments when his ripped torso is on display. He also (barely) manages to shy away any possible accusations that he's just a British novelty to American audiences.A basic action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts. People have unfairly slammed this movie for being unrealistic. What do you expect? The action scenes are performed to panache & stylized you have to suspend belief.

He has the car, the weaponry, the physical fitness, the self defense mechanisms and the brains to hold it altogether.

Most of the film is him beating up a bunch of disposable assassins as he travels with Lai (Shu Qi) a former 'package' who he broke his cardinal rule for and ended up helping and in that sense it does not disappoint. Nothing deep but that's not why you go to see this kind of film, you go to see the action and eat popcorn and for that it is definitely recommended.

"Utterly enjoyable nonsense, a very guilty pleasure","I don't think I quite fit the movie's target audience, but this big, dumb film cheers me up every time. Somehow all involved have achieved the amazing feat of making a second-rate Euro-doo-doo-chop-socky flick watchable, enjoyable, and even involving.Jason Statham plays Frank, whose job title gives the film its name. But he's not just your average lorry driverhe drives a mean car and will transport anything, anywhere around the Med, for a price. He's careful, taciturn, precise and likes routine. Within that framework, anything goes.Life breaks in on his steely solitude in the form of a woman (surprise!), and sets off a chain of events  but honestly, the rest of the 'story' is just thoroughly entertaining nonsense hardly worth summing up. Suffice to say that a bulked-up Jason Statham is surprisingly good in the central role  the only serious defect there being the daft transatlantic accent. Statham couldn't be more London if he tried.The movie's colour, humour and pathos come from able sidekicks Qui Shu and Francois Bearléand, and from Frank's (human) inability to live out his life by the cold logic of the lonely code he has set himself. In its harshness, his code reminded me of the terse commands of the Way of the Samurai, but in its application it is funny or brutal by turns. It's a credit to Statham's acting (yes!) and fighting skills that he lifts this above cartoon fare, and to the cinematographer that it looks much better than it deserves to.For yet more very enjoyable tosh, check out Statham's ""Crank"".

Good things:  The actors fit pretty well, and many stunts have a Jackie Chan quality.  Jason Stathom makes a great leading man.  There are tons of current, hip camera shots and editing tricks to make this look cool. Bad things:  The bad guy looks like a character from the Kids in the Hall (I thought immediately of the bad guy from Brain Candy when I saw him).  The story seems to have been pieced together from a 14 year old who's already seen too many Bond films and played way too many video games.  Also, during the fights, there are tons of ""lame fighters"".

Delivers the goods.,"Frank (Jason Statham) earns his living as a transporter, a driver who operates on the wrong side of the law, making deliveries of any kind, no questions asked; but when Frank breaks one of his own rules by opening a package en route, his ruthless employers decide to silence him using any means necessary.Jason Statham has some pretty lousy titles in his filmography (the preposterous and tiresome Crank movies, the disappointing The Expendables), as do director Corey Yuen (the mediocre So Close, the abysmal Blade of Kings) and producer Luc Besson (the awful Arthur and the Invisibles). The Transporter, however, sees all three on top form, their film providing an hour-and-a-half of exhilarating, knowingly dumb comic-book nonsense, star Statham playing his part perfectly, with an admirable sense of seriousness despite the patent silliness of the action (unlike his irritatingly OTT performances in the Crank films).As the story progresses, the gunfights, fist fights and explosions get bigger and better, with logic never allowed to get in the way of spectacle. Statham looks every inch the action hero and handles his martial arts scenes convincingly, the best being a hugely enjoyable battle against numerous foes that makes use of a couple of barrels of grease and a pair of bicycle pedals. Bringing a bit of glamour to proceedings is the lovely Shu Qi, who plays the contents of the package that gets Frank into so much trouble.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The story, though not real original, is also good and the fight scenes are pretty much eye candy; albeit not too realistic. They're just COOL.

It helped Jason Stathen to exude the badass persona without having to rely on catchy phrases to put up a false bravado. Well done on that account to actor, director, and writer.

All action,"I remember seeing the advertisements for this film. It looked like a good popcorn-flick, plenty of action and not much else. What can I say... accurate ad campaign. That's exactly what this movie is. If that's a good thing or not is up for the viewer to decide, but know that if you go to see this movie, that is what you will get, nothing more, nothing less. The plot just barely makes sense and keeps the movie... well, moving. The pacing is pretty solid. The acting is just about average. The soundtrack consists mostly of hard rock and rap, which is fitting, I suppose. I personally didn't mind(I enjoy both music genres, though I wouldn't exactly say I loved the music in the film), but if you're one of those who would, you might want to consider another film to watch. The cinematography is fairly basic, though some of it is experimentally stylish... and as with most experiments, not all of it is good. Luckily, there's not too much of the bad. The martial arts choreography is pretty good, with some using of surroundings and nearby items in the fights. The action is cool. Very. It's very intense and the film has more than its share of it. Statham may not look like he can kick ass... but believe me, he can. I can't tell you how many fights or action scenes there are in this film; I lost count. One complaint that I simply have to make, though... the girl. She's just about the worst actor in there, she's annoying and every other time she opens her mouth, a screech comes out. I read in her mini-biography that she has a 'manic' acting style; that's OK, there are movies where that fits, where that would be considered good comic relief... but here, it just causes the viewer(maybe not all, but most definitely yours truly) to cringe. The humor in general is pretty tame. Very ""Saturday morning cartoon"". All in all, good if you're looking for a high-octane, leave-your-brains-at-the-door action film. Pointless if you're looking for anything else. I recommend this to fans of action-flicks who can accept that it's nothing but action and still enjoy them.

"Great Popcorn action film, is one of the great guilty pleasures of all time.","I love this movie.I've seen it I don't know how many times since its release and I never seem to get tired of it.The plot is simple. Frank is man who will transport anything anywhere so long as you follow his rules. For Frank the rules are what keeps him safe and out of trouble. Of course Frank breaks one of the rules and he suddenly find himself on the run with a girl in tow with police and the bad guys on his tail.This film has great characters who say very funny things, the exchanges between Frank and the police officer name Taconi is wonderfully funny and knowing. It has incredible action the likes of which you've probably never seen, the opening chase is one of the best ever put on film, and o course the battle in the oil.Its a wonderful film that completely falls apart dramatically in the second half. Once Frank and the girl come face to face with the two bad guys, the film ceases to make logical sense. Whats going on (apparently a plot to smuggle Chinese into France, though its not really clear) is less important than getting Frank to the next action scene. Whats so troubling is that even after 30 or 40 viewings it feels like the film makers never had a clear direction past a certain point in the story. Its not fatal, but it is annoying.Plot collapse or no, this is a great film that really should be seen.

I wish we could have learned more about his background other than that he is retired from the military.

Truly awful,"Verdict? Truly awful. The choreography for the fight scenes are laughable.When a film contains a 'superman' who can take on a dozen men all at the same time, clearly we're entering into the world of fantasy and for the film to work it has to be played for laughs. The main problem with the film is that it took itself too seriously. Or rather Jason Statham played it too seriously. Statham has to be the worst actor in living memory, and seemed to be incapable of showing any expression or emotion in his cold, lifeless eyes. He just about gets away with it in, 'Oceans eleven' probably because he occupies so little screen time. To give you an example of Statham's acting in the film, in one scene his house is blown up. How are you going to feel if your house is blown up? Angry? Mildly irritated perhaps? -Not if you're Jason Statham. Having just seen his house destroyed and turned into complete rubble, his face doesn't register even the slightest muscle movement. He just can't act. Maybe, he should have watched Gene Hackman's turn in, 'Enemy of the State' when his house his destroyed for a few pointers. Even at the end of the film where he's reunited with his love interest, you'd think if there was ever an opportunity to smile and show a bit of life, this was it. What does he do? Same static, lifeless expression. Painful.Given that the whole premise of the film is that Statham is the best 'transporter' there is, transporting packages from one location to the next, no questions asked, you'd think there'd be a few good car chases to demonstrate why he is supposedly the best. And is there? Not, in this film.Badly acted. Badly written. Badly choreographed. Truly awful.3/10",,Anonymous,Crime

I Didn't Like the Robotic Fight Scenes,"The Transporter is about a man named Frank whose job it is to transport things. He lives his life by following rules designed to get him out of trouble.

He looks inside a package in the trunk of his car to find a woman named Lai. By breaking his rules, he spirals into trouble.It's interesting to see people torn between professional conduct and moral conduct, as it is a decision we all have to make, and different people will make different decisions.As a criticism, the movie's fight sequences seem too choreographed. Frank's fighting style is not smooth and flowing but rigid and sequential.The damsel in distress Lai is very attractive, and sometimes I wonder whether this sends the message that only beautiful women deserve to be saved.The movie concerns smuggling of people from Japan to Europe, presumably France. At the end we learn that the refugees seem to respond to Japanese.

"It's trash, but hell if it ain't entertaining","I don't think I've ever witnessed a movie that so thrives on a strangely dumb likability as ""The Transporter"". I felt a very European ""The Fast and the Furious"" vibe from this (not just the Matt Schulze connection), only not so insulting to the brain. There's no use coming to this with knives sharpened; it's inviting in its mindlessness.To wit: Jason Statham's a conveyor of goods for various criminal enterprises, and his every action is governed by a code of rules. Obviously, he'll come to break those rules and find himself in hot water with the bad guys as a result. Cue the series of physically impossible fight scenes. It's not hard to see where this thing's headed, but somehow, it doesn't make you want to slap yourself. All of this absurdity rests on the icy coolness of Statham, a man rising to the occasion without reservation. He's why something so flimsy can actually work. Even when he's fighting thugs on an oil slick, it's still engaging.I liked it just as much today as I did in 2002.

The one liners aren't too cheesy, the action is just enough over the top to entertain you without insulting your intelligence, and the trailer didn't give away even a fraction of the great scenes in the movie. The good guys are likable, the bad guys are detestable.  The character interaction is enjoyable at all times.  Jason Statham is certainly establishing himself as an action movie leading man.

The movie thats greatness relies entirely on the fight sequences and chase scenes!,"Frank Martin(Jason Statham)is the greatest driver there is. He makes his own rules and it works out splendid for him until he takes a job transporting a package for a few high class goons. He breaks one his own rules by opening the package only to find a young Asian girl. After bringing the package to its destination he is asked to take another package to a different destination and finds it to be bomb intended to kill him. Frank Martin gets his revenge and starts a battle with very powerful men.I have found that I enjoy these types of action movies better if they are much shorter as this one is. It is only 92 minutes long which helps keep people entertained throughout. The actual movie consisted of a plot that was OK but was not really carried out well. I happen to be a sucker for the stories of revenge, so I found it quite entertaining. There are many sequences that they try to set a romantic mood to but fail miserably. There is barely any dialog which is the way these types of movies should be. If you are going to make a cheesy action movie then make it rely on the action and only the action!! Don't try to make a dramatic story to the movie! So, The Transporter moved in the right direction by mainly doing this.As I have already hinted, the action just makes the movie what it is. The fight scenes were some of the best I have ever seen and reminded me of some of the older Jackie Chan movies. The chase scenes were definitely one of the best. I would say the best chase scene since Ronin. Whenever Frank is fighting, you just get a good vibe and it makes the movie. Honestly, if the movie left out the romance and the drama, it would be a great movie. Instead, the movie drags on and on about subjects that don't matter at all making it only mediocre. In conclusion, The Transporter is a entertaining thriller which, like many other action movies, has very many flaws.I recommend this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

All in all, an unimpressive first viewing.Then, I found myself thinking ""I'd like to see that first car chase scene again."", Or, ""why didn't i like that fight scene in the bus garage?""... and I ended up buying the movie!!!The good: This is a straight ahead action flick with good (if not great) fight scenes, a contemporary (if poor) plot, good (if annoying) car-chase scenes.  And Jason.  This man rocks, and I sincerely hope he continues on to super-stardom so we get HIM with some higher-class movies.  Oh, and the settings and scenery are excellent.The bad:  The girl is an annoying, bad actress who speaks so thickly I found myself wondering what she was trying to project. BUT, she's practically a thespian compared to the indistinguishable rumblings of the french police. After multiple viewings, I found myself turning on the subtitles to understand what he was saying!!Overall, this is a FUN movie that I'm glad I added to my collection, and I expect to watch it more for the strong points!!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Surprisingly Good,"Rating: * * *Recently, most action flicks have completely wooden scripts and big but completely unbelievable action scenes.  See, for example, the latest James Bond film, Die Another Day.  Several of the action scenes couldn't happen at all in real life under any circumstances and the characters are badly written.The Transporter is an exception.  It's not entirely credible, but it could happen, and that's saying more than you'd think.Jason Stathom, whose first films were Guy Richie's ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"", shows that he is a good action star and actually probably better than Vin Diesel.  The script for this flick isn't the greatest and has some wooden dialogue, but the characters are well written and that helps a lot.  The action scenes are thrilling and a lot of fun to watch.  The plot is good for the first half, then worthless for the second half, but then again, the second half is almost pure action.  The character relationships are well done, especially between Stathom's character and the French policeman.Overall, this isn't the best, but it is very entertaining and fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Plot holes? Of course, but who cares?","If you were expecting an involving, strongly emotional film during which you form a relationship with the characters, then how did you end up with this film?  Sure, the characters are flat, and even the plot has some big problems.  Just get your cartoon-sensibilities out and try to enjoy it!That said, the score is somewhat enjoyable in my opinion, the camerawork is outstanding (if it doesn't bug the hell out of you which it seems to do to some people).  There's not much to be said for any of the actors apart from Jason Statham, who is perfect for the part.  Someone mentioned that he has the Bruce Willis look going on, which is true, while he also has that cool accent.  And those are two guys who can pull off having receding hairlines without going totally skinhead and looking like a slab of meat (like Vin Diesel).  If you liked that look and accent in Snatch or the Italian Job you will probably like it here too.  In my opinion he is a perfect action hero: cool, calm, in control, powerful, fast, and anything but annoying.  Most heroes fail in one of these respects at some point during a film.So now the important part: the action sequences.  These really make up for the lack of coherence and character development.  Maybe you think that nothing could make up for a lack of coherence; well obviously you're not the action type and should stay away from this film!  If you can get over it, then some of the scenes are quite beautifully done, so rhythmic and well-choreographed as to look like dancing.  Some of the scenes are reminiscent of Kiss of the Dragon (and even one of the villains is the same guy).  That reminds my brothers and I watched it, we were many times reminded of other action movies: Ronin, Speed, Terminator 2, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Lethal Weapon 4, The Professional, the Fast and the Furious (some of these are not surprising due to their mutual associations with Luc Besson).  But while you might just think it copies these other films, it basically does many of the cooler things in these films in a borderline montage of action that leaves you with a sense of tribute to the genre rather than a copycat.  Plus, it has many scenes which are extremely original.  Overall, if you're into the action, this movie has some intense and spectacular scenes.  If you aren't, don't see this movie so we don't have to hear you complain about it. [7/10]",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Abysmal - How can Luc Besson ever put his name to it?,"I went into this picture to see an all out action film with a smart hero and a cool storyline. After all Luc Besson whose credits include Leon and The Fifth Element was credited for this film.The films opening left me slack jawed with amazement. Not at the audacity of the driving and action but at the crass stupidity of all the players. Stathams bald hard man in a suit came across as one of the most incompetent idiots of all time. After all, who stands still after a robber questioning the number of people and yet allowing the police to come along? An idiot, that's who.The plot lopes along carefully ignoring the massive holes that you could drive a herd of mastadon through and still leave room for the entire Mardi Gras procession in Rio! You have a heroine that shoots her father and then smiles happily at releasing a bunch of refugees whose likely fate is to be put on a plane back where they came from. You have Statham jumping from a Cessna plane that goes from skimming the roof of the lorry he is going to jump on to 20,000 feet in a second and whose parachute descent takes about the same time.This is a godawful film and only amusing in places. The characters are wooden save for one, the laconic police inspector who saves the film entirely.Please Luc ... get your act together.

Good action flick,"The opening third of the flick is by far the best part. Frank Martin lives by his three rules: never alter the deal, no names, never open the package. Up until he breaks one of his rules the movie is an interesting look at a man who lives by his own terms in an extremely violent and dangerous portion of the world. Unfortunately after he finds the girl the movie breaks down into a series of cliches and explosions that are less interesting. The girl in particular, Qi Shu, is not a terribly good actress and is better as eye candy than whenever she speaks. In fairness it's probably her first English language movie. Still it's a solid action flick with a lot of high-powered stunts and a winning performance by Jason Statham in the lead, though one wonders what sort of movie would have resulted had Frank just closed the trunk again.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Action scenes are not enough,"I haven't seen action movie in, literally, years. Sure, I saw adventure/war/thriller/sci-fi movies with action (combat) scenes, but no pure action movie, because I totally lost interest in this genre long time ago. I got this movie from a friend, he just told me, it's the guy from Snatch and if nothing else, it's worth seeing it because of a car chase. So I watched it without expectations, and like with Pirates Of The Caribbean, it worked out very well for me. I'm starting to believe no-expectation policy is the way to go.Le Transporteur is pure action and that's it. The movie has weak plot, average acting, no character development, but it has energy. The car chase at the beginning is the best I have ever seen. It really rushed adrenaline through my veins. Fighting scenes were also impressive for me, but I really can't compare them to anything as I've usually avoided kick-ass movies since the time of Van Damme. Yes, the movie is totally unrealistic and unbelievable, in real-life main character would die at least ten times (or maybe a hundred times), but that's how it's got to be in this genre nowadays. Actually, that's how it has always been.Jason Statham, with his black suit, leather gloves and (almost) bald head, reminded me (like another user already wrote) of Hit-man - assassin from a PC game. As a matter of fact, the movie kinda looks like a game. They too lack in story (usually there is none or it's ridiculous), but they look good and are fun, just like this movie. There are complaints about young Shu Qi, but I think she did okay, wouldn't say it was major casting error. I guess they needed oh so cute, fragile, in-need-of-protection type. So what if her English sucks?But, the movie could be much better. It started really well, with a cool, interesting guy who is real professional. But, when a girl showed up, the movie-makers couldn't resist a little romance, which was unnecessary and really didn't fit in. Bad boys' leader, who is in many movies so charismatic, is here totally empty, shallow, uninteresting. The music wasn't that bad like some say, it was somewhat good, but it really could be better. It's great way to improve the movie with the music, and I really don't understand why they didn't put more effort in it.I kinda feel bad for the movie, because I did like it. I believe it could be one of the best action movies ever made. Unfortunately, a movie is a whole. Everything counts: acting, directing, script, editing, sound&music. Even action movie needs more than just good action scenes to become really great action movie. Maybe it will improve in sequel, but we all know what's usually the story with sequels, so...",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Lean and Mean Just Like its Star,"""The Transporter"" is a surprisingly well made, if routine action-adventure film. There's a better story here than the one told, but star Jason Statham delivers the goods and has a real future as an action star. Statham is the most virile action hero since Sam Elliot and is built like a hairy Greek god. He also sounds like Billy Idol. I saw this movie primarily to see Qi Shu, who impressed me so much in Jackie Chan's ""Gorgeous"". Qi Shu has the kind of face that looks as if it were made of the parts of two different beautiful women. Her mouth certainly doesn't go with her eyes and nose and keeps her from being stunningly beautiful. However, she uses her mouth the way many actors use their eyes, and her contribution to ""The Transporter"" and cinema is largely due to that expressive mouth. She's perfect in ""The Transporter,"" giving her character much more than is written.What keeps ""The Transporter"" from being first rate is the directing and editing. Much of the dialogue is unintelligible and some of the action scenes suffer from unwise editing. Watch the ""deleted scenes,"" which are actually extended fights and you'll see what I mean. Had the fight scenes been left intact,the movie be worth a ""7"". As presented, however, I give ""The Transporter"" a ""6"".",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining...,"""The Transporter"" is an Action - Crime movie in which we watch a man working as a transporter, delivering mysterious and dangerous packages without asking questions about them, not opening them and getting payed very well for his services. After a pickup of a package he observes something on it and his actions will change his route.I liked this movie because it had a simple plot, it was interesting and also entertaining. I believe that ""The Transporter"" is the definition of action movies since it has a simple plot that allows you to follow it easily, it has plenty of action scenes with much of suspense and it is very entertaining. It is not a masterpiece it is just a nice action movie that only if you have high or different expectations by it, it will let you down. The interpretations of both Jason Statham who played as Frank Martin and Qi Shu who played as Lai were very good. Lastly, I have to say that ""The Transporter"" is a nice action movie and I highly recommend every action movie fan to watch it because I am sure that you will enjoy it very much.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Way Better than Triple X----7/10,"I hear people saying how Triple X is the best action movie of the year and what not, which isn't saying much seeing how their were not too many action flicks to begin with. But The Transporter blew away the competition. It has a much cooler story to begin with. It follows a professional courier of illegal goods who breaks the first rule of transportation: never open the package. Fortunatley, the package he opens contains a beautiful kidnappee. Unfortuantley for him, he now has the police, his clients, and others on his tail. Jason Statham is amazing-despite the obvious exaggerations that come with all action films- and Qi Shu is incredibly tasty. The action sequences are the best i have seen in a long time, especially the hand to hand combat and the opening and closing chases. This is a great action film. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Who needs the essentials of film making when you are having so much fun!,"I didn't expect any dialogue, plot or real creativity, and I came out very satisfied with this experience. I will note this as a piece of brilliant stupidity, and film so bad that it is funny and breathtaking in its concept. While the audience simply blurs through fight/action scene aimlessly, at least they were well made and not all made on some guy's laptop. Funny and often times engaging, at least the producers knew they were making this film for pure action freaks and theater jumpers looking for a good second film to watch.

"Not much going on plot-wise, but still a whole lot of fun","While it certainly won't win any awards for originality (nor did it), THE TRANSPORTER is probably the best solo vehicle for Jason Statham that I've seen up to this point (to include stuff that has come out more recently). It's an all-thrills, no frills action movie with minimal character development and a logically incoherent plot, but the action sequences and Jason Statham's charisma as a leading man more than make up for the flaws in the narrative. Certain elements date it a little bit (a few soundtrack cuts in particular), and it almost feels like a relic of the 90's except for the fact that this came out in 2002. Still, I have great nostalgia for these types of movies and I had a great time watching it. Not only that, but there was some humor peppered into the mix which makes it contrast favorably to other movies that take themselves a little too seriously.

Jason Statham for his first action movie and with amazing and professional like acting,"Nothing will ever change my opinion about Jason Statham and his movies.

I just can't help the fact that his first movie would be,in my opinion,the number one action movie ever. I'm just glad that I saw this movie,because it's just the best. Jason Statham in this movie is where he just does a simple delivery job with his own rules. And if any of his rules were to get broken,well,there will be consequences that would need to be payed.Then for his recent delivery,he delivers a girl that he didn't even know about,and that's not even what got Jason to start fighting.NO,what started him fighting is something more personal that would contain spoilers for those who haven't seen it.

Slick (as oil),"A great platform for Jason Statham.I love Luc Besson's films anyway, and looked forward to this with interest. My first reaction when I heard 'Frank's speech was one of incredulity. They gave the lead actor this ghey american accent, its AWFUL.Its a real shame, as originally the role called for a ex-SAS freelancer, why they just couldn't leave it like that who knows? Maybe its to do with the fact it's a French production and they couldn't stand the idea of a strong British actor in a lead role in a French film...?Anyway, apart from that it's very very good. Funny as fewk, its so true to life, how extremely violent situations can lead to bizarre yet hilarious conclusions (i have some personal experience of that.) The action sequences are some of the best I've seen, esp the oil and axe scenes,leading me to suspect that Stratham may be in the line-up as the next Bond.However, both the lead protagonist and the female leads father are cardboard cut-out stereotypes, a little more time should have gone into casting them methinks....All in all a great night out or to you dvdr types a great night IN ;-)I thoroughly recommend this film; expect laughs, gasps and phews as 'Frank' takes us on the 'ride' of our lives!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Transporter: 6/10,"Car chases are about the coolest stunt in an action movie. To my latest count, The Transporter had three.Frank (Jason Statham) is a transporter: he delievers packages from one bad guy to the next, no questions asked. Or he may even carry passangers, as seen from the first scene. But when he opens a package that seems to be moving and screaming, things start to turn to the worse. Soon everybody is trailing Frank and trying to kill him. Just an ordiniary day in the life of a transporter.The opening car chase scene is the coolest one I've ever seen in movies. Sure it's unlikely (nay...impossible), but this movie isn't about what can happen in real life. The subsequent chases pale in comparision, but are still pretty cool.The plot, however, is anything but cool. In the first half, the plot was the consequence of opening the package. In the second half, it's about 400 Asian immigrants and the girl (Qi Shu) from the package's father working for the bad guy. Or something like that. Action movies like this are supposed to have you not really think about anything except for basic plot and explosions (like the one at the rest stop...awesome!), but you had to follow the plot or else you wouldn't understand what was happening.The best non-car-chase fight sequence was in the bus station. Buses...$35,000. Fighting ten guys on an oiled floor...priceless. At some times, Statham's moves seemed like he was break-dancing. Speaking of Statham, he could be the next action hero. With his Bond-like stunts and his Diesel-like build, move over Brosnan! There's a new hero in town.Shu was good as a girl with tape over her mouth, but she soon became an obnoxious person who wasn't fun to be with. Shu, and almost everyone else in the movie, had accents that were hard to understand a lot of times. If they learned anything from The Osbournes, it is that they can put subtitles in English-it'll help!The music was right on-key, helping tense the situation and then relax us, and then tense us up again. In the beginning, the sound FX really helped to bring out the quality of the sound. Music can be obnoxious if used in the wrong places, but in some places, like The Transporter, it helps bring out the mood.The bad guys, on the con side of the film, were so one-dimensional that they must have aced Stupid Bad Guys 101. On the test: Question 1: True or False: When the person you're supposed to kill disappears, just assume that he died. They must of tried to kill him and ""succeeded"" three times. What a load of idiots. And some of the film was so utterly unbelieveable. Statham just knows how to scuba-dive, parachute, has a giant house with an underwater passage to another house connected to it and has a million Mercedeses. Right...Well, enough of my mumbo-jumbo. If you just skipped down here to have me cut to the chase, here it is: Fun, mucho action, and some awesome chases counter against one-dimensional bad guys and horrible plot. I'm not sure if I recommend it or not, I guess just see it for yourself to figure it out.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for strong action violence and some language.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Action for action's sake,"Let's be honest here.  The appeal of The Transporter is not in a gripping, tightly-plotted script that speaks to the intricacies of human nature.  The appeal of The Transporter is in the action.  The appeal is the highly-choreographed, Hong Kong-inspired, thrill-a-minute martial arts and stunts that make movies like this great fun.Directed by Hong Kong veteran Corey Yuen (Jet Li's Fong Sai Yuk movies) and coscripted by French action master Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita, Leon, The Fifth Element), The Transporter is the story of Frank (Jason Statham), an ex-military man who now earns a lucrative living in France as a transporter; a man who drives criminals and delivers packages, no questions asked.  Frank has three rules:  Number one, never change the deal.  Number two, no names. And number three, never open the package.Well it wouldn't be much of a movie if Frank didn't break the rules - and it's rule number three that proves his downfall, as he opens the package in his trunk only to find the lovely Lai (Shu Qi).  This starts a chain of action sequences that lead to a very cloudy and obscure plot which serves mostly to offer up more bad guys for Statham to beat the living snot out of.And beat them up he does. The action sequences are the saving grace here, with boundless energy (and an endless supply of goons) and inventive setpieces.  The movie starts with a high-energy chase scene down alleyways, up stairs, and every which way but the right way on one-way avenues. Another top-notch scene involves an outnumbered Statham fighting off a barrage of mooks while all of them have to deal with overturned barrels of oil - there's more slipping and sliding than there is punching and kicking there.  It all adds up to a lot of fun.There's no depth and mystery involved in a picture like The Transporter.  It is what it is, and it aims to please.  For pure entertainment (and a few double-take moments), it's well worth the time spent.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Stylistically French with an Asian twist,"Just rented it and I am blown away. For some idiotic reason I didn't see it at the theater. But man, is the preview ever a bit different than what I expected. No fooling, this is a good flick with alot of deep substance underlying the characters. I can tell the guys making this were REALLY into it cause you can just tell they had a ""Blast"" making it. The characters are likeable and genuine and the frenetic pacing and rhythm of the whole thing give me a real thrill. It's so quick and so slick that I can see how there are rapid Asian elements blending with French super cool style now. The director Corey Yuen and filmmaker rebel Luc Besson are a lethal combination, oh yea. I mean these guys mean business, this movie is no joke. It just wouldn't let up. Everything is constantly moving forward, the story lean and mean, very very strong story telling technique. Also, the score was dazzling the way it complimented the energy of the film. And yes, Jason Stratham is on a whole nother level of cool. I seen his cool in Guy Richie's gangster movie ""Snatch"",when he played Turkish and have been on the look out for this cat ever since. That too was a genre breaking film. It incorporated black humor in the style of Pulp Fiction but in a way all its own. Oh yea one last thing. I seen The Transporter again at my friends house on DVD because I told him to rent it and he too was blown away. I don't know how to explain it really. I guess the closest way would be to say The Transporter transported the action genre into a whole new arena of filmmaking in that they make no apologies for cutting right to the chase. Puns intended. O it's in your face story telling alright. John Woo, Robert Rodiguez, Quentin Tarantino and Guy Richie probably spilling popcorn all over the darn place in laughter as they watched ""this thing"" go nuts on their big screen T.V.P.S. If you blink, um...you may want to rewind the movie, you probably just missed about oh say, fifty-thousand cuts. That's round numbers of course.P.S. II Something that may help prevent you from missing anything could be to use a clamping device such as that used in ""A Clock Work Orange."" That would keep your eyes wide open for the duration of the movie.P.S. III  ~A New Beginning~      Why is it that when Luc Besson has a vision, T.V. sets are on the verge of exploding? Just a thought.P.S. IV  Cautionary Note   Be careful when you remove The Transporter DVD from your DVD player after the movie has played. It was spinning so fast and caused so much friction that I actually burned the palm of my hand when I went to pick it up. I now have a second degree disc burn on my hand that reads The Transporter with a guy balancing two Berretta hand guns in mid air performing a drop kick.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The regular but still fun Statham material,"Jason Statham is popular for obvious reasons. Most audiences enjoy Statham just for his sharp British accent and his athletic action chops. Of course, there is more to that when telling a story in film because that can't be the only thing the plot centers on. It just has to placed in the correct moments for the storyboard to move with flow. For this film, it definitely can be said for sure, that the flow of this movie is even. Yes, there are other things to address but those things will come. This is perhaps one of the few films people can enjoy that deals with consistent movement (like the The Fast and the Furious (2001) franchise in a way).The story is about an ex-military man, Frank Martin (Statham), who is covertly working as a transporter for hire - a man who basically moves things from one place to another. No questions are asked about what he's transporting; that's not apart of his deal. If the deal is broken, so are the rules and that's basically how things unfold. Upon taking what seems to be a routine job of ""transporting"", Martin discovers there may be more at stake and breaks his code of the deal. Thus ensuing him in a load of trouble. Of course, nothing he couldn't handle though and that's actually the surprising part of this movie.The screenwriters behind this movie are Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. Before this time, Besson was best known for writing Léon: The Professional (1994) and Kamen had written for The Karate Kid (1984). To many, those are extremely well written works. In six years they would write for Liam Neeson's Taken (2008). I guess they're writing slipped a little in quality around this time. That's not to say their writing is bad, it's just predictably clichéd. There are only a few areas that stand out. The areas that are clichéd are the one's dealing with character development in the protagonists and the knowledge of the antagonists.Statham playing an ex-militant is pretty much the same as how most ex- militant characters are written. They like working alone, but yet end up finding a love interest. They also have retained their martial arts and survival skills since their retirement, which allows them to fight their opponents with ease. It was actually more interesting in the beginning of the movie because it wasn't all about taking on 5 times as many opponents as it was getting the job of ""transporting"" done. Before the action finale to the film, Statham played a much slicker character - almost like a cheaper version of a James Bond. It was cool to watch him be clever and evade authorities by his driving skills or name changing license plates.Accompanying Mr. Martin in his travels is the thing that makes him break his rules; a girl named Lai (Qi Shu). Here, she explains to Martin in her best English about a crate shipment of people that are being given to some wealthy guy. It's actually not clearly stated what is purpose of this. Illegal immigration? Slave labor? What? Matt Schulze plays the wealthy bad guy and he doesn't play badly at it either. In fact, viewers may find his performance a little more energetic than Statham's. Not sure if it was meant to be that way, but Statham pretty much plays it straight faced. I would like to know how Schulze's character was able to track Martin wherever he went though. It's a little preposterous since there was no clear indication on how Martin's place of living was discovered.When it comes to action sequences however, that's a different matter. Since Statham is well equipped for this type of genre, there is no doubt Statham knows what he's doing, and those scenes filmed will be entertaining. Which leads to a very specific moment that must be pointed out - the oil slick fight. This particular scene isn't something action fans may see every day. It's a very unique action sequence and it's quite baffling to know how it could've been executed. The music provided by Stanley Clarke was an interesting take too. The sound mix contained some orchestra but mostly jazz work tones that actually meshed well with the scenes that were filmed. It surprised me. Overall, it's your standard Statham film. Nothing far from what's already been made.The Transporter had a good premise and started out with class (thanks to the music). By the end though, it's a standard Jason Statham action movie that has consistent flow and doesn't have bad pacing.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

9/10 star reviews! You've got to be kidding me!,"Like many action films, the script of The Transporter was largely ""throw-away"", but I would expect that the same script in a capable director's hands could have resulted in a much more enjoyable film. Unfortunately, ""capable"" is not a word that I would use to describe the director(s) of The Transporter. The casting, the acting, the cinematography, the fight scene choreography -- everything about this movie is lacking. About the movie's only saving grace is some of its car chase scenes, but these are bought down by the most distracting music score that I've ever heard in a film! I know it sounds crazy criticizing a film's score, but The Transporter's score is so bad, it made me constantly aware of its presence. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.

Good flick spoiled by appalling sound track,"Jason Statham is always a pleasure to watch, but I hope his taste in music is not reflected by the appalling sound track. With its repetitive beat and crashingly dull ""melodies,"" it has to be one of the worst sound tracks I've ever heard - so loud at times that it drowns out the dialogues. At first, I thought it was computer-generated, but a computer would have done a much better job. It would also have been useful to have had sub-titles when Chinese (?Mandarin ? Cantonese) was being spoken. Finally, does ""Wall Street"" say ""Stay alive"" to Frank Martin in the shipping container scene? If so, why? He is eventually killed - or at least he seems to be - but it's not clear why he says this to Frank.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Jason Statham!!!!!!!,"An outlaw finds his life becoming all the more dangerous when he turns against a gang of criminals in this action drama. Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a former Special Forces officer who lives on the French Mediterranean and has a lucrative second career as a underworld courier for hire. Martin will deliver anything anywhere, but he has three iron-clad rules - once the plan is in motion it cannot be changed, neither he nor his customers are to ever use their real names, and under no circumstances will he open the package. Martin is hired to make a delivery to a wealthy but unscrupulous American known as Wall Street (Matt Schulze), but after taking possession of the package he realizes that whatever is inside happens to be alive. Breaking his own rule, Martin opens the bag to discover a beautiful Asian woman, Lai (Shu Qi), who is bound and gagged. Lai briefly escapes, but Martin captures her, and delivers her to Wall Street as promised. However, after being given a parcel to deliver by Wall Street, Martin finds out what Wall Street is up to - in partnership with Lai's father Mr. Kwai (Ric Young), Wall Street is part of a scheme to smuggle Asian illegal aliens into France. Martin's conscience gets the better of him, and he sets out to rescue Lai and put Wall Street and Mr. Kwai out of business; however, as if this wasn't enough of a challenge, Martin discovers a French detective, Tarconi (Francois Berleand) has gotten wind of his illegal business.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Transporter-Didn't move me.,"I loved Statham in Snatch, I thought he was inspirational, and pulled off the part with real conviction. The voice over throughout only adds to your involvement with his character and sympathy to his plight.Here however I felt that Statham was totally misdirected. He seemed straight jacketed in the part and the lines he was given further tied him down. His screen presence is fantastic and the film on paper should have been great. The opening car chase (although ridden with more continuity errors than many entire films) was reminiscent of Frankenheimer, even more so with the French location. The story however as it unfolded I felt was staggered and unconvincing both in content and acting. The Asian girl I thought was about as wooden as an 18th century Galleon and although there should not have been any chemistry due to the circumstances, any attempt just didn't work, including the scene where she drops her clothes in the doorway. Totally embarrassing, dialogue, acting, direction...todo! There were many simply unbelievable parts and I can't help nut think that this should have been an 18 so that the makers could have exploited the violence and gun play to it's max which seemed to be it's mainstay anyway. Insteadwith a kiddie rating which I feel could have been executed so much better. Once I saw the rocket leave the launcher when Stathams house was attacked, and travel almost pedestrian like through his kitchen, giving them both time to take evasive action, my suspension of belief snapped and I had to enter the comedy zone for the rest of the film. All the time fighting my better intentions because the film had great production values, even if it did contain a tad too many jump cuts for my liking. It dipped in and out of great and mediocre for a couple of hours.Statham earned a nice pay packet no doubt, but I'm sure he'll look back on this as a huge turkey that probably didn't warrant a sequel, of which I have not seen. Hopefully he'll not try and any more accents, god knows why this either wasn't dubbed or scrubbed from day 1 of the shoot. It would have worked better with his native accent, possibly tidied up for the US market who seem to have a problem with the 'mockney' south London drawl. There were so many dialects and accents it was a bit of a mess on that front.This surely has to win the prize for most bullets dodged by leading man in any film to date.Watch Ronin and see where it could have gone.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Like the French setting, true ripe camembert","Enter Jason Stratham, a guy who has certainly kicked in some steroids and new muscle entering the new found territory of 'the action hero'.  Certainly along stretch from his roles in Snatch, and Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels.  Jason is the ""Transporter"" and ex military guy living in France who delivers stuff for 'dubious clientele' so long as they follow his rules. However, the transporter screws up by breaking the rules by opening a package and getting involved when he ends up transporting a Chinese woman to someone.At this point you want to know where the story is suppose to go, but what really happens is it goes nowhere.  Sure it's an action film, with a great car chase and some great unique fight sequences.  But at some point the people making this tried to make the story solve itself within 5 minutes in an office room as they start introducing more bad guys, and try to write up a hasty conclusion.From this point on you can't even like the film for its stupidness.  It doesn't even get to maintain some degree of B movie camp.  Worse is that the acting when needed particualry between Straham and You Qi is so chessy and SOOOOOOOO bad it is cringe inducing to listen to.  Like the great French setting this movie reaked of over ripe camembert.It's too bad cause Stratham is definitly passible as an action hero, and the oil slick fight scene is quite ingenious.  But the HORRIBLY bad acting, horrible dramatic moments, and lack of any comedic fun make this film DEATHLY DULL.  There are also some unbelievable continuity errors the most obvious being that one of the rules for the transporter is that nobody knows his name, but 1/2 way through the film at one point, You Qi is calling him Frank for no reason or explanation.  Sure an action film can be void of these things sometimes, but at some point the film has to be a fun ride. This one sure is not.Rating 4 out of 10",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

You don't need incredible effects to up the action quotient like The Matrix, you just need to have lots of chase scenes, shooting and fights. That is what The Transporter provides.

The Transporter doesn't have great acting or plot or anything, it's just solid action. The soundtrack is great and provides a great backdrop for the action. The fight scenes alone are works of art.

'The Transporter's' fight scenes are definitely the movie's highlight. Corey Yuen's choreography is brilliantly inventive placing our hero in life-threatening danger that he somehow always manages to slip. Don't take it seriously and you'll enjoy it.

Forget XXX... go see The Transporter,"Just came back from a preview. This is a heck of a ride! This movie reminds me of the French movies from the 80s, lots of action and lots of fun. Okay, it's been brought up to date, and now has martial arts, but it is still a wild ride.Jason Statham plays Frank Martin, ex Army, who works as a ""Transporter"" who works moving goods, no questions asked. When he's asked to move a package of no more than 50 kilos, he accepts the job. On the way to make the delivery, he gets a flat, opens the trunk and sees the package, in a bag, squirming. He decides to be a nice guy and give the package a drink... a mistake he is soon living to regret.There is the old police detective, snooping around, trying to find out what Mr. Martin is really doing in the Cote d'Azur.

Patchy at best.,"The Transporter start out very slow. You get an idea of what Statham does in the movie, and that goes on for about a half an hour. Then things start to get interesting, but they only start to. Once you find out what the movies all about it kind of ruins the cool tone it had to it originally. The plot itself is not only bad, but is thrown together, making for a really patchy film. The action is great - but that's all. Even at some points its absolutely ridiculous what is pulled off. I found myself laughing at a few parts. And those weren't the parts I was supposed to be laughing at.Transporter tries to be funny at parts, and it really isn't. It tries to be serious throughout, when really it's just weird. I wouldn't recommend this movie even as an action flick, since most of the action is repetitive and unrealistic. For example, two cars collide and burst into flames before they barely even hit each other. But what bothered me most about this film is the extremely poor music selection. What was left of the Transporter that made it any bit redeeming was ruined by the awful soundtrack. Half of it was hip-hop, when there really shouldn't have even been music. And the score for the rest of the film simply isn't that good and doesn't fit the tone of the movie. All in all it was another disappointing movie rental. I could keep the flick for another week but I returned it the day after. I didn't really want to look at it. This kind of makes me not want to see Transporter 2, but I will still give it a chance.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Back to the action,"'The Transporter' is an action thriller with a credible action hero. Jason (Lock, Stock) Statham comes out with a lot of credit for his performance here. I just wish he had decided sooner (at the start of the film, preferably) not to try to put on an American accent. By the end, he is just using standard Estuary English, which works fine with his character.His trade as a high-end courier (would The Courier have been a better title?) working for any criminal gang that wants his services leads to interest from the local police inspector, played by Francois Berleand, who also turns in a wonderful performance. Scenes between the two of them work well. But, as acting credits go, that is about it.The movie is well directed, well edited and beautifully photographed. The fight scenes are tightly choreographed, often in narrow corridors, and Statham earns his money in those scenes. If you like car chases, you will love the first few minutes too.Although the plot does not really make sense, it exists as a framework to hang all the shooting, fighting, diving, driving and explosions – and they are good.There is the inevitable 'love scene' between Statham and Qi Shu (bet you saw that coming) but it's all over very quickly, as if the director realised that it's not what we're here for.

Tongue in cheek and proud of it,"Took advantage of tightarse Tuesday and went and saw The Transporter this evening.Interesting film - reminded me a lot of 'The Big Hit' - stylised action and fight scenes mixed in with a lot of tongue in cheek humour.  The Transporter didn't go the extremes that 'The Big Hit' did but it was heading there.  It even shared a similar theme of the tough guy falling for the Asian school-age girl.The audience I saw the film with were sniggering at some of the more implausable things (the leap of the car onto the car trailer for one).The fight scene in the bus depot with the slippery oil was inventive.Can't help feeling that Jason Statham was a bit miscast for the role of the super efficient Transporter, the guy you hire when you have to get a package from point a to point b.  Writer Luc Besson has a long history of projects concerning loners (La Femme Nikita, Leon, heck, even Joan of Arc) and Statham doesn't fully succeed in pulling off the role.  He's great in the action sequences but anything else he seems to fall into familiar territory that his old mate Guy Ritchie trained him in for Lock Stock, and Snatch.The final chase between the Transporter and container lorries did seem to steal a lot from the Bond flick 'Licence to Kill' (taking over lorries, jumping from planes onto backs of lorries etc), but it did add enough wrinkles to stamp its own signature on the scenes.Good film though - great action sequences and inventive locations.  8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Can't Miss but I'm gonna pick nits...,"First let me say that this is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed the first time I saw it and every time I've seen it since. I would have paid to go see this movie which in the age of cable and DVD is a high compliment indeed. However, as I am the idiot who sits in movies and says things like ""That's a Model 1911 Colt and this movie is set in 1908!!!"", I do have a few nits to pick with the movie and they are all things that could have easily been rectified.Frank Martin drives, according to the Inspector, a 1999 BMW 735i. Now while I am by no means an expert on Euro-spec cars, one would think that a 3.5 liter six-cylinder would be a bit weak for the kind of work Frank does. I would pick an M5, 4.4 liter V8 or take a less conspicuous 540i six-speed and buy modifications from Alpina to bring it up to M5 specs. Maybe he needs the extra trunk space of a 7-series...in that case, the 745i V8 or the 750i V12 would be a much better choice. While I'm not sure of Euro-specs, in the US the 745i and 750i were only available with automatic transmissions and that would take some of the drama as well as the skill away from Frank's driving. At least here in the States someone shoehorned a 5-liter V12 into a 5-series BMW and mated it with a six-speed manual. Why couldn't Frank drive a 7-series with a V12 and six-speed? All the producers would have to do is stick on a 750 badge!!! (That 5-series with the six-speed and V12 is for sale and if I had 25 large burning a hole in my pocket it would be in my driveway...) Now, about Martin's military background...while he was sleeping the girl found pictures which would indicate that he had been an American helicopter pilot, Gulf War era. Now, although Jason Statham does a pretty good job of downplaying his British accent, he would have been much more believable as an ex-SAS operative, especially with the level of fighting skills he displayed. I'm sure in light of the crop duster plane sequence it was important to show that Frank had flying skills, however I wish our pilots were as well trained in hand-to-hand combat as Jason is!!! (9-11 would be a footnote of a couple of failed hijackings in that case...) Admittedly, in my service I was a Pathfinder attached to an aviation unit and several of our warrant officer pilots had been Airborne Ranger qualified enlisted men before going to flight school. I too am a Ranger School graduate and my hand-to-hand combat training nowhere approaches Frank Martin's level. Only the SAS, Dick Marcinko's Seal Team Six and maybe Delta Force could possibly fight at that level.Statham looks convincing though, and not since Steve McQueen have I seen someone who actually looks like he maybe can drive as well as he does in this movie (possible exception of Robert DeNiro in Ronin, whose research for any role is legendary and other-worldly). I did like this movie and will watch it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Top Notch Stuff,"I went to see this film fully expecting the action to be great, but the dialogue to be utter pants. In all fairness, I was absolutely correct. The dialogue is awful and there are so many cheesy lines you could melt them down and use them in a fondu! However, in a way this only makes the film more watchable. There were countless times when myself and other people in the cinema cracked up (check out the moment when the flowing music kicks in when Statham opens the bag for the first time!) at moments which were quite frankly halarious! But the film really doesnt take itself seriously, and almost seems to recognize that some of the lines are so bad, they are good!Jason Statham has always impressed me, especially in Guy Richie's Snatch, and in this film he doesnt let you down. Okay, so his accent may be dodgy as hell (we personally thought he should have kept the british accent to add to his hard ass image) but he is hard as nails and surprisingly efficient in the fight scenes!Overall, yes the plot is naff, yes the script is tripe, yes some of the acting (Statham aside) is wooden, BUT yes the action is fantastic, yes Statham is cool and yes it is so funny I nearly wet myself!Watch out Vin, Jason is the new action star!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Oh, the pain...","I want to know one thing, did anyone really see anything?  While trying so hard to be fast and flashy to keep stupid people glued to their seats, the shoddy direction and mile-a-minute editing manage to disguise anything remotely interesting.  The only reason I saw this is because I joined a group of friends to see a movie, not knowing it would be this one.  I heckled the entire movie, and actually had my friends and many other people in the audience laugh pretty hard.  Does that tell you anything about how bad this is?  I was making fun of what these people just paid eight bucks to see and they were being more entertained by my smart-ass comments.I'll spare the details of the film, is case any stupid people read this(don't want to spoil the movie for you, dumbass), but suffice to say this is a waste of film, time, and money.  If you have even a quarter of a brain cell left, avoid this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

The mindless action film that actually entertains,"Accept The Transporter for what it is and then the rest is just uphill from there. The Transporter is this European film that is exactly the kind of film that I had been looking for: it is no question a truly mindless action flick with a lot of action and also a ton of stunts, and very little plot to weave it in together. Who needs a plot anyway? Despite being a bomb at the United States box office, it gained enough popularity over a small cult following to garnish a sequel. And if there is a movie that deserves a sequel, it should be this one. Not enough people gave Jason Statham a chance years ago, and maybe this time the American public gets to see how good he really is.This fast-paced film is about a man who gets paid to move stuff around, and he never questions what it is and who it is going to, he is simply used as a transport. Retied mercenary, suddenly Frank Martin grows a heart when his next transfer is actually an Asian female woman. After breaking one of the rules (opening the package) disaster erupts, and now it is up to him to end all the chaos. Yes, the plot sounds a bit on the uncreative end, but guess what, there is only one reason to see this movie, and it is for the action.The Transporter has more action than most American films out today, and this movie happens to be only 92 minutes long. The movie opens with a massive chase sequence, and the movie ends with a massive chase/action sequence that despite it resembling Raiders of the Lost Ark, it still keeps you on the edge of your seat until the sequence is finished. In between the two big scenes are several more fights here and there that were well choreographed and almost perfectly executed. And unlike most other action movies like The Bourne Supremacy, the action isn't so in-your-face that you have no idea what is going on, the camera is far away enough from the subjects that it allows you to see everything that is happening, and also at times, slows down so you can catch your breath and be able to realize what had just happened. The acting is certainly not Oscar-caliber, but it gets the job done. Jason Statham has plenty of potential in becoming the next big action star, as long as the United States gives him a chance. Remember it took Jackie Chan over a decade before finally coming out with a movie that American audiences went to see, which was Rumble in the Bronx. Oh, before I forget, the soundtrack to the movie was awesome.Bottom Line: I use Jackie Chan as an example for one reason alone, because Jackie Chan and Jason Statham are both stars of two of among the most underrated and underapprieciated action films in a very long time. Just like Rumble in the Bronx, The Transporter has a weak plot, but is totally made up for with the insane amount of action and kung-fu that makes this film a perfect summer popcorn flick. I personally find this film very entertaining, and get over the fact that it received very little attention and give it a chance, I am sure you will like it. The Transporter: Finally, the mindless action flick that does not try too hard to have a decent plot.Score: 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
I have a better idea,"Lets be clear right from the start, I like action movies. Honest. I've always liked action movies. I like dumb action movies. So its not the terrible acting, there are many Jackie Chan films that I love. Its not the sad subservient eye candy female ""characters"" (not even cartoons, line drawings would be more accurate), I can do that, I'm a man for Pete's sake. Its not the lack of any real plot, a series of nice action scenes strung together with a wisp of motivation will do me, I like Tarantino.The unforgivable sin for me is to have an action movie with no action. Nice cars? Check. Driving them fact? Check. Guns? Check. Daft fighting? Check. But these aren't action. They are fast cars, guns and fighting.The Transporter is like an animated version of a mid-range men's fashion magazine. Glossy but not quite cool shots. Almost clever but not quite bylines. Not dumb enough to be funny set pieces. Cut some faces from the underwear pages of a men's clothing catalogue (the bad guys have the same expressions of holding in trapped wind) and stick them onto some Lego men.

"The new definition of ""cool movie""","Sure there's lots of action movies, and it certainly does seem the stunts in them get more and more ridiculous each year. But every once in awhile a movie like this one can make you enjoy watching one man miraculously defeat twenty or thirty enemies at once, all the while dodging punches, kicks, and 50,000 rounds of bullets. So how does The Transporter pull this off? Three simple things: great style, a cast of main characters with incredible talent, and of course the awesome chase scenes and fight sequences...plus a good tongue-in-cheek attitude about it all.Simply put, if you've been looking for a great action film for awhile, this is definitely the medicine you need.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

And is it just me or is all these new actions flicks in Europe such as XXX, Bourne Identity and Transporter all of the driving is on the driver left side and the right side of the road like America.

One Hell of a Ride,"What Worked: The transporter is a action film which delivers what it promises, non-stop action sequences. The action of this film is truly exciting, Jason Statham truly is bad ass as Frank Martin a.k.a.

The action scenes have to seen to believe, not only are they ridiculously funny, they are well choreographed(which was done by the film director Corey Yuen)They're arguably the best fight scenes since ""The Matrix"" and they don't rely on wires in every scene.What Didn't Work: Let's face it, there is no plot in this film, NONE, and the character played by Shu Qi gets rather annoying every now and then.

The plot is nothing superior, but it's easy to follow and does it's job very well leading from action scene to another.

Most of the scenes are a bit over the top (well, i think that's the idea..), but if you liked the action in Stathams another 'kick-ass-movie' Crank, i'm sure you'll love this one too.

This movie is total garbage,"Few films bring to mind gold standard by which all bad movies are measured. The gold standard? Dante's Peak, of course. That film demonstrated a total lack or respect for the viewer, not only offending through a total swiss cheese plot, but also by blowing all sense of reality through the window. The Transporter is in this category of poor films. The first 15 minutes actually lulled me into a false sense of happy expectation. Yes, it was ripped off of Ronin, but a good car chase is still a good car chase.Once the car chase stopped, though, the crap began. I think that there was a plot somewhere in the movie, but I can't be entirely sure since they dropped what felt like plot elements in every 20 minutes or so and never really explained them. I doubt it was a very good plot anyway, you don't hide plots that are sound between useless action sequences. That's ok, though, it's hard to care about a plot when you can't find anyone in the film to sympathize with. The Transoporter was a hollow and emotionless character, first not really caring about the woman in the trunk and suddenly lusting for her, after several times declaring she is nothing but problematic. Oh, yeah, I can see why he's ex-military since he puts a loose rope around her neck and lets her go out of sight to pee. Hey, guess what, not exactly razor sharp military intelligence there, pal.Then there's Chinese girl. She's a whore, and not exactly sure where her allegiances lie. At one point, she could saver the Transporter from a problematuic situation, but chooses instead to just look dumb. She jumps into bed with the Transporter ten minutes after meeting him, and doesn't exactly have a very clear picture of how she sees her father. Anyhow, it might actually be worth seeing this at some point. I have no doubt it will make every movie you've ever thought was bad seem that much better, as this is truly a Batman & Robin level piece of trash.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

He wasn't so hurt (a bit nonsense), and he did all the safe things by him self. However, the fighting scene was absolutely good and the most important thing is there was no slow motion (I really don't like when there is a fighting scene and suddenly it has slow motion, looks not real).Too bad Shu Qi couldn't speak English well.

As Of 2023 It's Safe Call This Movie An Action Classic!!!,"Jason Statham has become a British van damme & he is very cool & has become an awesome action star in his own right!!!Statham was Excellent as one of the expendables in the great action packed trilogy & was fantastic in The Mechanic & other's & he was also very cool in Death Race & Ghosts of mars but i honestly liked him best in this first Transporter film!!! By now as of 2023 its safe to call 2002's The Transporter an action Classic & i love it. Also Frank Martin is such a likeable character & probably Statham's best, well maybe because i do love his Chev Chelios from the Awesome Crank films & his Author Bishop from his Mechanic films, oh hell Statham has many great characters & many great films. Now I'm not into fast cars at all, hell i couldn't care less about cars, but i do love watching Statham brutally kick-ass with his skills & i think of Statham as the equivalent of a modern day Bronson but with the fighting skills of Van Damme. Yes Statham is old school Bronson hard with the coolness of say Steve McQueen or Eastwood. There's definitely something old school about Statham & he definitely fits into old school action cinema, 70's kung-fu action or 80's crime thriller or 90's macho blockbuster action, Statham feels like he's a part of all that came before & is doing it today in modern cinema. There's a few other's that often feel old school a little like Dwayne Johnson (made in a similar mould to Schwarzenegger or Stallone) & Gerard Butler (feels very 90's action hero like say Mel Gibson or Harrison Ford) but Statham is the best of the new age of action stars.Here we see & witness Statham become the brutal action hero we all know now!!! But this felt like his Die Hard or his Taken & so on as this action packed Thriller was his big action break & his trademark role & has become an action cult favourite. There's such a slick vibe to The Transporter that i just dig, it has a real chill mood going on like a smooth thriller that you can chill to & enjoy. Transporter has been a go-to late-night flick for me for ages now & I'm still not bored of it.Statham here is a nice mix of bruce Willis (his bald head & stubbled face) & Van damme (his ripped body & fighting moves) & he really is cool to watch especially the ""oil fight"" that's a great fight scene & yes this has the usual corny & cheesy bits but that's what makes this movie a throwback to those old school action films. There's something very 90's feeling to this action film & i loved that about it. Statham plays the lone wolf action hero well & gives a strong kick-ass performance in this old school feeling action film.The Transporter is such a fun piece of action cinema that its one of those films you can watch over & over again.This is a very slick looking film with tons of Action & stunts but still on the lower budget side & that's very cool!!!Statham has to deliver a package but he gets set up & things go explosively wrong....for the bad guys. Statham kick-ass awesomely with style & wit. Set in France & a story that puts Statham up against human traffickers & is a nice bit of action escapism.Frank Martin is a cool character & if you wanna see Statham do action, old school style & be very cool whilst doing it then see this film.A little cult classic action movie is The Transporter & that's a lot of fun & some more absolute Awesome Statham movies to checkout are the two insane & purely entertaining Crank films & his powerhouse Homefront & the kick-ass suspenseful Killer Elite & his Expendables flicks & Death Race & well, pretty much most of Statham's films are excellent, except for a few. Statham is such a great screen presence & is my favourite action star of today.Part 2 is fun but Part 3 is rubbish.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nice action scenes!,"Corey Yuen has directed some low-budget action films but in 2002 he directed a great action flick called The Transporter, which stars Jason Statham. Jason Statham's first film was brilliant and he became better and better in acting from then on. It was in 2002 that he starred in an action flick and finally showed off his Kickboxing and other skills and it was really great. From the first scene I had a feeling that this was going to get better after twenty minutes and I was right 100%. The story gets more interesting and more characters are introduced, good and bad. Jason Statham's character is all calm and careful and that is cool but when it comes to someone messing with him and his car, he really unleashes his dark side and believe me that all hell is going to break loose. The stunts and choreography are fantastic, so well done stunt men and choreographers. The character, played by Qi Shu, is pretty exceptional and her humor is funny. Her lack of vocabulary is a weak side to her character and you need subtitles sometimes to understand what she is saying. The villain Wall Street, played my Matt Schulze, is totally ridiculous in acting and he doesn't look like a villain but a wanna be villain. The boring scenes were revolting and they all contain the French cop. They contain blah-blah-blah and that stops the story a little bit.Ex-Special Forces operator Frank Martin lives what seems to be a quiet life along the French Mediterranean, hiring himself out as a mercenary ""transporter"" who moves goods--human or otherwise--from one place to another. No questions asked. Carrying out mysterious and sometimes dangerous tasks in his tricked-out BMW, Frank adheres to a strict set of rules, which he never breaks. Rule One: Never change the deal. Rule Two: No names--Frank doesn't want to know whom he's working for, or what he's transporting. Rule Three: never look in the package. Frank's newest transport seems no different from the countless ones he's done in the past. He's been hired by an American known only as ""Wall Street"" to make a delivery; but when Frank stops along the route, he notices his package is moving. Violating Rule Three, Frank looks inside the bag, finding its contents to be a beautiful, gagged woman. Frank's steadfast adherence to his other two rules--which make up his basic code of survival--also quickly fails, hurtling him and his new companion on a road leading to shocking secrets, deadly complications, and the last thing that Frank ever expected to come to believe: that rules are made to be broken. (Copied from IMDb)The action scenes are very lethal and smart with a little bit of coolness. When he took off his shirt while he was fighting enemies, it showed that he was a show-off who liked his body. The action scenes never disappoint or get boring as Frank Martin terminates enemies, tough scrawny. Sometimes it would look fake,(Spoiler!!!) like when he survived the bombing on his house (Spoiler End!!!), but it can be real as well. Mmmmmm? The end scene was very awesome and very James Bond like. As far as the story goes, it doesn't disappoint but it feels like it is clichéd, somehow.Corey Yuen did a good job at directing this film while Luc Besson did fantastic writing the story. The car chase scenes look realistic and that's why you should watch this movie. I would recommend this to any film lover that likes a solid action flick. It is not a masterpiece but definitely worth a peek. The sequel is even better but the the third one sucked balls.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Bad Acting, Poor Plot, So many continuity errors = Bad Film","This is a really bad film, how it did so well begs to be asked. The plot is really terrible and is not helped by the useless acting skills of Jason Statham, why will he not just use his natural London accent? He plays ex-British military, but still feels the need to add an awful American twang to his dialogue.The plot is so stupid, even for a mindless action flick. Whereas films such as Jackie Chan's use tongue-in-cheek action, this film tries to be cool, but is laughable.The music in the film really adds an element of pure cheese. The hip-hop beats played to car chases is really inappropriate. It works well with ""The Fast and the Furious"" because they have some cool vehicles, but not with a BMW being chased (really slowly) by a few Citroen police cars! The music during the ""romantic"" scenes is poor and makes you wonder if any of the budget was allocated to the music.How this didn't go straight to video, we'll never know.This film had me and my mates in stitches, it was just so bad we had to laugh.DO NOT buy this, Rent it if you must see it, but don't say you weren't warned.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
A great action flick,"I havent read the other comments, yet... but having just seen this movie, I thought I'd add my opinion.Great stuff. Action scenes are well executed. The movie is just the right length... not too long.The hero is a relative unknown, but performs excellently as Frank, the clinical, calculated ""Frank""... an ex-special forces ""retired"" transporter of illicit goods... no questions asked until he meets Li, one cargo he wasn't bargaining on.The plot is relatively simple, the characters are very obvious, yet it works... very well...If you're looking for a well crafted action flick, this movie will be a very pleasant way to spend an evening, if you're looking for the next Matrix, and don't appreciate simplicity, you should probably avoid.All in all, the Transporter is a fast paced, solid action movie with great fight scenes and a noble plot.

"Interesting plot, minor continuity issues","""The Transporter"" is an action film that focuses on Frank Martin (Jason Statham), who is a private driver for illegal cargo, such as people and money. The plot follows him in the south of France, where he activates. His work is led by three simple rules, which he almost always obeys. However, this changes, with Frank breaking the three rules constantly, which gets him in trouble with the police and with a very influential man.This being a movie directed by Luc Besson, it features a lot of intense car chases, beautifully combined with occasional fights. Similar to ""Taxi"", this film is based in Provence, featuring heavily-modified and fast vehicles. In the beginning, Frank is driving a black BMW 735i which is then replaced by a stolen Mercedes S-Class. In my opinion, the performances of all actors are very strong, mainly Jason Statham's and François Berléand's, who plays Inspector Tarconi.However, there are some minor letdowns, chief among which is the continuity of details. First of all, certain features of the cars vary from one scene to another, such as the BMW jumping off the bridge in the opening scene having tinted windows while the one in the rest of the movie doesn't, or the fact that the Mercedes has its grille in place immediately after crashing through a gate, but in the next scene it is hanging off. Moreover, after the oil fight, Frank is seen swimming away from the attackers, and in the next scene his trousers are clean and dry. Another disappointment is that there are many similarities to ""Taxi"", like the way the French Police is regarded useless.All in all, ""The Transporter"" is a memorable and gripping film that is worthwhile, even if it is slightly disjointed and a bit far-fetched as the plot unfolds.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Delivers everything it sets out to.,"Those already familiar with Luc Besson productions will know that they have a tendency for a light story accompanied by beautiful visuals. Whilst some of his directorial outings have broken this rule, his productions rarely stray from rule number one; make the experience fun for the viewer. This movie certainly keeps with the fun. Unashamedly breaking the laws of physics and reality in favour of visual flair (as has always been the Besson way) this movie delivers everything it promises; it is fun, and the story is (whilst not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination) more than adequate as a vehicle for the action.Strong cast, good story (with no pretensions of being anything it isn't) and beautiful visuals.

The Transporter Fails to Deliver,"The Transporter tries very hard to be a good action movie. It uses only enough story to tie together its action sequences. However, the action is far from hard hitting and this only makes the abysmal story more obvious.Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a hired mercenary transporter, who while on one delivery, breaks his own rules and opens his package. Finding a kidnapped woman (Qi Shu), complications arise for Frank. It starts out good, but everything falls apart when the cheesiness takes over. The dialogue and acting do nothing to help the story. The movie's main attractions, its action sequences, are weak. Not only do they seem very slow, but the camera work makes it very hard to follow everything. As with the story, it's nothing we haven't seen before. If you're looking for a fun action movie, look elsewhere.2 out of 10",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
An international action thriller!,"This is a very entertaining piece of action cinema. Jason Statham plays the transporter of the title who (appropriately) transports packages for the highest bidder. Naturally his clients are shady crime world members, after all he is not just a Sunday ride or a trip to the grocery store. The Transporter is a rule abiding, martial arts fighting, pedal to the medal driving professional who knows how to get the job done and get it done right. The story has Frank Martin (Statham) delivering a package to a client cross-country and he unwillingly (well almost) looks into the package, thus breaking one of his strict rules of trade. Then, in short, all hell break loose. Granted that this movie is not much in the plot department, but for action it has few peers. For all of you Hong Kong action film lovers, here is a film produced outside of Hong Kong that follows that same relentless formula you love.Also, one cannot help but look at the credits: a french director and producer/writer, a British star, a fight choreographer from Hong Kong, a plot involving Chinese criminals, and the hero's car is German. Basically an international action thriller!

Short on plot -- BIG on action.  What did you expect?,"Most of the movies I bother to comment on are the ones which people say they didn't like because the plot was weak...but if they're honest, most people should tell you that the thing about an Action movie trailer that gets their attention is the ACTION!  But most people aren't honest.  They wanna pretend that they went to the movie expecting a brilliantly-written story.  Well, I got news for ya:  Every action movie you see is going to have a weak plot! A Drama had darn well better have a strong plot, sure.  But an Action movie -- 9 times out of 10 -- is going to have a weak plot!  Why?  Because when you see an Action movie trailer, you don't say, ""wow, that sounds like a thought-provoking story.""  No, you say, ""WHOA!!  THAT MOVIE'S GONNA ROCK!!"" So, as I've said many times before, let a movie be what it is.  So okay, with that said, yes, the plot of The Transporter was like something from an episode of ""The Rockford Files"" stretched out to movie length.  BUT, The Transporter is clearly (to anybody who's seen the trailer) an Action movie. If you had seen the movie's trailer, but didn't know it was an Action movie when you bought your ticket, then you're an idiot.  Now, fast-paced, kick-butt action is the real reason you wanna go see an ""ACTION"" movie, correct?!  I mean, that's why I went to see it!  And I was not disappointed in the least!  The action in this comes at you hard and heavy through the whole movie, barely stopping for a minute to catch its breath.  Yeah, they did a few things that are highly implausible, but who freakin' cares!  I see reality all day long!  A little imagination never hurt anybody.  Which is not to say that the whole movie is full of impossible stunts, but it does have its share.  But my point is this: When I saw the trailer for The Transporter, I said, ""Whoa!!  That movie's gonna rock!""  And what did I say as I walked out of the theater after seeing it?  I said, ""WHOA!!  THAT MOVIE ROCKED!!""  So did I get what I expected? Absolutely!  Well, no...actually, the more I think about it, I didn't really get what I expected.  I got more! I loved it!  9 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

If I'd bothered, I would have lost count of the number of times Jason Statham looked at his watch. However, like Ryan O'Neal in the similar film, The Driver, that seemed to be almost the limit to his acting. I half-remember a review of The Driver that said that Ryan O'Neal had a range of emotions from a to b. Jason Statham is the same; he has ""grumpy"" and ""looking at his watch"". The film also reminded me why I stopped buying Stanley Clarke's albums twenty five years ago. The soundtrack was clichéd at its best, and normally far worse.

Okay, yes, the supposed 'plot' is a bit cliche and weak. However it is introduced rather late in the film. So, it doesn't get enough screen time to develop into anything other than a reason to like the girl; which is fine by me. The action more than supports the film. This film, ultimately, is about the transporter himself, not the hottie he ends up rescuing.The editor of this film needs major awards!!

"Great action, not-so-great story","Firstly, I loved Cory Yuen's work on ""Kiss of the Dragon"" and anything Luc Bisson is involved with, esp. ""The Professional."" The fight scenes in ""The Transporter"" were as amazing, some even more so, as I expected. However, I think the PG-13 rating hurt the movie. The only reason to see a movie like this is for the sex and violence, and if it got an R-rating, like ""Kiss of the Dragon"" the fight sequences and cheesy romance bits could have gone further. There's really no great story or character development here, and that's OK with me, because the movie was just plain entertaining. Jason Statham is a better actor, a better fighter, and just plain sexier than Vin Diesel. He proved he can act in ""Snatch"" and here he proves he's got the movies of an action star, now I just want to see him in something with the best of both worlds - a great script and great choreography. Hopefully, this'll happen for him soon, as he's really great.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

The cooks made a fantastic broth!,"I thought that THE TRANSPORTERwas flowing with coolness. Jason Stathammade a great leading man. He had a very smooth performance. He was veryhonorable, he never lost his cool,and another unique thing about him was that he never killed anybody unless he seriously had no other choice. It was achange from other movies where the good guy just kills all his enemies. Plus, he was VERY impressive with his martial arts. He was so good at it, he couldprobably beat Keanu Reeves in a fight. (Or even have a better chance againstJet Li than he did before in THE ONE.)People say Shu Qi was annoying in the film, but I thought she was cute. Herperformance was very fitting to her character in the film, so it6 made sense that she wasn't a confidant, Julia Roberts type of character.Corey Yuen's best modern work can be seen here. He actually did a better jobwith the action scenes here than in KISS OF THE DRAGON. He didn't evenhave to make blatant references to his other works in this film. His ideas were much more frsh this time. It made me think of the days of RIGHTING WRONGsand FONG SAI YUK.Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen have also written their best screenplaysince THE FIFTH ELEMENT.

Total Letdown,"If you go to see the Transporter with hopes of seeing something similar to ""Leon the Professional"" or ""The Fifth Element"", you are in for a complete disappointment.  The plot of ""The Transporter"" is WEAK and the action is completely un-inspired. You can see much better fight sequences from many of the standard action movies available (Matrix, Kiss of the Dragon) without the ultra cheesiness that came with this movie.The heroine was an annoying character that became even more annoying due to her ""random"" transitions between english and mandarin. Don't worry, her dialogue wasn't worth subtitles so we didn't miss out on any translation.Throughout the movie it seemed like Luc Besson was deliberately attempting to minimize the kill ratio in this movie, JUST to maintain a PG-13 rating (i.e. throwing a knife in between a persons legs vs. in his chest).

Turn-Your-Brain-Off Fun,"Being a Jason Statham fan, I had downloaded the Transporter trilogy to watch and hopefully enjoy. Having seen the first one, it was ludicrous. I was laughing at its ridiculousness and at some points, I was cringing. Frankly the only cringe-worthy aspect of this movie is the actress who played Lai. I'll give her credit, for someone who doesn't usually speak the English language she spoke it well, but it doesn't make up for her bad acting. She's not the worst actress ever, but she wasn't that great.The plot is unrealistically silly and just an excuse for Jason to kick some butt, and that's totally fine by me. This is a movie where people talk instead of shoot, and only use guns when there's a convenient opening for the hero to escape. Jason plays Frank Martin, a driver-for-hire who will drive children to school or act as the getaway for a group of thieves, or deliver anything--no questions asked. He's got three rules: no changing the deal, no names, and never open the package.Soon enough, he's given a job to transport a package that just happens to be a woman named Lai, and from there, things get complicated. He simply gives her a drink, but that still breaks one of his rules, and before he knows it, his car explodes shortly after making the delivery. This gets Frank tangled up in a human trafficking operation that he feels obliged to stop, partly because Lai is one of the key figures in it.We've got catching up to speeding trucks on parachutes, grease fights, bike pedal kicks to the face, and legions of henchmen battling a shirtless one man army.

The Transporter: Birth Of A Franchise.,"This is a fairly unique concept movie, by French director Luc Besson.
As of Nov 2020, almost 20 years old, spawning two sequels.There are really four 'Stars' - Jason Statham, a former British Olympic diver
(note that Jason normally has an underwater scene in his movies); Shu Qi,
from Taiwan then on to Hong Kong (she didn't speak English and spoke her
lines by rote); Francois Berleand, a well known French actor AND... a car.In many respects The Transporter series is all about... the car ... and driver.
In this first movie, the auto was a BMW 735 (normally a V8 automatic), now
refigured as a custom manual V12! So it has speed and massive torque.Jason transports whatever with a set of ""rules"", and breaks them with a ""package"" - which causes all sorts of mayhem. As a former 'Special Forces' operator he's pretty handy with his fighting skills (NOT a Martial Artist), but has since learned quite a bit. Throw in human trafficking, gangsters, and you have a movie.The Transporter is made with the usual French Flare and it's well worth a look.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Hero Worthy of a Better Film,"Frank Martin is a ""transporter"", which in this context seems to be a euphemism for ""courier to the criminal fraternity"". For the right fee he delivers ""packages"" around Europe, subject to three self-imposed rules. First, he will never change the terms of a deal once it has been agreed. Second, he will ask no questions about the identity of the persons with whom he is dealing. Third, he will ask no questions about the contents of the package- and will certainly never open it. The film deals with what happens when Frank breaks his third rule. On one journey he notices that a package, which he had assumed contained something inanimate, is moving, and obviously contains something living. Frank opens it to find that what has been consigned to his care is actually a beautiful young Chinese woman.Frank now begins to question his amoral, no-questions-asked philosophy. He learns that the girl is called Lai, and that the men who hired him to transport her are involved, together with her father, in an illegal scheme to smuggle Chinese immigrants into Europe. Frank decides to protect Lai, but in doing so he discovers that both he and she are in danger from the ruthless people-smuggling gang.Jason Statham seems to be Britain's first entrant into the world of the tough-guy action hero, previously dominated either by Americans (Stallone, Segal, Diesel) or Continental Europeans (Schwarzenegger, Van Damm, Lundgren). On the evidence of this film, he seems to be able to act a bit (something that cannot be said of all his rivals) and makes Frank a stylish hero, a mixture of East-End bovver boy and James Bond. On the one hand his expensive BMW cars, his smart tailor-made suits and his elegant home (a converted lighthouse) on the French Riviera speak of a Bond-like sophistication. On the other, his skinhead-type haircut and his tough-guy manner betray his working-class roots. (He would have been more convincing as a Cockney, but attempted to play the role with an American accent, doubtless to pacify that section of the American market that regards British English, especially when spoken with anything other than a ""posh"" accent, as an incomprehensible foreign tongue).In many ways, in fact, I felt that Frank was a hero worthy of a better film than this one. The film's numerous chase sequences show the influence of the Bond films (especially the sequence near the beginning where Frank uses his driving skills to escape from the police, at one point making a daring leap to insert his car onto the upper deck of a car transporter), but it lacks the wit and style which are the hallmark of the Bond series. The nearest it gets is a sort of grim gallows humour. (Frank refuses to drive the getaway car for a gang of bank robbers because there are four of them, rather than three as he had been led to believe, so the leader of the gang solves the problem by shooting dead one of his own men). The film also lacks a notable leading lady. Shu Qi is a well-known actress in the Far East, but this was her first English-language film, and she did not seem fluent enough in the language to be a credible heroine.As with most films of this type, spectacular action is more important than plausibility; the action sequences generally involve feats that would be improbable, or even impossible, in real life. As always, the villains fire off vast quantities of ammunition from powerful automatic weapons without ever once finding their target; action heroes and their girlfriends obviously have some miraculous immunity to bullets. Most of those reviewers who have defended this film have pointed out that action-adventure films are not supposed to be realistic. That is a fair enough point, but the main problem with the film is not a lack of realism but rather the lack of a decent plot. The first half, up until the point where Frank discovers who Lai really is, seemed clear enough, but the second half just seemed a confusing series of chase sequences, shoot-outs and martial-arts fights. It is all very well using a mixture of kung-fu skills and CGI techniques to produce a piece of pure escapist entertainment, but I always find that sort of escapism to be more entertaining when it is placed in the context of a plot which, if not strictly realistic, is at least comprehensible. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Seriously, I am sure she is a nice girl but that screaming coupled with her body (or there lack of) honestly grated on my nerves. I would have given it a ten for yummy Jason, but gawd that screaming. I do have to admit that while her acting is a little rough around the edges, she can do a lot of things on cue ie: When she shot her father, she cried and her voice shook and it was believable.

90s style action in the 00s,"'The Transporter' may not be Jason Statham's introduction into the world of on-screen action heroes, but it was certainly the film that cemented his potential as more of an 'old school' tough guy. Since the early 2000s, action films developed a severe case of over-seriousness. Gone were the days of witty quips and wry smiles of the Arnie and Stallone era, replaced with grim protagonists and gritty surroundings.That's why 'The Transporter' is so great. It totally knows what it is, i.e. big, dumb fun that's only trying to entertain, rather than deliver any sort of 'message.' Jason Statham plays 'Frank' an ex American marine with possibly the most 'questionable' American accent ever (seriously, it flits between London and New York approximately ever other word!). He specialises in driving for a living, or rather driving anything illegal from point A to point B in a severe hurry.However, his professional attitude to his work is severely tested when he begrudgingly opens the boot of his car during a job, only to find a young Chinese girl tied up in there. Naturally, his conscious is tested and it's up to him whether to deliver this girl to her - obvious - fate, or help her out. Luckily for her, she's quite pretty and therefore makes up the perfect love interest to our bald, rugged anti-hero.I would probably say that there's zero original content in this film. If you've watched enough action films then you've pretty much seen everything here and possibly done better. However, that isn't really too much of a criticism as 'The Transporter' is just such damn good fun. It has good looking heroes, evil dastardly villains, beautiful locations, great action and punch-ups. But, most of all, it never takes itself seriously in the same way as the 'pre-Craig' Bond movies did.And, if all that isn't enough to get you sit down and watch it - for the ladies - you get one hell of a look at a totally oiled-up Jason Statham, beating one goon after the other while he slips, slides and slaps his way through the bad guys - all gooey and topless.

One to watch over and over again!,"I can honestly watch this film over and over again.Jason Statham makes his first appearance as Ex-Special Forces operator Frank Martin who lives a quiet life in the French Mediterranean, but hires himself out as a ""transporter"" who moves goods from one place to another. No questions asked. Frank adheres to a strict set of rules, which he never breaks. Rule One: Never change the deal. Rule Two: No names--Frank doesn't want to know who he's working for, or what he's transporting. Rule Three: never look in the package. However Frank's newest delivery makes him break some of his rules.He's been hired by an American known only as ""Wall Street"" to make a delivery; but when Frank stops along the route, he notices his package is moving. Violating Rule Three, Frank looks inside the bag, finding its contents to be a beautiful, gagged woman played by Qi Shu.Frank realises what evil man Wall Street is and he sets about destroying a human trafficking organisation. he gets some help from his friend and Police Inspector Tarconi played brilliantly by François Berléand who adds some humour to the film (and subsequent Transporter films).But what makes this such a great film is the introduction to film of the great character of Frank Martin, brilliantly played by Jason Statham.The fight scenes are really good and the ending does not disappoint.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Bad, VERY bad action flick","While few people go to see an action film for a ""deep"" story line, most would like to see something that at least makes cohesive sense. And the simple fact of the matter is that The Transporter cannot even manage this. Sure, most of the action sequences are reasonably well choreographed, and Jason Statham is quite engaging as the titular character, but neither of these is enough to save a film that chokes on one of the worst scripts of the year. Luc Besson's fall from grace is complete. Even last year's Kiss of the Dragon was smarter than this - and that really is saying something. By the film's end, every single person I attended the screening with had two major complaints: First and foremost - how completely non-sensical the script was (to the point where Lai Kwai's actions have no motivating basis at virtually any point in the film). Secondly - one of the worst musical scores in film history. Mr Stanley Clarke, stand up and take a bow. Any score that so completely overplays the action scenes to the point where sound effects are actually lost in the mix, is one that is worthy of sincere disdain. There were plenty of other criticisms levelled, but these were the main two that really grated on all of us.Do yourself the biggest of favours and avoid this tripe at all costs. Maybe, just maybe, The Transporter is worth a late night rental from the video store when you have absolutely nothing better to do and are in the mood to ""Spot the flaws"". But otherwise, just don't do it.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is a great film,"This picture is pure action and is a perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood today. It keeps forcing ridiculous female heroes and boyish men in the role of hero. Jason Statham is tremendous ,the bad guy( who I recently saw in Steven Seagals atrocious Out of Reach) is also great. Shu Qi is gorgeous and the film is beautifully shot ,the fight scenes are sharp and unpretentious.The dialogue at times is dodgy as is the soundtrack but I would actually buy this on DVD and be proud of that fact. If people say an overlong pretentious piece of excrement like Le Grande Bleu(also by Besson) is a masterpiece then the the Transporter is a modern action classic",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a great surprise!,"I only saw this film because my local Warner Village had both 8 Mile and Gangs of New York sold out. I wasn't looking forward to it at all after seeing the trailer - the footage of Statham deflecting a missile with a tray looked especially awful.Thankfully to my surprise, the film was amazing!  It had both me and those that also reluctantly saw it with me in a complete state of shock. Statham was excellent (unlike his performance in The One) and the chemistry between him and Shu Qi's character (I always knew her as Hsu Chi) was both amusing and heart warming when appropriate.The action scenes were fantastic, Statham carried them very well and the editing was not too noticeable.  I would even go as far as saying that the scenes were better than previous films that Corey Yuen has worked on with Jet Li.  Although it goes without saying, that when Li is used correctly he is phenomenal...I highly recommend this film - great fun!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stylish European mayhem from beginning to end.,"I had heard nothing good about this film, but as I started to like Jason Statham in Jet Li's 'The One', I thought I would see his headlining performance in 'The Transporter' when it came to the UK.I had already heard that the director was only interested in stunts and that Statham's accent drifted from faux-American back to archetypical Mockney. I had already read that there was no plot to speak off and that the whole enterprise was unrealistic.Having seen the film and been flabbergasted by its stylishness, I don't think these valid criticisms touch the film.Jason Statham is the Man. Tough, composed, laconic and absolutely ready and willing to take on any number of hostiles. How can he be so good at this kind of martial mayhem? How can he be so flexible? I have seen generations of genuine martial artists take to the cinema - Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Olivier Gruner, Cynthia Rothrock, Don 'The Dragon' Wilson - but on the basis of 'The Transporter' these have nothing on Jason.There are enough stylish and imaginative stunts to make me think this film is at least on a par with the best James Bond films.Other attractive features are the beautiful vistas from Southern France, the well-placed musical tracks, the villains who are 'well 'ard' and 'serious'.I don't know how an obscure British actor gets to star in a film that opened at cinemas in the USA and didn't go straight to video in the UK. I hear that Jason Statham will get to do another two films. I really can't wait to this guy in action again.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Excellent and funny action flick,"My wife and I went to see this movie, because we could not get into the sold out James bond movie which I was not too interested in seeing in the first place as that series just keep rehashing the same old corny plot over and over again.As we got to our seats, I could not help noticing that the theater was filling up quite nicely, something which I did not expect, thinking that this was going to be just some B movie that no one would bother to go see. Now when I see a movie theater filling up, that usually tells me that the word of mouth has gotten out regardless of what the movie reviewers have been saying about the movie. People just tell their friend to go see this movie.I had already seen a movie with Statham , Ghost Of Mars which I liked a lot. You know the type of cool midnight movie action flick which most guys love with their popcorn and soda. So although I was not expecting an academy awards performance I know that I generally liked Statham 's persona.Well the movie finally started and right away I was pleasantly surprised , I even commented to my wife as we were watching , "" I'm really liking this movie"". Statham plays an interesting character as an ex Special Forces type that retired on the coast of France, taking work on the side as a transporter of extremely hot illegal packages that even the criminals would not want to transport themselves. He is a no questions asked one man Federal Express type  transporter of  illegal goods. He is just the right person for the job too, highly experienced ex military ,  quick thinking , organized and effective and can't be pushed around by even his hardest core customers. Now Statham is a meticulous professional that takes pride in his work, who lives by a set of simple rules. 1) Once you agree to the contract, it does not change, 2)  No names / no questions  asked   3) never look in the package.Well the story is basically what happens when he breaks rule # 3. I will leave at that for those who may not have seen the movie yet.The action sequences are very well done , the pace of the plot is fast and the dialog is quite funny.This gets a 9 out 10. Not because it academy awards material , but because that is how I felt when we came out of the theater .",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Transporter Broke the Rules,"Glad I decided to watch this film on TV as I really wanted an action filled film with a great plot and I soon found out this film had everything from Soup to Nuts. Jason Statham,(Frank Martin),""Cellular"",'04, was a no mess around guy, who did all his work by the book, in other words, Step 1., Step 2., & Step 3. No names mentioned and a prompt delivery of the merchandise and never open up the cargo to be delivered. Frank Martin had a fancy life style and lived in a fabulous home and had great talents in driving a car where no one else would dream of driving. However, Frank made a bad mistake and happened to opened up a bag of hot enjoyment and trouble. In this film there is plenty of action, even romantic and sexy scenes and bloody fights and very fancy steps of self-defense. QI Shu (Lai),""Mei Ren Cao"",'03, gave a great supporting role to Frank Martin and managed to get him just where she wanted him, flat on his back.

90 Mins Of Pure HIGH-Octane Action!!,"I think many critics went to this film expecting something totally different then what this film was trying to be. Critics were actually looking for a quality detailed plot and Oscar winning performances. I can tell you right now that the Director: Luc Besson wasn't even aiming in that direction at all. The actual plot of this movie was definitely an afterthought. I'm not going to bother going into full detail of the plot either, cause everyone who has seen this movie knows what it's about. I want to comment more so on the performance of Jason Statham. Can this former unknown carry an action movie and could he be the next Arnold, Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Bruce Willis or even Vin Diesel? Well..I don't think he's any of them, as he has his own style, but I think he has the potential to be a great action star. While all the other actors are great action stars, most of them can barely act. Vin & Bruce had their moments (Pitch Black & The Sixth Sense), but the others are pure action actors with one line dialogues. I think Jason Statham has charisma, style, personality, wit and the look. He has a unique way of delivering his lines. He does it with coolness and confidence. In the Transporter he does this adamantly and his fighting abilities are pretty awesome as well. People forget that he was in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch and even The One w/Jet Li. He'll be in The Italian Job next.As for the movie itself, I loved it. I went into the theater expecting continuous action with a small plot to move the story along and that's what I got. I was happy that the producers didn't show ALL of the action scenes in the trailer like many of them like to do. There was still a lot of special effects and stunts that weren't in the trailer. If your bored and need a little excitement in your life get to the theater and see The Transporter. If you want to see an even better action film get Jet Li's FIST OF LEGEND. You won't be disappointed.B-ACE",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good start......but then what?,"After the first 10 minutes I was thinking to myself this is going to be excellent. After the 11th minute I realized I was sadly mistaken and it was just the same old, same old action thing.The title character played by Jason Statham was just so sharp when he first appeared and he was one I thought I could really take an interest in as he seemed so different. Wrong again!! That illusion lasted the same length as it did for me to come to my first conclusion.Qi Shu was actually quite able in her role as Lai, the hard done to female who get's associated with our hero, but the other characters were just the usual types that you would expect to inhabit this kind of movie.The Transporter had such promise if the character had been fully utilized instead of being turned into a Michael Dudikoff wannabe and the storyline actually been given some substance, but instead I would consign it to the shelf along with the likes of Missing in Action, Bloodsport and Under Siege. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

So sad.,"The movie was great.  The sad part is that there are people out there complaining about a weak plot and storyline.  Might I remind you that this is an action movie that's supposed to be in the style of violence and not sophistication?  I think people need to learn to understand that.  Do you go to see Titanic wanting to see martial arts?  How about White Oleander wanting to see animals in their natural habitats?No.  So take this for what it is.  It's an action movie.Having seen Statham in Snatch, it was quite a great surprise seeing him as a martial artist, but also sad since he could've used that in The One with Jet Li.  The only other guy that I think could've done this better was Gary Daniels.  British guy, martial artist, muscular.  That's all there really was too it.So, don't go to this movie expecting a grand moral lesson at the end for your children.  Don't go to this movie if you want to see the triumph over racial hatred.  Don't go see this movie if you want to see a relaxing, long, non-entertaining movie.See it if you want to see awesome action sequences.  Because this movie sure has those.(8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
BMW  Chase Scenes and Martial Arts!,"While The Transporter may not be the most provocative action thriller to some, it packs an amazing punch based on two of its action themes that I truly love: intense driving sequences of the ultimate driving machine BMW, and superb martial arts correagraphy.  Statham is an up-and-comer with great screen presence and I also hope to see more of Qi Shu in American films. Although the story line could have been more polished, the illegal smuggling of Chinese was an interesting twist and I would enjoy a movie that delves deeper into this all-too horrific reality.  The two main characters, Frank and Lai, and their relationship is something that left me wanting more.  I would love to see a sequel, perhaps Frank can set up his transporting business state side with Lai helping him out.

All The Transporter offers are big car chases and fast fight scenes,"And as luck would have it, those big car chases and fast fight scenes make up almost the entire movie. Seeing as the chases and fights are extraordinarily stunning, The Transporter succeeds! This movie really is the same as most action movies out there. Great action, lots of excitement, explosions, guns, hand to hand combat, lame love story that nobody cares about, and no originality at all. I for one don't care about the lack of originality. I thought the action topped almost everything XXX tried to do. It's not THE best action film of the year (that would be Bourne Identity or Die Another Day) but it buries the rest of this years action letdowns like Ballistic or Rollerball in a fraction of a second!There's one thing I wanted to point out. The huge climax with the Trucks on the highway at the end seemed strangely familiar to me. I think somebody was watching Raiders Of The Lost Ark a little too much when they wrote the script.As for the star, Jason Statham, he has the fighting style of Jet Li, and the coolness of Vince Vaughn and Vin Diesel combined. This guy is too cool to go unnoticed. If he's not making 10 million a movie in a few years...... then...... maybe it will take a little longer......So, in the end The Transporter is exactly what it tries to be. An amazing 90+ minutes of watchable stunts and fights, with a lame love story that nobody cares about, and a plot that's so unimportant that I barely remember what it's about. I think The Transporter rules. You might disagree. But what do I care what YOU think. I don't have to live with you.7.5 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Irrational action,"Well, I wouldn't have expected this kind of screenplay from the man who directed Fifth Element, Leon, Nikita and the Big Blue. If one would summarize the film in one sentence it would be: irrational action from the start. The plot was really illogical. For instance, why on earth would someone want to pay 40 000 dollars to someone to transport a daughter of a boss (who runs a criminal organization) to another place in the same country? Why didn't they do the `transport' themselves? It never came out why they wanted to transport the daughter to another place in France in the first place.I don't like about films that contain impossible stunts either. What do you think about the following stunt: the key figure in the film jumps ten meters from a moving truck to another and performs a somersault from top of the truck keeping hold of the roof (?!) and smashes the windscreen kicking the bad guy inside the truck. What's the fun of watching a film like that? The film let's you think that the good guy must be a god, because he can perform actions what humans are not possibly able to do. Therefore, you (the viewer) think that there is absolutely nothing that can happen to the hero and there is no point watching the film, since you already know what's going to happen. Such stunts are logical when a robot from the future or someone in the matrix does them but humans aren't supposed to be able to do such actions. I think though that the actor, Jason Statham has talents and I hope he will be seen in more classy films in the future.For your information directors and screenwriters: viewers are intelligent creatures and don't appreciate that you underestimate them. The films like The Transporter may interest viewers for a while, but in the long run they never make it in the big league.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very feeble attempt at cool action movie,"""The Transporter"" was recommended to be my a colleague as one of the worst movies he had seen in recent years. While I usually take claims like this with a grain of salt, in this I think there was a lot of truth in it. ""The Transporter"" is an extremely lackluster, uninspired attempt at making a cool action movie, which manages to screw up in almost every aspect.First, there's the story. It makes very little sense, and is so predictable and full of clichés that you can guess where it's going to go almost immediately. None of the characters, including the hero, are even remotely interesting, and everything is so rushed that there is no room for character development at all. You might as well watch some cardboard cut-outs.Billed as an action comedy, ""The Transporter"" does indeed offer a lot of action, but only very little comedy. There are some things that are supposed to be funny, but, with two or three exceptions, they really aren't. Unless completely inept and cartoony bad guys are still supposed to be funny...That leaves only the action. And while there certainly is a lot of it, and in spite of some impressive pyrotechnics, it's for the most part really dull. Apparently, the makers of this cinematic dud have gone to great length to make sure that the main characters comes across as really cool. The problem is that the things he does aren't even remotely possible in the real world, and are for the most part so exaggerated that they become unintentionally funny rather than cool. On top of that, the hero is so completely invulnerable that any tension there might have been is completely ruined.And finally, there's the music, which is in one world awful. For some reason, just about every action sequence in the movie is accompanied by either some annoying hip hop song or some totally nondescript and monotonous rock number.I wish I could find something positive to say, but there really isn't anything I can think of. ""The Transporter"" is an utterly hollow movie, with virtually no story and no characters to care about, full of action that is so exaggerated that it becomes simultaneously dull and unintentionally funny.* out of ******",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

Big mistake !!! After an admittedly cool introductory chase this is a straight and steep downhill deploying movie (Hint - leave right after it and do something else. It will save the evening !). Most treestumps have more distinguishable and varied facial expression than Mr.Statham flashes at the audience in this movie, the villains are utterly faceless styrofoam cutouts, the ""plot"" has holes in it the size of parking lots and some of the surprises are so hare-brained ( I mean, what villain has a packaged and primed timed-explosive-device ready for deployment, while frolicking in his gardens, just in case he needs to blow some unlucky courier to pieces if the whim takes him ?

was Van Damme not available ????,"All through watching this film - the thought that it was specially written for Jean Claude Vna Damme kept popping up in my head. The naff storyline, the kick-boxing moves, the lack of dialogue for the leading man, the army of nameless heavies, the almost compulsory Japanese bad guy / girl / even director. The plot - which i will NOT go into here - is rudimentary to say the least. The amount of times people just happen to turn up in scenes without any realistic semblance of how they got there is incredible - it must be a record for a movie. Couple this with the total number of unrealistic stunt moves carried out and you have yourself a bona-fide turkey. For instance, trucks propel themselves forward on their own without a need for a driver, a small plane goes from a hundred feet up in the sky to thousands of feet in a blink, the hero can somehow dodge a thousand bullets and still manage to incapacitate 3 bad guys with nothing more than a jumper !!! i watched this knowing what it was beforehand - a cheesy action flick - but it still took some swallowing to believe the plot. The best award must go to the guy who somehow managed to squeeze a further 2 sequels from this franchise. After the first film - the whole cast and crew should have been sent straight to DVD dungeon never to appear again. How they convinced anyone to make another 2 movies is beyond me.

Silly Hong Kong action thriller transported - for box office reasons - to the South of France.,"Given that politics and old age have side-tracked the last generation of action stars a search for new generation must proceed a-pace. Jason Statham was OK in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and a little better in Snatch (both directed by fellow Brit Guy Richie) so he is given the reluctant nod in this action no-brainer.The fact that he can do stunts helps too (although not all of them, unless he grew more hair while parachuting!) making him more than suitable for this nervous try out. Sadly he can't do the needed American accent to save his life!JS plays a strange ""no questions asked"" transporter. The guy charges more than Federal Express, but Federal Express don't allow the transportation of girls in sacks with tape across their mouths. When our hero breaks his own rules and interferes with ""the package"" all kinds of problems unfold.What we have here is - in all reality - a Hong Kong pot boiler with a bigger special effects budget. Sadly the script seems to have cost the same as it would down Sweat Shop Avenue and some of the dialogue is truly gut turning and terrible. Clearly the work of people that don't have English as their first language.However when it moves, it moves well, in a James Bond kind of way. The modern audience might not know it, but the quality of the stunts on display would have probably knocked the 1960's audience on to the cinema floor. How times have moved on!This product has nothing further to report on other than the fact that Taiwanese female lead - Oi Shu - is sexy beyond belief.

"Looking For Bad Movie To Watch, You Have Found It.","There no word to describe how bad this movie is. It is just another really cheap attempt movie.The story: The transporter broke his own rules by opening the package he has to deliver to the mafia. That when they decided to kill him and the girl in that package.It is a HUGH disappointment watching this movie. Frank acting was like bring a stuntman to make a movie; Qi Shu can't even speak right most of the time. The story is horrible, even worst was the score and the dialogue. All they do was adding fighting scenes from time to time.

Perfect base with nothing built on it,"The car chase scenes were great. The story shaped up so well and then after the transporter got to the container yard it went shallow with some of the ridiculous fight scenes.

Rule number 1; an action film should provide an audience with maximum entertainment,"Frank Martin is The Transporter a man whom will transport any package no questions asked and only asks his clients to observe 3 basic rules. However, when Frank transports his latest package he breaks one of his own rules on delivery resulting in his life being put in danger...The opening chase scene in this film is brilliant and set the bar for what this film should have been like for the rest of its running time. However, The Transporter is another example of a film where the opener is so explosive and exciting that it was always going to be a big ask for the rest of the film to play out in the same manner and sadly it doesn't....The story is fairly uninspiring and is barely given any focus; this isn't a problem in this particular genre if the film provides consistent thrills and spills and whilst there are thrills and spills at sporadic intervals there are also quite a few dull spots which sour the experience slightly. Statham is not the best of actors and like Arnie he is at his best when he is given lots of action scenes and cheeky dialogue that winks at the audience. To me, there is not enough action here and Statham was a little too dry and wasn't the commanding screen presence that he can be. Statham isn't helped by being saddled with Qi Shu who is a very poor sidekick and love interest.When the focus is on the action the film is quite good (as well as the very good opening scence) there are the action scenes with the trucks which were pretty good (reminiscene at times of the truck scenes in Raiders Of The Lost Ark), but like I say they come too few and far between for my liking leaving me feeling a little underwhelmed.The Transporter is watchable and is by no means a bad film (it does have some exciting and entertaining moments), but where plot and characters are weak it needs to compensate by thrilling its audience at every moment, but this film does not do that. It provides passable entertainment nothing more and nothing less.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

So predictable you'll think you've seen this movie before. Scenes run together so incongruently I wonder if the editor was even looking at the celluloid. The romanctic interlude is likely put in only for a nudity rating. Even the stunts are archaic. Jumping out of a plane with a parachute, ooooh! Leaping from an overpass to a moving semi, whoa.

Transport me elsewhere...away from this movie.,"Luc Besson has always been more of a visuals and styles than a story and substance director. His film Leon proved that but that was very enjoyable and was believable whereas The Transporter, well oh dear. This was watchable don't get me wrong, but as Hollywood trashy fun, minus the word fun mostly and it's just Hollywood trash.Well the basic story is that Jason Statham plays ex-army soldier Frank Martin who ""transports"" packages for anyone to earn money, but Frank has three rules, which are no new deals or renegotiation of old ones, no names and never open the package, but he breaks the rules and gets involved with a Chinese girl Lai (Qui Shu) whose caught up in people's smuggling.And that's it, the film suffers from lack of story or depths to the characters, which makes them uninteresting and you not care about them. Lai sleeps with Frank for no reason even though he treats her badly, though he is just doing his job. There are plot holes the size of a black hole like the villain goes after Frank because he opened the package, but he was nowhere near him when he did it, so how would he know? That's never explained. The script and dialogue is very cheesy and cliché. Also the acting is atrocious, no one can act in this though Statham isn't too bad, but he just wasn't convincing much at all nor was Qui Shu and even though Francois Berleand as Inspector Tarconi was good, the script didn't help him even though Frank and him have a history, that is never delved into. The only reason I gave this a three star was because the action was though preposterous was exciting and choreographed well with some nice scenery and music, but this was predictable and badly made mostly.

Promising start but after-wards it fails do deliver more realistic action movie,"'The Transporter' defined Jason Statham as action star but I think he deserves better as we have all seen his great acting abilities in debut movies ('Lock, Stock...' and 'Snatch'). This movie really starts fine as we are introduced with Frank Martin, ex soldier, who is a mercenary ""transporter"". He moves goods from one place to another and he does it with no questions asked. So one day Frank breaks his own rules and he looks at the moving package. There he founds tied women. Of course he decides to help her...Entrance car chase as we watch what Frank is doing for living has resemblance with Pirès/Besson 'Taxi' scenes and the whole story is set in France also. There are also clear reference with movies like 'Léon' or 'Ronin'. But never mind that, 'The Transporter' has obvious problems with reality, like lots of todays action movies. There are too many great explosions, our heroes special skills (drives with his feet, holds under truck at high speeds, bullets are not even wounding him...) and unbelievable acting from some actors (Matt Schulze is trying so hard to be bad that that is funny). There are some good fighting scenes with oil, on bus or at containers. Also Statham is good, Qi Shu pretty and François Berléand is French Alan Rickman (they look very similar to me).To say long story short; good action, brainless fun with new action star Jason Statham!",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Downhill Fast,"Luc Besson has traditionally given US audiences something more than your standard Hollywood action film, often with thrilling (La Femme Nikita, The Professional) or visually dynamic (Fifth Element, The Messenger) results. So what went terribly wrong with The Transporter? Perhaps it was the director's (Corey Yuen) heavy reliance on the stylized John Woo and Jackie Chan inspired action sequences. But that can be fun sometimes. Perhaps it was the improbable scenarios and James Bond like clichés. But that, too, can be fun, even when the diabolical evil mastermind waits to kill the hero providing him enough time to be saved. What really went wrong with this film was that the story and main character got lost after the first car chase sequence.Frank Martin is The Transported, played perfectly cold faced by Jason Statham. He is wonderfully introduced as a well organized, manicured, and precise driver hired for transporting ""packages"" for high fees, no questions asked. This is an austere man, following his own protocol and rules to keep his life ticking as perfectly as his watch. I wanted to get to know this interesting and reserved person from the moment he tersely negotiates with bank robbers on the first job we're privy to. He drives up to a bank at the strike of 10 am just in time to pick up his load - four bank robbers with masks, guns, and bank sacks. As he calmly explains that the contract was for three men, no more, and that he is not proceeding until the contract terms are met, the robbers threaten with guns and the cops start closing in around them. Through some good negotiation skills and some fancy and fantastic car handling skills, The Transporter soon has the men out of the situation and returns to his seaside home to clean up the minor mess to his car. BMW had several notable directors (Ang Lee, Guy Ritchie) shoot short films for the web, some with dramatically good results. The car chase sequence follows this theme with great results.But then something terrible happens with this wonderful start to the film. His next assignment, to carry a bag to a hillside mansion, turns bad when he opens the wriggling package to find a fresh and soft faced Asian girl with model good looks. Breaking his rule never to open the package results in some bad consequences. After he kicks two motor cops into submission, we loose the interesting guy and are left with only an action hero flexing his muscle and beating up on multiple guys at a time. The story about the thinking, motivated professional trying to walk the line as a precise driver in an imprecise and dangerous world turns into a mess of fight sequences and large explosions. Gone is the Martin with the clean suits and sharp dialog. We're left with a buff martial arts guy and no plot. This could be expected from the Hollywood studios and some of the lesser interesting Hong Kong action films but I expected more, both from the early hints of a real character at the start of the film and from Besson's earlier works. Sadly we're left with action fluff about as satisfying as cotton candy. Have fun with the car chase and oil spill antics, just don't be surprised if the sugary mass turns to air after the lights come up.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Jon Monsarrat review: decent action, but silly, like ""Independence Day""","Transporter, like Jackie Chan's Rumble in the Bronx, is all about the action, and the plot doesn't make any sense. And there were some very impressive scenes. But ultimately the action wasn't quite high-level enough to sustain my interest in the face of many plot holes.The motivations of the characters didn't make much sense. The policeman and the bad guy are friends for no reason I can see. I didn't feel any chemistry in the romance. There is a father-child relationship that doesn't make any sense. The protagonist is one of those criminals with a heart of gold, except in the first 20 minutes of the film, he does some incredibly ugly stuff I won't spoil for you. I can't empathize with a protagonist who'd do that. Some of the comedy with the lead actress fell flat. (You can't miss her, she the only woman in the entire movie with a speaking role.) A lot of stuff blows up, which is good, I just couldn't get the plot points out of my mind.Who should see this film:-- Action movie lovers only, and then only on a rainy day.

Caveat Emptor,"There are two types of bad action movies: the first is the action movie that doesn't even bother to put in a storyline, and simply tries to get by with some cool gimmicks and action sequences; the second is the action movie that tries to put in a story line to make it seem like a movie with substance...and fail miserably. This movie didn't just fail miserably. It failed with such spectacular flare that practically two-thirds of the people in the theatre, including myself, burst out into laughter and just about every scene. If you're looking for some mindless action, I suppose this movie may do, although even the action sequences (supposed highlights) are way too unrealistic (pretty much an attempt to create the White Bruce Lee, if you ask me).

But, Yuen, in the director's chair, doesn't know how to shoot those fight scenes, or the car chase scenes.The cinematography, such as it is, is shaky-cam. And, it is too close up. We know that Statham can fight, so by doing the close-up stuff, and doing too much cutting, it undercuts the stuntwork, and it makes you think that they had to cut because the actor couldn't do full, uncut fight scenes.The story has okay ideas, but even in 92 minutes, the movie is narratively uneven, so it basically starts and stops at irregular intervals.The Stanley Clarke film score seems divorced from the film, like it was something he wrote separately, and the editors just kind of cut and pasted it into the movie.

...and then it all fell apart!,"The Transporter seemed like a good, solid movie for about 95% of its running time.  To be sure, this is a movie where you must surrender disbelief before you walk into the cinema, in the genre of films like the Die Hard series and many modern Asian martial arts movies. Facts don't get in the way of a good story, and in a good story such lapses can be easily forgiven. This is sadly not one of those films, though.  I can only presume that the budget ran out, and deadlines did their damage, because after what seemed promising through almost the entire movie quickly turned into a shambles with one of the weakest endings I have ever seen.  I won't spoil what happens, although the ending could hardly be any more spoiled if I tried - suffice to say that you will leave the cinema thoroughly disappointed, and perhaps even tempted to try for a refund.As the film progressed, I'd been expecting to want to buy it on DVD if only for some funny scenes, alongside its impressive special effects and fight scenes (which borrow heavily from the movies of Jackie Chan in places).

However, the most disappointing aspect of this film was the blatent plagerism of Guy Ritchie's BMW ""Ambush"" short and Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".  If you see the movie it's obvious.

Above-Average action movie that lacked real danger,"When I first heard action superemo Corey Yeun was going to work with British actor Jason Statham to make a film called 'The Transporter', my mind started to think 'oh no - yeun has decided to ruin his career'.However as soon as I saw this movie, I was actually quite surprised to see Mr Statham pulling off some very impressive martial art moves however I think it was ruined by constant quick-cutting and MTV-style editing, which reminded me of the overly-cut fight sequences in Rush Hour.The film, which I'm sure will spawn a b-movie version called 'The Courier' and will probably star Steven Seagal or Dolph Lundgren, has Mr Statham a very good Courier with a pretty name, ie: the Transporter.He delivers goods and has very strict rules.  But one day he decides to break his own rules when he discovers he smuggling a pretty Chinese girl around France.The film has lots of good, excellent action sequences - which include impressive fight sequences - but you should never judge a movie based upon its first 10, 20 minutes of action.  This movie slows down, a heck of a lot - to explain its plot.The pretty Chinese girl's dad (whom I'm sure was wearing a lot of make-up) is in cahoots with an evil criminal with a goatee (you knew he was evil because his passport picture) to smuggle lots of Chinese immigrants across France.  Why?  Err, I'm not sure.The film suffers from horrible dialogue, fast-cutting and sequences where I felt Jason Statham's character was never in any danger.Overall this is an average action movie that could, should have been a lot better.Rating: 4.5/10",,Anonymous,Crime

It starts off well, but I zoned out about a quarter of the way through and was relieved when it was over.While beautifully filmed, as has been said, this movie has little plot coherance and much of the action lacks believability. We are never allowed to know who the characters are or their motivations and frankly, don't care one way or another about them.Plus, the editing sucks big time. Erratic ""cuts and pastes"" serve to pull the viewer out and add to the distraction. Not to mention the strong accents and lack of english subtitles for some of the dialogue. The only guys speaking clearly haven't much to say. (Don't get me wrong, I speak a couple of languages (asian and european) and have international experience, ""foreigness"" is not an issue. But here it's a major distraction.)Even the special features were a disappointment. The extended fight scenes were unedited and we saw the wires.On the plus side, there is an awesome soundtrack, good humor, beautifiul locations, cool car, generally good fight scenes and Jason Statham without a shirt is nice to look at. The commentaries were rather interesting, especially those of Jason and his point of view as a fighter.OVERALL, a B- movie, filmed as if it were an A one.",,Anonymous,Crime

For an action movie, it wasn't laughably bad as far as gratuitous fighting scenes, and the concept was pretty cool.Then, about halfway through the movie, it all went downhill, in my opinion. Every scene is full of endless henchmen trying to kill the  transporter, who had no shirt on and was glistening with fake sweat. This alone drives one away. In addition to that, they throw in some meaningless plot point *5P01L3RZ* about how the bad guys are smuggling in people from Asia! Wow! Few plots have never transitioned so smoothly! All subsequent action sequences were hilarious. Hilariously bad. I can recall vividly a car swerving to a halt on a freeway, to be hit at 70 mph. That was ok. The giant explosion ensuing, however, was a little unrealistic.In true Raiders of the Lost Ark fashion, he kicks the driver of a tractor trailer out of the side of the truck. The driver then falls, with the door, onto the pavement where he proceeds to actually ACCELERATE, continuing to travel at 70-or-so mph for maybe 15 seconds, and flies off a cliff, the dummy painfully obvious.

The action scenes are fantastic, like they were cut out from a James Bond movie. The fight scenes are amazing too. People complain about this movie is being over-the-top, but as a fan I must say I disagree. It´s like a Hong Kong movie and requires some fantasy to enjoy and don´t forget to turn of your brain.This one gets 5/5 as it is a true action classic.",,Anonymous,Crime
I enjoyed it.,"I rented this on strength of the recommendation of a friend. I enjoyed it so much I bought it. Contrary to what what so reviewers say I thought Jason Statham did a good job in the role.Plus, I like Luc Besson's writing.I'd give it 9/10, I hope Besson directs the sequel.",,Anonymous,Crime
Mmm. Pretty pictures.,"I mostly went to see this movie because I'd heard that the action sequences were snappy and the shooting locations were gorgeous. I wasn't disappointed. Jason Statham's ex-military-turned-super-precise-criminal barely held my attention, but I covet his house and its ocean view. This is one of the few action movies I've ever wanted to see novelized, because I can't help thinking there were some untold stories floating around (in Statham's mind, if not producer Besson's) which might've added a little depth to an otherwise shallow movie.",,Anonymous,Crime
Music different in theatrical release than on DVD??,"I thought the original music in this movie was by Paul Oakenfold.  I could have swore some of it was.  In any case, I don't remember the music being so lousy when I saw the movie in the theatre.  It totally wrecks watching this movie.  I could have swore the music was totally different in the theatre than on the DVD I rented this evening.  In most cases the music sounds like it was chosen by someone who would rather be adding music to something like ""Boyz in Gansta-land"" and actually takes away from the pace of the movie. I had to turn it off I was so put off by it.Just my 2cents.",,Anonymous,Crime
dry powder,"This is based on nothing. Everything explodes, but it blows nothing. The elements that were used on this film will be regarded, i suppose, as the main characteristics in action films from this first decade of the century. We have a specific cinematography, based on blue tones which in the end work as a kind of sober image, tough, hard. This is supposed to set the tone for the action, which will be choreographed, but also hard, heavy, sometimes violent. Editing has a fundamental part in all this, many times we, spectators, won't be allowed to understand exactly everything that happens. The Bourne features started this, i think, Casino Royale successfully exploited the notion, as well as several other films. Not this one. This is a collection of useless tricks, which don't work in any situation, in any part of the movie. There's nothing here. It emulates badly its references, it lives on a certain style, but that style is corrupted and it is incompetently used here.My opinion: 1/5 stay away.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Crime
Kung-Fu in France,"This is an enjoyable Kung-Fu movie (Not that you'd realise this from the way it's been marketed)The fight scenes are very well executed, and the leading characters are just as they should be.

Pure Fun,"Jason Statham is the Transporter.  For the right price he will deliver your package wherever it is supposed to go, no questions asked.  Unfortunately he makes the cardinal mistake one day and finds out what the package is.  His employers take exception to this and the action/adventure slugfest is running at full speed.This movie has a mediocre plot (the romance that blossoms and the immigrant storyline is somewhat cheesy) that is quite simply saved by the impressive direction and choreography of the action.  I have previously seen Statham only in supporting roles but here he proves that he has the ability to carry an action lead.  Sure, the character is the familiar quiet man who doesn't want to be pushed, but when push comes to shove he is more than able to deliver.I found the movie to be well shot, extremely stylish, and somewhat substantive.  If anything, it was the best action rush in awhile at the theater.",,Anonymous,Crime
Nice Blend of Action Styles,"A very interesting blend between the styles and strengths of Corey Yuen and Luc Besson.  This movie combines more different types of action than you would expect.  A Bond movie will have the great chase scenes, a John Woo film will have great gun work, and a Jackie Chan film will have great fight choreography and physical action.  This movie does it all very well.  You'd expect the great fighting from Corey Yuen, and you'd expect the stylistic action from Luc Besson, but it really comes together well, an excellent bridge between Hong Kong and Hollywood, emerging from Europe.  Thoroughly enjoyable, although the ending seems somewhat flat.  Some of the action work was astounding, all of it was good.  If you are an action afficionado, see it big screen.  I hope the DVD will have plenty of extras to show how the action scenes were done.-Rick",,Anonymous,Crime
Bus station fight scene?,"Hello all. Even as the movie is as great as it is I have to mention some stealing that has occurred, stealing from another movie. The scene at the bus station is not just inspired by or similar to, it is close to a full replica of a scene in the Hong Kong movie ""Tiger on The Beat 2"". While this movie is not the best Hong Kong movie made it makes me sad that Luc Besson(and I admire him greatly) couldent create his own idea for this scene. Have any of you seen it, or do you not agree that stealing from other is not OK unless you show from where it is?

Ranks along down there with Stallone's COBRA or TANGO & CASH,"I caught this forgettable piece of trash this weekend.  Absolutely one of the three worst action films I've ever had the misfortune to experience. I've lost two hours of my life to this dreck.  Luc Besson has gone downhill since 'Nikita' - who the heck greenlighted the script?  Absolutely laughable action sequences become yawn-fests as the sequences stretch to fifteen-minute thrills-within-thrills-within-thrills.There was no chemistry between any of the leads, but then when you are forced to mouth inane lines, I guess all one can do is look forward to the paycheck...What a complete shame that Jason Statham, who has been extremely likeable in other films, had to do time in this monstrosity.On a five-star rating, this is one out of five stars",,Anonymous,Crime
Tongue in Cheek action,"This movie wants to be a blockbuster action flick but doesn't quite hit the mark.  The best part of the film is the slightly sardonic way that the main character, Frank reacts before he fights.  Despite the fact that he is a criminal, we are supposed to believe that Frank really would prefer a quiet life polishing his beloved Mercedes and that he gets dragged into fighting and car chases almost against his will.  I found this amusing.  I also enjoyed the novel ""oil slick"" fighting and the other fight scenes in close quarters.What I hated most was the contrived way Frank and the leading lady fall into the sack.  If beautiful women immediately had sex with every unassuming guy who could fight, men everywhere would be lining up for martial arts lessons. Of course, without beautiful women having sex with sweaty heros, where would the action genre be?It was a fun movie and as a woman I found the fight scenes unique enough and humorous enough to sit through with my hubby.  The thin plot was predictable, but at the same time it was comfortable movie to watch and over all I enjoyed it.",,Anonymous,Crime

A quality action set-piece of the Hong Kong variety that effectively showcases action man Jason Statham.,"There's not much for action fans to complain about here.  Everything is assuredly set up to capitalize on Statham, and he pays off.  Those looking for more substance in story and support will probably be disappointed, but taken as Statham's show, it's more than satisfying.  As for Statham, he's a breath of fresh air compared to the recent doses of fey leading men like Colin Farrell, Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey.",,Anonymous,Crime
Pretty Good - Bad Music,"I thought this film was pretty good - the action was great but was let down by a weak storyline. Of course like Bond and xXx there will always be 'impossible' scenes in films like this, but this just adds to the fun - wouldn't be much action if it was too real (guy gets shot, end of story...).Statham is as always great (see Lock Stock and Snatch for two great British films - oh yes 'raysond', he is British not French...).One last point, didn't think much to the music - could have been beefed up a bit! Music in the trailer was good, could have been better in the film (also version of the film I watched was missing the bit in the trailer where he deflects a rocket with a tea tray - anyone know why that was?).",,Anonymous,Crime

Statham as Frank, invites you to LIKE him..why? because he's likeable. Similarly, Francois Berleand is a major plus in his smallish but extremely effective role as the Detective who has been on Frank's ""case"" since he ""retired"" and set up home locally. Miss Shu is a major plus also, being very natural and extremely feminine as Lai Kwai a girl in the wrong place for MOST of the time.Awesome pyrotechnics, auto stunts, fight sequences and some decent laughs along the way...NEVER was the price of your theater ticket a better investment.

Unlikely hero wins the day,"This is the first installment of the Transporter series. The hero of the series Frank transports cargo without asking questions, but his enemies are not only the guys who are after his cargo.Frank contracts to carry any cargo for (mostly) underground clients. His attraction is that no questions are asked about the content of the cargo or what the purpose of transportation. One day, he notices that his cargo is moving in the trunk and out of curiosity he opens it and discovers that his cargo is a woman. Frank's trouble starts when he breaks his own rules of not to open the cargo.The hero of this story is unlike any other seen on the big screen. He's a guy with thinning hair approaching his middle age, but he's got a body like that of an Olympic athlete, and can move like a Tiger. Handsome and rugged, he's dressed in an expensive suit, and if I may put in my personal comment, he looks better in a suit than Daniel Craig does as James Bond in his suit.So there you have it. A super cool looking guy that becomes an unlikely hero for justice. He always ends up saving the ""cargo"" from certain destruction and at the same time saves the day.The story is good and acting by Jason Statham is superb.

The Transporter proves action movies can still be fun.,"*** out of ****The Transporter has little in the way of plot or character development. That alone will put off a lot of viewers, but for those looking for a slice of thrilling escapism, there probably won't be a more enjoyable pure action film all year. The filmmakers here have accomplished with a very moderate budget (30 million) that most big-budget blockbusters can't with three times the amount, and that is to work as a consistently entertaining thrill ride from beginning to end.The imperturbably cool Jason Statham stars as Frank Martin, a transporter who follows three rules. Unfortunately, he breaks his most valued code: never to look at the package. What he finds in the trunk of his car is a young, beautiful Chinese woman (Qi Shu) named Lai. She eventually tags along with him, as various thugs and henchmen try to kill him and retrieve her. From there, it's one brawl after another all the way to the film's eighteen-wheeler finale.Corey Yuen has always been an exceptional action director, and this time around, he stages some of the most memorable fight scenes of his career. Most particularly, I'm referring to the oil-slick fight, a delightful setpiece that displays a kind of (intentional) sloppiness that's refreshingly fun to watch. The high-speed finale pays homage to License to Kill and Raiders of the Lost Ark, boasting spectacular stunts and fast-paced mayhem. The film's last half-hour or so is virtually non-stop action, delivering the sort of virtuoso choreography that most of today's American action films lack (Equilibrium being a major exception).Overall, there's not much to say about the acting. Matt Schulze is terrible, as always, and Qi Shu struggles with her English (though she and Statham make for a surprisingly decent romantic pair). The lone standout is Statham, who's I'm convinced will be the next big action star. He has more charisma than Vin Diesel and is also a more physically agile performer, able to show off plenty of fancy martial arts moves in a completely believable fashion, even if he doesn't actually know any martial arts (who knows, he might).The Transporter's story isn't anything special. From what I gathered, it's about illegal smuggling and people being made into slaves. Basically, it's a script perfect for typical action fodder. A great story isn't necessary to enjoy The Transporter, which succeeds because of Statham's charismatic performance and Yuen's fabulous action sequences. The Transporter is tight and fast-paced, lots of fun, and a must see for action fans.",,Anonymous,Crime
Wasn't what I expected but still action packed,"So this movie has a story line that was really kinda messed up moving towards the middle of the movie but still, the action sequences were off the hook.

Like I had said about another review, I was waiting for the big ""punch line"" or whatever in the movie but again I was disappointed. I did like Matt Schulze who played the lead villain.

transported down the toilet!,"Good grief, what a wretched movie.  The first scene, though a touch over-the-top, was pretty good with the car escape from the bank job.  And that was it.  The movie then deteriorated into a kind of pretentious version of 70's/80's martial arts film.  The improved film quality and more expansive cinematography only made the action sequences seem more goofy. At least with the old kung fu movies you knew what to expect: low quality filming with silent film era special effects, but with blazing fight sequences.  Transporter was a joke....the british actor seemed slow and awkward by comparison, his opponents politely positioning themselves to take their licks.  I confess, I got sucked in by Luc Besson's name....I initially thought he directed it.  What the hell is happening to him??!  After Fifth Element, he kind of lost it.  Messenger seemed to signify some kind of psychotic break, and now writing credits for this?!  Not good.  I may skip his next endeavour and put him on rental probation.  Frankly, I felt embarrassed for those who gave Transporter good marks....I think I remember an exclamation of ""Excellent!"" within a couple posts.  I'm at a loss....how does one perceive in such a way?  Anyway, each to his own.  If anyone wants to get the most out of this film, buy a ticket to some other movie starting 15 minutes later and then sneak into Tranporter and watch the initial car chase...then go see the better movie.  Better yet, watch a trailer and call it quits.  If my memory serves, the previews contained the only worthwhile scenes of the whole reel.  3 out of 10 stars.",,Anonymous,Crime
Nobody Smokes Cigarettes Like the French,"For me Francois Berleand was the star of this movie as the worldlywise French cop who knows exactly who the Transporter is and what he does, but he approaches his job like a chess game where he's always a few moves ahead of his opponent.  Like the great Jean Gabin in those wonderful old black and white flicks, Berleand speaks volumes with a shrug, a glance,  a half smile or (of course) a puff of the de rigueur cigarette, without which it's impossible to be properly Gallic and suave.  Mr. Statham, for his part, seemed most engaged in the proceedings during his verbal rope-a-dope with Mr. Berleand.I have liked Mr. Statham a lot not just in those English gangster movies but in ""The One"" with Jet Li and John Carpenter's ""Ghosts of Mars,"" he deserves to be a star in his own right and this movie co-starring a vehicle should have been the right vehicle for him.  It's a shame he was given so little to do, aside from kicking the crap out of many people, which he does quite handily.  There's a lot of talk about ""rules"" in this movie and the movie itself obeys the rules of martial arts onscreen, one being that when the hero is facing a bunch of bad guys, they're only allowed to attack him one or two at a time, and they're not allowed to have guns unless they stand so close that the hero can disarm them.  Jacie Chan's classic shtick of picking up any handy item to use as a weapon is alive and well here, likewise Chan's trademark element of farce/slapstick, e.g. the oil-slick brouhaha.  And we have death-defying stunts galore and tire-squealing car chases and all sorts of goings -on.     Yet somehow Mr. Statham himself seems to get lost in the proceedings.It's really not his fault.  His character is very sketchily written, the plot seems to have been made up as they went along a la ""Casablanca,""  and the desired chemistry between him and the Chinese heroine just doesn't happen.  I don't know who the actress is or what she did previously, and she's, you know, cute and all that, but she just did nothing for me whatsoever, and apparently not much for Mr. Statham either.  She's no Bai Ling, let's say, much less a Lucy Liu or Kelly Hu or--dare I mention the name--Michelle Yeoh aka Michelle Kwan.  She's a cypher and even the writers seem to have grasped that; look how long they keep her bound and gagged onscreen to try to generate some fetishistic interest in what's happening with her.  ""The Big Hit,"" another movie with a kidnapped Chinese chick falling for the kidnapper, only took about five minutes to generate the romantic oomph that his one never really achieves.  The movie doesn't even bother including the usually obligatory closing shot of the of the hero & heroine alone together, as though acknowledging they were never really an item.As we knew in advance from the trailer, there's a scene where the bad guys approach Statham's house to kill him and choose to deviate from the French tradition of subtlety by firing a rocket launcher at the place.  The scene goes on so long it becomes funny, but stupid-funny not clever-funny.  One would think the bad guys at least would have made sure Statham was even home before unleashing more firepower than, I think, the French army used at Dienbenphu.  They seemed to know in advance they would be undisturbed by the arrival of police during their assault; maybe they'd read the script, assuming there was one.  But it did afford the French cop one of the best lines in the movie, when he drily asked if Statham would care to account for the thousands of rounds of spent ammo surrounding the remains of his house. ""Maybe they had the wrong house....""   Good one, Centurion!Bottom line, I did enjoy this but not as much as I was hoping I would.  If they do a sequel, maybe Mr. Besson himself will take charge next time & give us another cult classic like ""La Femme Nikita"" or ""The Professional"" ....",,Anonymous,Crime

straight to video for this bomb...,"Jason Statham had a nickname 'Turkish' in the Guy Richie movie Snatch which is probably why they hired him for this turkey. As the main star, he appeared to struggle in holding the picture together and was devoid of any deep emotion due to a poor screenplay and direction.  Sure it is an action movie, but generally you want to root for the main star rather than hope they get slaughtered quickly.It felt like a bad episode of Texas Walker Ranger with Chuck Norris (who would have fitted in nicely with a film of this calibre). To be fair though, Chuck Norris has too much style for the Transporter. Seems like Luc Besson (joint screenwriter) rehashed old material: dive scenes from the Big Blue, action from the Professional and start sequence from Taxis.  Individually good films, added together a miserable mess that should have gone straight to video.",,Anonymous,Crime
Jason Staham finally makes his mark...,"Looking like a Brit version of Bruce Willis, Jason Statham made his debut back in Guy Ritchie's classic crime caper/comedy ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.""  Since then he has been given a few side roles here and there in ""Snatch"" (or Lock, Stock 2 as I like to call it), John Carpenter's ""Ghosts of Mars"", and then he teamed up with Delroy Lindo to track two Jet Li's in ""The One.""  But who would've guessed that he finally got his own film, and a kick ass action film at that.  Ever since Corey Yuen and Luc Besson collaborated on ""Kiss of the Dragon,"" I knew that any film they did together from then on would be golden. And ""The Transporter"" definitely lives up to that standard. Sure there's nothing new here: how many times is a bad guy gonna get a change of conscience over a hot chick, right? And unlike the others, there is actually some good chemistry going on between our hero and his damsel in distress.Basically, the film combines some great European atmosphere (The beautiful southern coast of France) with some incredible fight and action sequences. Corey Yuen could pretty much create a fight scenario out of virtually any environment. Now I know you could easily replace Staham with Jet Li, but you know what? He really proves that he can hang with the big boys in this film. I mean, he did ALL HIS OWN STUNTS. How awesome is that? Not even our great American action actors like Sylvestor and Arnold can say that. My only criticsim of the film is that I think they should of beefed it up a little bit and went for the R rating. Other than that I think it's a great little action/martial arts movie with a European flavor. It will definitely make you reminisce over the days when Van Damme and Seagal used to make great Action fliks. I can't wait to see what Turkish has in store for us next.

"Good Action, But Could Have Been Better.","Already at the very beginning, after the car chase scene, this movie seems promising of heavy action sequences. The soundtrack is an important contributing element to the film's fast pace. Statham's performance as the calculating 'transporter' is exceptional.Unfortunately, a few sub-par elements take the shine out of this movie. Among them is a particularly bad performance by some members of the supporting cast, and (most importantly) a very weak plot. Basically every scene of the movie includes Statham, thus giving little opportunity to get to know the foes or their intentions a little better.All in all, this is a good action movie with very well achieved stunts.

I guess that's the artist's curse -- never living up to your best work.  Anyways, there are some Besson trademarks in the film, and the first 20 minutes seem promising.. but it's basically your standard action film after that.I don't expect a great plot or romance in an action film - but I have to say the love story was kind of sick, considering she falls for a guy that basically delivers her in a bound, gagged, and in a duffle bag to some God knows what fate.  But nope, instead of knocking him over the head, she makes him breakfast, and falls in love with him, all to a cheesy ""love"" soundtrack.

cue ball-headed britisher fails to pot,"There is a particular sub-type of film character perfect for those with thinning hair and vocal chords like truck engines, and we have seen a lot of his type lately. I speak of the shaven-headed hard man. Yul Brynner was an early example, stomping around Westworld looking hairless and deadly. Bruce Willis made the type famous, Vin Diesel is busy attempting to do the same again. But from the late nineteen-nineties there was another waiting in the wings, with a can of shaving foam in one hand and a can of whup-ass in the other. Jason Stratham.Those in the know have watched his progress in reverent silence, as stargazers might a passing meteor- here was one who, quite apart from romancing Kelly Brook, had a glittering Hollywood future ahead of him.Sadly, this film represents (at the very least) a worrying misstep. This ex-diver is out of the water and struggling.Let us begin as the film does, with a chase. There is no impression of speed, only a little fluff for the cinematographer's showreel and some rather limp comedy. Jason Stratham attempts cool (he's done it before, successfully) but ends up resembling Christopher Reeve post-accident, or a person playing 'dead lions'. Soon there are other action scenes, and a romantic subplot that I cannot muster the energy to describe, and a fight in oil- entertaining in its avowed non-naturalism, and a refreshing change from staring contests and pointless explosions. I felt a deep and crippling sense of ennui, and left with no memories of the film apart from fond ones of the hero's gloss-black executive car.Avoid this film! Not an abominable ninety minutes, admittedly, but such a waste. You could have made a model aeroplane in the time it took to watch this; you could have written a letter to an old friend. Do either of those two things instead of watch this film. Do something else, if you like. I can't pretend to know about your interests.",,Anonymous,Crime

I think it was directed in a way you do not typically see in a film of this genre.",,Anonymous,Crime
"The images say ""cinema""; the music says ""television""","Style over substance? Not really. That's what happens when the director can't resist the temptation to include what he takes to be a cool-looking shot and in so doing makes nonsense of his own story or characters or themes. What we have here is style WITHOUT substance. There's no reason, all things considered, why the characters couldn't have been more involving as characters: there's nothing in the slick, zippy pacing, or the lovely golden photography, or the stylish French setting, or the cleverly conceived and choreographed fight scenes (for once, the word ""edgy"" actually applies; there's something exhilerating about the way the editing is ALMOST too fast to defeat its own purpose, but not quite) ... there's nothing in all of this that COMPELS the characters to be ciphers.Partly for this reason it doesn't even matter very much that they are. The film's construction, down to the very rivets, is solid, so while a keener sense of everyone's motivation would be nice, the film doesn't really need this much to hold itself up. Remember, it does go beyond the call of duty in other respects. It opens with an exceptional car chase sequence, and the oil-wrestling scene (one of those things which everyone who's seen the movie is likely to talk about) shows how it's possible for the hero to plausibly defeat several bad guys at once in a novel way.My main problem (which also doesn't matter very much in retrospect) was with the music. ""The Transporter"" may look and feel like a real movie, it may BE a real movie, but the music kicks in it sounds like a dodgy, charmless television cop show. This is not just an association of ideas. Music like this is inherently wrong for the big screen.",,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome action horrible story,This movie  had some great actions scenes and one of the best car chases ever.  So at the beginning you think this movie is gonna be great.  You know this guy is going to get a package and he's going to open it although he shouldn't.  The movie could have been good if it had had a bunch of bad guys chasing him trying to kill him and he gets away and gets the girl.  It tried to be more and failed horribly.  I got lost through all the confusion and contoversy.  I wanted to fall asleep and just tell someone to wake me up for the action scenes.  Jason Statham brought great action scenes to this movie which is why I give it **1/2.,,Anonymous,Crime
A review of The Transporter.  The most satisfying action movie in a long time.,"The Transporter is an action flick that doesn't pretend to be anything else. It also happens to be one of the most satisfying movies I have seen in a long time.  The movie starts off slowly, with Frank Martin, The Transporter, played by Jason Statham, sitting calmly in his car waiting.  The entire first part of the story is designed to set up who he is and what he does. The Transporter is a man who will take anything wherever it needs to go for a price.  In the opening sequence he transports a group of thieves from the location they have just robbed to a designated meeting point.  As he does so, we learn a little about his way of doing business (no nonsense) and get treated to one of the best car chase scenes the big screen has seen in a long time. The Transporter is obviously very good at what he does and Statham portrays him marvelously.  He doesn't come off as an Arnold type super hero, willing to kill anything.  He remains cool, but not glacial as surprises pop up. He tries to avoid fights in most of the movie, only kicking ass when he has to. Statham's performance was one of the big parts of the movie I really enjoyed.  Martin is obviously supposed to be a typical action star character, involved in high-speed car chases and running away from expanding fireballs, but he still manages to come off as human.  The fact that Statham is a really good actor (as demonstrated in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch) is a big part of what made the movie above average.The other really great part of this movie is the departure from the usual `hero meets pretty girl, falls in love and agrees to help her defeat bad guys' storyline.  It takes the better part of the movie for the female lead (Qi Shu) to convince him to help, and when she does it's only in part because he's going to be stuck in jail if he doesn't.  There is no final showdown with the big boss in a burning building, or prolonged kung fu battle and despite some of the seeming absurdities and a couple of Deus Ex Machina scenes, the story is completely believable in the world it sets itself up in.  Every part fits in well to the story and doesn't leave and blatant plot holes. The acting and basic plot alone would not be enough to make the movie truly enjoyable without the action and the liberal application of humor.  The movie is quite obviously an action movie.  If you hadn't figured it out from the advertisements and posters, it becomes blatant in the first 10 minutes. The advertisements promise car chases, fight scenes and explosions and the movie certainly delivers.  Apart from the usual action fare is a really entertaining fight involving a lot of oil, a high-speed chase in an 18-wheeler and a hijacked crop duster.  The originality keeps the audience from tuning out parts of the action as being simply rehashed from another movie.  My favorite part about this movie though is that it's really pretty funny.  It's not really a comedy, but there are a lot of little humorous movements spread throughout the story that keeps the audience awake and alert. I went into this movie expecting the usual formulaic action movie, and came out more satisfied than I had for any other movie I've seen in a long time. The action was amazing, the humor was subtle, and the story was head and shoulders above most of the action movies out there.",,Anonymous,Crime
Good but could have been better,"This has to be one of the better action films to come out in recent times, though being a big Jason Statham fan myself I must admit it has brought my opinion of him down a notch or two. The action in this movie is great. Honestly I can't fault it. It's quick, ingenuitive and damn fun. Jason's heroic posturing definately crosses the line and makes it a little ridiculous. The score was very strange, and made some potentially beautiful scenes seem a little embarassing. I was literally blushing in the theatre so it's a good thing theatre's are dark.The script could have been better by far. Jason is a good actor and I feel like his talents are wasted on this film. He didn't really play the unemotional fighting machine very well (a common problem these days which Lucy Liu is guilty of in Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever). Some of the scenes in this film seem to be irrelevant and could have been replaced with something that fleshes out the plot, rather than having a storyline akin to an 80's action film.Having said that, I still think it's a great action movie, although it had the potential to be something much more. It's fast, fun and furious. Go rent it.",,Anonymous,Crime
I think alot of you are missing the point.,"Alot of you have slattered the film because of unoriginality. There is something about this film that, if your not from the UK or don't know who Jason Statham is, you will find difficult to understand why the movie is the way it is. This film was never intended to be a great classic to go down into film history. The film was purely made to introduce Jason Staham to the action movie audience. Its was nothing more than a test. Anything else he does would, I'm sure, be ten times better and more original. It was produced very quickly so they could advertise his talent quickly. Thats why the story is so simple and the idea is very much a common one. This film was made just to help project Jason into the world of Hollywood action and to be honest he definately deserves it. The stunts were ALL done by himself (apparently he is highly trained in martial arts IRL) and he acts really well too.Sure the film is definately not original but when you consider what I've told you, you can understand why its such a plainly simple film. I still enjoyed watching it but only because of Statham and his great acting, unbelievable martial arts and suitability to action movie roles.So please, when you review this film, bare in mind everything I've told you above before reviewing it.",,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent rental material!!,"Does your mind need a break from the harshness of reality and all that painful ""thinking"" you have to do every day?  Then rent this epic, hit your mental ""pause"" button, sit back and ignore all the laws of physics you learned in school, and the stunts will seem waaay kewl..(almost rhymes, eh?) I do agree with many of the other commenters here, this is a so-bad-it's-kinda-good film.  But I don't really get all the comparisons between this and ""Matrix Reloaded"".  To me, they are not even really the same genre.  But everyone has their own ideas about that... One other point I'd like to make is that it doesn't seem quite fair to judge whether or not Statham has acting ability based on this film. Apart from the stunts, the script doesn't call for him to do much more than occasionally glare menacingly at the camera and look great with his shirt off.  Heck, a lot of us ordinary guys out here could do that (okay, we might have to spend a little more time at the gym first).  So maybe I'll wait until Jason plays ""Hamlet"" to decide if he can really act (I know he's worried now......)",,Anonymous,Crime
Oh how I long for the days of Die Hard,"On the heels of `XXX' and `Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever' comes `The Transporter', another movie that dedicates itself to non-stop action without care for much of anything else.  Jason Statham plays Frank Martin, AKA The Transporter. He is a courier, moving packages for seedy gangsters. He lives in a waterside home and drives a sleek BMW that would make James Bond jealous. The Transporter operates by three rules: deals cannot be changed, there are no names to be used and to never look in the package.During one of his jobs Martin breaks his third rule and opens the package, which has been thumping in his trunk for most of his drive. The cargo is actually a beautiful woman, (Qi Shi), and Martin is immediately attracted to her. But business is business, and he delivers her to the destination. After the delivery, the head thug (Matt Schulze) offers Martin another job, which he accepts. The package is a bomb, destroying the BMW, sending the very lucky Martin on a mission for revenge.This is an action film, top to bottom. The opening car chase and some hand-to-hand fights are impressive, but unfortunately that's about it. The villains can't compete with Frank Martin, so therefore nobody cares about the plot, the supporting characters are one-dimensional and they all blurt out horrible lines of dialogue. The blame goes to writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, who thought that only the explosions and karate chops would carry this movie. Action movies can have a brain, and last summer's `Bourne Identity' proved that.Even with all of the film's problems, Jason Statham is excellent in the title role. An alumni of Guy Ritchie's ensemble casts in the British gangster films `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and `Snatch', Statham proves he has the presence to steal the lead from Vin Diesel as the next big action star. Hopefully he'll be in some better movies, and turn out to be the next Bruce Willis rather than the next Jean-Claude Van Damme.Grade: C",,Anonymous,Crime
Great Action Movie!,"I only saw this film recently and I have to say that it was fantastic! I was interested because Jason Statham was in the lead.  I've seen him in LOCK, STOCK and SNATCH and not too long ago, I saw him in THE ONE in which he gave a great performance.  Here, he gives an excellent performance as well, and excels at the martial arts he is required to do as well.The story is very compelling. Another IMDB user pointed out a couple of plot holes, a couple of which I agree with, but besides that, the story is great. Apart from Statham there are great performances from Shu Qi, Francois Bernhard and Matt Schulze (THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS) as suave villain 'Wall Street'.  The action sequences are all handled brilliantly, such as when Statham takes over a speeding truck.  I strongly recommend this film.  If he keeps making films like this, Mr. Statham could join Vin Diesel as one of today's up and coming action stars.",,Anonymous,Crime
One of the All-Time best,That's how I rate it anyway.The action is very good...not your usual run-of-the-mill fare. Jason s. should have a nice action career lined up for him.

Jason Statham kicks some butt,"The plot was pretty weak (and a little confusing), the stunts totally defy real-life physics, and the ending was cliché. So I'm a little reluctant to admit it, but... I loved it! I guess I was just in the mood for an action movie, and this one delivers. Jason Statham (of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch) plays the lead. Who knew he had such a background in martial arts? There are some really innovative fight scenes in The Transporter, many involving props, in the style of Jackie Chan. And fortunately the best ones are kept a surprise and not shown in the trailer. So if that's your kinda thing, I recommend.",,Anonymous,Crime
Why does everyone hate this film?,"*MINOR SPOLIERS* To me The Transporter is to me acutally a rather solid action movie, even though the acting is terrible the action is really well done (I was supprised when the main character kicks down the door on that one drug lord). Also the car chase in the begging was pretty cool (same goes for the one in the end). I would acutally choose this film over Die Another Day or The Bourne Idenity. Also what I think what made this good was at some points the muisc is pretty good even though most of it is that Euro techno vibe. Finally the one thing that made this film good was the well done grease fight.Overall 8/10",,Anonymous,Crime

There is one fight sequence with some of that HK flourish, but the rest is tired formula mandated by studio. Also, Shu Qi is nice to look at but there are no sparks with the hero, and the obligatory love scene has no glimpses of her lovely figure unclothed, and is just awkwardly stuck into the movie with no reason other than it had to be there.

Do yourself a favor and go see this movie,Usually when I go to the theaters to catch a flick I come out disappointed like take XXX for example I was so ready to see that movie when it came out and Vin Diesel is my favorite actor but if they made XXX half as good as this one then you would have something. The fight scenes are as if they were handed down from Jet Li and the driving was in its own category. This movie is as if it was spawned from James Bond films and Jet Li films. During the battle scene with the oil was just the best thing I have ever scene in a movie. This movie gets a 10/10 from me. So do yourself a favor and go see this movie.,,Anonymous,Crime
deserves nothing more than a 1/10,"How can an action movie have so little action? The entire movie, except maybe 20 minutes, was all talk. I found this unnecessary, considering the fact that all the talk led to nowhere. That brings me to another factor that ruins the moive. There is a huge lack of plot. The movie seems to move way too fast paced. The chinese girl's acting was absolutely terrible, and whoever played the transporter also had pretty bad acting skills. This movie had several considerable flaws and plot holes. The most annoying part of it is the ending. I was all prepared for a really good action scene and it just stopped. Then I was disappointed. By all costs, avoid this film. Rent The Matrix. Rent Gladiator. Anything but this crap. For those of you who like guns, be prepared for a disappoinment. There were about 2 minutes of guns in the whole film. The rest was talk and some badly coordinated fight scenes. In all, The Transporter deserves nothing more than a 1/10, which is what it received from me.",,Anonymous,Crime
** out of 5,"Action is in a sad state of self-loathing these days. This is a genre that used to be about macho, adrenaline soaked fun. Now it seems to have been de-revolutionized into a contest to see who can hawk as many recycled ideas into their film. Now anyone who has been subjected to my flow of thoughts in the past will know that I am fully in favour of Luc Besson and his movement to bring integrity to action films that combines the big thrills with the tender art of French theatre. I guess that is why it was such a shame to see a film like this fail horribly at ever turn. This is the story of Frank, a transporter who helped criminals escape the police and also transports packages, no questions asked. He is good at his job, probably the best in the business. He lives by his rules and will die by his rules: number one, never change the deal. Number two, no names, and number three, never look in the package. It is rare to see that an action persona follows such a strict set of guidelines. He asks customers the weight and exact dimensions of their packages and maps out an exact time of deliver, but is a fresh and welcome change to the fold. Who ever said an action man can't be a perfectionist? But rules are meant to be broken, any individual with an active conscience knows that, and when they are broken there is usually little repercussion to accompany the crime. So what should happen if a man who puts his life on the line for his rules decides to break them one sunny afternoon? All hell breaks loose. After having to pull his car over to change a flat tire, Frank finds that the bag in his trunk seems to be alive. So being the gentleman he is, he buys whatever it is a drink. The bag turns out to conceal a young Asian girl who is bound and gagged. Of course with any standard action fare the villains find out about Frank's abundance of disclosed information, making him for death. One of this films major pitfalls is that it makes its central character extremely hard to like and except as someone with heroic traits. Frank is not a good guy nor is he a bad guy. He is a businessman who will do whatever it takes to get the job done and cares only for the payoff he receives from a mission accomplished. Unlike James Bond or Xander Cage for that mater he cares none for the people he deals with and the troubles they face. So when he decides to care for, possibly even love, this Asian girl and risk his life for hers it is hard to give heed to either party. I guess Besson himself is to blame for that, he produced and co-wrote the script to this film. But it is the direction from Corey Yuen that does this film the injustice that it is. Between trying to be as action packed as possible and as artistic as possible Yuen lands right in the centre with nothing with any meaning behind it or any thrills to aid it, to put it bluntly this film is just plain boring. The thing that made Besson's action masterpieces so splendid was that before divulging in action he made sure to have a full cast of characters and a story to back the needs of all supporting to the product. Besson supported his men with anything they needed to bring out the best in their character and in return they delivered him with fully emotive and humanly characteristic people. Here Yuen gives his men very little and they return the favour. Frank seems to walk in and out of action sequences like he has nothing better on his agenda to pertain to and the stories villain(s) are more annoying than threatening. With any Besson film there is a sensual romantic bond between the lead male and lead female. There is no exception here except the fact that it is entirely irrelevant. In one scene they don't care for each other, in the next they make love and in the next they never act upon it again. These feelings are not even made clear to the viewer in the end. The script also feels it priority to through in tremendous plot twists without explanation of given time to be exercised. If there is one pet peeve I have about action it is the whole `trust no one' scenario, especially when the director gives no time to explain of elaborate on any reason for this to be happening. Being as this is an action film there is undoubtedly going to be a mass amount of cliches. I will only touch on two of the worst offenders because I see them in almost ever film of this nature and am getting sick of them. The first one is the `untactful detainment.' This is where a henchman has the hero detained, usually in a headlock, and he still manages to take down all of the oncoming baddies. What is the point of putting a guy in a headlock if he is still able to beat up your men? The second cliche that gives me great discouragement to see is the `vehicular misconduct.' This is when a fight break lose in a vehicle, usually a transport truck, at top speeds on a highway.  You all know what I am talking about that scene where the two rivals try to fight and steer at the same time and one usually finds themselves hanging out of an open door or kicked out a windshield. This is one of the most recycled action sequences out there and trust me, it does not get better with time. I do not know who scored this film but whoever it was should maybe consider resigning from the action field and entering into low-grade porn. That's right there is porno music playing during one of the film's more intense action sequences, not only ruining the momentum and structure of the scene but also sacrificing any enjoyment from the scene. This is a very kaleidoscopic film. It is a wide array of shifting fragments and colours to come up with something new around every turn. It is truly a film of great potential with the talent, on and off screen to make for a great action/art film in the same vein as La Femme Nikita but falls flat on its face from what I like to call `XXX syndrome.' Meaning it features enough action to deliver the thrills but has such a mish-mash of a story that it is almost made impossible to like, and in this day and age of low rent film making, story is key.",,Anonymous,Crime
Redemption,"Finally, the action genre has a decent addition without the over-rated cast. Statham is a refreshing composition of style and poise.

If you think about the movie shouldn't have taken place, because why would someone care enough to kill this man for opening the package.  In my opinion the movie should have been done in half an hour. I would also like to comment on the oil scene which was the hot topic of conversation on this website.  The scene is harmless, and the only thing these lonely, homophobic morons can think about is the possibility of two men touching eachother.  In the movie the characther did this to prevent the Bad Guys from grabbing on to him.  All and all I give the movie 2 1/2 stars out of 5.

Action:A Failing Genre,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsGee,I don't know what's up with action flicks these days.Or rather,I tell a lie,I do know.In 1999,a film by the name of The Matrix starring Keanu Reeves was released,and it revolutionised action films and the way they were made,like one particular film will,say every 15-20 years or so.But this one unique film may not,in some peoples opinion,revolutionise it for the better.Dirty Harry,for instance,kick-started the cop-who-plays-by-his-own-rules movie,and Die Hard was the original one-man-must-take-on-the-terrorists-and-save-the-hostages flick which inspired many imitations.And in my opinion,a lot of the movies I've seen that have spun off from those two movies have been quite entertaining.But personally,I don't think The Matrix has had a very good influence on films.I think it's caused them to all be style-over-substance,as is definitely the case with The Transporter.One thing you certainly can't knock about the film is it's fight sequences.Cory Yeun is probably one of the best guys in the business to hire to chereograph these,as Kiss of the Dragon with Jet Li proved,so to have him as one of the directors as well is just fantastic for fight fanatics.Jason Statham pulls the fast kicks and knock-out punches off fantastically for,as far as I'm aware,a non-martial artist as well.But,if the story,characterization and dialogue aren't up to scratch,then these are but the faintest of praises in a giant sounding hallway of hollow whispers.In fact,I think it's time to take a stand right here.If movies like this and Vin Diesel's xXx are where action movies are headed nowadays,I think Hollywood screenwriters need to be made aware of their abundant shortcomings.**",,Anonymous,Crime
will have you in transports of mediocrity,"Jason Statham, regular in the cult movies of Guy Ritchie (lock stock... snatch) gets a stab at a lead role in a fairly high profile film. And a fair job he makes of it too. He plays a getaway driver for hire in Europe, and he is a professional who does not ask questions. Until one day he breaks his own rules and takes a look at the package he is supposed to deliver. Fortunately the content is the exquisitely sexy Qi Shu in a mini skirt. The caper evolves in predictable ways with heavy emphasis on the fight scenes - performed by Statham himself. The European setting is fresh, and the actors all do a good job with the mediocre dialogue. It is a formula that works, and this has been reflected in the box office. Be fair to the producers - this is a rather high budget movie for Europe, they need to stick to the formula to ensure a fair return on the investment. It is not some Indie art flick (unfortunately). Be fair to Statham - he is not big enough to heavily influence his characters or the writing, yet does a good job and has earned his right to the lead. Qi Shu, with her over the top style of acting, is rather captivating, and her large experience (and awards) in the Chinese cinema lends an air of steady character to the film. A note on the accents:- Statham is made to adopt what is known in the multimedia world as a 'trans-atlantic' accent, one that is supposed to straddle the English and American accents to be easily understood by Americans, English and European audiences. In this respect it works. Unfortunately it tends to annoy the British, who would rather have one accent or the other. It is more palatable to the US audience who are usually unaware when something has been altered for their benefit. Other nations, it must be said, do not appreciate strong accents or colloquialisms - it is just too hard to understand for non native speakers. So give Statham a break, he was not trying to play an American! In the same vein, Comments from the US that they cannot follow Qi's Chinese accent are unjust. Most people find such accents refreshing and in her case, very endearing. As Statham proves his mettle lets hope he has more say in these kind of things.",,Anonymous,Crime
Throwback,"For what this is it delivers.It is from the time before Bond and Batman (and Bourne) were 'serious' and harks back to the tongue-in-cheek action cartoons of the 90s and prior, American and Hong Kong, so watching it now it seems refreshing and a bit different, something made up to amuse.The transporter lives in a mechanical narrative of his choosing, getaway driver for all sorts of shady characters. His second rule is no names, no human connection with people. His first, no change of plans - the story stays the same.We see a first demo drive; where we would expect lots of crashing around a la the Vin Diesel franchise his driving is slick, miraculously so. He even lands his BMW from a bridge to a space just right for it on a towing truck in motion.In one of his rounds he breaks his rule and this introduces the unpredictable human element in the gears, a woman, that alters the story.The first time he escapes death he ends up with her back at his place. The second, he dives with her deep in the waters and of course in the next beat she gets out of her clothes and throws herself on him - the underwater scene COULD have been more sensual (not to mention a more veiled sex), scuba diving is after all Besson's Proustian madeleine of childhood memory.Besson's sensibilities are all right for this and he matches them with a Chinese director at the helm. This guy had done according to IMDb extensive kung fu work in his country that he brings here - the fights are in the Hong Kong style that Chan made famous, so more akin to choreographed dance than real violence. Not great in this style, but no one does it any more so again it sticks.The most amusing set piece here has Statham and a dozen goons rolling around in grease and trying to stand up, it's purely a slapstick dance number which ends with Statham gliding on the floor and out of the scene - you can see how the musical would go.This sense of danced fun bounced off against a Statham who can contain his amused smirk just enough makes up for the unexciting car chase mechanics; Vin Diesel is the go to guy for that. The formulaic plot and cheesy villains all add to this throwback videocassette-rental sense.",,Anonymous,Crime
