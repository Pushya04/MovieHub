"It really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, it was actually fine","To be quite honest, this final installment of Twilight was not as bad as most people have made it to be. The only kicker is that you need to know some background story. If you're a guy following your girl to the cinema because of obligations, chances are you're going to not get this movie and will likely give it a very bad review. But if you would just play along with the plot, listen to your girlfriend for info and accept the supernatural aspect of the story, you might just enjoy it. Just sayin' guys. Don't be hatin' just for the sake of hatin'.All in all, I thought Breaking Dawn Part 2 did the Twilight series justice. It was a great finale, and dare I say, surprising good too? It was.I was a bit worried after watching the trailers that they may have somehow made this into boom-boom-bam movie filled with action scenes to please the I-need-insta-gratification crowd. But no. It was very true to the book, despite the proclaimed twist. It was, really, a very clever representation of the story from a different perspective. Bill Condon did an excellent job. And I am also glad that the Twilight Saga is finally over. Phew.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Episode V - The Last Cringe (Part 2),"'The Twilight Saga' comes to an end in possibly the most subversively underwhelming way. However, you can't really hold it against this franchise for at least being very consistent with its quality.This movie is treating its moments of culmination as if it's been highly anticipated when, in actuality, the series has not been building up to the conclusion it reaches, which only happens due to a misunderstanding that's slowly resolved. The CGI baby is freaky, distracting, and just so perplexing that it's best left ignored. Bella apparently has a brain now, and with it a problem with Jacob imprinting on, and therefore protecting, her baby, as she's constantly leaving it in anyone else's protection other than her own. Edward has lost all of his appeal at this point, being left as one of the least compelling characters in this instalment. Carlisle, Alice and Charlie are my personal stand-outs, and are each noticeably absent or sidelined in favour of newer, more uninteresting characters. Michael Sheen's presence is felt more here than in maybe any other instalment, but still so brief that he's hardly all that interesting even though he's supposedly the primary overarching antagonist. The effects, score and camera work are on par with the previous films, which isn't saying much but there's not much else to say.A suitable end to an overly broody, dramatic franchise, with improved acting compared to the other films, and a resolution that just let's you know it's all over now.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
All That Glisters...,"It's amazing the effect of being dead, lifts your spirits, makes you happy, makes eyes red; it's as if you've been reborn, all those problems have been shorn, you're in control, you have a role, no longer torn.Alas the climax, is a little disappointing, an open chasm, where all threads cascade and fall in, while being shallow as it's narrow, it will leave you feeling harrowed, as nothing's ventured, nothing's gained, bone without marrow.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An improvement over Part 1, but goes out on a whimper rather than on a bang","As said in my review of Breaking Dawn: Part 1, I am neither a fan or detractor of the Twilight Saga, though in terms of the books I only lasted the first chapter of the first book. Of the movies, for me the best was Eclipse, and the worst New Moon. In terms of Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 I'd say that it is a marginal improvement over Breaking Dawn: Part 1 and ranking the whole saga I'd put it bang in the middle, but for a finale to a film series I found it very underwhelming.Does it have good points? Yes actually. I did think the scenery was really lovely, very evergreen-looking, and the photography did have some nice shots(some of the zooming though does get too much). I also thought that Breaking Dawn: Part 2 did have the best music score, courtesy of Carter Burwell, of the saga, and that Renesmee was just adorable. There are a few performances that were quite good. Michael Sheen does ham things up but he is gleefully fun to watch, Billy Burke is once again amusing and Ashley Greene is good as Alice. Dakota Fanning is also not too bad, I think an improvement over the previous instalments, but I have seen her give better performances in better movies.That said, I am still not convinced by the acting of the three leads. I will say though that Kristen Stewart does give her best performance of the series, she does finally crack a smile after looking bored previously, she doesn't mope around as much and she does show some genuine concern regarding Bella's situation. However, and it doesn't help that Bella(in my eyes) is such a dull and unlikeable character, I still didn't find her entirely convincing, her eyes show no signs of life, her face lacks expression and she has a lot of flat line delivery. Robert Pattinson does have some sweet chemistry with her, but he does look constipated a lot and his facial expressions have a tendency to be on the hammy side. They are not that bad though compared to Taylor Lautner, who is unbearably wooden here as Jacob and the constant taking off of his shirt got old quickly.On top of that, Bill Condon's direction seems rather uninspired. I am familiar with Condon and do find him a promising director/writer who observes things well, Gods and Monsters is one of my favourites, Kinsey is very interesting and Dreamgirls is decent. But there is little of what these things as good as they were on display here, so as like the previous instalment there is the sense that Condon was not in his comfort zone. A lot of things don't help though, as the dialogue continues to be clunky and almost like watching an overly-melodramatic soap opera- especially in the first half where everything is lacking in any kind of intent- and the story is plodding- though the beginning also manages to feel very rushed- in its exposition with scenes dragging on too long and very little that is exciting or surprising. The ending has no real gusto or emotional punch(though actually it still manages to be the highlight of the entire film), the fight scenes are clumsily choreographed, the opening credits go on for far too long and you just don't care for any of the characters.In regard to the special effects and make-up, they are pretty terrible here. The computer generated wolves manage to be both cheesy and stupid in design and manner and the red glaring contact lenses look dodgy and are more at home in a cartoon. While Renesmee as a baby looks so creepily fake that it is laughable, the be-headings are the equivalent of ripping the head of your favourite toy in a rage and the white greasepaint passing for make-up all looks blotchy and artificial. The closing moments are clichéd and reek of cheese as well, and the vampires are as far away from authentic as you could come. Overall, not the best or worst of the series, but for a saga finale it was underwhelming, where it had potential to go out on a bang it was more of a whimper.4/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Revenge of the Department-Store Manikins,"This movie cost a reported $120,000,000. In only 2 weeks, it's already doubled that take at the box office, but what I'd like to know is where all that money went. Not on sets or locations, since it's mainly set in the woods. Elegant costumes, to be sure, but you're not gonna blow 9 digits' worth of bucks on epaulets. The effects are sparse and nothing special. Fersher not on the writing (execrable screenplay by Melissa Rosenberg).So it has to have been on the actors. And boy, did they ever NOT get their money's worth. The entire film consists of people standing around like statues, reading dialog to each other, with an occasional flicker of attempted facial expression. Really, this is not an exaggeration. 80% of the film is literally people just standing there like an array of department-store manikins, spouting inane, vapid dialog.The entire premise of the film is based on the idea that the Volturi, self-appointed overlords of the vampire world, will not tolerate a human child being turned into a vampire (with some justification, based on terrible experiences in the past, when the tykes had tantrums and couldn't control their appetites). And now the Volturi mistakenly believe that Bella and Edward's new child, the regrettably named Renesmee, is one such, and they're coming to wreak vengeance on her and the entire Cullen clan — having politely given several weeks advance notice. All of this could have been cleared up with a little home video, or perhaps a Skype call. Ditto for the Cullens' attempts to round up witnesses to little Nessie's amazing growth spurt (newborn to an apparent age 6 in a couple of weeks). Could they just ring up their friends on their cell phones or e-mail them? Nooooooo, gotta travel twice around the world to ask them in person. And then they all show up in the Pacific northwoods, where they get to stand around like statues like everyone else. When there finally IS a flurry of action, the cameras move so rapidly and jerkily that you can't get any sense at all of who's doing what to whom.This is a terrible movie, all posing and posturing and protestations of undying love less sincere than a Twinkies commercial.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
great adaptation of the book,"People are weirdly bitter about this saga. It's a great adaptation of the book. The whole series of movies does a good job. Some of these reviews are from people who've not even seen the other films let alone read the books. These movies are for the book fans. They are cast perfectly; the acting is exactly what it should be, overdramatized and slightly disjointed but perfectly in tune with the awkward Bella, hot tempered Jacob and out of his element Edward. Even the poorly animated baby still goes with the book. It's not meant to look like a real baby. People are just taking these movies way to seriously for what they are; young adult fantasy movies made for fans of a book series.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Love Letter to Fans,"The final movie is a love letter to fans. If you're a fan, you will be quite happy, and a little sad too. Of course, the movie only touches the surface on the storyline, but the entertainment value is still there. It's the perfect end to the franchise. It's truly Bella's movie. Her emergence into being a vampire fun to watch, but only if you know the details from the book. The baby is a little off putting; the CGI is clunky for her like it was in the beginning for the wolves, who now are seamless and better done than ever. No it won't win any awards, but it was the best attempt at trying to bring a book to life that inexplicably touched people in ways they couldn't fathom. Nicely done.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best & Worst Twilight.,"This is the first time I sat in a theatre to watch a Twilight movie. I think the theatre experience maybe helped me enjoy the film more than I should have. Nevertheless, Breaking Dawn Part II is not only the best entry in the franchise, it's also the worst. How can that be? For a good 20 minutes, the film tries to be daring and does something different. Yet it is all undone by playing it safe and ruining what came before it.I have to stress that yes, this film did NOT have to be broken up into two. The first film was an hour and a half of filler, followed by 20 minutes of awesomeness. This entry is an hour and a half of build-up, followed by 20 minutes of awesomeness X10, followed by the worst decision the series has ever made to date.I have seen every Twilight movie, I'm not a fan, nor am I a hater. I'm always objective when it comes to these movies. The highest rating I've given one of them is a 5, that went to Eclipse. Breaking Dawn Part II could have easily gotten a 7 from me, had they had the balls to go through with what we were witnessing. A twist so inane, that it actually made me boo at the screen. I don't think I've ever booed at any movie in the theatre before, so congratulations Breaking Dawn Part II, you achieved something.Now, that awesomeness that I was speaking of, it is indeed awesome. I was cheering, I was laughing, I was having a blast. The people around me, I'm assuming fans, were gasping at the carnage they were witnessing. I had a giant smile on my face. Did the creators finally take the series in a bold direction? Did they finally have the balls to do something different? Yes, they did, but then they ruin it. I can't stress how awful that made me feel.K-Stew, finally has something to do other than swoon over Edward, resist the urges from Jacob and act like a whiny teenager. She is a vampire, so she has to learn to be one, although it seems she has no problem with the thirst and heightened senses. There is no struggle for her, which makes this whole aspect a bit shallow. Jacob, unfortunately has nothing to do in this entry other than glare at everyone who comes near Renesmee. So the character shifts his focus from one girl to the next, nothing more for him to do, yawn.Speaking of Renesmee (stupid name), we have what is probably one of the creepiest babies to ever grace the silver screen. Why they chose to use CGI for the face of the baby, other than using a normal one is beyond me. It looks unnatural and comical. The movement doesn't flow and for some reason they decide to keep this CGI face with the kid as she grows older until they finally have the older actress in the role.As with every Twilight film, there are moments of unintentional laughter, bad acting, dialogue and CGI. Michael Sheen seems to be having fun acting like a complete weirdo and the others seem to be happy they are finished with this series. Now, to be completely honest, this entire saga could have been told in three movies. Twilight for the set up, Eclipse for conflict, Breaking Dawn for the closure. Eliminate the pointless New Moon and condense these two movies into one.Twilight is finally over. No more sparkling vampires, no more team Edwards or team Jacobs and no more shirtless scenes of young men. Good bye Twilight, I do not look forward to the inevitable remakes.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Out of all the series, this one was the best.","I'm not a twilight fan, but I loved the ending to this movie. Out of all the series, this one was the best.Bella is new and improved as a vampire after childbirth killed her mortality. And although her union with Edward was fully accepted amongst the vampire community, their new baby Renesmee (a composite name of Renee, Bella's mother, and Esme, Edward's ""mother"") wasn't so lucky. After a false accusation, the new family is in grave trouble with the powerful Volturi who only happen to be the largest vampire regime. Even still, the Cullen's are prepared to use their special gifts against anyone who threatens their family.There are certain details of this film that one has to accept in order to appreciate it. First, aside from the vampires' requisite to drink blood, the Twilight saga movies focuses on the majestic viewpoint of vampires rather than their dark side. And, when assessing the situation in that way, it might make it easier to digest that teenage Bella was literally dying to be a vampire in order to be with Edward, unbeknownst to her parents and only has to loose her soul to do it. Furthermore, even with Bella and Edward being married, there's no way around the fact that Twilight glorifies teenage pregnancy.If these details can be accepted or moved past for the sake of fiction, this film is awesome! I've seen the previous films in the Twilight saga and I thought they were captivating at times but I've never been impressed this much. For starters, it continues to evolve the intense Romeo and Juliet type romance, with a twist. However, the writing in Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 seems to be the best yet. I found myself laughing out loud. The storyline is more witty, interesting, cleverly done and the action scenes are completely unexpected.Even the actors gave better performances. The highlight performances for me were from the beautiful Kristen Stewart, who plays Bella Swan. Not only did she give a believable performance as an incredibly strong vampire in such a tiny frame, but she made it funny and fascinating to watch. Also giving an always reputable performance was Michael Sheen, who plays Aro, one of the three leaders of the Volturi. There's something about his malicious depiction that is so grimy, yet you'll love to loath him! Robert Pattinson, who plays Edward, was funnier than I ever remember him being. Taylor Lautner, whose character is Jacob, gives another vigorous performance and the other wicked actor that amplifies inhumanity is Dakota Fanning.I saw this movie surrounded by a packed theater of energetic Twilight fans. It was almost as equally entertaining to watch the film as it was to be amongst the energy of the crowd for Team Edward vs. Team Jacob. And especially all the boisterous fans who were anti- Volturi. Of course the second Jacob took off his shirt, girls in the audience went bananas. Aro and his crew got an equal amount of rowdy boos.Regarding the topic of appropriateness for young impressionable teens, this film warrants at the least a conversation to your youngsters on issues like intense sexual content, violent murder and teen defiance.Overall, if you've never seen any of the Twilight saga films, this is the one to see. If you're a fan already you will be blown away with how this final movie goes out with a blast. Go see Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2; it's worthy! Surprisingly, one of my favorite films this year!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Terrific awfulness,"It's with a hint of sadness that the Twilight franchise has come to an end. Sure, they're terrible, terrible films (and books I assume), the popularity of which paints a sorry picture of the tastes of today's youth, but now that all is said and done, on reflection it was worth enduring the first three insufferable disasters (Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse) to get to the unbridled mayhem of Breaking Dawn (my thoughts on part one can be found here).After seeing part one, it was difficult to see where the story had left to go. We had seen the unending wedding of Edward and Bella, the banal South American honeymoon, the shocking and genuinely upsetting pregnancy/birth, and the werewolf falling in love with the baby. It seemed like an appropriate place to end it, but Summit and Stephenie Meyer obviously had other ideas, hence we have Breaking Dawn, part 2.While perhaps not as off-the-leash nutty, Breaking Dawn, part 2 maintains a lot of the weirdness of the preceding chapter. Picking up exactly at the point where part one ended, Bella (Kristen Stewart) finds herself having to adjust to her 'newborn' vampire status, learning to control her superhuman strength and fighting the urge to hunt humans. Edward (Robert Pattinson) begins to assume a mentor role, but for whatever reason Bella learns so quickly that the learning plot is pretty much dropped.Here's the first and biggest of the many problems of Breaking Dawn, part 2. For at least the first two thirds of the film, plot threads and characters are introduced with enough fanfare to make one think they're going to be important cogs in the larger machinery of the story, only to be forgotten or abandoned with zero explanation. Perhaps it's fan service, and people familiar with the novels will be able to link things up, but for newcomers it becomes increasingly hard to keep track of who everyone is, why they're involved, and what on earth is happening from one scene to the next.The character of Alistair (Joe Anderson) is a good example. Following the development that the Volturi, the ruling council of vampires last seen in New Moon, are coming after Edward and Bella's daughter Renesmee, the Cullen clan assemble a team of vampires from across the globe to defend the child, the last of which is the enigmatic Alistair. Yet after an introduction to suggest he will be a character of some importance he merely ends up lurking in the background, and popping into one random and pointless scene with Bella. He's always there, but doesn't actually do anything significant.It's this scattered and overloaded approach that really damages an already abysmal film. On top of the lack of charisma in the stars, the questionable storytelling is a real hindrance for anyone set on enjoying Breaking Dawn, part 2 at all, not to mention how simply ugly the thing is. There's an over-reliance on terrible green-screen work, shoddy visual effects, and whatever lunatic decided that an almost completely CG Renesmee was a good idea needs to be removed from the business of movie making.However, much like the last film, a part of me loved Breaking Dawn, part 2. As I said, it may not seem as insane as part one, but in some ways that's a good thing. I loved part one because I was caught completely off guard by the madness, but was appalled by it because much of the content really shouldn't be part of a film made for pre-teen girls. Part two dials back the more troubling aspects of the previous film and just revels in the stupidity of Meyer's writing. It's weird as hell, but really pretty harmless, aside from all the decapitation. Oh boy, there's a lot of decapitation.Director Bill Condon and his cast seem to be having a lot more fun here. The most ridiculous thing about the first three films in the series is how unwaveringly serious they are, but with both parts of Breaking Dawn, it feels like Condon and Pattinson in particular are winking at that portion of the audience who, like myself, are simply there to see how off the reservation this daft franchise can go. It manages to achieve a delicate and kind of wonderful balance of satisfying the true fans (the Twi-hards) with its creepy romantic melodrama, while clearly acknowledging the bizarre and quite frankly awful story Meyer has crafted. The awareness of this final chapter is perhaps its greatest asset, and if you're willing to abandon all logic and actual critical appreciation, then Breaking Dawn, part 2 delivers a great time at the cinema.tinribs27.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unbelievably Bad,"I can't believe I sat through this entire movie. I can't believe Stephanie Meyer approves of it. I can't believe the acting is so dreadful. I can't believe some people actually think this is an all-right, let alone great, ending to the movie franchise. Admittedly, I am inclined to be negatively critical of movies that are not faithful to the original story or characters on which they are based - especially if I liked the original. I was mildly tolerant of the 4 movies leading up to this one because I felt the important parts of the story lines were there even though the actors didn't measure up to the characters that had formed in my mind from reading the books. This final movie, on the other hand, rushes through the story barely touching on some parts I feel are important, in order to include a culminating scene which is not part of the original story, and which itself has to be absurdly unbelievable to any fan of the book series. Two actors, Lautner and Sheen, do the best they can with the terrible dialoge they were given, but not one other character utters a believable syllable the entire time. I should have stayed home and re-read the book, and would heartily advise others to do the same.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A decent twist! to watch,"Im not a massive fan of twilight and not much of a fan of vampire and werewolf films although i do always watch true blood. I went to watch twilight breaking dawn part 2 on Friday as my mates wanted to watch it but i wanted to watch the new James bond, however i did end up watching twilight and i thought the first hour of it wasn't anything spectacular and i can't believe the fanbase that twilight has got.Apart from the shawshank redemption the twist you see in the film when Alice Cullen takes the leader of the volturi's hand is one of the most surprising moments of a film i have watched as i did not for one second like many people for that to happen, now I'm not a twilight fan but you have to say that it was a unexpected twist in the film no matter how much you dislike the films, that was one of the good parts of the film.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Saga Ends As Cheesy As It Started,"I have just come home from watching this last installment of the Twilight Saga, Breaking Dawn Part 2 with my wife. I don't know what is with these Twilight movies that we look forward to watching them, simply to see how bad they are. Haha! The poster showing the three main characters running did not hold much promise of a better film.This film starts where the last film left off. Bella has just given birth to her daughter Renesmee. This supernatural birth brings Bella close to death, so Edward saves her by making her a vampire. Now, when the Volturri find out about Renesmee, they consider her a threat to their existence and hence seek to kill her. Will the Cullen family be able to protect Renesmee and themselves from ultimate destruction?The beginning of this movie are filled with the same clunky scenes and corny dialog that we have all seen and cringed to in all the previous movies. The very long scene showing Bella's reaction to Jacob's imprinting is particularly hilarious. There was also the requisite Jacob striptease scene strictly for Team Jacob fanatics.The climactic battle scenes between the Cullens and the Volturri were another matter though. Sure it was pure computer generated mayhem and violence. But for those who have not read the books and just followed the films, there was some imaginative storytelling at work here for a change. I am actually curious how this part of the story was written in the book. I will give this movie an extra point for this part.In the closing scenes set in the familiar field of purple flowers we have seen before, the whole Twilight saga ends with an incredibly thick serving of cheese. I am not surprised. It ends as it started: cheesy. It never really aspired to be more, so let the Twi-hard fans enjoy this last film while it lasts. So now that it all ends, I'm pretty sure the rest of the world will also be missing Bella and her two other-worldly consorts. We won't have a next film to look forward to nitpick anymore.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Lights Out,"I am going to go ahead and confess that I have not seen any of the other Twilight films. I guess I am the person that buys the book, but only reads the last chapter (smile). I do have to say that in this case it really did not matter. There is so much publicity about these films that I pretty much know what happened in the other ones, so I really don't feel like I missed much. I don't even think that I needed to see part one of this 2-parter. This film could have stood on its own. I enjoyed all the special effects in the film, but I do have to say that when Renesmee was a new born the CGI kind of reminded me of an E-Trade baby. In this film Bella (Kristen Stewart) is getting used to the idea that she is now a vampire and is starting to flex her super natural powers. She also has to adjust her diet and Edward (Robert Pattinson) has the daunting task of helping her to control some of her now instinctual urges. I have to say that I thought that the vampires would be scarier than they actually were. Even the vampires of the Volturi were not that bad. I do want to say that Jacob (Taylor Lautner) was one big werewolf compared to the other ones. The whole story centers around a rumor gone wild and what can happen if you don't present all the facts. I think that I was a little disappointed because I thought that there would be more action than there was. Just to recap, you do not have to be a Twi-hard fan to see this film. I think that the ending was unexpected. I saw an interview that Kristen Stewart gave and she said that when the film was over, the whole cast did a dance number in the snow. I was hoping that they would put that at the end of the credits, but I am sure that it will pop up sooner or later. Will this film make me want to go back and see the rest of them., no, but I am glad that I saw this one. Some folks that have seen them all say that this is the best one. I can't agree or disagree, but I am going to take their word for it. I was not blown away so I am giving this film an amber light.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Volturis spoiling for a fight,The Twilight Saga came to an end with Breaking Dawn Part II as Robert Pattinson and Kristine Stewart try to settle down as best they can with the ever present threat of the Volturi clan looming over them. They've even made some kind of arrangement with Taylor Lautner and the Indian clan of werewolves to serve as protectors of their daughter.Two things about the daughter that are relevant. One the Volturis think she's a threat as the offspring of a mortal which Stewart was then and a vampire. Second thing this crowd is perpetually spoiling for a fight and the Cullen vampire clan better get some allies even if just to serve as guarantors of their good intentions that they mean no harm to anyone.Fans of the books and the previous films will not be disappointed with the film and the ending.

Great end for a great history!,"When I watched Twilight for the first time, I didn't know anything about the books.

I keep all this for me. The books, the places, the story, the characters!! This last movie is wonderful and in my opinion, makes you feel same feelings than the first one.

Continues part 1 with the same blend of teen feelings and lack of purpose,"Having just watched the first part of the movie, which ended saying nothing after a whole bunch of feely scenes that also said nothing, it felt only natural to consider that at some time, after all was said and (hopefully) done, there will be a point to all of this. After all, this is a ""saga"" so it must have an ""epic"" ending. And it didn't, really!The first half of the film was more like part 1, then a threat was revealed and allies were gathered. This part started to get my hopes up: vampires from all over the world, each one with a different ""gift"", came together to fight the dreadful Volturi. Even the wolves joined in. And then the epic battle!Let me just say that after hours of suffering the egotism and mindlessness of all involved, doing nothing and feeling a whole lot of stuff that I didn't, the ending was far from ""epic"". Also, it wasn't really the ending, which was more akin to a Dallas episode. And then the entire franchise... ended. With nothing at all to show for it. Like a soap opera, the fact that a bunch of people you don't care about are living their life is not something interesting or worth wasting time with. That's all!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awful,"I usually don't write negative reviews, but I had to give my opinion on this movie. I had originally only watched parts of it, but my mom forced me to watch a huge portion of the movie. It was awful, just awful! I've never been a huge Twilight fan to begin with. The only reason I have any interaction with it is because of my mom, who is a die hard fan. I haven't read the books, but I've seen most of the movies. I only like the first one, and mainly because of the amazing soundtrack.There were so many things wrong with this movie. First of all, I cannot stand the disgusting CGI baby. Why would they do that? There is seriously no reason for it at all. And the fact that the baby from the very beginning is supposed to have an imprint with Jacob? Like maybe there is a possibility that she will grow up and fall in love with him and be with him? I find that weird and disturbing. I know that it's not supposed to be like that... But still... Also I hate how they try to make seem Bella all cool, strong, and tough now that she's a vampire. I find it really annoying. The acting isn't really that great and the jokes are nearly unbearable. And really, they can't tell Bella's dad that she is a vampire but they can tell him Jacob is a werewolf? Really? And Bella knew for many years as a human that they were vampires. 
All in all, I recommend people watch the honest trailer on YouTube for this movie, it is so hilarious! It will really show you how bad this movie is. I even read some other reviews on this movie saying that Stephen King said this story was bad. I'm not a fan of Stephen King, but I know he is an excellent writer, so that's really saying something about how terrible this movie is.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The absolute best of the worst!,"I NEVER write reviews for movies unless there is a dire need for it, and for this particular film I feel one is required. Let me just say that I have been a strong Anti-Twilight believer since it started. The books were terrible as well as the films. But I continued to watch them just I would have something I could poke fun at. I saw this tonight and leaving the theater I was nearly speechless and it kills me to say I actually enjoyed it to an extent.I'll start with the acting which seems to have improved since the first installment of the series. It is still a bit flaky but has definitely been worse. The makeup however is annoying in the sense that it seems to change dramatically in between each movie. There is no consistency whatsoever. The hair color is always changing as is the intensity of the ""pale-face"" look. The Cullens looked especially unusual looking than normal; Esme looked like a big toe in my opinion. Furthermore the special effects have not changed and were shameful considering the advancement of today's technology.But despite all of the flaws here is why I gave it a 7 out of 10; the plot twist was absolutely, undoubtedly spectacular. It was brilliant and completely unexpected and the whole theater gasped in shock. This was a huge milestone for any production, especially for Twilight as the standards are not exactly sky high. I would also like to note the last scene with Bella and Edward left you with a satisfactory, tickled pink feeling. And lastly I would like to commend whoever is responsible for the credits because that was very thoughtful and shows their appreciation for the cast; even those who were not apart of this last installment. So overall, I would definitely recommend anyone and everyone to give this film a chance, because even I who have been skeptical since the beginning, left the building pleasantly surprised.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Second best of the Twilight saga,"Although this was not my favorite movie of the Twilight Saga (New Moon was!), I loved it. Far better than Breaking Dawn Part 1, it offered complete satisfaction with the culmination of the saga. I sat in the theater enthralled with the movie, enjoying every moment of it. It was fun to watch Bella the vampire and Bella the new mom. I finally grew to appreciate Jacob and his connection to Bella. I actually cried at one pivotal point in the movie and was sad when Breaking Dawn Part 2 was over. No more Twilight movies! I will re-read the books and have my own Twilight Saga marathon. I was not disappointed and don't believe any true 'Twihard' could possibly be. Cudos to the entire cast and crew for giving the viewers what they wanted in this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An interesting ending,"All devotees of ""Breaking Dawn"" know exactly how the story ends, and there are no surprises in the plot and characters. If you have not seen the previous movies or have read the books, this movie would be incomprehensible, especially at the beginning. I was really hoping for a bit more of Bella's ""awakening"" and Edward's frantic efforts to prevent her death. It got lost at the end of Part I, and Part II picks up with a Bella who is in perfect control, if perhaps a mite thirsty. Bella's discovery of Jacob's new role in her life is also disappointing. Let's face it, Miss Stewart simply cannot act. Sad, but true. She's lovely to look at, but has an extremely limited range -- her anger at Jacob was comical, not threatening, and I saw no evidence of ""motherliness"" in her interactions with Renesmee -- she was more of a big sister. Breaking the book up into two movies made for two movies that were overlong for the limited story that was actually presented.Having said that, the film's management of Alice's visions was a nicely done twist. As her visions began to unfold, I looked at my companion in horror -- ""THIS wasn't in the book!"" we hissed at each other. To be fair, the visions may have been in the book -- there is a delightfully sparsely-described interaction that leaves room for a broad range of dramatic invention.Kudos to the director/producer or whomever created the final credits. At the end of such a epic, it was good to see all the characters that had appeared in all the movies being recognized so beautifully for their part in creating the whole fabric of the tale.Let's face it -- no review is going to deter a Twi-hard fan from seeing this movie. And if you aren't a Twi-hard fan, no review is going to tempt you into starting, now. Will it be an enduring classic? Probably not. But it was a fun ride while it lasted.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's Alright,"Well, this Part 2 is most definitely better than Part 1. Part 1, the 4th film, sucked badly. This film is a marked improvement.To summon up the series: 1st film is fine, 2nd and 3rd films are the best, 4th film is awful, this 5th film is alright.

Don't let everyone else's opinions influence your own,"OK, I've never thought that I would defend a Twilight movie. I've watched all of them and - I have to admit it - they were ridiculous. The book series itself is not a masterpiece but is an easy and absorbing read. But the films have always been famous for bad acting (how do the good actors actually manage to act so badly?) and for making even the most (theoretically) touching scenes ridiculous. I didn't anticipate much before watching this last film. That's why I was positively surprised by it. The movie is fast-paced, entertaining, absorbing and enjoyable. There is not much sense or much good acting in it but it reaches its goal very well. I couldn't get away from the screen (even though I wasn't in the theater and could always leave) and I received my part of guilty pleasure. So don't think you're a misfit if you like it. Maybe you're just more honest with yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining At Least :),"At this point I feel like I need to just enjoy Twilight.

It's done, it's satisfying I guess.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than I thought but not great.,"I remember the hype around The Twilight saga back in the days when I went to school and everything the girls talked about were these movies. After a short summary from one of my friends I soon made up my mind that this wasn't something for me, and I left it alone.it's 2016 now, and I stumbled upon the 4 movies on a streaming service I subscribe to, thinking; ""It's the middle of the night and I'm bored"" so I gave it a chance, and it var OK. Nothing more nothing less. I figured that since I didn't have anything better to do I could see what all the hype had been about.The story is pretty straight forward. Girl moves away, girl meets boy, boy is a vampire. That's it. At least in the first movie. The story escalates allot throughout the movies and several conflicts appear.As for the actors; It all pretty much starts out as a typical late-teen movie, with mostly young protagonists. Robert Pattison and Kristen Steward (Taylor Lautner as well) has gotten allot of mocking for doing these movies and somehow I kinda agree but disagree at the same time. They did alright, but nothing worth an Oscar either. It seems to me that the actors grew allot while filming the movies and I look forward to seeing some of them in other, more mature movies. Steward especially.All in all the movies were OK, I won't likely watch them again, but I wouldn't kill myself either If I was to watch them in the company of others.I'd give the saga as a whole a 5.5.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fitting conclusion to an otherwise mediocre franchise,"First, I'll sum my thoughts about this series: I really hated the first TWILIGHT, I found the second slightly better, I kinda liked the third one (and probably deserves to be named the best in the franchise) but the fourth one was a huge step backwards to badness, and when this final chapter ended I thought ''Thank God it's finally over''. Now I can go to the review.After the events of the previous chapter (with Bella suffering a lot with her pregnancy until Renesmee finally is born, and she finally turns into a vampire) Bella makes her father believe that the child was adopted. Unfortunately tho Irina sees Renesmee in the woods and thinks she is an immortal child; she goes to the Volturi tribe for reporting this. After a vision the Cullens have to rally more witnesses as possible for proving that Renesmee is not an immortal child. After a long, pointless and dull fight between the vampires, wolves and Volturis the Cullens are finally free and Bella says Edward that they will love and live together forever.The acting was decent at best. Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner looked like they matured acting-wise and Michael Sheen and Rami Malek stand out in the supporting cast. The photography was great and on par with the soundtrack. However, the problems with this conclusion are some stilted acting by Maggie Grace (Irina) and the battle scene that at times looked like it had to last forever.Overall, I think this is probably the best way this cringeworthy movie franchise could have ended, and I really felt relieved as I finally had to stop torturing myself watching this nonsense. Only of interest for true bad movie fans or if you are forced to stay home.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Well, it is a good laugh","So, film is clearly made for teenagers so therefore expectations should not be high. Still at times it remains me of a Indian soap opera type tv show.A lot of glances overly dramatic shots and fighting choreography nicked from anime cartoon.I understand that there was not enough material for two films from one book so there was a necessity of adding some extra running time, but the problem is that the creators are obviously not too creative...That being said I had a blast watching it and could not stop laughing. In a way it belongs to the group of films such as The Room. It's goal was not to make us laugh but it sure did one hell of a job. So honestly I think it should be labeled as comedy and would definitely recommend it!",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

First off all i would like to say something about new effects. 3D effects is awesome, like scene when Bella is running with Edward. Nature and sound is amazing. I don't know what to say...I really enjoy in this movie. Last fight is so good, epic, strategy, fictional, emotional. There is a lot of new people in this movie, who create and make new styles on the movie. Wolfs animation is very good, sounds like a real in movie.I love Bella powers, and on the end i would like to say: Thanks production for everything. If someone ask me, i will put this movie on nomination for Oscars or golden globe. Thanks production for hard work all night, thanks Bill Condom, thanks IMDb.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I do not regret this,"I have finished all of them in one night (says something about me), and this one was the most satisfying. It has filled my sad, aching heart with some half-weird half-cliche feelings.

"poorly acted, poorly directed mess","To tell a tale out of school, out of all the horrible Worst Picture Razzie winners, Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 2 was the main reason I retained from doing this marathon in the first place. On top of not getting into the teenage vampire and werewolf trend in early 2010's, I didn't want to expose myself to the cinematic bubonic plague known as the Twilight franchise. Unfortunately, the 8-year record is broken as I have now seen one of their movies, the final one. Previously, Bella Swan-Cullen (Kristen Stewart) gave birth to Edward Cullen's (Robert Pattinson) half-vampire baby Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy). In Part 2, Bella and Edward's love-child brings a conflict between the Cullen family, the pack of werewolves lead by Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) and the Volturi cult led by Aro (Michael Sheen). Having not seen the other films or read the Stephanie Meyer books, I could never follow why being immortal would be a threat to the Volturi vampires or how the vampires inexplicably gain powers like chopping logs like a cheese cracker, superspeed, or super-jump. It also didn't help that the visual effects are far below the standards of a Sci-Fi channel movie, demonstrated by the werewolves, motion blurs, the backdrops, and the baby. Another list of stupidity: Bella learning to act human, the elemental powers that contribute nothing to vampirism, the ethnic stereotypes, and the climactic battle near the end which was all a vision. The only redeeming and entertaining value in the whole series so far is Michael Sheen, who bites the scenery gloriously and even has that silly hammy laugh as an act of threat. While nicely shot and not with some crazy and funny moments, Breaking Dawn Part 2 is still a poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed mess.

A Decent Finale,"After the slow build-up of ""Part 1"", ""Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" finally brings some much-needed energy to the franchise. While it still suffers from the series' signature flaws-awkward dialogue, uneven pacing, and underdeveloped characters-it delivers enough spectacle and closure to make it a barely sufficient conclusion, especially after enduring the previous movies.Kristen Stewart's Bella, now transformed, finally gains some presence, making her character slightly more engaging than before. Robert Pattinson's Edward remains brooding but at least gets some decent moments. Taylor Lautner's Jacob continues to be one of the more charismatic characters, though the handling of his storyline remains questionable. The supporting cast, including the expanded vampire coven, adds some intrigue, but most of them don't get enough screen time to leave a lasting impact.Visually, ""Part 2"" is stronger than its predecessors, with improved cinematography and some well-executed action sequences. The much-discussed final battle is surprisingly intense and cleverly handled, adding a sense of excitement that was often missing in previous films. However, the CGI remains inconsistent, with some moments looking noticeably unpolished.While ""Breaking Dawn - Part 2"" isn't a great film, it at least gives the franchise a proper send-off. It's still flawed, but compared to what came before, it deserves at least a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
With All These Bad Reviews...Did You See The Movie?,"I like this board for the idea that you can give your opinion on movies. However, what I see a lot aren't reviews by Twilight lovers, but haters. I am questioning whether they have even seen the movie? Our theater was packed and the reaction was nothing but positive at the midnight showing.As the computer technology has improved, so have the CGI wolves. They have come a long way in the last four years. They were believable characters in this movie. The whole concept of a baby with teeth was most likely why the baby looked like the E-Trade baby. You don't expect a newborn baby to have a full set of choppers. However, this film was the perfect amount of action and romance. This is exactly what fans needed. I can see why they needed to make this into two movies.Since this was a continuation of the last movie, I can see why some people may not know what is going on. These are characters most of us have grown to love over the last 4 years. You are expected to know these characters without a lot of flashback. The actors as well as characters have matured over these years. Kristen Stewart showed both emotional and growth in her acting abilities. If they would have kept Katherine Hardwick, I am not sure the series could have progressed the way it did.The only thing I wish they would have spent more time on is Bella's change. In the book, she isn't allowed to see Renesmee and has a longer transition period. Also in the book, the Bella/Charlie meeting takes is longer. The twist ending had everyone in our theater gasping. The battle scene was awesome and they did a nice job casting the the other tribes. The pace of the film was good also. I didn't once want to get out of my seat, although my seat was horrible uncomfortable.I thought this was a great ending to the series. As a true fan of both the movies and books, I left the theater overall satisfied. It is a great thing Stephanie Meyer became an producer on her own vision. She was able to give input on the characters.This is a must see for ""Twilight"" lovers.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best movie of the series...,"I will be the first person to admit that the movies were waaaay better than the books. This series could have been so much better, had it not been written by Stephenie Meyer. Granted, I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and not everybody can be JK Rowling, but the 2 dimensional characters that Stephenie Meyer thought up, make it impossible for this series to be great. Overall, given what the cast had to work with, this is a great series. The cast did an outstanding job with the characters they were given and really brought this particular movie to life. This movie is fast paced and well done. The characters mesh well together, all of them, including characters we haven't seen before. Acting is great. Overall a good conclusion to a decent series.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I loved this film,"Unlike so many of the other reviewers, I loved this movie. I enjoyed the books(although I realize that they are not great literature) and I feel that Bill Condon did an excellent job with some difficult material. There is a lot of action, a twist at the end(which I did not feel ruined the film as a few others do) and a nostalgic finish.It's a good companion piece to Breaking Dawn 1. The actors continued to make the most of their roles- by this film they were family.The fact that it (and the others) have made so much money attests to the fact that some people do like it, and they are not all teenage girls. So count me as a Twihard who loves the story and the way it was portrayed. It's a classic love story that resonated with a lot of people. It wasn't meant to be ""War and Peace"", guys.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly Enjoyable,"For the record: I am neither a ""Twihard"" nor a Twilight hater. I recognize that the books are far from high art but I enjoy them nonetheless.Perhaps that is why I was disappointed with Breaking Dawn, the novel: even compared to its prequels, it was weakly plotted.The biggest problem with the book was how it botched the climax. All the tension, all the sense of danger...dissipated prematurely. Knowing this, I went into the theater with especially low expectations.As it happened, the screenwriters used a simple, but very clever device to fix that flaw while remaining true to the source material. It worked so well that I didn't entirely realize what they'd done until after the sequence. Granted, if you've read the book recently you're likely to catch on quickly. I won't say any more than that.Other good points:~Opening Credits: these were honestly beautiful. Lots of soaring over the forests coupled with macro time-lapse photography involving ice and flowers. It was clearly symbolic of certain story elements, plus everything was shone through red and grey scale filters, echoing the books' covers. Perhaps the best part was the orchestral background music.~A certain scene with Charlie and Jacob: It was every bit as hilarious as I imagined.~Renesmee: I found her a little creepy in the book, but she seems much more natural in the movie...in as much as the word ""natural"" applies.~A certain scene with Bella and Emmett: also nicely played out. Emmett's expressions were perfect.~Vampire allies: there were some colorful characters here. I wish they'd been around sooner. Lee Pace's performance was especially good.With all the story's faults, *somehow* this film worked. The person who invited me to see it was also pleasantly surprised. In our post-theater chat, we decided why:1. The movie makers generally made good decisions.2. The story is no longer about a girl choosing between her suitors---it's about people protecting their lives they've built from a common threat. For the Twilight series, it was a refreshing change of pace.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I advice everyone to see it even if you don't like twilight. It also has a good ending which is always good if it the last one and it ties all the films together so nothing is left out.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"a damp squib of a climax, highlighting franchise flaws and naivety","The Twilight books were a guilty pleasure, I enjoyed them (to a point). I don't pretend they were works of literary genius, or the plot was particularly clever, and don't get me started on sparkles, but they were a diversion and I bought them all and saw all the films (mainly on DVD).This is the final instalment, the denouement of the story arc and should have been the screaming crescendo of a climax but was more or less a damp squib. Given the money that was clearly lavished on this film (and the others) it left a lot to be desired. The series' final book was split into two films which I think was a con as there just isn't enough happening in them to make four hours of viewing, they would have been TOTALLY better as one film with faster action. This film was relatively empty and jumped from point to point with little cohesion between. It got annoying. Then there's the acting, given the lack of intelligent script the actors have to act by numbers - jumping from facial expression to the next which makes the woodenness of the acting, which Pattinson and Stewart (both good actors) have been tarred with since the franchise began as if they are just reading lines rather than delivering them. Given, also, there's a lot of - invisible to the viewer - telepathy there are a lot of empty hand-on-face scenes. The CGI is prolific, and it's often hard to tell if there is anything real, which isn't necessarily a good thing as it makes the film less believable (despite being fantasy). The CGI of Renesme's face was so fake and ridiculous but the wolves are lovely again and one of the best parts of all the films, and the CGI on Kristen's face/make up is good. Regarding CGI, what was with the brief white sparkles in the love scene? Was that supposed to be an orgasm? WTH? The only other redeeming features of the film is the cinematography of the landscapes (real or CGI) and the sweeping panoramas which are legion and the fight scene at the end. It is an attractive film, the cottage in the woods very Thomas Kincaid, entertaining to a point but empty and rather dull and like the previous two-parter too montage ridden. The dialogue (what little there was) was banal and limited, and there needed to be more complexity, but that is the fault of the books as they were naively written (given the subject) but it must be remembered that this is a series for young adults not grown-ups and as such it is probably gripping and exciting. With that in mind, as a film, it's still disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It has every ingredient of a blockbuster however the ingredients are used to make one master gore-may dinner.Every part of the film was fantastically used, from the intense action scenes, to even the moving soundtrack that gave that extra edge that was needed. The movie starts straight from the first part which is a important role in my opinion. the action scenes were intense, i was sat in awe because of the films intensity and beautiful landscapes that were used. The actors again filled the roles exquisitely, it was like they were Tailored to play the characters.I rated this film a 10 because i couldn't find one floor with the film, however i did watch this movie in 2D so i have no opinion on the IMAX screenings.

Definite improvement from the previous films,"Frankly, I had the same notion as with most people that the film, rooted from a less than creative material would be pretty bad as well, but I went to see it anyway. Less than 2 hours later, I was surprised that it was actually quite entertaining, well, the last part specifically. True enough, the film builds incredibly slow, the narrative is as linear as with any of the previous installments but kudos to Bill Condon for getting the most out of Meyer's rather poorly written book series, and allowing people who aren't fans of it to appreciate it more.The acting was just as bad but evidently getting better, Robert Pattinson especially.

"The best attempt to tie everything together, except for Eclipse","The film was great, had more varied characters, had more insight into the mythology, and showed more of a living reality of the series. It wasn't perfect, a few minor tweaks would have made the film a bit better - Nahuel's style choice etc. Lol. All in all this gave a stunning happy ever after to a series that rivalled the following of Harry Potter, but most importantly, showed that indie films that have small beginnings, can develop, and with enough care, can capture the attention of a generation.A valid *attempt* to improve everything that the series had offered previously, and if you're willing to see it's value, you won't regret having been a fan of the series. The casting for me was one of the best aspects of the movie, really diversified the field, lowest point was that Mackenzie didn't have many lines, and that the cgi for Renesmee and a lot of the action was a bit lacking - like vampire speed etc.PS I will even admit that I shed a tear at THAT omg moment :)Go here for full criticism of details etc.http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt1673434/board/thread/207210078",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I came out of this movie saying 'that got a 5.8 on IMDb' ... it did,"Full disclosure: I saw this film with an open mind, I hadn't seen any previous Twilight movies or read any of the books. 10 minutes before the film started I had a complete debrief of the previous 3 episodes.This movie was awful. The plot was stop and start for the first hour. It would be going in one direction and then just stop awkwardly to cut to an arm wrestle scene or topless scene that added zero value; this must have happened 4 or 5 times.Apart from the hilarious stop and start opening, it was incredibly bland. The one liners detracted from the fact that all of these people were facing certain death from an army of 30 vampires. When any action finally took place, it got slightly interesting before making the biggest plot faux pas imaginable - you'll see.All that this had going for it was a small dose of action and some interestingly surreal videography. On the other hand, the acting was wooden, the relationships were dead (for a first time viewer at least) and the plot was beyond weak.Do not bother.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
wasn't what i expected,"wow, if there's any definition of surprise. its that a twilight movie was actually good. before i get into this movie i wanna point out that in one part of the movie, i was completely shocked at what had happened. i was wondering if my friends saw the same movie i did, because this part of the movie had screwed me over in a way that i loved! everyone had been tricked and went ""AWWWW."" i was pleasantly surprised that this scene saved the film. i hated every single movie except eclipse. but the weather was always breath taking, and made me feel at ease, I'm one for gloomy weather because thats when i think most. the movies color is captured so perfect i could practically feel the temperature. and we all know Bella is now a vampire, i don't know if she knew this herself but there has never been more expression in her face than in this film. i guess she played dead for a teenager, and looked alive and happy when she was a dead bloodsucker. because forget logic. besides that, every character gets enough screen time, the whole movie consists of gathering a group of vampires to witness a problem that the lead vampires wont believe. all the vampires that are recruited get enough detail to know they are there, so your not left wondering who the hell died. Jacob also made fun of himself in this film, he is SO sensitive and pouty, i don't see why girls like him. i went to see this with three of my twi-hard cousins, and 2 of my cousins that hated these films. I'm in the middle, i find something interesting in these films that people don't. all in all, for a twilight movie it was really good, starts cheesy, goes hardcore in the climax, and then goes cheesy for the last 3 minutes, and for the 40 year olds crying that its the end. calm down, because with the money they make i wouldn't be surprised if they made a prequel or had the author write another book. i give it a 7/10 for pulling a trick on the audience, and wowing us for a last film. if you think about it, the climax is the only true amazing thing in the film, they could have made the film with only 1 part, but expand it to 3 hours and cut out the crap Bella had to go through when she was pregnant. and for the last note, the baby is obviously CGI, but it is the cutest little thing i have ever seen in computer graphics. give it a shot if your thinking about giving these movies 1 more chance.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad movie night Sundays week five,"Its over, its finally over! I will never be watching these films for as long as I live.This film was soo bad it makes the first two Twilight films look Oscar worthy. Breaking Dawn Part 1 was all set up for Breaking Dawn Part 2 just for this whole film to be build up to the last twenty minutes. Literally nothing happens in this film, just skip to the last twenty minutes because I can promise you won't be missing anything.There is just soo much wrong with this film. Terrible pacing, terrible writing, down right atrocious CGI, and of course can't forget cringe worthy dialogue which is a staple for the saga. Bella earns nothing in this film, she's a new born yet has an a extreme ability to resist the urge to feed on human blood which takes vampires years to learn. Then of course she masters her ""gift"" in a single training session but it took the other vampires years to master their own.Lastly the greatest insult, the slap in the face to any viewer no satisfactory conclusion to the tension between the Cullens and the Volturi. This film was clearly building up to a final conflict and to end it the way they did was a massive cop out. If I was a Twilight fan I would be extraordinarily disappointed by this poor execuse of saga conclusion. Perhaps this what the fans like, what do I know. My last criticism, not enough Alice.Anyway I'm finally done with this saga and I definitely have no plans to revisit anytime soon. I'm going to need a break from bad movie night for a while as to heal my brain and eyes from this atrocious film.IMDb: 1/10

"Not bad - Stewart's Best, Pattinson's weakest","I thought this was a fitting enough end for the saga - particularly the last 30 - 40 minutes. I also enjoyed seeing the ""newborn"" vampire hunt and found that intriguing. Jacob and Kristen Stewart are given string characters and plenty to do and they do it very well. Stewart also exhibits an energy level and sexuality here far beyond anything we've seen before - and it's exciting to watch. On the other hand, Edward is SO weak in this one - he's far weaker than the baby or anything else. I'm not talking about Pattinson's performance - which I found adequate - but how weak his character was in this one and how much he more than anybody needed Her protection. Overall, it was an imaginative, if episodic, way to end the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Breaking Wind Part 2,"The most entertaining film in the franchise.

"If You're in the Neutral Category, You Might Give it a Shot","KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, 15-year-old Raven Devanney, admits that she's never been a huge Twilight fan but found herself with new respect for this series now, even to the point of contemplating reading the books. Her review follows.Twilight, Breaking Dawn Pt. 2 by Raven Devanney, KIDS FIRST! Film CriticThis dramatic ending concludes the tale of Bella and Edward on their journey, defying the odds of love.I have never really been a fan of the Twilight series, never read any of the books or waited in line at the midnight premieres. I'm not a huge fan of dairy products, and this series contains an awful lot of cheese. But food jokes aside, I didn't completely dislike this film. Don't get me wrong there were definitely some parts that were way too dramatic, but overall I would say this is by far the best film in the Twilight Saga. The cinematography and special effects weren't anything different from the previous films, so I think they were pretty well done. However, I was very confused when I saw Renesmee. I couldn't tell if she was real or not because she looked so computer edited.I also have a problem with Bella's makeup in the opening scene. This movie picked up right where it left off and in the last film, the final scene was Bella lying on the table after she gave birth. When this movie started, it was Bella waking up on the table two days after the birth of her daughter. But her makeup and hair was perfect. If she had been unconscious for two days how would she have on spotless makeup? Another detail that I noticed that didn't seem right was Edward and Bella's new home. Who made it? And who could design, build and furnish an entire home in only two days? I pretty sure vampires don't have super-human- carpenter powers. One last visual detail that was weird for me was Renesmee's room. When you first see it, it's a nursery, but then a day or two later it's completely different and completely refurbished. How on earth do the Collins afford to refurbish their homes every week?!I can't say I have a favorite character because the acting done by each character is a little far fetched. I understand that the storyline itself is far from realistic, but I feel like all of the actors over- play their roles. I do have a favorite scene though. The final battle scene completely shocked me, and made me actually enjoy the movie. I haven't read the books so I had no idea what to expect, but I got completely sucked into it. I watched this film with my friend who isn't a Twilight fan either, but her and I were squealing in shock during the ending scene. After the movie I felt like such a nerd because I got so into the film, but in all honesty I actually enjoyed it. No, I will not become a Twi-hard fan now, but I do have a lot more respect for this series now. And I'm thinking about reading the books.This film is the most violent and sexual out of the whole series so I recommend it for ages 13 and up. Obviously if you're a huge Twilight fanatic, you're going to see this movie no matter what anybody else tells you. And if you completely despise the movies (which I'm sure some of you probably do) you're not going to see the film no matter what you're told. But if you're in the neutral category of loving/hating Twilight like I am, give it a shot and you might actually be surprised. Overall I give Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Pt. 2 - 4 out of 5 stars because it definitely surpassed my expectations.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sloppy fifth,"The writing and scene's are really bad. I enjoyed the first few movies, but this is a terrible way to end the saga.
The fact that they use fur for clothing is also a shame. Animals get skinned alive (if you search for video footage, you won't recover again from the shock) for a cheap way to keep the fur intact. I'm disappointed.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Best of the series?  Um, no.","For most, the Twilight Saga has been something either you loved or had no interest in.... If you got past the first film, you were probably in it for the long haul. I was one of those...but unlike the TwiHards and such, it has not been an enjoyable ride.""Twilight,"" the first film, was great. I thought everything about it was incredibly entertaining, albeit far from perfect. However, that is where it peaked for me. With every subsequent film, ""New Moon,"" ""Eclipse"" and the first part of ""Breaking Dawn,"" these films got worse and worse and worse.And worse.But as I started this pop culture phenomenal, goddamit, I was going to finish it. And what made the last installment the worst one of the bunch was that there wasn't even a decent consolation prize of gratuitous Lautner nakedness lasting more than eight seconds to make up for the two hours of soap-opera-like pseudo-silly-eye-rolling-drama that we had to endure.Like, c'mon! And thus, that FINALLY brings us to the final chapter of the series, where everything comes to head and we say goodbye to these characters once and for all. And has anything gotten any better? Uh...no.As Bella comes to terms with her new status as Trampire (and her transition was the easiest I've seen of any vampire story), the feared Volturi are gonna come aknocking as they believe a huge taboo has been committed...that the half-human/half-vamp baby of her and Edward was not born but rather created! Oh no! So, the whole last film and the first hour and a bit of this one has been a set up for the final conflict...a conflict that takes forever to get to, finally has some amazing appeal and violence, and then a plot twist just ruins it all in a millisecond.And there you are. Disappointed again. But I will give it credit for having a touching final scene and an impressive final credit role.So, many may claim this is the best of the series, but they would be dead wrong, so to speak. It is definitely the best out of the last four, no doubt, but after the first film, nothing has been able to rise above crap. The acting in this one is just as cardboard as ever, Stewart having not improved her ability to be one of the most popular horrible actresses in Hollywood. When Taylor Lautner is the best actor in your film, you know you may not be in the greatest production.But on that note, there is an excellent scene where Lautner strips down. And for that, this film does go from 3 to 4 out of 10...and those of us who were most motivated to see these the last four films by Lautner's pecs, we thank you.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Read this if your girlfriend is forcing you to see this movie...,"So, I'll keep this review short and sweet--you probably don't have time to be reading through paragraph upon paragraph.So, I'm a guy, and was dragged to this movie by several female friends. I saw the first book IV movie, too, and didn't really like it. However, I actually quite enjoyed this movie.The first half of Breaking Dawn Part 2 was pretty bad--that is, very laughable acting, laughable special effects, and laughable plot. But, it was SO BAD, that it was actually really, really funny. Kristen Stewart--God bless her--is not exactly what I'd call a ""talent...."" The second half of this movie was much better, and quite entertaining. After an excruciating first half, the second half really took off and ended with a bang. It seems as though they poured all their money into the final scenes, and skimped on the beginning scenes--this is ""Big Budget,"" and let me tell you, some of those scenes at the beginning look like they were shot with an iPhone camera. Again, the end made up for it.I haven't read the books, so I really didn't know the names of most of the minor characters, but this really didn't detract from the movie experience.Bottom line: You won't be too bored if your girlfriend/wife drags you to this movie. On the whole, I was entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
For Non-Fans: Only marginally less boring from the 1st Part,"This series obviously has a great number of fans and I guess anyone who had enjoyed even the previous entry in the series (Part 1 of Breakinng Dawn) will also enjoy this Part 2. For non-fans, on the other hand, there is not any reason to give Part 2 a chance. It is only marginally less boring than Part 1. For instance, the climactic confrontation is not handled with any gusto and appears pretty lame. I don't have any problem in principle with soap opera dynamics if they feature some genuine dramatic tension, as the first sequel had to some degree (with regards to Bella's ambivalent attachment to Jacob) and I had enjoyed that one on its own merits. But once Bella and her pale-face lover made up and settled, the series had ran out of dramatic fuel. Yes, Kristen Stewart is a very attractive young woman and there is some pleasure in viewing her pretty face on big screen, but that's all there is to it really.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It is absolutely the best and will have you crying.My heart was literally jumping out of my chest and my hands were so sweaty through the entire movie.

Better than expected,"First, this is the Twilight saga, so the criticism I've seen seems to generate mostly from guys who wouldn't like chic flicks anyway.As a husband, I dutifully took my wife to this last installment, not exactly thrilled at the idea, but figuring it would have to be better than the part 1, which left out many of the key ingredients that my wife enjoyed in the book.I found this a much faster paced movie and the ending seemed to have been engineered mostly for the male audience. The characters were a little more animated and easier to watch.On the negative side, if I hadn't had my wife to fill me in on a few details I wouldn't have understood some of the motives ... such as most of the battle at the end was over Alice, and not the newborn half-ling.In all, I thought, from a guy's perspective, this was equal to Eclipse.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining ending,"All good things must come to an end and so does all average things. Yes, it is the end of the Twilight Saga and personally it will not be missed by me since I have never been a fan. The same cannot be said about a majority of viewers who are simply in love with the movie, its characters and also the actors and actresses in real life. The fame cruise mobile of Kirsten Stewart, Robert Pattison and Taylor Lautner is what TWILIGHT simply is to another.TWILIGHT never has been rated in the higher digits and it simply stays the same with one characteristic which did disturb me. The entire concept of TWILIGHT swept through its fans back in 2008 simply on the vampire human romance. Apart from Charlie; there are no humans in TWILIGHT BREAKING DAWN PART 2. Instead it is all about the vampires and the Bella Edward hybrid daughter Nessy and also TWILIGHT BREAKING DAWN PART 2 shows you Bella fitting in as a vampire and how she progress and trains herself to be around her own daughter and the acceptance of Nessy by the Volturi.Concentrated with more comic relief than all its predecessors TWILIGHT BREAKING DAWN PART 2 is safe to be considered one of the most entertaining of the franchise. However it does tend to stray away at times focusing on certain Bella Edward moments which I think we have all had enough of from all 5 movies. However the Oscar winning writer who has turned director: Bill Condon seems to be convinced that the audience needs more of Bella and Edward seated in green pastures whispering sweet nothings! This side of TWILIGHT brings its rating down by half and completely destroys the velocity the plot is travelling in. However Bill Condon gets his fight sequences and his computer generated imagery right in the bulls' eye. Never is there is moment where the action aspect of the movie is compromised.The VerdictThis isn't a must watch. This will satisfy only the most devout fans of the franchise. Since there are no humans involved it feels too monotonous. Excellent CGI and fight sequences whenever they pop up. The wolves finally have stopped talking and Stewart and Pattisons performances are as pale as they look on screen. Entertaining; Yet good riddance!TITLE : TWILIGHT BREAKING DAWN PART 2 DIRECTED BY: BILL CONDON STARRING: KIRSTEN STEWART, ROBERT PATTISON, TAYLOR LAUTNER, MICHAEL SHEEN & PETER FACINELLI RATED: PG RATING: 05/10 RUNTIME: 115 MINUTES",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not Really Epic But Close..,"I had to say this is literally closely epic... I came to watch the last chapter of the franchise and I really had fun. It's better than Breaking Dawn Part 1.The theme of the movie was done better than any of the Twilight films. I really almost had my heart stopped at the moment of the ending. I really liked it. It was a fun action-excitement at the end.What I literally don't like in the New Moon was bringing the franchise into a Saga... This franchise is not a SAGA?! I don't call it a Saga because Saga means it's amusing, appealing, and has a central idea into it. But after seeing Breaking Dawn Part 2 into theaters I really understand why they call it THE TWILIGHT SAGA! That is how fun this movie is!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Glad this garbadge movie series are over!,"Extremely boring movie series. There is no development story and all the main characters are super boring and annoying. Certainly Bella has been super annoying throughout the film series, how could you think of such a disgusting person! Also Jabob and Edward you have to get through them extremely obsessive about 'protecting' Bella and later the daughter where they bark and hurt everyone for a selfish person! Won't even tell her daddy the truth because she's a villian! The side characters that are interesting such as Rosalie and Emmet, Charlie, carlisle and Jasper are barely visible in the picture and when they are in the picture they have nothing to do.

Epic end,"When I first heard about twilight I thought it was nothing special and pretty much that it was bad.When I saw breaking dawn part 1 ,I was so stunned by it that next day I watched all other parts an bought books.Yeah I became another fan.After waiting ,the day has come,today I watched part 2 in cinema.It was everything I expected and even more.Story was great ,and from the beginning till end it was getting better and better.I am glad that in this part we learn a bit more about vampire family and their connections.But what everyone was waiting was the final battle.Of course it was epic ,but no one could imagine ,how it would end .It was probably one of the best ends in movies I have ever seen.Everyone should see this movie ,thrust me,it is really good.I have only one bad thing to say about it, it ended too soon, I would love to see story keep going.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

I have read all of the books, and of course movies are never better than books, but this is the first Twilight movie that I didn't over analyze how much it compared to the book.Kirsten Stewart actually showed some emotion in this one, I liked the new vampires coming to join the clan. I was interested in how they were going to show their abilities and talents, and I thought that they did a good job.Some of the acting was awkward, but that's what you kind of expect if you have see the first 4.The best part of the movie was definitely at the end. The only thing running through my head was ""THIS WASN'T IN THE BOOK!"" It was such a surprise and I ended up loving the end and wished that it was that way in the book.The very ending of the movie actually made me tear up a little as Edward and Bella share a moment.So all in all the movie has sex, violence, and drugs if you count blood (Edward did say it was like a drug) And special tender moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Now that I have finally wrapped up the Saga with this instalment, I can confidently say the whole series is a shambles.This one in particular I feel especially let down by. Wrapping up the series there were at least a couple of half decent story threads left dangling to tie up nicely, but this just didn't happen at all.As always, the performances were dire and really just didn't deliver any kind of passion or drive or excitement.Then there is a big story 'twist' that is just incredibly annoying and frustrating and negates so much of the emotional stakes of the entire film and the series!As I say, at least it's finally over and I never have to watch one of these films again!",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Redemption,"This was the best movie of the series since twilight itself. Clearly people who have not read the books are at somewhat of a disadvantage, but if you watched the series from beginning to Breaking Dawn Part I, then I would definitely not miss this one. It is obvious that Lionsgate's influence on this movie had a positive result and I wish that influence extended to the others, because of Summit's former 'make it cheap' attitude. The books deserved better, because the movies focused more on character relationships and less on an important theme from the books which was you can choose to be a predator, or not and the results of those choices. For me, bringing the books to life was very fun and being an old person, a nice diversion. If you haven't seen the prior movies, or read the books, then I'd skip the movie as it won't make much sense. (Hence a prior review comparing it to X-men. Really?!?!) Otherwise I think it tied in twilight's original feel and look, which made it best movie since twilight. I will be going back again to watch in in theater and buying the DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's at least the most entertaining in the series.,"Well, it's finally over, or at least it's supposed to be over since I hear they're thinking about spin offs. The last Twilight, and just as a refresher, here's what I thought of the other four. Twilight: Didn't like it. New Moon: Not really good, but had enough moments to be watchable. Eclipse: I would say was OK. Breaking Dawn Part 1: Didn't like it. And now we have hit the final film, and it's certainly the most entertaining in the series, at least for half of it maybe.Because when this movie slows down, it REALLY slows down. It can get so boring at points that I wanted to just stop watching. Bella's exposition narration was, well, as pointless as it was in ""The Last Airbender."" But that film at least was cut down and tried to fit a season of a TV show into one movie. This is fitting one half a book into a movie that's the end of a franchise, I don't think anyone will find it weird if it's longer. The actress who played Renesmee wasn't very good, I'm sure she tried her hardest, but would it kill her to have any other expression other than just blank staring. And I thought the main villain was supposed to be Dakota Fanning, but she doesn't do anything, literally, I don't even remember her talking.Now for the positives: Bella actually does stuff other than mope and complain. She did start to get better in the last movie, but now she's actually fighting and doing stuff. And it's a good thing too, if Bella turned into a Vampire than didn't do anything, I would have been so angry. The movie seems to have a sense of humor in the beginning that pokes fun at the series, allowing for some actual entertainment. The villains are actually a threat, the leader being so over the top at times that I found myself laughing. And the final battle was actually really fun. It's just vampires and werewolves beating the crap out of each other, and it was actually quite entertaining. Thank God, since the movie was being very slow up to this point.Now let's talk the twist, I won't spoil it, but it's the only twist ending I've ever seen that both infuriated me, and was also awesome at the same time. So...good job Twilight, you ended your series with you best, or at least most entertaining movie, even if it was still only just OK, so don't mess it up.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fifth Time's The Charm,"Hello, Hello all, I'm here with another movie review. This time I'm covering the latest in the Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2, and I hope to shed some light on the final episode of the series. Now you've seen plenty of debate in this series with many hating everything about this series, while others think it's the best vampire series to ever exist. With all the bias towards this series, it may be hard to determine whether this movie is worth spending time in the theater or should just be blown off. Let's see if I can shed some light on the subject.With last year's rather over-hyped prequel, I'll admit I wasn't looking forward to the second installment of Breaking Dawn. Although the trailers showed some interesting direction, I had my doubts that they could actually do something to extend the last few pages of the book. However, the directing team was able to accomplish their goal, in what may be the most impressive movie yet to hit the series. Just what makes this movie so great though. My first strength was the dialog. While most of the movies lines are overemotional, lovey dovey, one dimensional quotes from the book that made me roll my eyes, this one was a little different. I found this installment to have more balance still sticking to some of the classic lines, but throwing in some well-timed comedy. The insults and banter between Jacob and the vampires were quite entertaining to the audience and me, and I thought some of the extra characters even had some funny moments with the parts they played. Charlie (Billy Burke) in particular had me laughing the most, with his awkward comedy and real facial gestures combining to be very funny. Aside from the comedy, the movie did have some good dialog play on other parts, particularly when it involved making plans involving the Cullen's battle against all odds. Of course being Twilight, this movie also had its share of romantic dialog, many being lines quote from the book, which should comfort die-hard fans of the series. While some of the romance was captured in these mooshy quotes, some of it still made me laugh or roll my eyes at the cheesiness that still remains.Aside from the dialog what else was good about this movie? I guess my next biggest thing is the balance this movie has. While this Twilight still has that romantic feel that will have fans crying awe, this film had other things to keep the movie going. For one thing there was some suspense to the movie, as all the behind the scenes of the book were brought to life on screen. The Vultori's movements, the attempt to control hunger, and even the training scenes were all well shot to keep the suspense building. Between these scenes, fans are certain to enjoy the love dynamic not only between Edward and Bella (which includes a seven minute love scene), but spread amongst the other members of the family, especially Renessmee. I felt that there was actually a family dynamic between the Cullen's this time instead of them all just being in the same room and just hugging each other's mate and giving that Abercrombie and Fitch smolder. Throw in the extra vampire's backstory and loyalty, and well you have quite a story builder that keeps the movie going forward much faster than the other films. Yet there was still another dynamic thrown into the mix that helped bring this movie to a full circle, the action. Now many reviews and commercials are going to say it's the most action packed, which is true, however don't think this means its Cullen slam fest 2012. Most of the 105 minutes stays true to the romantic soup I previously mentioned, but there are a few scenes of fast running and fighting thrown in to pick up the pace. However, the action to mention is the battle at the end, which takes up ten minutes of the film and has plenty of impressive moves that impressed me, and some simple punches that didn't. While the fight is impressive, there are some things that needed some work to make it better, the biggest being some rather spastic camera work during the fight.Still not impressed with the movie? I have a few other points to cover that might change your mind. The soundtrack for this movie was rather good, with many of the musical scores fitting the scenes' emotions perfectly. As for the acting, well it has somewhat improved, but still remains the same model poster, cardboard acting that has made the series famous. Kristen Stewart continues showing her unemotional acting skills off delivering most of her lines in that awkward monotone way, and fails in her attempts to be angry, which is rather funny. However, most people going in know the acting isn't the best, but go for the looks of the characters. Yes, my fans there are still plenty of hot body scenes to go around, as both Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are still present. Unfortunately for you girls, Lautner keeps his tight shirts on for most of the movie so you might be disappointed in that aspect. Guys , you're not out of the loop on this one though, as the new vampires not only bring guys, but a few beautiful girls as well, especially the blonde cousins.Breaking Dawn 2 finally has the balance the series has needed and wrapped up the series impressively. Although the acting, editing, and dialog still need some tightening up, most of the mistakes from the previous films have been corrected or improved upon. My opinion is to catch this movie in theaters as it is worth a second trip for me, but definitely hit it up on Netflix. My scores are: Adventure/Drama/Fantasy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0-7.5 Series: 9.5 Contact me at rkarim11@su.edu for more discussion or constructive criticism.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not bad... but I have a lot of things I didn't like.,"TWILIGHT: BREAKING DAWN PART IIOK, now I have some issues with these movies. I have seen them all now with my girlfriend, who is a massive fan. She has read all the books and seen all the movies and loves every bit of it. I on the other hand, am not impressed too much.I did enjoy them, they are very entertaining movies and I can see why they are popular. But I won't be reading the books.In case you don't know, Twilight is a love story between a mortal girl, a vampire and a guy who changes into a werewolf.I love vampire movies out of all the mythical creatures, vampires are my favourite by far. But this story killed 2 of the most important things about vampires. 1. Vampires have fangs to help them drink the blood of their victims... not in this movie! They have normal teeth. 2. Vampires can't go in the sunlight because they burn Nope, not here... they glisten and shine in the sunlight. I was not happy about that at all... when I saw the first movie I was really disappointed with those facts because it goes against what vampires are.Anywho, back to the final chapter in the series... This one was OK in places. The story is good, the action was good, even the acting was alright. There are some really good actors in this film. I don't rate Robert Pattinson much. He is OK, but I don't think he is as good as everyone else seems to think he is. Kristen Stewart did well in this one... I prefer her character the way she is in this movie compared to her previous ones. Then you have Dakota Fanning who has always been an amazing actress, and then Michael Sheen... this guy is awesome and has made some brilliant films in the past.But, the effects in the film were terrible, Bellas baby was clearly a computer generated baby, you could see how unrealistic it was. Also, when the vampires were running in the forest and jumping around, you could see they were on wires... you could not see the wires, but it all looked a bit too much like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.But, finally the ending was painful! I felt like I had been robbed. I hated the ending to this movie. I watched it in the cinema and when the ending happened there were a lot of groans in the cinema. I don't think there were many people happy with what happened but my girlfriend loved it. Maybe it's a girl thing. JAnyway, I will give Breaking Dawn Part 2 a 6 out of 10.The whole series was entertaining, but it definitely had its weak moments and the less said about the end the better!For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Nutshell Review: Breaking Dawn Part 2,"And so we finally bid farewell to one film franchise that managed to survive the odds at the box office, propped by die hard fans and the curious, or by those, like me, who are completist with high threshold of pain. Despite negative and scathing reviews, the Twilight films suffered no dent in its revenue stream, and having the audacity to split the final book, like what Harry Potter did, to bring more money for the studios. But unlike the boy wizard's final installment, Breaking Dawn actually didn't have much content to justify the split, other than to dangle in its trailer an all out slug-fest, turning it into an action film with what I thought was an extremely shrewd move to get detractors into seats, just to see their hated characters getting ripped to pieces.Or not. There were a couple of inherently strange and twisted plots and subplots in the franchise that I wonder just what's brewing in writer Stephenie Meyer's mind, having to go against the established grain that vampires can survive under ultra-violet light, and sparkle at that, while also developing X-Men inspired mutant powers in addition to Superman like abilities. I suppose one has to buy into Twilight's logic in order to enjoy it, but if it keeps pushing the envelope of the ridiculous, one can only call it a day, with this movie churning out a finale that I'm not embarrassed to reveal would be something for comic book movie fans, if only it had the guts to stick to what it did, rather than to cop it out, exactly in the same way how Ong Bak 3 did it.But what's more disturbing are, firstly, already revealed in Breaking Dawn Part 1, was that the already dead Edward (Robert Pattinson) can actually impregnate Bella (Kristen Stuart), which even the Volturi, headed by Aro (Michael Sheen) deem impossible to happen. But it did, which events from that film, culminating in the third party Jacob (Taylor Lautner) having to sexually groom a female infant, who will grow at breakneck speed in this installment. Let's not forget he's a wolf too, so you can do the math. Fantasy romance is one thing, and some lines of decency shouldn't be crossed, considering that the novels were targeted at a particular population demographic.In many ways this followed the formula employed by the slew of many superhero origin movies, with Bella, now immortal and very powerful, showing off and discovering many other new found abilities. With every challenge thrown her way, be it trying to stave off her instinct for human blood, to dealing with slightly more mature issues in reconciliation with her dad, there's nothing to even make her break into a sweat, which kind of makes it very boring indeed. And that's not all, considering that the story had thrown a lot more cardboard X-Men characters on screen, from those who can deliver electric shocks to some who can control the elements, just to fill up some half hour worth of CG laden mano-a-mano, only for the rug to be fulled under one's feet. This overshadowed the main thread of having tell the Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy) story, a human-vampire hybrid who is the great unknown, with powers unseen and an unbelievable growth rate, having a pet wolf sworn to be by her side in Jacob.Director Bill Condon really had his work cut out for him in making the movie, having to put up with cringe-worthy lines that will induce one to roll one's eyeballs, many times over. The acting by all from Pattinson to Stewart to the many support acts all showed a certain eager tolerance to be over and done with this. Michael Sheen hams it up in really boring fashion as the all powerful judge, jury and executioner, while Dakota Fanning probably signed on the dotted line to pay the bills, having to utter absolutely nothing, but to turn up in the office, show her face and act nasty. In fact, everyone did just that, including the leads,If looked at on the whole, it's suffice to say this film franchise started off quite brightly (heh), only to have stretched itself too thin based on really lightweight material by its author. One can only put lovelorn and infatuation on screen for so many films without the feeling of repetition and deja-vu, before finally reaching its goal of a certain idea that was realized in the final installment - the crave for power and immortality, as can be seen from Bella's smirk each time someone mentions she is powerful. I suspect the story's none other than a stroke of one's ego and fantasy.For the target audience, perhaps this film franchise is gold. But to the rest, well, this is something destined for the books as one really strange film anomaly.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Movie but Could Have Been Better,"I think the people behind this movie knew what they were doing. As the guy who gets dragged to all to all the movies to hold the popcorn and pay for drinks, I've seen the entire saga. By far, this movie was the best, however, Kristen Stewart continues to suck the life out of her lines, the actors around her obviously trying to support her, but she ruins the entire scene. I did however, love the Romanian vampires and the ending. The film had beautiful cinematography, directing and editing, good pacing, and with the exception of Kristen Stewart; wonderful acting. There was well timed comic relief and tension that continued throughout the entire movie, which kept the viewers interested. With a bit of casting changes, few script re-writes and no sparkles, this movie would have gone beyond its current state. I think most people hated this movie because it was already stained by the devastation that was new moon and twilight.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Really, really, really BAD...","This movie had absolutely nothing worth watching for. It contains no real story, acting was terrible (especially Kirsten-but for bad acting I also blame the awful script and directing), everything was just so mellow......In the middle of the movie I really wanted to start crying (but not for the same reason for which the other spectators kept crying all threw the movie) just because of pure disappointment even though I wasn't expecting much of this movie in the first place.If I could go back in time I would never go see this movie even though that it is the last part.

I am surprised,"This was the first movie I really liked in this series since the first one. The 2nd one i didn't like at all, the 3rd one was eh, and the fourth part 1 was okay. Breaking Dawn Part 2 was an improvement from the 2nd,3rd,and 4th Part1 films. The first 30 minutes of BD 2 had some cheesy moments but they sharpened it up for the middle and end portion. I loved the pacing in this film and I like that they got scores from all previous movies as well as the most current ones to kind of go full circle. I think Melissa Rosenberg (sciptwriter) wasn't a good choice for this movie series because some of her writing is cheesy, but she made an improvement as well when all the cheesy moments were only in the beginning portion. I'm disappointed that the movies got better at the last one and that should have started at Eclipse.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Beautiful,"Don't care what the critics say, this is for the fans. I was overwhelmed, it was so moving to me and I'm glad I went to see the movie alone so I didn't have to explain or be distracted(like I did last year when my sister took me to see Breaking Dawn Part I) from one glorious moment. For me it did not disappoint! The movie was meant to be entertaining, pure escapism and it accomplished that. The movie was true to the book(s) and I've read them all. Great cinematography, just beautiful locations, Director Bill Conte is incredible. It's amazing given the storyline and subject matter that this series doesn't have to resort to the gratuitous gore factor. For the record I'm Team Jacob.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining...,"Whew! I just finished watching an advanced screening of Breaking Dawn Part 2 and I must say, the second half of the series' final installment is better than the first. Director Bill Condon knew what the audience crave and gave it to them. Jaw dropping scenes (especially for Twihard fans) will keep you glued and might stop you from reaching for that popcorn. Let's just say that some Twihards in the cinema with me was shocked and some even cried as the latter part of the movie unfold then, BAM! The presentation of the baby Renesmee in my own opinion is necessary so as to be consistent with how the girl looks later in the film. Just watch it and be entertained. I enjoyed my evening watching it with some newfound Twihard friends. :)",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
They finally broke 5.0 on IMDb since Twilight! But...,"Let's be honest; we all know how bad the movie adaptations of the book series up to BDpt2 were, and if you think they were good then no disrespect but don't reed reviews because almost anything will entertain you.To start things off this movie is an improvement but unfortunately it makes very similar mistakes to its predecessors.Acting: Even though Pattinson has shown his acknowledgeable acting skills in some of his previous movies and the fact that this movie has some skilled acting veterans in its cast. Unfortunitly the acting is still par to the average soap opera. It voids emotion in the key aspects of the movie, and exaggerates in the miner scenes.Plot: I know people always say ""It was very different from the book."" But let me tell you... This was nothing like the second half of the book... Although that doesn't make it a pure disappointment(if your a fan of the series.) It had its action and emotion when it needed it but in all, saying it was way better then New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn Pt1 all together, does not make it enjoyable to the average observer.In closing, If you were a fan: then you will enjoy it like you have for all the Twilight films...If you are not a fan: you will wonder why these movies can make profit in the high hundreds of millions!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A stupidly entertaining finale to an entertainingly stupid series,"What can I say that hasn't been said already? A plot synopsis or any background information is practically redundant because I imagine that if you're reading this (not very good) review, you already know the setup.'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part Two '(that title's not clumsy at all) is my first Twilight-related experience since the Chris Weitz- directed 'New Moon', I must say however, I'm not one of these people who passionately despises the series, nor am I someone who lives for it, i.e. a 'twi-hard'; honestly, I'm somewhat passive about the series. I kind of enjoyed the first two installments, finding the shoddy visual effects, cheesy dialogue, often flat performances and ludicrousness to be consistently entertaining.It's worth noting that (in a manner somewhat similar to the Harry Potter films) the cast have eased into their roles and appear more comfortable in them than ever before. At the same time though, the trademarks of the series are still present - the lingering and forlorn frowns, the lip- biting and Taylor Lautner's way of saying ""Bella"" when he gets 'emotional'. Also worth a mention is Michael Sheen's performance as Aro; exactly what the franchise needs, he's ridiculously camp and OTT, which is displayed delightfully in a moment of maniacal laughter that wouldn't have been out of place in an episode of Adam West's Batman. It was similarly nice to see Lee Pace, a personal favourite of mine, get some screen time.Out of all the Twilight films I've seen thus far, I found this to be the most solidly enjoyable, offering a number of scenes where it embraced its inherent absurdity. These included (but was not limited to) Bella wrestling a mountain lion, the creepy relationship between Jacob and borderline MacGuffin child Renesmee, and Bella beating the crap out of Jacob. There were also moments where I wondered if it was consciously laughing at itself - Jacob's ""should I start calling you Dad?"" remark to Edward and dad Charlie's confusion at his granddaughter's name. Interestingly though, the CGI incarnation of baby Renesmee resembled some sort of demon-child that you'd find in a 70s horror film. A final act showdown showcases the best action and effects displayed throughout the series, unfortunately and frustratingly, it is robbed of its entertainment factor following a cheap twist. In the end, all it really amounts to is ""creepy soapy claptrap"", as Danny Leigh remarked, but let's not forget that there is indeed a place for ""creepy soapy claptrap"".",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not anything like what I was told to expect.,"There's a weird amount of variety in the cinematic 'Twilight' saga. The first movie is teen and high school awkwardness wrapped up with supernatural elements and young love. The second movie is a bizarre sidestep, rife with issues, that doesn't meaningfully advance the plot. The third movie is a surprisingly solid burst of action-horror - and the fourth movie, 'Breaking dawn - Part 1,' mostly puts all this on a back burner to emphasize pure human drama. The fifth and final movie, 'Breaking dawn - Part 2,' promises a completion of the saga, the consummation of Bella's dream - and a return to the core of the overarching narrative that, to one extent or another, is the real heart of it all. Each successive film illustrated further development of the skills of all involved, and improvements in important areas, though the greatest flaw can't entirely be helped, as Stephanie Meyer's source material, the books, are plagued with some deep, deep problems that demand robust critical assessment. As if all this weren't enough, it also needs to be stated that while the grand plot is relatively small in scope, and its realization on film is unexpectedly strong, it tries to weave in so many ideas, flavors, tones, and story beats that it's hard for all the constituent parts to feel balanced. And this is where we enter the last film.Veteran director Bill Condon returns from this entry's immediate predecessor and again illustrates his skills with a sharp eye for arranging shots and scenes, and for guiding his cast. And that cast illustrates their capabilities with displays of acting that are a far cry from the generally thoughtless nay-saying that often follows from movies aimed at women or teen girls. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson stand out above all, naturally, but they and the large ensemble cast all exhibit noteworthy range, nuance, strength and force of personality, poise, and physicality that's fitting not just for the feature at hand, but for all the great performances they've turned in before or since. Billy Burke also distinctly stands out as Bella's father, Charlie, a man struggling to cope with everything his daughter has been through, and has put him through. And others: Peter Facinelli, Ashley Greene, Elizabeth Reaser, Nikki Reed, Michael Sheen, Rami Malek, Maggie Grace, Lee Pace, Mackenzie Foy, and all the rest, no matter how much screen time they have, all show the same welcome, gratifying dexterity, far exceeding what they are given to work with and what Internet opinion would have us believe. Even Taylor Lautner, almost certainly the weakest link on hand, nonetheless demonstrates further growth as an actor beyond the paltry display we saw earlier in the franchise.As with the prior pictures, screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg again lends her considerable gifts to adapt Meyer's sorely troubled novels. With all the power she can muster, Rosenberg paints over the indelicacies in the source material to serve up the best possible rendition thereof. The arguable peak of Meyer's problematic works, the notion of imprinting as it applies to supporting character Jacob, is against all odds softened to the point of being almost (kind of) slightly palatable. The quasi-love triangle that defined much of the saga, somewhat unconvincingly before, is resolved in what I think is a very satisfying way. The dialogue is real, and earnest. Characters are complex and believable. Scene writing is wonderfully diverse, and engaging - rich and impactful whether the mood is dire, exciting, sorrowful, heartwarming, or otherwise. And the narrative? It's perhaps overfull and brusque in its advancement, mostly coming together a little too neatly so as to offer emotional and visceral fulfillment rather than utmost storytelling prudence. But even at that, the story is complete and cohesive, well considered, and very easy to get invested in.And with that, it's important to single out the climax of 'Part 2.' Because the climax, in turn, initially comes across as joining the ranks of that excessive tidiness - and is then rife with stupendous tension, and terrifically thrilling fantasy action violence - before making a hairpin turn and dabbling with a trope that I despise in fiction, but which is utilized, here, with true, dazzling brilliance. What's more, all this is to the credit of Rosenberg, as I'm given to understand the treatment of this story beat in Meyer's book is decidedly less than invigorating, and even anticlimactic. I cannot overstate - all due respect to Melissa Rosenberg for an incredible job in turning the climax of the fourth book on its head. And that's not all! The special effects that have steadily improved throughout the films arguably are at their best here: not perfect, but suitable, and fun, and that also goes for the wolves. The costume design, and the hair and makeup that initially impressed in the first two movies as garish, has never looked better, and the technical craft is beyond reproach - art direction, production design, cinematography, lighting, and all else. And it all comes together with a climax that genuinely impresses, and with an ending that is frankly beautiful.I do not jest when I say that I could carry on for much, much longer dissecting every last iota of 'Breaking dawn, Part 2' specifically, and of the series broadly. Because when, all these years later, I decided to sit and watch these movies, I did so with immense skepticism, over a decade of having been flooded with negative opinions and mockery, and expectations that were mixed at best. And I cannot overstate how pleased I am that the viewing experience has not been the one I anticipated - I step away at least liking the 'Twilight' movies, flaws and all, if not altogether loving (some of) them. The vast majority of all I had been led to believe about the franchise was simply false. Whatever the peculiarities, the idiosyncrasies, the faults, the weird production decisions - I think the contributions of every director in the series have been solid. I think Melissa Rosenberg's adapted screenplays have been exceptional, not least of all in tackling source material that is much worse, in too many ways, than the most unsightly faults on film. I think the large, impressive cast give strong performances contradicting the outright antagonism that has been unjustly heaped upon them (and Stewart especially) in all the time since. That these movies are as good as they are is a swell testament to the skills of the cast, and crew, and everyone involved. And 'Breaking Dawn - Part 2' really is the best of them: a conclusion that is satisfying, and rewarding, and even fulfilling.I don't know if I would have been able to appreciate these titles 10 years ago the way that I can now. I do know that I would without hesitation, in 2022, call myself a fan of the 'Twilight' films, and the fifth and final picture in particular is as close to perfect as the series would get. No one is more surprised than I am, but here we are.Cheers.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So drawn out,"I don't know why they made two movies from the final book, but I felt that the movie was too far drawn out. Emphasis on scenes that are of minor importance to the arch of the story.

There were far too many places where the story became melodramatic and boring.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Who's Mom did the CG for this film?,"Honestly, I'm not a Twilight doomsayer. I found the first couple at least fair to decent, but the series did deteriorate.When I watched and cackled during Breaking Dawn Part 1, I couldn't believe how bad the film was, but my wife, in her wisdom and accuracy said 'you shouldn't see part 2 then'. I responded with 'well part 1 was terrible - generally without dialogue or direction and the CG that has been awful through the other movies has continued the tradition in part 1.' Honestly, those wolves are so poorly modeled and animated, it's painful.My wife looked at me and said, 'I really don't want to be in the room with you if you watch part 2'. She was right. She didn't want to be in the room.OMG, that baby was complete freakshow. I think Sharktopus on the SciFi channel was built and rigged better. Baby needs bloom.Part 2 sadly is without dialogue or direction. The special effects cause a migration in the film from just bad to humorous so that leaves me with this rating.I might have rated it slightly higher if it hadn't cost so much. I know where the money went in this film, but it wasn't in production, creation, concept or detail.Enjoy the film if you can",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good adaptation of the book,"As someone who read and very much enjoyed the books I thought this a rather good adaptation and an enjoyable movie. Others here have complained about things like introducing characters who have relatively small parts, but since all of the Twilight movies are relatively faithful book adaptations I think it would really have been a disservice to the fans to have excluded these characters. There were certainly some changes and omissions, but that is to be expected in any adaptation of a book. In my opinion they did a good job of covering what needed to be covered and making for a satisfying conclusion to the movie franchise.I heard that the ending would be a surprise and it certainly was. I thought it worked very well and it did not disappoint.In summary, if you're a Twilight book fan this is a must-see, just like the rest. If you're a Twilight hater I'm not sure why you'd bother.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The long-awaited end, for the worst reasons.","This film is the latest in a saga of five based on a series of ""best seller"" books. I never read the books (nor do I intend to), but if Edward and Bella's story should be epic it won't be thanks to these films.The plot of this film is summarized as follows: after a difficult delivery in which she truly dies, Bella ends up being a vampire, as she longed for. Now, you need to learn to control your bloodlust and your newly acquired powers and abilities, as well as to disguise your new condition when necessary. At the same time, and just when everything seems to be going well, the Cullens will have to defend themselves against a false accusation in the face of the relentless Volturi, who are on their way to probably kill them all.Bill Condon continues to provide direction and gives the film a good sense of direct connection to its predecessor, as well as a good, closed and well-done conclusion. In clear contrast to the film that precedes it, this is the least romantic, with the novel giving way to a more interesting plot where adaptation to a new life, followed by the threat of war, are the strong points. It was also the most interesting and appealing film in the saga, the most cinematic and the most epic, in my opinion. The rhythm was more worked, but it still drags a lot in moments that seem unnecessary. The climax is, of course, the confrontation between the Cullens and the Volturi, and the ending is quite good and puts a clear and definitive end to the saga.Despite everything, the film still has problems, parallel and endemic to the whole saga. Looking at the big picture, now that I have seen all the films, I really think that the fault lies more with the incompetence of the screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg, and not so much with the successive directors, although the lack of firm hands and the inconstancy in this field (with each film to be made by a different director, in practice) did not help the quality of the whole. Parallel to the whole saga, a warm and boring story that can only be saved thanks to sub-plots of action, suspense or danger, with bad dialogues and bad material given to the actors. Never as in this saga of five films has it been so clear to see the damage that a bad screenwriter can do to a film or, in this case, an entire film cycle!Another problem that this film presents, and which is also parallel to the whole saga, is the poor performance of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, two actors who, in my view, should never have been placed here. There were casting errors. Stewart is much better in this film than in all the others, but she remains an actress without expression, and that will be something she will have to change and improve in future works if she wants to succeed. Pattinson has achieved minimal chemistry with her, but he is still far short of what he should have achieved, even individually. Taylor Lautner, who started the saga well and grew, ended badly. From a serious actor playing a nice character, he has become a bunch of muscles that, when he takes off his shirt, turns into a furball. The secondary cast maintains the positive level of previous films. Billy Burke and Ashley Greene are very good, as are Peter Facinelli, Elizabeth Reaser, Nikki Reed, Maggie Grace and Booboo Stewart. On the Volturi side, Dakota Fanning was fine but had little to do and I didn't like Michael Sheen. I think he put too much pressure on the stereotypes of the European noble vampire when thinking about his character. Rami Malek makes a brief appearance, but shows ability and talent.Technically, the film has ups and downs. The CGI wolves don't look as good and realistic as in the first films, the fight scenes look like contemporary dance due to excessive choreography and the bloodless deaths are not credible. I am not an apologist for a bath of liters of false blood, but as the people say, ""neither eight nor eighty"". Another problem is Renesmee ... the baby looks so unreal and fake that they could have used it on a children's toy instead. Carter Burwell's soundtrack has space to stand out and is very good, standing out in the initial credits (longer than usual in the franchise) and in the finals, where Christina Perri's excellent song ""A Thousand Years"" stands out. Good scenarios, props, costumes (especially Volturi uniforms) and very good images of large-scale landscapes complete the technical work.This film ends the less successful and less epic saga of the epic sagas. Dragging for five films what could have been easily done in four, it lacks everything, starting with a duo of central characters capable of moving and moving us. The introduction of elements of tension and danger to temper excessive sweetness and mask the flaws of the actors, but they did not make this film (or its predecessors) good films. They just helped them make it bearable.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A visually appealing, yet unsatisfying end.","Out of all the Twilight films, this film is the best in terma of cinematography and CGI. The acting is a soight improvemt by 3% from the previous films. But, it was just frustrating. I have to admit, but I kinda like the premise of Breaking Dawn Part 1 and 2. Vampire has a child with human who turns into a vampire. I found the premise the most interesting out of all the films. But, it is directed sooooo poorly and the acti g is just AWFUL. The thing that completely ruines the film for me is that it was building up to this epic showdown. I really wanted to see that and we do, but not in the way you expect ir to. What they do in the final battle is tragically unbelievable. I just felt so frustrated. So this is the final film in the series and there are still plot arcs and storylines still unresolved in the ens. Yea, kinda of a let down, but it's Twilighr for goodness sake.

An epic finish to the Twilight franchise,"After the birth of Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy)in Breaking Dawn Part 1, Bella (Kristen Stewart) wakes up to find herself in the world of the Cullens as a newborn vampire.

So the Volturi proclaim them guilty and they declare war on the Cullens. But the Cullens take matter into their own hands by gathering their army of vampire witnesses in an effort to defeat them .Now overall the film was great. The acting was effective, the special effects were a bit obnoxious. But the only things that got to me were Dakota Fanning as Volturi member Jane and the final battle sequence at the end. I loved the effects with how the Volturi and the Cullens collided within the mountain battlefield.The film is a good time with good acting, an epic fight sequence, new faces including well-known from previous Twilight films and a good story that wraps up the four-book series by Stephenie Meyer that took five films and a great story that combines action and romance with the werewolf and the vampire",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The movie does nothing to raise the bar over past entries in the series and seems content with its mediocre at very best delivery.,"Breaking Dawn Part 2 starts where the last movie leaves off with Bella(Kristen Stewart) having to adapt to her new vampire abilities as well as become acquainted with her half vampire/human daughter Renessmee(no her name never sounds natural even after 2 movies). It does not take long before Edward Cullen(Robert Pattinson) and Bella realize that Jacob(Taylor Lautner) has imprinted their daughter and the issue is immediately(an a little too quickly) dealt with. After a few weeks of living in peace, another vampire, Irina, sees Renessmee and mistakes her for an immortal child( a sort of uncontrollable infant vampire). Irina immediately goes to the Volturi led by Aro(Michael Sheen) and misinforms him of the threat the Cullen child poses to the vampiric race. The Cullens find out that the Volturi are coming and attempt to gather as many allies as they can to stand by Renessmee.

The end.For those of you who did not manage to stay awake till the end of the first bore fest that was Breaking Dawn I, Bella and Edward get married, and consummate their marriage, Bella almost dying (Edward still getting cheered by teenage girls shouting ""Hero"") and so Bella fell pregnant and Edward had to turn her into a vampire to keep her alive to make more money for this film.Breaking Dawn II sees Bella try to adjust to her life as a vampire with her new powers and her new responsibility being a mother.Based on Stephanie Meyer's popular series, Breaking Dawn sees Bella and Edward try to recruit vampires from around the world to assist in their defence against the Volturi. The reasoning behind the concern comes about stupidly and there are a lot of terms and conditions which are discussed at length, which seem to replicate the novel in many ways.Many reviewers and critics have said this is your conventional Twilight film, with a paper thin plot and faceless acting. Whilst this is true, this is still an entertaining film.As with previous releases the great quality of these films is its ability to bring in new faces. Anna Kendrick blossomed whilst Ashley Greene and Nikki Reed have grown in praise.Focus inevitably surrounds Pattinson and Stewart. Edward has evolved through the films becoming stronger and overcoming his emotionally over exaggerated issues and he even smiles a few times in this film. Stewart's Bella finally comfortable in her own skin is given new challenges as she adjusts to life as a vampire. Her character development is interesting to see as she tackles learning her powers and becoming emotionally hardened by her new life.Jacob Black was very present in the novel as we gained an insight into his change of heart towards the vampire clan and his imprinting. Here however there isn't much character involvement as would have been desired (don't worry girls there is still the always present removal of clothes) but the special effects for the wolves are the best since they were introduced.The effects for this film are, interesting. The sequence in the snow is amazing in terms of scenery and the bluntness of the fights isn't always skewered to accommodate the 12A rating, meaning there's blood and broken bones to enjoy. But in one of the most ridiculous things in all of human history, I have never seen someone's power be to project blurry lines out of their body to protect someone they love. And since when do vampires have powers anyway? I can read your mind, I can see the future, I can run at a million miles an hour through a forest and coincidentally always miss the trees even though I'm looking sideways.But that's the thing about this film, it is ridiculous. But for the first time since Twilight and arguably Eclipse, this is more entertaining. There is some good action, not too much dramatic romantic implication scenarios, some great one liners from Billy Burke and a sense of anticipation, even though it's slight, that the film is going somewhere.Breaking Dawn II then is a ridiculous piece of cinema that is quite different from the novel but by being more outlandish with its ideas, at least will entertain you right until its ending.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lame,"Bella (Kristen Stewart) is now a full-fledged Vampire with baby. Someone sees Bella's daughter, Renesmme, -that's a real name? - act in such a manner that the person believes the child was turned. Aro (Michael Sheen) the head Vampire of the Volturri (Vampire royalty) is so informed. Turning a child is against Vampire Law and the penalty, if the charge is true, is death for both mother and daughter.Well, here we are. At the end. Thankfully. About time. Hopefully. Please let this be the end of it. I can't do it anymore. PleaseLet's recap: The first one was good. We saw Edward (Robert Pattinson), the Vampire, woo Bella and Bella wanted him to turn her. Edward wouldn't do it. Then, Breaking Dawn Part I: was really about nothing but getting all of us into the theaters again, but Bella got her wish and was turned.Breaking Dawn Pt II. Bella likes being a Vampire and does all the acrobatics that she saw Edward do in earlier parts. She is loving life. Ooops, can I say that?Most of the movie is Bella and Edward convincing their Vampire friends that Renesmme (Mackenzie Foy) was not bitten, hence not turned. Will the Volturri believe this? Will war break out? Inquiring minds, you see.Let's get to it: here is my problem with this movie. Seemed like ALL - with one exception: Aro - acting performances were of the wooden ilk. All behaved like they were in a trance. The dialogues appeared to be dubbed in. Watch their mouths closely and you will see there is a space between the spoken word and movement of lips. I couldn't help but noticing this as it was blatantly obvious. And, lastly, I kind of got the impression that Jacob (Taylor Lautner) will wait for Renesmee – really, a real name? – to become an adult. See where this is going?I thought Vampire reflections could not be seen in a mirror, but we see Bella and Edward's looking at their reflections in a mirror. (What are you doing? You know there are no such things as Vampires)Michael Sheen's character Aro was THE breath of fresh air in here and we wished he had a bigger part. The CGI was okay. Let's face it, this movie definitely needed CGI.In case you missed past Twilight movies, we are given a short recap of them at the end. This kind of takes your attention off this Breaking Dawn Pt II, which is truly lame.Anyway, take a breath, it's all over.it is, isn't it? I don't think I can do it again. (3/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Not really, chalk it up to a make-out session. Nudity: No. Language: No.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Non-Twilight Reader Movie Review - Part 2,"I have never read any of the Twilight books, and after seeing all four movies (which I got hooked on one day when they all came on cable, on after another), I haven't really wanted to ever read them. But for some reason I was drawn to finding out how everything ended, so after seeing Part 1, I really was ready to see Part 2, especially when people kept telling me how good it was.I had no idea how it ended or anything about the story before I saw it, on purpose, so this movie (the ending especially) was a real treat for me. Kristen Stewart drove me nuts in every other movie, but in this one, I actually liked her. I HATED that they used CGI for that little girl. HATED. I have no reason why that was even suggested, much less followed through on. And you would think that if they were planning on doing that, this is a franchise with almost unlimited funds, they would have found a graphics team that could have done better than this one did. And while we are on the subject of ridiculous things that shouldn't have happened, that stupid line about the loch ness monster (could have been in the book, who knows?) should never been in this movie and I don't know how any actress could have pulled that off without bursting into laughter and walking off the set.I had a hard time following some of the things going on, probably because I hadn't read the book. And I thought it was completely pointless to make this into two movies, instead of making one kick-&^% movie (which they could have if they really wanted to, but you know, revenue got in the way!) The entire movie franchise was salvaged the second I saw Carlisle's head in Aro's hand. I then watched one of the best fight scenes I've seen, mainly because of all of the main characters who were killed. Then, I got to the end and realized it was all a vision. Great, great ending.All in all, this movie was the best of the five for me. They could have had better dialogue. At some point, there will be good film adaptations for books (I was so disappointed in the Hunger Games, as I have read that book) but I am guessing, this wasn't one of them. However, it certainly wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good riddance, Twilight.","The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 is seriously boring. Nothing happens for the entire movie, but, don't worry, it's all building up for the much anticipated finale when. . .nothing happens. For most of the movie, characters stand around, stare at each other and occasionally recite lines. The only eventful part of the story is nothing but a cheap fake-out. Without Rifftrax, I wouldn't have made it through this terrible film. Good riddance, Twilight.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A huge improvement!,"Not really a fan of the Twilight Saga, but I also don't hate it. My biggest problem with this series has always been the awful acting that plagued the first 4 movies.
Edward was constipated 247, and Bella was just so bland and flat and always looked just weird. This movie honestly really fixes that. All of the leads put on the best performance in the series and it's a satisfying end to the series when it's over. Without spoiling anything, this movie does without a doubt have the best action scene and you will have a lot of fun at that part of the movie.
Only compliant honestly is I wish we saw more of Bella as a vampire, we had 4 movies building up to it and we get her transformation scene and the other scene and that's about it. The movie was pretty short so it could of added some run time to play around more with that concept.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cozy and comforting,"I can imagine a lot of people discarding the Twilight movie series as teenage werewolf crap. Indeed, one needs to be strong to swallow wish-wash like ""Oh no, he has just imprinted on my baby!"". It is also unwise to try to find implausibilities such as how it is possible that plain humans don't know about the vampire's existence. But if you can look past the vampire and werewolf bullshit, you will find a truly great movie. Because apart from these complaints, all other aspects are simply marvelous: great acting, beautiful visuals, nice special effects and some exciting action scenes. And what really sets Twilight apart from other beautiful movies are the cozy one-big-happy-family feeling and the comforting we're-on-top-of-the-world atmosphere, amplified by the great soundtrack and the beautiful woody environment. I wish more movies would breathe so much happiness, friendship and warmth.True: as this is the fifth part in the series it is more of the same, but it is very well done all the same. I feel like the series grew on me. Maybe it is because the makers have fine-tuned their work, or maybe it is just that I became immune to the vampire nonsense. Nonetheless I think this was the best part in the series and I would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Expected More Than This,"well i actually am a fan of the twilight saga and i was always interested in how the saga ends. If Bela was transformed in the breaking dawn part 1, the movie would have been better. things wouldn't have been in a rush and put everything together in one movie just to finish the saga. the ending of the movie shocked me. when the battle was just a vision from Alice and nobody had died. actually the battle should have continued because that's what logic says. although in the vision Carlyle and jasper were killed but it shouldn't have been a vision....some sacrifices had to be made to put an end to the cruel and powerful volturi who ruled for a long time. the director maybe chose to end things in a peaceful to somehow comedy when Ari tells the rest of the volturi that there is no danger here after seeing he will die in the vision of Alice. I expected a better ending from the twilight saga....",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why so boooooring?,"Now having seen all the story, I believe everything died in the third movie, when the love triangle was solved. For better or worst, that was the heart of the franchise (the fantasy world building was always done poorly).
Again the writers elude the real and natural conflicts: Bella's moral dilemma of needing human blood for a while; How is Bella going to disappear from his community now that she can't appear in daylight? Those things are resolved in two short scenes. Basically, ""it doesn't matter"".Ok, then more time for the final conflict between the Cullen and the ""orthodox vampire clan"", with two different views of what to do to preserve the entire race survival.But the road to the resolution of that conflict was filled of incredibly boring scenes, with characters without any weight, personality or motivation to participate (even the movie makes fun of how easily they are convinced to do so). About that ending, I can understand some may like it. I just didn't.To end this. It's embarrasing how bad the CGI is (except when the wolfs do not interact with anything), considering how much money these mfs made. The score is also non-existant or lame. The acting, is hard to know with this script, but still: I think Pattinson was at his worst; Stewart confirmed simply lack of talent (at that point, at least); and Taylor Latuner was giving an inexplicable character, and he didn't do anything to make it better. Proper ending for a bad franchise with exactly one decent movie of five.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wrong director.,"There is no doubt in my mind that the person who directed New Moon should have been the one to direct this and the rest of the films. Chris Weitz I believe his name was, and he managed very well to capture a wonderful look to the world of Twlight. He also stayed true to the books, and whenever there was emotional moments in the movie, they were never awkward or cheesy like they were in BD Part 1 & 2. Not too mention the end battle scene looked atrocious. It was a terrifc idea to Showcase what Alice had seen in her vision, and I know I wasn't their fault. But because they were forced to shoot the scene inside and use special effects to add into background just gave the whole thing a fake and horrible look. I believe all would have been a lot better if they had of kept Weitz on to direct all the films. He was the only who captured the core fundamentals of the franchise. It's a love story, and it should be that above all. If you want an action then go see one. Weitz managed to seamlessly blend action into a love story. He also should have directed the first film, as I think every single person can agree fan or not, was utter rubbish. It was made terribly.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Relatively tolerable as compared to all previous installments.,"Well, I have just finished watching the entire saga in a row, and I come to a conclusion that, first and last installments are comparatively tolerable among all. Though this series had a good box office collection throughout (much owe to the Twihards, hype, on/off-screen chemistry of Kstew N Pattison, and publicity), it wasn't critically acclaimed and overall it wasn't a good experience watching it.This series could have been a lot better and romantic than how it is presented. The acting had been awful by entire cast, especially Kstew and Robert Pattison...you suck a big time. I have not gone through the novels, but by this time I will not dare it. There are numerous outstanding romance-genre films in Hollywood, from which the saga-director could have learned something, but they didn't. Overall this particular saga series is totally disappointing. I will give 4/10 to entire saga.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

More Vamps & Wolves..,"The final Twilight film. With Bella now being a vampire and a child in the picture, what else could happen. This film is packed with action and if you have read the film their certainly is a twist at the end. From the first film, you have the actors still working their stuff. You find there is happy ending for every person in the story. More and more vampires and wolves come together to protect the Cullen Clan. You might new and exciting actors. As the last film of the sequel I wasn't all impressed and I think they could of done something better to improve it. The twist is amazing but before then it just drags. The music shall I say carries on a lot. Most of the time the music isn't necessary and you wish it was over. Overall, I vote the film 7 out of 10. It would of been a 6 if there wasn't a twist. But there is. It is a must see if you have seen the before films as it is brilliant.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not bad - just a little bit more and it could have been epic!,"I think the trailer of the movie pretty much clarified to everyone that BD II would be on the same lines as eclipse (my favourite in the series). Relaxed at the start, then some bad news and then the build up to the main fight scene. I personally always admire all fight scenes in daylight.One more thing that went in favour of the movie, was the fact that Breaking Dawn was all out crap and it sort of kept expectations on the lower side for part II.Without revealing too much, I must say that the buildup to the main fight and the fight itself was pretty good. A little longer fight scene and more of one-on-one action, would have made this my favourite ever vampires' fight scene. In the end, i think the story writer had two options on how to end the story (reminds me of Harry Potter when its final novel was being written and an ending was being decided) - the option used is the one that probably kept everyone happy in the end.To wrap it up, there were some funny moments, some grim moments, good tension and suspense...with a U-turn ending....",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A whiny teenage soap opera at best!,"Epic? Really? The only thing that's epic would have to be the hype surrounding this concluding installment.BREAKING DAWN, PART 2 seems to have that lackluster quality about it. The first part of last year's BREAKING DAWN had me growing with intense anticipation of how the entire Twilight saga was going to end. So much so that I loved the second time I went to see it.PART 2 seems to be lacking in so many areas that it almost looked like a whiny teenage soap opera. And I'm not kidding about it. Like those cheesy television dramas I was practically distracted by the good-looking model-like vampires that the movie felt like it's a montage of moving advertisements from Zara or Bershka or Mango. Even the Amazonian vampires looked more like models for Benetton or something.As I saw the trailer I was intrigued by how the author Stephanie Meyer might include exotic vampires and from all walks of life at that. From Irish to even Japanese vampire? Come on! But in the end, the funny thing was that after all those search for vampires all over the world, only few appeared to face up to the army of Volturi's almost 10 times their number. It seems like Meyer might have dreamed this last book of hers right after watching (or reading) Anne Rice's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE. And even the ""rock-star"" vampire, Garrett, appeared to be like Anne Rice's Lestat. But at least, he had more charms than those Pattinson-Lautner combo put together.As for Mackenzie Foy's Renesmee, she looked more like some CGI-kid developed out of Lucas Studios or something. Even in her infant stage, the baby looked pretty odd. I know this is a make-believe movie but seriously, it's pretty ridiculous.However, I'm particularly drawn to how hot one of the cast was. And it was not the overrated hunky Taylor Lautner. Believe me. With how superficial Hollywood made their actors to be, Lautner's time is so over already. But I'm actually referring Rami Malek who played the Egyptian vampire whose name, ""Benjamin"", was peculiarly English instead of a Middle-eastern one. I remembered seeing him once as an Egyptian mummy in Ben Stiller's NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM where he played ""Ahkmenrah"". And he's simply cute.Nevertheless, what it lacked in the epic quality of it PART 2 compensated with the battle scenes between the Volturi's and the rest of vampire and werewolves clans. But even that was just some psychic vision of Alice. The audience were made to believe that it really did happened but only to find out that that was what going to happen should the Volturi's decided on waging the war against the rest of the vampires. Bummer!I'd say that the redeeming part throughout the entire film there were but only two scenes that I found to be rather interestingly engaging.One was when Jacob literally stripped down in front of Bella's father right down to his undies and yikes! HOTNESS! From the moment Lautner flashed out his six-packs from under his shirt I was gawking like a silly schoolgirl and wishing for the two men, Jacob and Bella's father, to get it going on. Yeah, I know I said Taylor Lautner is overrated earlier but, really. Who could resists man's flesh! Even though he's a decade younger than me. YUMMY!!!And yeah, I know. I'm a perv with ""pedophiliac cougar"" written all over me. But hey, anyone who sees that scene would be affected one way or anotherunless you're some celibate Benedictine monks; of whom I greatly believe that even they commit sins behind closed doors.Nonetheless, that scene keeps on playing in my mind like I'm wishing to have some alternative cross-generational ""thing"" to happen.The second was not even a scene, per se. It's the closing credit that featured the cast from this film and all other earlier Twilight films like Anna Kendrick and the two girls who played Victoria in the earlier films. I must say that I was glad for Kendrick for not being in this one. Perhaps, she realized that she had outgrown this teenage flick as she went to more serious stuff and garnered herself an Oscar nomination for her work in George Clooney's UP IN THE AIR. Even Rachelle Lefevre who played the first Victoria was wise enough to pass on to Bryce Dallas Howard. Perhaps, she might think that these Twilight movies might be some sort of career jinx for her. I mean look at the typecasts given to the trio of Rob Pattinson, Kristen Steward and Taylor Lautner.Anyway, juxtaposed with a sombre tune the closing credits felt as if the filmmakers were compelled to make the audience leaving the theater to have that ""separation anxiety"" as if we've grown together with the Twilight saga altogether. Yeah, right!The thing is if it only not for hype and publicity around BREAKING DAWN, PART 2, I would rather spend my money on either PITCH PERFECT or ARGO.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
There are two types of reviews for this movie. I'll try to be the third one.,"OK. I know this movie came out years ago and people still love it, or hate it. The reason why i post this review anyways is because it was on TV and i thought: ""What the hell, why not. Lets check"". I am not a Twilight fan, or a mindless hater, so i'll try to be as neutral as possible.Lets start with the good sides, because i'll be lying if i said that the movie doesn't have those. The story on it self (this includes part 1) is good to follow, even if you didn't see the previous movies. I could understand everything without issues, and i'll confess; The story was not as horrific as people made me believe.There are also a few actors in the movie that seem to know what they are doing. Not all of them but there are a few that are not bad.That is all i could think of when it comes to the good side of the movie. Now lets go for the bad part, so please ladies and gentlemen. 'Fasten your seat-belts.'The general acting is nothing near immersive. With the main characters like Bella (Kristen Stewart), Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) i got used to their way of acting. It is not very exiting to see them act, because they have a very passive way of acting. They don't shine on screen, and if they show major emotions, it is only for a few seconds. As for the other characters? Every time they introduced a new character, they seemed weird and a bit... 'over the top'? No... out of place? Yea. something like that.Lets also dive into the lore of Vampires and Werewolves. I HATE THE VAMPIRES AND WEREWOLVES IN THIS SAGA!!!!!! So, now that i released that, lets explain. The vampires in (almost) every other story have the 3 basics: Sucking Blood (or else they die), Deathly vulnerable to sunlight, and have enhanced abilities like speed and strength. The vampires here only have the enhanced abilities, but they kind of need blood, but animal blood will do just fine. So why are they a threat to humans if they can feed on your cat just fine????? Also they are not weak to sunlight, but sparkle in them. THEY!!! FREAKING!!!! SPARKLEEEEE!!!!. I am sure that Bram Stoker is spinning in his grave and Dracula just committed suicide. The vampires also seem to have a random grab-bag of powers that make no sense in any way, and are not related to Vampires at all. This dude can control the four elements? What is this? Avatar? Someone else can generate lightning in her fingers? ehhh... right? Needless to say, these guys suck. And with that i mean ass, and not blood.The Werewolves are also dumb and can transform into... a normal wolf form. Just a bit bigger. Whenever and wherever they like! This is not a Werewolf, but an Animagus from Harry Potter. Also they are in full control, do not go into a feral rage and do not need the full moon, or the moon for that matter.The CGI in the movie looks weird and amateurish. Especially the running of the vampires. They just look like they are played in fast- fore-ward.They story also has incredible weird and even disturbing moments. Given the fact that a Vampire (whose body is actually dead) has sex with a human. Therefore: Necrophilia. Also a Werewolf guy gets over his childhood crush by instead falling in love... with her creepy, CGI baby, while excusing it as 'Imprinting and he cannot control that'. Ugghh, this takes underage romances to a whole new low.With all of that i think it is safe for me to say that i will never watch this movie again. It was not as horrific as i feared, i did not have to puke every time during the commercial-brake, and i did not throw it out. But the movie stays incredibly bad, with terrible lore, acting, CGI, romances and basically everything that makes a movie bad. Now please excuse me, while i play Castlevania. I really need to see a real Vampire.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Embarrassing,"Four books and five films later, the Twilight Saga has now ended hopefully. The last of Stephanie Meyer's books was split in two for Hollywood's latest money-grabbing scheme.Part 2 is where all the drama is supposed to really kick off but after the deflating experience of part 1 it's difficult to get in the Twilight spirit. Having read the book I know how much of a dud the ending is and clearly the writers have too – I won't disclose what they do to try and solve this problem but it doesn't work and goes against nearly every rule of story-telling. Otherwise, the script is as basic as ever; the quality of these films has decreased with every sequel despite a promising beginning. The dialogue is embarrassingly simple, with laughable conversations with predictable outcomes. Not all of this is down to the script-writers however; Meyer must take some of the blame too. Sometimes you can visibly see the actors – particularly Robert Pattinson – cringing at the dialogue. The make-up always seems to get worse as these films continue - this last film saw the worst from the make-up department with the vampires clearly sticking out like sore thumbs caked in white make-up with odd contact lenses...aren't they supposed to look spectacularly hot?A lot of the actors have out-done themselves in terrible acting here. Kristen Stewart was hilarious and embarrassing. In particular, scenes where she is 'angry' she looks like she's having a bowel movement and scenes where she is supposed to be motherly and instead looks to be made of stone – I will note that the creepy CGI baby would have been difficult to work with. The CGI child was a bizarre choice and looked awful. Robert Pattinson did his best but still fell flat here; his future career looks promising though. Taylor Lautner does not have a major role here but is terrible all the same. Some of the new characters such as Lee Pace's Garrett were good additions to the cast and Michael Sheen was also great except from an odd scene where he laughs in such a bizarre way – if you've seen the film you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.Overall, this is a disappointing end to a disappointing franchise – there are some sparks of talent here but it is mostly the same old dull dialogue and acting.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not the best, but definitely not the worst.","This twilight installment is at times entertaining, and at other times somewhat boring and you just wish it would move along a little faster. All the characters are just the same as they have always been throughout the entire franchise, no surprise there. Some of the scenes were rather cheesy as far the dialogue, but that was sort of expected. I didn't really like how Renesme looked strangely animated, it wasn't natural looking at all, so that was weird looking. The action scenes were well done, and exciting to watch, that's the main thing the film had going for it. Overall, I can only give this movie a 6/10, not horrible, not great. Eclipse was much better (my personal favorite).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Poor script and Awful Acting,"At first, I've told myself that since this will be the final Twilight movie, it would be the best of the series. Unfortunately, it's the same with its predecessors, which is terrible.I'm trying to understand what genre this movie should be considered whether it is a comedy, a drama or a teenage flick. They should've studied the film context and delivered their intended theme/genre for this film.In the Philippines, a CBCP supported group is insisting that Twilight Film has connection with supports on ""Anti-RH bill"" movements. This is ""ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS AND COMPLETELY HILARIOUS"", nobody in his sane mind would ever associate Twilight to the Philippines' worsening condition and ""Anti-RH"" bill movement. These are blood sucking vampires you idiots. They've even place ""SUPPORT THE FAMILIES"" in every Twilight poster here in the Philippines.I would've given this film a ""5 out of 10"" but thanks to a CBCP supported group propaganda, I'll give this film a ""2 out of 10"".",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Movie is OK with haunting soundtrack and Ultimate climax!!!,"finally its time for Stephenie Meyer's romantic fantasy TWILIGHT to come to an end.Though the expectations are high for the breaking dawn part 2 as part 1 couldn't make much noise disappointing some die hard fans like me,first 30 minutes neither have gripping moments nor had some emotional sequences.Movie starts by showcasing locations of forks during which the flora and fauna freezes resembling the Bella's blood being frozen during her transformation. Bella now a new born vampire is stronger than Edward Emmett and other Cullen's and possess a power to shield(similar to that of fantastic 4 and x-men stuff) she manages to hide the truth about vampires and her transformation in to them with Charlie with the help of Jacob but her daughter Renesmee(who is half vampire half human and possess with power to show memories) Renesmee is seen by Irina from the Denali coven. Irina, believing that Renesmee is an immortal child, reports The Cullens to The Volturi. Alice Cullen has a vision of The Volturi making their way to Forks in order to confront The Cullens over the allegations.The rest is how cullens gather the witnesses all over the world and protects the child from the volturi.The climax battle was amazing along with the the twist which brought great response and cheers in theater.The last scene where Bella makes Edward to feel their love journey brings nostalgia not only for them but also for all twilight series fans.The sound track haunts you even after the movie and the end credits were amazing showing all the characters involved in the twilight saga.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The same plot as last time but Jacob has a shirt on more often.,"You would think over the past couple of years of being spotlight actors, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson would have picked up a few acting techniques. After viewing the recent Twilight film I found this not to be the case. The fact that Stephenie Meyer would even allow this to be shown in theaters tells you all you need to know about the Twilight Saga. It was not the product of a creative mind. It was an elaborate get rich quick scheme based on what could have been a good story. I would have left 20 minutes into this movie if it was not for my girlfriend sitting next to me entranced in this joke of the film. I would save your money and YouTube the Final scene which was the only scene worth watching.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Some Really Funny Scenes!,"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 is the fifth and last installment in the Twilight franchise. Bella's become a vampire, she has a daughter that for some reason everyone thinks is immortal without getting proof, so Bella, Edward, Jacob and the entire vampire family gather all their relatives for a big, epic ... formal confrontation...? Yeah, I'm serious! Sure, without spoiling anything, the trailer shows that it ends up as a final battle, but they originally intend it to be a formal confrontation... Ummm... I digress.This movie was good. And I'm not saying it's more intelligent than any of the previous movies. This is a dumb movie, and it's one of the dumbest in the series. But that's part of what makes it so entertaining at times.Whether intentional or unintentional, I enjoyed the humor in the movie. I laughed so many times at the terrible lines that were so easy to put in a sexual context, and there is even a small sub-plot about Jacob being ... IN LOVE WITH BELLA'S DAUGHTER!The action scene at the end was actually really cool, but the weird thing was that every characters that died were killed by having their head ripped off.The biggest annoyance with this movie are the special effects. They're terrible for a big budget movie. And the worst part is that Bella's daughter is CGI even a while AFTER growing up from being a baby! That's just disturbing! She just looks so artificial, and there's NO true character development on her!Overall, you'll probably love this movie if you're a serious fan. But if you're a fan of the movies because they're so stupid, you'll like this too. This is the dumbest and funniest movie in the franchise. And I thought Snow White & the Huntsman was hilarious.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really? A CGI baby? Creepy.,"OK the creepy, obviously fake CGI baby really freaked me out. What on earth was that about? What in the world did I just witness? The acting, or lack there of, all the wooden characters......Stewart and her one expression face. Oh gosh where do I begin? The movie was boring and made no sense. The plot was comical and the scenes had absolutely no connection.I wanted to turn this off after the first 15 minutes for the simple fact that it was so boring and the acting was non existent. Oh yeah and what was the explanation for wolf boy hanging around the vampires home 24/7? Terrible movie to an over priced and over grossing series.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Wonderful Film adaptation Ending To One Of The Best Book Series Of All Time,"The Twilight Saga: It is known by many,yet hated by so many.The Twilight Series is one of the best book series ever written,and I love the books with all my heart,Stephenie Meyer wrote books where Humans,werewolves,and vampires all come together,and where there was true magic,suspense,drama,love,and much more.Now I've read a lot of reviews where people have ONLY saw the movies and have NOT read the books,and then assume that books are just as bad as the movies,but there not the books are truly amazing,and just by watching a movie based off of a novel doesn't mean the story is any weak than the films they made out of them.Another thing I hear people say is ""I wanna kill whoever came up with these"" Oh please give me a freaking break,just because you haven't read the books,and it seems some people don't even know that the movies are based off of award winning novels.Yes the movies aren't as good as the books but that's to expected I mean really do you honestly think that any movie based off of a book will be the same?No it won't I mean let's think for a second here,the Hunger Games,a wonderful book series that I also love,but the movie wasn't as good at all but I still really enjoyed it.The thing is when a movie is being made off of a book things will be cut out,because they can't fit everything in when it's a film adaptation.I think that that the twilight movies were made perfectly and are no better than the Harry Potter movies,or the The Hunger Games.So if you haven't read the books (Which a lot of people seem to have not)Then you're missing out on something amazing,because the books are wonderful,so if you hate the movies at least give the novels a chance,you will be surprised on how much good stuff you've been missing out on.So yes I think the movies were perfectly done and the ending I think was the best of all!So if you haven't read the books,go get them,open them up,and have yourself an awesome time getting lost in a world with pure magic,love,suspense,drama around every corner.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

pretty good,"Firstly I would say don't listen to the bias haters who have cast there votes giving this a low score without even watching it.........The film was superbly shot. There were some very nice scenes and the transition / editing between scenes was very fluid. The action scenes were much better than all the other twilight films with heads being ripped off and a couple of half decent scraps.Whilst the dialogue was a bit lacking in this film they made up by presenting a whole host of different characters, there was always something on screen to keep us interested. The character development was also a bit lacking. I would say this film was entertaining but no more. I gave it a 10 to make up for all the haters casting silly votes like 1! There's no need for me to describe the film IMDb does that on the title page. I'm just going to say you will like watching it but don't expect to be intellectually challenged!!

The theater was packed with a generation of their own. I sit through the whole movie holding the hand of my loved one, trying to find if there is a single scene in the movie that I would have liked. Unfortunately there was none.There was one scene in the movie, the whole crowd started cheering and at that point I realized what is wrong with the world today.

"Finally, We've Reached the End","The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 (2012)** (out of 4)The fifth and final film in the series has Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her husband Edward (Robert Pattinson) bringing a daughter into this world but soon this birth gets the attention of the Volturi and a war is about to break out.BREAKING DOWN PART 2 will undoubtedly be loved by the majority of the teenage girls who watch it but everyone else is probably going to be bored out of their minds. Having gone through the entire series now, this one here would probably rank as the third in the series after parts one and four but thankfully this isn't nearly as bad as the second and third entries. There's quite a few problems with this film from some bad performances to the awful CGI and the drawn out story but, again, I doubt fans of the series are going to mind this stuff too much.The biggest problem I had with the film is that it's simply way too boring for its own good. I guess breaking it into two parts was mainly done to get more money out of people's pockets but there really isn't any reason as to why this entire film couldn't have been played at the end of the previous one. I say that because everything here is just building up to the final fifteen-minutes so everything earlier than that is just drawn out dialogue. There are countless scenes where people discuss things and it's the same stuff over and over to the point where you're wishing everyone would just drop dead. The dialogue isn't the greatest anyways so having to listen to it wasn't all that fun.I will say that both Stewart and Pattinson are good in their roles as they should have been by this point. The supporting cast has many questionable performances but I'm sure most were hired because of looks and not talent. The CGI is as horrid as the previous four films and I must admit that it's downright hilarious how the wolves are constantly changing sizes and sometimes within one scene. The CGI fires are just as laughable as are the bloodless decapitations. THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN PART 2 is a pretty bad movie that thankfully put an end to the series.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
I watched it for about 20 minutes in the middle,"The bits I saw meant a lot or nothing to me.

One of them answered ""Because she is half immortal."" I kept it to myself that by as many definitions of all of those words that I can come up with, ""half immortal"" is impossible.At some point, I was bored and wanted to leave so I jumped up and said ""And that's why you keep the f-ing band in the orchestra pit!""

A not so exciting book becomes a heart stopping movie,"My vote of 10 is not me saying this is the best movie and storyline ever told and it couldn't get any better. It's me saying as a book fan that this film does not disappoint and does all that it can and more with the time and story it has to work with.After many years of waiting Bella Swan the human has become Bella Cullen the vampire and it just comes so naturally to her and I must praise Kristen here as all throughout the film I noticed how different she was with her movement, speech, everything. The girl has nailed it and I respect her so much for the dedication she has put into these films for the fans. I'm not going to get into the storyline as most people have an idea of the plot by now. What I want to say is that for the people who love these characters this film brings with it the twilight humour we love, touching family affection, some interesting and likable new characters and if you can manage to avoid spoilers of the big twist this film will get your heart racing.If you hate Twilight and everything about it then don't go see it...but also don't go on message boards complaining about it either. These movies weren't made for you so just go live your life and forget about them. For the millions of people out there who love these characters go see the movie and give the characters an emotional last goodbye.Thank you Twilight cast for being such a big part of my life for the last 5 years.

Much better than the other 4,"I have just returned from watching this film and i have to say it exceeded my expectations. The previous films have been a master class in how not to act but this film works. I cant believe im gonna say this but Kristen Stewart wasn't totally awful! The film trots along at a good pace and has a fantastic ending which you just don't see coming. The new vamps we meet are great and Michael Sheen, well, shines as Aro. I honestly thought my sister and I would have a good laugh poking fun at this film as we have the previous ones but i found it gripping. Bella is sooo much more likable as a vamp and Edward seems to have shifted that constipation that seemed to be bothering him in the other 4 films and is much more relaxed and normal. Billy Burke as usual puts in a great performance as Charlie and Taylor Lautner comes into his own as Jacob. The only eye roll moment for me was the obvious and very badly animated CGI baby, although luckily we don't see much of it. This film had me both chuckling and gasping in shock at all the right places. Im so glad they got the last film nailed as it goes some way to redeeming the others before it. Pleasantly surprised.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as good a love story as the 4th one.,"I wonder if I am the only person that find this franchise just sort of OK because it seems that everyone else is either one extreme or the other.I find it bemusing that this is supposed to be the second half of the final book. It feels like a solid piece by itself as much as the third book was to the second.A Twilight movie is always stylish, technically professional and visually a treat for lovers of a semi-urban gothic aesthetic.After a somewhat anti-climactic first act things feel al little soap-opera-y. I guess we're not getting the magic of the fourth movie...Seriously, I fits and starts I can really feel what Twilight is for other people. This lyrical and heart stopping tale of devotion and love that transcends the bounds of mortality and death (with strong mormon overtones). I enjoyed the Christmas commercial-cute fun with little Renesmee (I know there should be an accent aigue in there somewhere...) and Mackenzie Foy is as adorable as a bunny in a Santa hat but I feel a little disappointed how little personality she has. I guess it's not really about her; she's just a sentient Macguffin.It annoyed me how the central premise of this chapter is based on a severe lack of communication; I find it hard to believe people who have been around for as long as the Volturi or whatever they're called wouldn't be thorough enough to run some fact checks.I know it's supposed to be a paranormal romance first and fantasy adventure second but sometimes I wonder if this series should just pick a lane as we watch our heroes gradually recruit an army. It feels a bit half hearted to be honest.I don't to give anything away but the biggest slap in the face was when they really went there in the third act but kind of invalidate a lot of things. It felt a bit like artistic cowardice (the only bad kind of cowardice asides moral and intellectual). You'll know it when you see it.I don't know what I was expecting. It concludes the saga I guess.The main vampire villain guy: HE is the real star of the show.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The end of a movie saga I wish to forget.,"I loved the Twilight books, and as I watched the credits roll in this film, it upset me because when they created these films, they got it all so wrong. They had the potential to do so much with the books, but with mediocre actors, average directors and bad visual effects, the films lost the spark that the novels had, and gained a following of young girls, obsessing over the choice between Vampire and Werewolf. As for this last installment, I do think it was slightly better than it's predecessors, and much better than Breaking Dawn part one. Many parts of the film did make me cringe, especially the bad acting and the laughable special effects.

Amazing in every way!,"Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 2 is fantastic! From beginning to end it is nearly a masterpiece. The acting is spectacular this time around and the directing is gorgeous. Every scene is exciting and thrilling, constantly leaving you on the edge of your seat. There were funny scenes, romantic scenes, and great action scenes. That whole scene towards the end with the action is possibly the best action sequence I've ever seen! It leaves you shocked. Bella becoming a vampire is honestly a terrific character development. The strength Bella has is crazy. And the credits are one of the best end credits to a movie ever. They are unique and relate to the books with a beautiful song.

Thrilling,"I have been a long time fan and defender of The Twilight franchise both the books and movies. I've fought a lot of battles of people unnecessarily attacking the material just because they didn't get it, or wasn't their thing. In all my 33 years I've never encountered the sheer hatred for any movie/book series that Twilight has managed to garner. But on the flip side I've never seen people as passionate or energetic about any property either. Anyone whose been to a midnight show knows just what I'm talking about. there is a fluid respectable energy and although about 80% female there are people of all ages regardless of what people may think. So finally after all this time I can tell everyone who hates the Saga to suck it because this movie kicks major ass. And not just in the way I and you have come to expect from the other films but it actually graduates the material to an intense level I've never experienced in any film before. I was literally on the edge of my seat having heart palpitations during the stunning, uber violent finale. It's not just what you've always wanted from these films it's the culmination you've always wanted from most films. The only comparable material I can think is how the Avengers played out. It's not just the ballsy clever maneuver to twist the material a bit but the execution overall. Everything ends on a high note. From the production design to the costumes to the much improved special effects, the now explosive special effects, the toned down/up screenplay and the performances. people who have complained about the acting in the other films will see what I mean. As these characters have grown so have the actors. Robert Pattinson is mesmerizing as always but Taylor Lautner finally stretches his whiny chops and explores a more adult, caring side to his character while Stewart steals the show gone is the clumsy, awkward, slightly annoying girl from the other films and replaced with a seductive, bad ass woman with a fierce mean streak. As a fan it's sad to see it all end but I've never felt so satisfied leaving something like this behind. All the questions are answered and the franchise goes out on a super high note. It's truly the most thrilling cinematic experience I've had in a decade. It's funny, romantic, edge of your seat, intense, clever and unique. And Kudos to Condon for t=giving the fans some love with that montage at the films end and the addition of the visualized pages from the book.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

don't like the final twist,Bella (Kristen Stewart) is now a vampire. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) has been imprinted on baby Renesmee. Jacob reveals part of the secret world to Bella's father Charlie.

The family recruits supporters or witnesses to plead their case to the Volturi.It's an improvement over Part 1. The last installment is a long exposition of everybody's powers leading to one big final battle. The movie becomes X-Men with a vast cast of new characters with new powers. I really like the final battle where so many of the characters bite it. Then there's a twist and it turns a pretty good movie into a somewhat disappointing one.,5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Don't get excited-- this movie is not that much better,"About myself: I am a teenager. I enjoyed the twilight books, the movies--not so much. I went in expecting more. People kept telling me, ""oh this movie is so much better than the others."" I went in with my friends, excited and expecting a lot. I soon realized that it was not any different. Bella was still awkward and annoying, with her stutter and super loud breathing. Edward was still impeccably stoic and awkward. And Jacob still had an awkward high voice and broody looks. As you can see, this movie is in a word-- awkward. Well moviegoers, prepare yourself for awkward make out sessions, confusing plot (for anyone who hasn't read the book in a while), and too many vampires to keep track of. Call me cynical. Call me no fun. But I am just not a fan of characters I can't relate to. I had no time to attach to any of the characters. Half of them, I could not even keep track of names. Overall, the movie is scattered, poorly acted, confusing, and gave into a lot of gimmicks. There is one particular twist that was a bit much. As you can see, I gave the film four stars. I admit, I was generous. But the film's redeeming factor was the nostalgia. It is the end of a teen era. I read the books as a middle schooler. The end credits actually made me a little misty-eyed. That particular segment was particularly well-done. There were moments that made me laugh; others were suspenseful. The battle scene was particularly well done. I almost enjoyed the film. Almost. The actors and the rushed plot did nothing for me. Overall, don't listen to the hype. It is really not all that different from the others.

Too much time filling stuff (ok, in I it was terrible in II it was occasional). Some shots were badly done (e.g. entering the cottage) or missing the point completely (e.g. wide shot of the battlefield).

A Truly Painful Viewing Experience.,"I've always hated the ""Twilight"" movies, but ""Breaking Dawn, Part 2"" is an atrocious film. Director Bill Condon has disappointed me greatly by making a movie that is cheesy and joyless. Until I saw this movie, I did not realize how awful Kristen Stewart really is. Stewart is a terrible choice for the role of Bella and she nearly ruined ""Snow White And The Huntsman"". Taylor Lautner's performance is unintentionally funny, but not exactly painful to watch. However, Robert Pattinson Is A Wonderful Actor. It is unfortunate that he is totally wasted in the role of sparkling vampire Edward Cullen. Pattinson was very good in both ""Water For Elephants"" and David Cronenberg's ""Cosmopolis"" earlier this year.Lee Pace, who was absolutely brilliant in ""Pushing Daisies, turns in a terrible performance as one of the vampires. Yes, the performances are really, really bad, but the movie has virtually nothing positive. When I say ""virtually"", I mean that the score is pretty good. The film's story is vapid and preposterous. When the film finally ends, you will breath a sigh of relief.I would rather be locked in a supply closet for two hours than sit through this horrible movie once more.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's really sad that the series was ever so popular!,"'THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 2': One and a Half Stars (Out of Five)I've never been a fan of the 'TWILIGHT' series; I've seen every chapter, but only so I could review them (because of their immense popularity). I've always thought the series was really poorly made, but I can handle bad movies, the thing I really despised about each film is how tasteless and morally depraved they all are. They send horrible messages to their target audience, young girls, and are extremely sexist to both women and men. The heroine, Bella (played by Kristen Stewart throughout the series), is a terrible role model for young women; she's weak, obsessive and totally dependent on men (to the point where she's suicidal if one breaks up with her). The films also kind of sends the message that every girl wants two cute guys to fight over her and all women look for in a romantic love interest is a guy that looks good (and that no other redeemable qualities are necessary). While Bella at least has some character and admirable skills the leading men in the series are both emotionless, wooden and completely lacking of any wit or charm. With that said this film does finally give viewers a heroine worth rooting for; Bella in this film is finally strong and self dependent. It does kind of send the message that a woman has to become a vampire in order to become those things though. The film is a little more entertaining than the rest but it's so full of flaws (once again) and just extreme trash filmmaking (to put it simply). It's really sad that the series was ever so popular.The film is the fifth and final installment in the franchise and is based on the second half of Stephenie Meyer's fourth book. It was directed by Bill Condon (who also directed the last film in the series) and written by Melissa Rosenberg once again (she wrote all five films and appears to be just as bad a writer as Meyers (having improved nothing on the awful books). It once again stars Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner as the three leads and has most of the key supporting players returning from the other films as well. In this film Bella (Stewart) has just awoken to discover her new powers as a vampire and meets her newborn daughter Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy), who is a gifted half vampire / half human creature (who ages extremely fast). She also learns that her werewolf buddy Jacob (Lautner), who used to be obsessed with her, has now dedicated his love to her baby (in order to save her from being killed by other werewolves). Bella, understandably, does not take kindly to the idea of her ex-stalker now agreeing to spend the rest of his life with her newborn baby. More problems arise when the kid is mistaken for an immortal child and the Volturi (the vampire ruling class) decides to execute her. Edward (Pattinson) and his family of vampires then raise an army of their own (from old vampire friends) to combat the Volturi.The film is more of the same cheesy dialogue, acting and atrocious romance but it does have more action than the other films. This one has a gruesome climactic battle scene that proves the motion picture rating system is a joke. If a film with as many beheadings, body burnings and other violent mutilations as this can get away with a PG-13 rating obviously any studio (with enough money) can buy the rating they want for any film. While the movie does have a somewhat cool final fight scene and a newly improved kick ass heroine it still reeks of horrible flaws. One I especially didn't like is a major plot twist at the end that feels extremely overdone, cheep and a total rip-off (but that's to be expected from a series like this). Fans of the franchise will once again eat it up and anyone else (who has to see it) will be extremely sickened.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olADa6vEcMk",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie is indeed equally exciting and has surprising but reassuring ending. A must see movie for  young and old.,"The movie was good and with happy ending. Unlike other Vampire movies where there is gruesome deaths and evil, here, the movie predicts evil and understands there is discrimination and hatred but prevents it from happening.The value of foreseeing death and destruction and the ability to prevent such destruction has been portrayed very well. In our real life we are unable to do so. We wage wars in spite of knowing it cause severe damage and destruction and loss of economical strength.For a nation like ours this is a true moralistic movie as well. Also it teaches how to be flexible and be able to tolerate and get along with one another.I felt that vibrations and the unity among the audience that day while the movie was ending. The main theme is cohabitation of mixed race and in this case cohabitation of the dead and alive. This is a remarkable piece of peace in this society of anything less than peace these days. Why should the movie replicate the actual book? The book should only be used as a guide line. The movie is meant to be creative and that takes talent. Otherwise every book writer would end producing a movie of their books but fortunately they are not movie directors. This movie has quite a dramatic theme and indeed different, so the colors and the make up and all should match the imaginary colors and make up of Vampires, since all of it is nothing but make believe (just like Harry Potter). I give this movie a score of 9. Won't you do the same after reading my piece?",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good ending to a disappointing series of films.,"This is one book to movie adaptation (Although a cash grab as this story could've been easily told within one movie) that i would love to say what i usually say and that is the book was better but you know what? I can't as the ending gives you more or less the Meyer version that is the book and you get director Bill Condon's version as well that entwine quite well actually. So a two for one type ending is not a bad thing in a movie world that provides so little these days. The film starts pretty much where 'Breaking Dawn Prt 1' left off.. Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is dealing with two major life changing things in her life..1..Becoming a newborn vampire and two...becoming a mommy to a baby girl named Renesme (The worst storybook name i have ever seen) who seems to, due to the fact that she is half vampire/half human, have powers of her own such as mind reading and levitation, she also has starting ageing rapidly. So all these things considered she has to still come up with an idea on what to tell her dad Charlie (Billy Burke) who only thinks she is still ill from her and new beau Edward's (Robert Pattinson) 's honeymoon trip. Needless to say a lot has gone on in short time in her life.The Cullen family thanks to Alice (Ashley Greene) are soon to find out that one of their cousins has seen Bella walking Renesmee, and her powers as she flies up to touch a falling snowflake, the cousin informs the powerful sect The Volturi of this new edition to the Cullen family with inquisitions and questions they all come looking for the Cullens. This sets off Alice and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) to find who they believe is the only other hybrid like Renessmee to hopefully avoid war with the Volturi.A good ending to a series of films that in my mind were more off then on. Hey at least they ended it properly in my mind. Maybe Condon should've directed the lot?? Who knows?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie was a decent movie,"I have been waiting to watch Breaking Dawn Part 2, and now that I have watched it I'm surprised at somethings throughout the whole movie. This film is a drama/fantasy typed story.Bella being the main female character has to male figures after her. Jacob and Edward, as seen in the Breaking Dawn Part 1 she stay with Edward. Part one seems more realistic than this movie because of the way they use computer programs(as so portrayed) to build up characters. As we all know Bella and Edward have get married and end up having a baby, then Bella ""dies"". Throughout this whole movie, as a viewer you could tell that the baby, Renesmee is a computer fantasy per say. She does not look realist at all well at some times she will but throughout the movie she mostly looks fake. The main point of this movie is that they are trying to protect the baby from the Volturi because they have declared her as an immortal child, that has to be put to death. There were many interesting points. There were a lot of angles, camera movement, lighting,and sound that you could totally pin point. When Bella is waking up they have a close range shot, they start very zoomed in the eye and then they zoom out slowly and to show the rest of her body.They do a long shot view of when they(Bella and Edward) go chasing after her meal. In this shot they show them take a long jump/leap to get onto the other side of the hill. They used a Pan movement to introduce the scene of when they enter the woods hunting. When out running they use tracking shots, which is when the camera is moved to follow the movement of the character. This movie had natural lighting throughout the whole thing. I rated this film a 6/10 because I was very bleak toward the fact that the daughter was based on a computer program and it bothered me at full length because I couldn't really focus on certain scenes when the girl showed up because of how fake she had looked. So if you don't like seeing movies like that, that have computerized characters than i would not recommend this film. Other than that issue it is a very pleasant movie to watch because they continue the story board as expected and don't have surprises. I would recommend you to watch it and see how the story continues.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Splendid effort!!!!!!!!!,"First of all, ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" is the best twilight movie. In fact, if you consider its photography, performances, effects, action, music etc. its a hugely entertaining movie even for the ""non-twilight"" audience.Secondly, for all those romantics out there, its an awesome ending to the series.The lead pair have acted well. The supporting actors are also good. The new vampires are very interesting.I won't give out too many details. Its better that everybody watches this blockbuster in the cinema.Well worth every penny of the ticket price!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Aro is best character,"Okay, so do I think any of these films are good? Well, no. Not in the least. But do I recommend you watch them? Absolutely you should. I had a blast watching all this crap.And this one is no different. Again, there's some half-decent direction here, unlike New Moon or Eclipse, but the writing is still hilariously bad, any hint of ""romance"" between the two leads falls completely flat, the dialogue is terrible, and the performances are some of the most wooden I've ever seen.I mean...except for one stand-out. One godly performance that as far as I'm concerned, makes this entire film. And that is Michael Sheen as Aro. Good god, he is surely the only person on set who knew the kind of rubbish he was working with and he was going to have fun with it, goddamnit.But really, I've already covered all the bases for this film series, and if you found the previous ones hilarious, then you'll find this one hilarious. The only other thing to note (even if I refuse to spoil it) is that the ending of this film...I mean, I was stunned. It's maybe one step above ""and it was all a dream, the end"". I'm not joking.So you can look forward to that if you've yet to experience these disasterpieces, and if you thrive on cringe humour like I do, please do yourself a favour and experience them already.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bittersweet,"First of all, to all the reviewers who are saying you don't like any of the series or that you haven't even watched the other movies, why are you reviewing this film?? It makes no sense.I have loved all of the movies. Eclipse and Breaking Dawn part 2 being my favorites.I had high expectations for this. I wasn't disappointed. It had a lot more humor than the others and Edward and Bella seemed so much more equal. They both smile so much more in this.The child who plays Renesme is perfectly cast. She looks so much like Kristen and Rob.This movie does exactly what it should. It wraps up the end of a great series. It fills in the holes and ties up loose ends. It leaves a bittersweet feeling when leaving the theater.If you don't like Twilight movies, simply don't go watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Almost Average,"Twilight: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 follows Bella as word gets out about her new child. When the authorities begin to believe that the child is a threat, the Cullens set out to help prove otherwise and to avoid a confrontation with said authorities.Surprisingly I actually kind of liked this movie. I thought it had some really cool ideas. While they weren't always presented super well, like the twist ending, they were interesting. If the movies beforehand had been better then I might have actually liked this movie more. But alas, it wasn't meant to be.On top of that the soundtrack was actually pretty good. I was surprised to hear songs that both fit the scene they were placed in and just sounded nice anyway. If only the movie had put as much effort into the soundtrack as everything else.However, this movie still isn't very well-made. To start, the special effects still suck. It's actually really noticeable by this point. The baby was made from CGI for some stupid reason, and it looked awful. It looked like someone had taken a cutout of Mackenzie Foy's face and just glued it over another kid's face. Even when she grows up it looks fake. There's this obvious change when the CGI child was replaced by an actual child actor, and after that it was much better. It was kind of hilarious that the CGI child thing went on so long though. And the wolves, wow, those looked terrible. Maybe on their own they're okay, but when put side-by-side with actual people it was just awful.There were a lot of other parts of the movie that were just kind of really stupid. Little nitpicks here and there. Eventually they do add up and I have to stop ignoring them.A lot of new characters were introduced into this movie, and a lot of them weren't given any more screen time than their introductions. This is fine and all, but some of them were given slightly more screen time than the others, and then somehow we were expected to care about them. There's this weird romance that starts between two of these expendables, yet we only see the two character together once before they promise to be together forever. Kind of like Edward and Bella's relationship I guess. Regardless, it's a rushed relationship that we as an audience are expected to care about despite being given no reason to do so.At this point I can't even tell if the actors are bad or if I've lowered my expectations so low that at this point they seem passable. Regardless of which one it is, Kristen Stewart still isn't that great. It's easier to watch Taylor Lautner now than it is her. While her performance isn't unbearable, it's still one of the worst in the movie.Overall Twilight: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 is, while the best of the Twilight saga, still an incapably made movie. Most aspects don't exceed a level beyond average, and many fall far below it. However, there were a couple moments of blind luck when this movie dared to step, or maybe stumbled, over the average line and surprised us all, only to fall flat on it's face yet again. This movie is sort of like vanilla ice cream with bits of poop here and there. It's a bland flavor, sure, but it's still tasty. Sure there's poop every few licks, but for the most part it's just a decent ice cream cone. In the end I would only recommend this movie if you liked the previous ones or are contemplating whether or not it's worth it to finish the series. This is the shortest of the saga, and it's the best, so you might as well.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ending to a topsy turvy franchise,"Rating-5/10The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn-Part 2 is the final instalment in the five film franchise about vampires and werewolves. Now this one truly is the end of a series that isn't all that good and really not consistent either, going from average at the top to very poor at the bottom. Will this be remembered in years to come, of course, but still badly reviewed, well of course.There are way too many new characters In this and not only are certain characters not allowed to finish what they started, they also are never explored as the running time dips under 2 hours, but to be fair any longer and even more dullness would set in. The main cast seem to be getting poorer, Pattinson, Stewart and Lautner all do not improve with only Lautner managing to not be worse than before. The new cast are also not that great and with the addition of Michael Sheen well still he doesn't show up to the show.It really isn't directed all that well, it gets better toward the end of the movie but starts off horrible and really drags the lifeless plot from Breaking Dawn-Part 1 in. Now Bill Condon the director may not be all at fault here, it may just be the source material and could be the reason it feels awkward and sometimes as if there actually isn't a director involved. Overall Condon does it poorly anyway, he just couldn't change the series enough.The script is also a poor thing, but yet again it seems to improve upon the ending of the film, but still poor and really needed a lot of changes from the book, Mellissa Rosenberg does not adapt well at all. Also I will add that yet again the book may be the fault of the script completely, it feels like the words are straight from the page, and having someone else imagine the scenes just makes it awkward for all.This film had too much usage of special effects and when characters literally are just an effect, you know it is out of hand. All credit to the effects at the end as for the third time the ending saves any shatter of respect this movie can try to cling to. I think although the budget does get well used on the effects, it just feels too much and in some scenes with large landscapes or vampires using special powers, it just look ridiculous.I felt with part 2 the romance that really is one of the driving forces behind the movies has gone and very little is actually displayed that brings warmth. I think it just feels again there is that word, awkward, and it never gets to the point where people can envy Edward and Bella's relationship. On that note a lot of the warmth is missing here, the niceness of the panorama and settings are not fully explored and you also don't truly get to say bye to characters in it from film one.Overall I felt it was maybe safely below average but really not too far from going down to poor, with the ending as I have mentioned just letting it slide into 5. The movie won't convert ardent haters of Twilight and certainly won't entertain those less in tuned to it, but for the many many fans it should please and cap off a film series that although vastly flawed, can still be enjoyed.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Satisfying Finale to a Phenomenal Saga,"As the final chapter in The Twilight Saga, Breaking Dawn - Part 2 delivers a thrilling conclusion that ties up loose ends and rewards fans of the series with a spectacle of action, emotion, and romance. While the franchise may not have been everyone's cup of tea, this installment achieves a balance of fan service and narrative closure that makes it a standout in the series.The film showcases an impressive sense of growth in its characters, particularly Bella, as Kristen Stewart embraces her role as a powerful vampire mother. The dynamic between Bella, Edward (Robert Pattinson), and their daughter Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy) is heartfelt and anchors the story in a sense of familial love. Taylor Lautner continues to bring depth to Jacob, whose interactions with Renesmee spark some of the film's lighter moments.Director Bill Condon ups the ante with a visually striking final battle sequence that leaves a lasting impression. The twist during this climactic showdown is both shocking and cleverly executed, making it a memorable highlight of the film. The gorgeous cinematography, paired with Carter Burwell's evocative score, adds to the cinematic quality of this finale.That said, the film isn't without its flaws. The CGI on Renesmee feels awkward at times, and some moments feel overly melodramatic. But these issues don't overshadow the fact that Breaking Dawn - Part 2 is an enjoyable and satisfying end to an iconic saga.For fans of the series, this film delivers everything you've been waiting for, while those less familiar with Twilight may find it a decent watch for its entertainment value and emotional payoff.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pretty Good,"I'm quite surprised at the reviews. A couple weeks ago, this movie was around 8.5. Now its ranked really low. I am not a fan of the Twilight Series, but I have seen all of them. I thought quite a few of them were a waste of time to be honest. However, in this one, I thought in some ways justice was made. The bad vampires finally make a scene which they pretty much haven't even though they really should have been a bigger focus. The bad vampires get what they deserve in a metaphoric sense. Especially since many of these vampire characters really annoyed me.I am really surprised people graded it bad, and I don't understand why they rated it bad. Because it didn't represent the literature well? Seriously? I'm not defending this movie by any stretch of the word, because I think the series is joke. But the first movie was horrible! It did not give the book series justice at all. And every movie except for this one in my opinion progressively got worse. So I don't understand the logic behind the reviews at all. All the girl things that were used like the Edward and Jacob thing being lovers of the same girl (any American Girls Dream) were done with this movie a long time ago. So why critics feel like they should whine and moan about its disappearance is a mystery to me.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Twilight 5: Free At Last!,"Oh thank god, it's finally over. To be honest, I don't really remember the separation points between pt1 and pt2 all that well so if I mix stuff up, fight me because I don't really care that much. But lets see, there's the massive fight fake out, that was stupid. We've got wolf-boy ""imprinting"" on a baby, which is absolutely as creepy as it sounded. Bella, of course, maintains her role as princess of all snowflakes, gaining a super amazing vamp power, which she learns and expands on in the course of a weekend. Oh, and there's a baby that brainwashes everyone it touches into being pro-lifers* while it grows at a stupid rate.I would like to give credit though to one thing throughout this entire, nightmarish series and that credit goes to Mr. Burke, as the Swanfather. Dude is the only character in this entire series having anything close to a normal, real reaction to the absurdity going on around him. I would almost even watch a Sheriff Swan series about this guy being a cop around a bunch of supernatural crazy.Lastly, release the deleted scene where the vamps are milked for their ""venom"" cause that would be hilarious.*This review is not taking sides on the issue.

"Simple, so much potential wasted.","I dont mind this type of idea of vampires, werewolf or wolf, but the movies in general is potentially wasted on bad story line and some acting because the scripts is horrible, even the decisions that the characters make and the things they do you question, who in earth would do such a thing as if this is some sort of weird freaky fantasy that someone wants to experience and goes in to the category of ""oatmeal on the pants"" character, ....hey there is even a zombie movie that was released in between this movies that was also a some sort of love story in some way, cant remember the name but it does have a better plot and script line, not perfect but what helped that movie is that it didn't took it seriously, there were some humor in it. Also the movies needed a better director, scripts writer and book author. The cast. i would let them go for another round to remake the whole series since there were various actors that i have seen before and they do good acting and better if they have better direction, even the guy from Good Omens, he is fun to watch.The good out of this move?

A fine end to the saga.,"Okay, so aside from the bad CGI towards baby Renesmee, the ending towards is what makes your money's worth. Even friends who didn't appreciate the saga had admitted that the movie was pretty good. Romance throughout the saga proves very cheesy for some. Some might show major annoyance towards screaming girls who roar over Taylor Lautner's abs. Some might have considered the fact that this series is a ""chick"" thing, just like how Sucker Punch may be targeted more over to the guys. However, the series leaves room for the action-packed werewolves and the oddly sinister smiles and laughs provided by Michael Sheen. And if you are one of many that try to disregard's Kristen Stewart's acting as Bella Swan, I believe that she has showed major improvement in Breaking Dawn Part. 2 much more than Part. 1 - and way, way more than the previous three films. To you fans who have been loyal from the beginning and read the books, I believe you won't be disappointed. This plot twist you keep hearing about? It's well played. You will be angry, sad, relieved, and left with a bit of a bittersweet feeling. If you didn't get enough of almost everything that the other three movies failed to give you, give this one a chance. It is the best one yet by providing a solid finish and proves that the saga is more than just about a girl who fell in love with a vampire who sparkles. It is about a love that brought everything in place.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If your not a fan of the books, there is no way you will enjoy these movies.","Watched this again when I stumbled across it on my TV and couldn't turn it off. The Twilight saga is just such a guilty pleasure for me. Whatever don't judge.This last part of the ""saga"" picks up exactly where Breaking Dawn part 1 left us, with the newly turned Bella opening her red eyes after the birth of Renesmee. We then see her training her new abilities, conquering her thirst and realizing her CGI baby is growing at an alarming rate. Oh and thens there's Jacob who has ""bonded"" with the child, the whole ""imprinting issue is handled about as well and non creepily as possible with flashes of the future couple.We then see the Cullen's gathering vampire clans from around the globe in order to protect the child from a false allegation that puts her and the entire the family in front of the Volturi under a sentence of death for creating a vampire child, they must prove she was born not made.If I'm honest this last half of the Breaking Dawn book is much of an anticlimax and I'd wondered how they were going to liven things up for the movie version. All I can say there is I Loved ""the twist"" well done, very exciting, sorry about your head Carlise! much better than what Stephanie Meyer wrote.The closing credits are excellent, a real tribute to the fans showing the cast from all 5 movies along with passages from the book.

Great adaptation - Twilight fans will love it.,"If you love Twilight, you'll be chuffed with this film. The only issue with it - just to get it out of the way - is some elements of the final act. Whilst I quite like the final battle, Meyer makes it clear in the books that vampires are pretty indestructible. It takes quite a lot to kill them. Whereas in this film they're tearing each other's heads off with ease. That slightly cheapens it. But that is a minor quibble. As with all the Twilight films, if you enjoyed the books, they are a great watch.Robert Pattinson is perfect as Edward in this film. I wasn't sure about him in the earlier films but by this stage, he's got it nailed. And Kristen Stewart is just fantastic. She looks dynamite and her portrayal of Bella is perfect.And the final scene...swoon.

Well performed and written conclusion to a satisfying saga.,"There are a lot of very expressive reviews in the negative to this film, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn-Part 2, and I can only wonder if there are many of those reviewers who are either immature teenagers with a grudge against such a successful franchise or other such smug individuals who want to distinguish themselves as so called 'hip' by bashing a successful franchise. Being a college film professor over the age of 50 I have followed the Twilight franchise with a critical eye for theme, cinematography, acting, story, and various other components.I can see the allure that this franchise has for those who are seeking a cinematic escape from something other than a familiar blood and guts horror genre. I give solid acknowledgment to the performances by Kristen Stewart (Bella), Robert Pattinson (Edward), Taylor Lautner (Jacob), Michael Sheen (Aro), and the entire brilliant cast. This particular installment provided all the essentials for a well done movie experience; beautiful and engaging stars, a story line that never dragged at any instance, menacing protagonists, suspenseful plot and a surprise ending that had me shout out 'Wow' when revealed. The audience that sat with me were equally enthralled. There were cheers when moments called for it and at the end of the film almost EVERYONE in the theater applauded.My suggestion- don't let the naysayers on this board give you pause to see this film. If as a viewer you liked any part of the franchise (and so far the box office on this film has reached over $340 M)then know that this is as satisfying, if not more, than the others in the series.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Breaking Dawn 2,"Never before has a series change my mind so well. Twilight did start off as a pretty good film for me, then as time went on it became a bit numb as the female fans around the world kept going on about looks instead of the story and acting. Although this annoyed me, I decided to watch Breaking Dawn 2 with my sister who had a spare ticket, and I must say the film was a triumph. There is a lot of emotional, a lot of twist and turns and amazing scenes. The film has scenes of comedy which are very good and the actors grow and are less boring, especially Kristen Stewart who shined throughout the movie.

"Surprised me, even though I've seen all the others.","Even though I didn't enjoy the books much (although I love the actual idea and storyline), I am a huge fan of the Twilight movies; I knew this movie was going to entertain me, and it didn't disappoint. Having read the book yonks ago, I had forgotten the ending. This final movie of the saga did a great job at wrapping up the storyline. Apart from one obvious scene (you'll know it when you see it), they did a great job with all the CGI effects. As usual, the scenery was stunning, and there were some great fight scenes, laugh-out-loud humorous moments and one scene even evoked a passionate applause from a three-quarters-full theatre (middle of the morning at school time, so there weren't many students or people with jobs there). There was the predictable (and nauseating) titter from the younger ones when Jacob goes shirtless. There wasn't a great deal of romance compared to the previous movie, which was nice, but the action scenes were plentiful and wonderfully choreographed.For some reason, the Twilight movies really entertain me, even at 45! I enjoy the ethics portrayed by the Cullen family and there is a strong message in these movies for me personally that is not only charming, but so lacking in many movies today.So, excellent movie, for me, and, if you're not one of those who decided they were going to hate the movies even before they came out, you won't be wasting your money if you choose to go see it. The only bad thing about it is that this is the last in the Saga :(",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Forever,"We live in a world full of fantasy – fantasy that we can't explain sometimes. Everything has a purpose, everything has its place, everything has a forever. This is one forever that will last into the next life. It amazes me that 5 years ago in 2008 we were introduced to a whole new world that was created by a 35 year old writer who told a story of a mortal human being who was drawn into a world of vampires and were-wolves.Nobody knew that it would end up with a sad-happy ending. We were mesmerized by the way that these movies and books that have melted (literally) into our hearts. It's like we live in this world that I described a second ago full of make-believe, but for The Twilight Saga – it was so real. The Saga has been ingrained into our souls and left a chilling (so to speak) mark.As I was sitting there watching the movie, I was shocked by the way each part of it was so breathtaking. Each scene was so impactful. The books and the movies have made a mark in us that no other franchise has left in us – The Twilight Saga, will and always be a part of our lives for many years, decades and centuries to come no matter how old we are.Stephanie, thank you so much for your hard work and for sharing with us the story of our lives. To the many directors – Catherine Hardwicke, Chris Weitz, David Slade and Bill Condon – thank you for giving the vision to see Stephanie's work come alive. To Melissa Rosenberg – girl, you rock – your words are Stephanie's words, thank you for the craft that you have. To the composers – Carter Burwell, Alexandre Desplat, Howard Shore – you guys are the epitome of the Saga – thank for the music and for bringing artists like Linkin Park, Muse, Metric, Bruno Mars and Green Day on board.The last thing I do want to say before I close this great Saga Review – to the 3 people who gave us an enchanting vampire – Robert Pattinson – to the mortal who loved a vampire who he is and becoming the immortal that we loved – Kristen Stewart – and to the brown-nosed werewolf who gives his heart and soul – Taylor Lautner – you guys are what The Twilight Saga is about. So.Let's Start With Forever.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Phenomenal!!!,"Without giving anything away, this movie is the following: epic, surprising, shocking, edge-of-your-seat kind of movie, intense, suspenseful, romantic, etc.! I will definitely be going to see it again. I was full of emotions while watching it: crying happy tears, sad tears, angry, shocked, thrilled, surprised, etc. There are honestly no words to describe this movie, but if I could describe it in one word? It would be: WOW.Do not walk to your theater to see this movie; RUN!!! :)And also for the non-Twilight fans? This is SO action-packed and awesome that it may just make you a fan because it is THAT good!! :)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You will not be disappointed with this one - Awesome!,"It was better than the book and the book was great. This is rare I know, but you won't be disappointed if you liked the books. People who don't love Twilight series shouldn't be commenting. I laughed out loud I gasped in unbelief - with excitement I saw great acting - Bella especially blossomed I was surprised The flow was perfect with the book They could have expanded it in a few areas and it would have not bothered me because I'm a Twilight fanatic.This series was clean, romantic, exciting, funny, suspenseful, dramatic, sci-fi magic. A 10 all the way!! I have always loved Sci-Fi and Romance - this series gives you that and so much more.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best of the series,"Let me tell you this. This movie is ""only"" for Twilight Fans. The movie opens with Bella turning into a Vampire. The stunts she performs as a Vampire are awesome, particularly where she goes in hunt for blood. Rob and Kristen's love for each other is so natural that you will start envying them. Kristen scores well over the others. The girl who acted as Renesmee has done a good job. Though she doesn't have much dialogs, she delivers with her expression. Her eyes does most of the talking. Rob has done what is expected out of the character. Peter Facinelli is the surprise element here. He gets a meaty character and delivers it really well. The main disappointment is Taylor Lautner. There isn't much scope for him. The story travels at a steady pace and gets really fast at the end. The climax is outstanding, there is a real twist at the end that you should definitely not miss. Overall the movie is enjoyable and if you are a Twihard, watch is at least twice..",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Epic Finale,"Half the movie was credits. Half my heart is still not functioning. A short, drawn out end to the series that left the audience making inhumane guttural noises. Twilight fans will not be disappointed, but they will spend a major scene of the film and afterwards shaken like never before. The only thing I can say is that the screenwriter really will screw with you. You will enjoy this film and it will leave you oddly satisfied even though before the credits (which air beautifully twice) you yearned for more and you cursed and gasped along with the crowd. Go see it now. I still haven't recovered. Kristen Stewart's acting improved greatly. I fell for RPatts even though I despised him previously. In the end, the movie was all about Alice. Trying not to give anything way here. Just: amazing. And one major perfect screw. I am glad they broke it into two parts. The second was short and sweet and twisted and lovely. This will last forever, as in a couple of months.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Top 5 film, even for someone who doesn't love twilight","Of the first four twilight movies, I enjoyed each one but didn't fully understand what the storyline was, and so on the day that I was going to the midnight screening of breaking dawn part two, I watched all four again with my twihard girlfriend and she explained it all to me as it went along. The storyline is good, although not a considerable amount happens over the first four films .. and I can understand why .. it's all been saved til the end. Breaking Dawn Part Two is an unbelievable film; clever, full of action, emotional and all round excellent. I left the cinema at 2.20am and have never been so awake at that time in the morning, literally can't even explain how good the film is. From someone who doesn't love or fully understand the twilight saga, I would still put this film in my top 5 films ever.@matthewmolyneux",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing!!,"I think this movie was awesome, a perfect ending to The Twilight Saga. The first 3 did not excite me after reading the books Pre-movies, surprisingly the small changes in the final movie differing from the book were a good addition to the movie. A must see for sure. Just to be clear I'm not a teen Just raving on the movie, I'm in my 30's. if you have not yet seen this movie you should go ASAP, don't wait for blu-ray if was too good on the big screen. It was nice for it to be just short of 2 hours long, some have been too short, if you read the books you'll know that a lot was left out, I truly believe that cutting this movie in half was a good idea though I'm sure the rest of you are with me on how hard it was to wait a year for part two. I hope this helped and know you will enjoy the movie, even the guys in the theater were having a good time watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A perfect ending to a perfect saga!,"I don't care what anyone say, Twilight ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" is the Bomb of all Bombs. It is a blast and wonderful to watch. Bill Condon took care of business for the final twilight movie. He had a sweet and gentle, yet dramatic way of bringing the twilight saga to an end. This is definitely a MUST SEE, A LOT OF TIMES, MOVIE!!!!!I am hoping for another book by Stephenie Meyer with the regular cast and blending in the relationship of Jacob and Renesmee (much older). The reason I mention regular cast is because we had to see 2 Victoria's, but Bryce Dallas Howard's performance was par-excellence! Thank you Stephenie for the classic works, ""The Twilight Saga.""It was hard waiting a year for each movie to debut, but in the end, it was worth the wait all 4 times.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Probably the best part of the Twilight Saga Series,"I went to watch this the first day it was made available for public viewing in Thailand. I went to watch this not so much coz of being a fan but coz my wife wanted to. I expected a load of dramatic scenes talking about love and departure yada yada yada but I was extremely surprise...Not going into detail and spoiling the movie, the CGI of Bella and Edward at the beginning of the movie was amateur for me. It really put me off and I had already concluded that the movie was going to be another profit driven sequel to reap in as much money possible to end of the franchise on the silver screen. Anyway, the movie unfolded very well, with in my opinion, very creatively inclining to the sci- fi/fantasy genre. I had low hopes for the movie but it turned out to be a blast. REALLY!Though the friend I went to watch this movie with was a bit disappointed with the ending while I was totally satisfied with it and couldn't ask for a more freakishly fulfilling ending. You gotta watch it. THE END.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Twilight film I actually LIKE:),"This picks right off where Part 1 took off. Bella (Kristen Stewart) gave birth to a baby right before she was changed (into a vampire) by husband Edward (Robert Pattinson). Everything is fine but then the Volturi hear about the baby being half vampire/half human and fear that it is an abomination that must be destroyed. They travel to the USA to deal with it while the Cullens get vampires from all over on their side to help them.OK--this could have been easily done in one film. Like part 1 this film moves VERY slowly and, has subplots that lead to nowhere and has quite a few needless song montages. Also Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner give horrible performances, Michael Sheen overacts to an embarrassing degree and the dialogue is terrible and this doesn't make a lot of sense. Still I liked it a LOT! The cinematography is beautiful (especially on a wide screen), except for Lautner and Stewart the acting is great and there's a fantastic final battle that easily makes up for all the problems the film has. It's long, violent and brutal--my audience (composed of mostly teenage girls) LOVED it. So not a great movie but the beautiful cinematography and final battle made it worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
REVIEW: The Last Bite of the Twilight Saga,"I wrote an extensive review on Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn 2, along with the pre-show party that was offered in my area (Rhode Island). Check it out now and leave your comments on what you think! It's currently up on my local radio stations' websites. Check it out here: http://www.hot1063.com/Article.asp?id=2575948I don't take myself too seriously when I do reviews, so it's kind of tongue-in-cheek. Check out an excerpt:""Actually, the only (very small) qualm I had with the film happens to be Bella & Edward's child Renesmee. Or as I like to call her, ""Creepy Face"" Cullen. For some reason the production team felt the need to CGI the poor little baby's face, creating these weird, ill-positioned facial expressions, which left me with a strange uneasiness...""Missy",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful ending to a Saga!,"I hear it all the time... people making fun of The Twilight Saga. ""You call that a great Vampire movie? The main guy sparkles... I can't take that serious... My girlfriend made me watch this with her..."". Let's not forget that this is also a lovestory, actually a very big part of it, and that Vampires are fictional beings. However the author creates or portrays them - that's the way they are. And they're not too far from original Vampire stories. They are cold, pale, drink blood - all features of a classical Vampire like the famous Dracula. Also the view of these fictional characters has changed. There are more modern stories, movies and series where they don't get burnt in sunlight or drink human blood (I know some in Twilight do but in the modern perspective they chose). It's as simple as the innovation of cars for example. They're still there to get you from one place to another but do they look like 100 years ago? Do they have the same features?Now to the movie itself:I thought that the final definitely did the Saga justice. I read the books, of course they're better, what do you expect? I'ts hard to top a book as a movie will never be as extensive and describing in some things. It would also be really sad if that happened.I hated the fact that they split Breaking Dawn into two but after seeing the first part I was convinced. The way it ended was great, don't want to give away anything here though. You will be surprised even though you might already know they changed up the end a little bit before seeing it. They really had me there. I was sitting there, looking at my friend with this ""Woah, are they serious?"" expression. I liked the way they changed it, it didn't throw off balance of the concept.One thing bugged me a little. Aro was being a little too silly at the ending part of the movie. A serious part where this didn't belong that much even though that's part of his character. It was still too much.The musical choices where right on point by Carter Burwell, as known from the other parts. Really charming the visuals.One last thing. I read the book about 2 years ago so I can't really tell how different it was from the film anymore. I did remember parts that I read while seeing them but not everything. I don't judge a movie by that anyway. I think about what I see not what I expect to see.Open your mind a little when seeing this or any Twilight movie. It's not your average Vampire flick.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Don't listen to the negative/bad reviews. It's either they're old or they don't have good taste.

Grand Finale,"I , for one ,was very happy with the movie, feeling it provided a fitting conclusion to the Saga. Bella really transforms as a vampire and I feel that the ending was exciting and surprising. In the book the whole confrontation with the Volutri was just talked out. The battle made it much more interesting and plausible. I've read the books, so I followed it with no problem, but my son, who has seen all the films, found all the visiting vampires confusing.In the book, it's all laid out better, but I realize that there are time constraints to filming.I felt that the main characters were excellent, as usual, Bella being very strong, Edward being supportive, ,and Jacob, for a change, being happy and not in the middle of a love triangle, and being very annoying to boot. The CGI Renesmees were odd, but the final one (Mackezie Foy) did a fine job. I liked the movie ( and series) a lot, and would say to those who badmouth it, don't waste your time and money. I have no time for the Batman series, but there are many who love it, so try and respect another's opinion",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Finally! Truly Thrilling!,"Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 - Seriously, what a story!! I never thought I'm going to love this trilogy movies. Other than skipped the New Moon, forced for the Eclipse, and disappointed for the first part of Breaking Dawn, I was extremely thrilled for this one! Honestly, I never felt some much blood pumping into my heart watching movie, not that many I might say. Maybe the real deal is due to how boring the first part, for this exciting plot for the second. Might just be a better reason for both are supposed to be in a chapter, not separated. But of course, it would take more than just two hours of running. The best part of it, the part two really packed with actions and surprises that we were dying to see in the previous movies. Not after the first one I guess. Seriously (I keep saying this, am I?), I was like, ""Oh, my God!"", ""Wow!"", ""Oh, sh*t"", ""Serve you right!"", ""Take that!"", ""You go girl!"", ""That's like it"", ""Now we talking!"" all the way the storyline. Maybe after some times of addicted to Vampire's Diaries and Charmed, this Breaking Dawn Part 2 really entertained my thirst upon actions and fight, with some powers and abilities. There are humor too, to add, even though the scenes weren't that much. And truly, you gonna love how it satisfied our lust of actions and maintaining the happy ending for everyone. Seriously, again, I was dying to watch this kind of exciting, thrilling movie like this one. I can't give enough stars to five. It certainly deserves more than that, and for the very last credit as well. Yeah, 5 multiplied by many more, and obviously A-MUST-WATCH movie! No, I don't spell it wrong.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

for twilight's everywhere,i have just been to the cinema to see this amazing film and i cannot believe that the creators of the fantastic film do not wish to create a future film like and epilogue and if they do decide to do so then i believe that they should call it twilight the Bella and Jacob story. i also happen to be on team Edward because he has a vibrant and very thorough personality trait which is very strong and it shows through rob as an actor and it also shows his passionate side when he is around Kristen/Bella. I also am very happy with all the performances from the main actors involved in such an epic saga conclusion.my thanks go to the cast and directors for making such an amazing and gripping storyline for all of the viewer's to sink their vampire teeth into,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worth watching,"Normally i'm not the big fan of Twilight, but my mom forced me to watch them, and so I did. Kristen Stewart was not my cup of tea, I found her very annoying and even though I properly knew that her character was suppose to be this way, it made me look at these movies and say, this is crap... But I saw the last Twilight movie yesterday and i must say that Kristen really surprised me very positively! Her character was totally different, and suddenly i realized something that changed my views on these films completely! The Bella role was meant to be sad, shy, and quiet.. But when she turns into a vampire herself, all the beauty and happiness gets out! So it all led to this, the was suppose to be a little different from normal girls in the other movies, so that she could really shine in this one! It worked so good, and I was blown away! But one thing that I don't get is the special effects... They are so bad... I don't understand why everything has to look like one big green screen shot, it's so awful to look at! But all in all, great movie, especially if you are a real Twilight fan, i'm not a fan, but it still blew me away, so if you haven't seen it yet, go do it! It will not disappoint you!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
They saved the best for the last,"¨Lot of red eyes around here... ¨After five films The Twilight Saga finally reaches its epic conclusion. What started for me as a pretty interesting franchise with the first film went downhill with the next sequels until the first part of Breaking Dawn which I thought was terrible. I still had to see how the franchise was going to end so I went ahead and watched the second part which to my surprise was really quite entertaining and up to par with the first film. The climatic ending was really worth the slow opening. I absolutely loved the final half hour of this film with the epic battle which in my opinion was one o the most entertaining battle sequences I've seen in a long time. There were a lot of things that this film got right: first of all the love triangle soap opera was put to an end finally, then you had Kristen Stewart finally playing a stronger character once she was turned into a vampire, Taylor Lautner wasn't annoying like in the other films, and the werewolves finally stopped talking amongst themselves. These were all good enough reasons for me to like this film better than all the other sequels. Another thing I enjoyed quite a bit was the addition of all the new vampire characters, but the best thing about Breaking Dawn was that epic battle scene which made the movie for me. It was a worthy ending to the franchise although I doubt it will convert any anti Twilight fans.The film picks up right where the first part left us, with Bella (Kristen Stewart) being converted into a vampire after giving birth to Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy) by Edward (Robert Pattinson). Bella begins to adapt quickly to her new life as a vampire and her newfound strength. Edward teaches her a few things about hunting and feeding before letting her see the baby. Once she is ready to see Renesmee she finds out that Jacob (Taylor Lautner) has imprinted himself on her. At first she is furious as we see her strength unleash itself on his pack, but later comes to her senses. The rest of the Cullen family are all home welcoming and congratulating Bella, but peace doesn't last for very long when the Volturi hear rumors that Renesmee is an immortal child that could threaten their very existence with her powers. Alice (Ashley Greene) has a vision of the future and warns her family that the Volturi will come to kill Renesmee. The Cullen's decide to gather their vampire friends around the world so they can act as witnesses and stand up to the Volturi claiming that Renesmee is actually human. However they are ready to fight the Volturi alongside with their allies if they try to harm the girl. Everything seems set for the final epic battle between both sides.Kristen Stewart is a lot better in this film considering she gets to play a much stronger character now and doesn't have to struggle about deciding between Jacob and Edward. Robert Pattinson isn't all that great here, but the truth of the matter is that no one came to these films for the performances. I'm really grateful that the werewolves weren't used as much here as in the other films. The twist at the end is also pretty fulfilling, and I really wasn't expecting something like that in a Twilight film. Bill Condon is a great director and he made this film much better by changing the final scene from the book. I still think he is way too good of a director for a franchise like this. The screenplay was once again adapted by Melissa Rosenberg from Stephenie Mayer's famous novel. As I said before, the material really isn't that great, but the film is really worth watching for that final half hour.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Definitely the best in the series, ending is Epic","hey what can i say i liked the movie if you're into romantic movies as well as vampire flicks you'll dig this series there's no ifs ands or buts about it, i disagree with a lot of people complaining about the a animated baby its essentially the girl actress face turned into a baby form so rather than look for a pairing of baby and older actor they opted for a animated face which i didn't see the defects these people posted about but hey thats why there's a different shade of color for everyone because two people liked the same movie doesn't mean they'll both like a similar movie its individual taste,i thought it was really good and the ending, well you've probably read negative reviews on the movie but called the ending worth seeing the movie again for, ill just leave it at that it took me like a month to see this movie because of the bad reviews it initially got, I'm now glad i saw it 8 out of 10 for me",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very good conclusion!,"Honestly I hesitate to vote as ""love stories"" are really not my gig, although I love the whole vampire ensemble and most everything that goes along with it which I guess includes this too. The fact that this movie had a good final battle made all the difference at least for me, be it a vision or not. That and the fact that it truly wrapped up the entire thing with no lame cliff hanger ending.I took my now 11 year old daughter to this, keep in mind I took her reluctantly to the original Twilight back when she was 7 when everyone in her class was raving about it. I had a hard time in the 3rd movie when well you know what happens... In any case I have to say this 4th movie was very good and probably 2nd to only the first movie as it's next to impossible to top the first movie of anything. It really brought everything together, tied together everything story line wise and really gave everyone what they wanted, which really was to see Bella finally become a vampire and embrace that lifestyle.The whole Volturi ""bad guy"" thing played out well in the end and left a satisfying ending at least to me. typically I hate that whole ""It was all a dream"" kind of ending, but in this movie it seem to fit and yet not rob you of the experience. I have to say Kristen Stewart is really a beautiful girl and it was nice to see her made up so beautiful in this movie and see her smile and actually look happy as she's been so subdued and withdrawn beauty wise in the previous movies. It's no doubt she was born to stardom and we'll be seeing more of her.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I give it a 10,"""Twilight: The Breaking Dawn"" was 10/10. It can not be done better, it was the best ending. I could have imagined of, well filmed with a very good flow, separately the movie was fine. But when you club all the parts together the movie is an awesome peace of work.Those who did not find it interesting, might have not seen the earlier parts of twilight, or might have lost interest because of long gaps. So i suggest to revise the earlier movie parts, As you can enjoy ""The Breaking Dawn -2"" in a better way.The Breaking Dawn part-1 is little slow but is beautiful. And it also created a curiosity for the part-2. As expectation is well served, and the movie is worth the wait.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Last but not the least,"First, I would like to thank K-Stew for giving the best performance so far! Of course, she can improve her acting skills, but I am very glad that she did not disappoint me with her acting in the most anticipated scenes (such as punching Jacob!). Robert did a great job as always - always keeps his distance, but has so much energy and love. There is a lot of new faces in this movie and I think that they are well chosen and they also did a memorable performance. I must add, Renesmee was adorable! The movie has fulfilled all of my expectations and more. Just when you think the film couldn't have gotten better, there is this beautiful ending, filled with emotions - joy and happiness but also melancholy. The ending makes you want another sequel.P.S. For completely understanding the movie it is necessary to read the books. Only then you can watch the movie without prejudices.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nothing's wrong about Twilight,"I don't't know it's too late to make a review or not but to be honest I just started to be a fan of Twilight Saga. And I don't't understand why most of the reviewers said bad things about Twilight *I'm talking about all Twilight movies. I didn't get it. Seriously it's very interesting movie for me and for some people at least Twilight still has big fans around the world. The movies were very unique. It's not just an usual love story like others love story movies but they mixed it up with more fictions, fantasy, mystery and horror story that made the movies were just incredible and brilliant. With that fantasy about a beautiful vampire with all their specializes it made some people especially the women *in my case* scream like Oh my God and Wow while watching the movies. Of course I've been trapped in an imagination about how handsome Robert Pattinson Is. That's the additional interesting thing about Twilight.

Overall Amazing and Unforgettable. Best movie in the series!,"Being a huge twi-hard fan from the start, I just HAD to see Breaking Dawn Part 2. Although the first two movies disappointed me, Breaking Dawn Part 2 made everything better. Words cannot explain the expression on my face once the ending credits were finished. In my honest opinion, Breaking Dawn Part 2 has been the best installment in the whole series and is definitely worth watching again. Filled with suspense and drama, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat and gripping my friend next to me. The ending was definitely a shocker. Sure, there were a few disappointments like the fake-ness of Renesmee's baby face and face as she grew older and the corny, cliché beach scene at the very end, but this is still one of the best movies I have seen in a while. It left me absolutely breathless. Each scene made me inch closer to the screen wanting more. Some scenes even made me tear up and take in a loud gasp! Overall, I am completely satisfied with this movie and I'm sad to see it is over.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just Saying...,"You know it's really unfair because the movie's really good and I'm not just saying that because I'm a 'Twihard'. This is actually the best one out of the whole saga. Yet people would still waste their time trashing the movie, I mean if you despise the whole 'Twilight' thing, why even bother watching it and even put an effort to review it. Like why spend time on things you don't like? Just admit it, this whole franchise totally left a mark on everyone's heart. TWILIGHT SAGA IS A CLASSIC. Bella and Edward's Lovestory equals to Romeo + Juliet, Catherine + Heathcliff, Mr Darcy + Elizabeth Bennett and so on. So yeah. I wouldn't go on convincing people to watch this movie, it's already #1 in the box office anyway! Haters to the left!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My Review on the Final Twilight Saga Film,"I will admit. I wasn't too sure about going to see the end of a much- loved series. I hate endings, and have in fact broken down at the end of this series and also Harry Potter. Today I reached my decision; everything has to end at some point. Collecting my courage, I walked bravely into the cinema armed with Kleenex and Nacho's.After waiting through, about fifteen minutes of boring adverts I had a realisation. That music, it sounds familiar. Hmm, then it hit me. Twilight's first composer had been brought back. I smiled happily as the music haunted one of my favourite twilight compositions. The music though, had not taking my mind of the fact that the titles were dragging on a bit. This had started my list of errors. The first scene was all in all, pretty good. The zoom-ins that occurred during first half-an-hour was brilliant. Hunting was a bit tame to me. I understand the process, as I have read the books. But something was burning in my mind. The runs didn't look at all realistic, mind you it's meant to be supernatural so I probably wouldn't think that it was. After the first few scenes I thought that the relationship between Robert Pattison and Kristen Stewart's characters was a bit off.I continued to mull over my thoughts until a surprise came to me. The battle, after reading the books I was wondering how on earth they were going to make it more interesting, and then in came Alice Cullen (Ashley Greene) and Jasper Hale (Jackson Rathbone). After witnessing a scene that never happened I was panicking like mad. So when I realised that my favourite characters weren't in any danger, I sighed in ease. After seeing such a dramatic scene, I was pleased to have a slightly nicer ending. Joy was filled through me as I saw Alice's Vision of The future. But I was in for one more shock, the final meadow scene. As Edward and Bella sat in the meadow for the last time, my heart was thumping. Then, music started. It was so beautiful; I was enchanted by the music. My tears only increased as I watched the flashbacks. I found myself looking at a screen with a book being flipped through until it reached the last sentence for the book series. With forever being highlighted, signifying the end to this magnificent seriesAfter living through much of the series History, I have come to the conclusion that this film has lived up to its caption. ""The Epic Finale That Will Love Forever"" I used to thoroughly hate this series, but after watching the film, this has changed. Although, it has not lived up to my love of Harry Potter, it is till up there. I will miss this series, and will fondly look back at the message of love, just before I close my eyes, and take my last breath.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Twi Fans will not want to miss!,"Just got back from watching it, it was awesome watching the book come to life, loved breaking dawn part 2 the book was my fav of all. The movie is not an exact replica, but there are some comical moments and tag lines which have been included.Best part was the end, TOTALLY surprising and will not disclose for fear of ruining it for fans. BUT I will say that the last 40 mins was the best of ALL the films.2nd best... ""Bella"" and her change, I found her so much more likable and gone was the weak, needy easily breakable girl. She finally came into her own. Both her, Edward and Jacob finally found their place. There was no more confusion which at times was often tedious to watch.As for the future? would LOVE LOVE LOVE to see a film about her and Jacob with Bella and Edward in the background. But if not, happy with where they left it. Great conclusion. Enjoyable chick flick.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Good Finale to a Ho-Hum Series!,"Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 is a good finish as one could expect for a series like this. Looking back, these films weren't bad but as a fantasy series, they could have been much better. Unlike Part 1, most of the icky romance scenes are gone and is replaced with tension and action. Many of the scenes just feature build-up moments as we meet people from each vampire clan but all of this successfully adds up to an incredible end sequence which is worth alone the price of admission.Bill Condon's film takes place right after Bella gave birth to Renessemee. Bella is trying to get under control over her new vampire skills and trying to keep away from Charlie. But things begin to slide when the Volturi, led by Aro believes her child is an Immortal, one that can spell doom for them.As for acting, it's not magnificent, but not terrible either. I believe Kristen Stewart is better here even though she still needs to be happier. Robert Pattinson is also decent. Taylor Lautner is meh and should stay away from acting. However, Michael Sheen delivers a heck of a performance as Aro and his screen presence is amazing.Overall, the finale of the Twilight series is a good one and one that neatly brings the franchise to a close, perhaps mercifully. As always, this film features great cinematography and a good score with some easy-listening songs attached. The final forty minutes of the film is excellent and on the whole, not a bad film. I don't think this will sway any non-believers though. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Favorite Movie,"This movie was at the top of my list! When I was watching the movie I couldn't wait to see what fun and exciting things they were going to be doing! I was also very paranoid because I wanted to get to the ending to see what exactly happens once the Volturi arrive! And now when I think about It I am glad that I waited to watch the full movie and relieved when everything had gone as planned! I was really scared when I saw Carlisle's death, Japser's, and even young Seth Clearwater. I love the scene where Benjamin is looking around, first at Edward, then Garrett, and lastly at newborn Bella who is fighting about 5 or less vampires, and Benjamin in shock creates a black hole to save her from them!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
perfect from beginning to end!!!!,First or I don't understand what the bad reviews came from. If you are a Twilight fan then obviously you love the movie like I did. If you want white lights and you didn't like the movie you don't like vampire movies and you have no business reviewing a masterpiece such as this one.Every part of this movie was perfect from the music to the acting and the story also including a great ending to a story. To bad it had to end. Not many movies that aren't horror movies can make your heart pound in one second and the other second feel relieved. This movie played with my emotions like no other Twilight movie has done. I am NOT saying that the other Twilight movies weren't good but I do believe this one was the most emotional and is very overlooked and deserves more than what I got review wise,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Spellbinding,"Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2 is the perfect ending to the Twilight Saga franchise! The plot is easy to follow, but slick and speedy at the same time so it never feels like it's dragging on! The characters are likable and amusing in their own ways, making each one of them unique. The action is breath-taking with some heartfelt moments that may cause tears to fall from the sensitive viewers. I was blown away into space from it all, every moment of the film is a moment I will remember and treasure for definite! For Twilight lovers, this movie will be a real treat they'll never forget! For viewers who've never seen a Twilight movie before, this may encourage them to watch the others. When I watched this movie, I hadn't seen the first part to it yet, but it didn't take me long to understand what was happening because of the easily understandable atmosphere the movie creates which makes it such a must-see blockbuster!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Chix Chat on Film Review: Bella and Edward, forever.","The love story between Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) is the draw for the ladies and the supernatural creatures battling it out is the draw for the guys so with Breaking Dawn Part 2 everybody gets something out of the story. But I did not imagine that fans were so emotionally involved until I witnessed a woman seated to my left in the theatre audibly began to cry during the climactic battle that is shown in the trailer, when a beloved character falls. I have shed a tear or two over scenes in movies, but never a lingering 'nooooooooo!' will I utter. Seriously, I really like the stories, I read the first book and part of the second, but it is still just a movie, the characters are not real. Besides rather than enhance my movie going experience by having read the book first it tarnishes it, but that's just me. This final film was actually very interesting, creative and cleverly crafted. The story provided for answers to questions that I didn't know that I had, like the whole immortal child story. This did provide for some insight into the Volturi zero tolerance policy, but never a reason for their extreme cruelty. I did find that baby Renesmee was a bit too animated for my taste so it was hard to appreciate what was supposed to be extracted from her ability to communicate. Bella's story was worth experiencing on the big screen and held my attention through all the films. I was never team Edward or team Jacob (Taylor Lautner) but I always felt that Jacob was more endearing, maybe because out of the two he brooded less. The whole imprinting on the new born was a little freaky if I give it too much thought, so I stopped over thinking it. Aside from the appearance of baby Renesmee, the special effects in this film would have you convinced that people could transform into over-sized wolves, the Bella rock climbing and that massive crack in the ground looked truly realistic. It's no secret that I really appreciate cool FX, which made this film a gem in my mind. I'm not broken up about this series ending any more than I was about Harry Potter ending, it just makes way for the next epic story that makes people wonder 'what if?'. I liked the shock and awe moments and I thoroughly enjoyed the mitigated collateral damage. Part 2 gets a green light.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Last movie is the best!,"I'm a big books fan,and I even own several editions of the books in different languages. You could say I was pretty much obsessed with this story. At first it was just the vampire story that lured me in,the the ordinary brown eyed girl who enters the supernatural world. I was never the team this or team that,I was into the whole thing. I loved the movies from the very first minute and still like them. But yesterday I started Twilight marathon and realized that movies aren't that perfect. But still,they are good. Before I didn't understand all the hate,but now I see some things that are wrong. It doesn't change the fact that Bella was meant to be a vampire. Kristen Stewart did an amazing job playing Bella as a vampire,she was so deadly awesome,she had this aura and I'm just sad that it took this long for her to become one. Although,every tiny detail made her stronger and happier and nothing was just for plot's sake. The cast was so diverse and all the actors were so great all along the movies. I'm really happy Meyer wrote this,and all the haters can keep hating,there still will be a lot more people loving this story.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Too much fun,"I have a different view of these Twilight movies. First, I had tons of fun watching them in a marathon week with my 23 year old and 13 year old daughters. We would make popcorn, light candles, turn on the huge lava lamp and settle in for enjoyment. The movies were made based on YA fiction so what do the other reviewers expect? For what they were intended, they were a blast to watch. As a parent, I was highly impressed with the values and morals promoted in the films. Yes, the special effects, acting, and dialogue was not profound, but it did what it was intended to do: entertain the adolescents and those with a fun loving attitude, and make money These films were never set to be serious or portray anything other than fictional teen/ young adult drama. Lighten up, people! Oh, and the actors look better in character as vampires than in real life.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
WOW!! It gets WAY better the second time around!!,"I can't believe I am writing a review in favor of this movie, seeing as a couple of hours ago I was determined to not even bother renting or buying this movie ever!! I LOVED twilight and that movie wasn't even on my radar when it first came out. I had never heard of it. All of the rest of the twilight movies up until this last movie had their ups and downs and I never really loved them the way I loved the first movie. What I discovered though is that once they came out to DVD and I watched them again, any issues I had previously had about all of the previous movies were dissolved.I have NEVER read any of the books, so I knew absolutely nothing about what was going to happen in this movie, just like I never knew what was happening in any of the previous movies.I just got done watching this movie, as it just came out at midnight on DVD. I wasn't expecting much, as I didn't really care for it when it came out in the theaters and I saw it opening night at midnight, along with all the other teeny boppers. All I can say is WOW, this movie is REALLY great!! If you watched this in the theaters and hated it, but kinda liked the other twilight movies, give this movie another chance and try seeing it again. I alternated between cheesy grins and crying the entire movie and I felt like it really moved me. This movie ISN'T for a lot of people and I will be the first to kinda agree that if you pick apart the movie or the actors acting abilities, it's kinda low quality. You have to go beyond all of that and see this movie for what it truly is....an eternal love story that defies all odds, shows a mothers unwavering love, and can touch your soul if you let it. I know everyone goes on and on about the bad acting in all of the twilight movies, but the one thing I have always thought was FANTASTIC about these movies is the non-verbal acting. I think it is a lot harder to portray anguish, heartache, love, and burning desire with just a look or two then it is to read some lines. I have always felt that Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson especially were great at doing that and all three of the main actors had a chemistry on screen that I thought was very believable.I'm sure everyone is going to pick this review apart and I will be the first to admit that I am a 30 something who is kind of embarrassed to like these movies. I don't gush about Edward or Jacob and I am not in love with the movies because I get to see these guys half naked on the screen. I DON""t have Edward posters on my wall, I don't post on the forums or talk incessantly about this movie or the actors in it. I don't pick apart the actors personal lives and judge them. I just really appreciate the depth of love that can be shown in these movies and I thought this was a VERY unexpected and beautiful way to end this series. I will be going out to buy this movie this morning, because I believe that this movie deserves my money and time.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Breaking Dawn Part 2,"First, for all those critics out there that feel they need to wax eloquent about BDP2, with horrible critiques, what is your problem? If you don't like the movie(s) why would you spend your hard earned, stolen, borrowed money to get a ticket? Do you have some lame wish to sit in a theater for 2 hours and watch something you know you won't like? If so, then you got exactly what you paid for and you should thank everyone in the film profusely.As for the movie, it was great. It was a different twist on a couple of old myths (vampires and werewolves), with a love story angle thrown in. It sold to women and some men, those that like that kind of story, some that are in touch with their emotional or feminine side, gay, etc. Though the werewolves weren't actually werewolves according to the story they were shape-shifters. It had a pretty good fight scene at the end that really had some of us fans worried, but it all turned out okay. In the end it was satisfying to those of us that enjoyed the stories for what they are, nuff said.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Spend money on the movie instead of the book.,"I read. A lot. I am a fiction junkie, if such a thing exists. When a book is made into a movie, what do I do?Step 1 - Read the book. Step 2 - Watch the movie. Step 3 - Spend blissful hours criticising the movie.And that is exactly what I had planned to do for the 2nd part of breaking dawn. Until all my plans went up in flames that is. :-OBreaking dawn part 2 - dare i say it, is a must watch. Especially if you have read the book. It out-passes the book in ways you cannot imagine.The climax especially is so very intriguing, gripping and all other - ings a person (well, me) actually screams out loud in surprise and wonder.

Women Gave This Film a 7.0 Rating,"I just want to point out to readers trying to decide whether to see this movie or not that there is a serious gender gap with regard to the votes for this film. As of this writing, the film's overall average rating on IMDb is a 5.8 but 18,200 males gave it an average of 4.7 and 14,700 women gave it an average score of 7.0. So men are dragging down the numbers here, lol. I think one reason for this might be that the male viewing audience is still getting adjusted to films where men are eroticized for women's visual pleasure. Of course, women have had to watch hot young women eroticized in films for decades so we're used to it, but I suspect it still makes a lot of men nervous in our homophobic society.I enjoyed this film, not because of the acting (hey, after 5 films, we know Kristen Stewart can't act!) but because it is very sensual. I enjoyed all the uber close ups that took us into her vampire reality in a very visceral way. And that cabin in the woods! What a dream! That's paradise wish fulfillment on film if ever I saw it.Was this film great art? Heck, no. But for this red-blooded heterosexual female it was great ENTERTAINMENT. Thanks, Hollywood, and keep up the good work of making films that pander to people's capacity for fantasy stories rooted in LOVE, with an adventurous female protagonist who rejects gender stereotypes, eroticized supporting male characters who are also gender conscious, sensuality, passion, eternal romance and epic battles fought for love. How refreshing to go through an entire film without having to cringe at some neanderthal unconscious objectification of our strong heroine! Goodness knows, we are STARVING for THAT type of movie! I'm not surprised these film's are making BANK at the box office, lol. :)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Over decades, the virus slowly spread across Africa and later into other parts of the world.The earliest known case of infection with HIV-1 in a human was detected in a blood sample collected in 1959 from a man in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

"Eye opener, v1.00","I found this to be the most approachable of the five features. I found reading the novel after watching the feature to add to the experience. I found the Youtube audio books by BreakingDawnReader1, etc, to add to that.The dress code of the wolves, at first I found that to be a big let down as it is not explained in the features or the commentary. I am now wondering if it is part of the novels that I have forgotten about. The novel series Animorphs by Katherine Applegate does give a believable explanation in its early episodes and I now import that into my experience of this feature and I can shrug off what used to be a big negative point, to me.I used to experience the romance of the first three features as fake, unreal. After gradually acclimatising to this feature I can now accept the romance in all of the features. I have now watched it through, the full set of features, a few times and found them all to be okay. I needed this feature in order to be able to do that.I found the later features of Kristen to be a problem to me due to her acting style. Riley's and Snow White. This feature has enabled me to overcome that. I can now like them more. I will now be wanting to get more of Kristen's later features.Me rating this feature as 10 out of ten.

The End of the Saga!,"Finally, getting around to viewing the final film in the franchise which started both the Young Adult film adaptation explosion and Hollywood's love of breaking up films/books into two films. I wasn't a fan of the first two films but I do think this franchise got better and the director's were given a bigger budget to explore the books better. Like all the films in the franchise, I'm a viewer who thought the supporting characters were more interesting, but never given enough time to shine (but thank god these films were not three hours long to explore that). This film actually ends the way it should have (surprisingly) and I think it was a satisfying ending to a film franchise the way it was set up.

The best movie of the series!,"First of all, when I first watched the official teaser of the movie I liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and gladly, it was better than the previous movies. The plot of the 5th movie was very interesting, but it wasn't innovative because it was similar to the previous movies. The storyline was very well-written and well-explained, even though it was simple and easy to understand. The characters were exactly the same as before, but they were still very interesting, well-developed and likeable. The casting choices were the same and their performances were excellent. I have to admit, it was a very intense movie, action-filled and the final battle scene was probably, the best part of the entire series. The opening scene was predictable, but it was very promising and enjoyable. The 3rd act was adventurous and the plot twist was definitely unpredictable. Moreover, the cinematography was very well done and the soundtrack was great.

It has a lot of energy and I believe that the actors wanted to end the series on a high note as well. Throughout the movies I really enjoyed Bella and Edward's love story and I know that the movie doesn't really portray a theme to a lot of people. But to me, the theme of Twilight is that you should do whatever you can to protect your family and the ones that you love.

Cool,"The fourth and fifth Twilight saga films were directed by Bill Condon. It is based on the second half of the fourth book by American writer Stephanie Mayer. It was released in 2012, four years after the book was published. And years after the first part of Dawn). I'm just thrilled with the actors playing the roles of vampires from various clans. This is one of the most interesting things in this movie. And the most gorgeous battles are in no way inferior to previous films, thanks to which the film was liked not only by girls, but also by guys. Music is one of the main advantages of the twilight saga, and especially this movie! I just love the musical accompaniment presented here, it's just excellent!

The perfect ending to a good five-film series,"Now, I conclude my franchise review of THE TWILIGHT SAGA with the second part and the fifth and final installment of the film series, THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 2.I will not explain this movie, but this is a quick summary: The birth of Bella and Edward's child brings conflict between Bella and her lifelong friend Jacob, and an all-out war between the Cullens and the Volturi, but it is not a real fight. It is only a vision.This film picks up nicely after the last film and is based on the second half of the final book of the same name written by Stephanie Meyer.The story is really, really cool. From my point of view, this is the best TWILIGHT film ever made and there will never be another film like BREAKING DAWN - PART 2, well, except for THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, THE AVENGERS, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, MAN OF STEEL and CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER. Out of all of the film's stories, the plot is so easy to follow.I will not explain a whole lot, but I will say that the CGI was great and really fantastic, especially in the last fight scene at the end of the film. The music was really good, in fact, the music during the fight scene was really amazing with the orchestra and choir going full blast.The dialogue is not bad and this was really amazing because this was a difficult challenge to pull off, but it was really cool.The acting was really cool especially with Kristen Stewart, MacKenzie Foy, Taylor Lautner, Dakota Fanning, Michael Sheen, Robert Pattinson, Ashley Greene, Nikki Reed and the original cast and newcomers that they put into this movie and they do their absolute best.The editing is a little confusing, but it pays off wonderfully with Ian Slater and Virginia Katz, both editors who worked on this film, put together a really good, entertaining and amazing film that caps of the TWILIGHT SAGA nicely.Now, I get to the ending. The ending was a little confusing, and the reason why is because it shows a vision that Alice has when she sees Renesmee, as an adult with Jacob, also Bella & Edward meeting with each other. I thought that would set up another TWILIGHT movie if possible, but it's just in this movie because it's in the book.Overall, THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 2 is a great and satisfying conclusion to the five-film franchise. From the music to the CGI to the acting to the ending, you will not be able to take your eyes of that screen once you see the fight.It is sad to say that this is the last film in the TWILIGHT SAGA. But I really do hope that they find a way to continue it because my sister LeeAnn really like this feature film. She likes the entire franchise in total and I would love to hear what Stephanie Meyer says about writing another TWILIGHT book or two for Summit Entertainment to make into another film or two.I give THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 2 a perfect score of 8 out of 10. It may not win fans over, but it definitely gives you exactly what you want: a stunning conclusion to a great film series.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Loved it ..but have some issues,"Let me be honest here,this movie is a good one but there's few problems I had with it.Firstly, I hated the fact that they didn't rip heart out and there is less blood..Also,I was disappointed when the head of the coven was defeated that easily.. Those dudes were the highest rank I expected a lot... What I really loved was how fast they went..they made it look like real vampires...their pale skin,strength...the wolves were awesome too..comparing realism of vampires between vampire diaries and twilight.

I fell in love by how the book was light and keep my imagination of characters and details alive.But in this movie, I admit I was more amazed by how they put battle scene as a plot twist. Imagined how suprised I was when I know there was no exact battle based on the book and found one in the movie! But It was clever and smooth.When I first saw the movie, I love the opening, the crimson red, the soundtrack and the ending. But little disappointed by the colour of the whole movie. It was unnatural. Well, maybe it was unavoidable. I don't know.But the conclusion was, WELL DONE!!!

Better than the book,"Breaking dawn was the book I like the less of all the Twilight saga. But Bill Condon made a very good job with this two last movies, and this one is jubilant. In the book, Charlie's reaction in front of the change of his daughter is not very convincing ; in the movie, it is very touching. We see how difficult it is for him to shut his mouth and close his eyes in front of so many strangeness. Ditto for the scene with J. Jenks, much better than in the book. And the great, great idea of the battle scene. I was elated : it's good, it's really good! I was so bored of all the speeches in the book, and there, at last, fight for good ! I loved the graphic style, the music, Kristen Stewart, obviously happy to leave the fragile character for a feral vampire ! To be honest, I didn't like Renesmee transformation from a baby to a little girl ; and I think Peter Facinelli should have lost some weight, but there are only details.

not surprises,"it is not good or bad part of series. only final piece of a puzzle who can seduce but not for long time. basic sin - maybe, the huge ambition of team and the poor tools. basic chance - to be a beautiful film. but , far to be a fail, it is only a show with large isles of kitsch. sparkles, special effects - not very convincing in few scenes - , a couple and a story - that can be all the pieces of film/series. something missing and that fact is reflected by the absence of roots and sense.fireworks, it is just teenager cultural fast food. and that is all. but, maybe, not enough. this film is the best example because , as last part, the expectations are many and high. good thing - the performance of few actors in small roles. but it is not really a consolation.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
