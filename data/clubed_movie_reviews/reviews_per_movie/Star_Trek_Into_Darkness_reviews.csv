Good story - great fun,"Yes it's just pure fun. Not a Star Trek fan but I loved the action, the acting and the story. Good visuals and great entertainment. Recommended, 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I seem to be going against the trend here...,"As much as I liked Abrams' 2009 re-boot of the Star Trek series, I liked this second installment better. I think that's because there was less of an obligation to fill up back-story, and more ability to go deeper both into plot, and into the emotions of these new, younger versions of the characters we now (re) know. Add to that Benedict Cumberbatch makes a complex and compelling villain, even if the character does borrow from other sources, including Rutger Hauer in ""Blade Runner"".The humor is funny, the emotional scenes have a real impact, the battles are exciting, the acting is excellent, the plot twists are clever, and the more epic 'big' moments are really effective.There are flaws; some plot twists can be seen coming a mile off, there are a few painful cheats or jumps in logic, and a handful of too-easy coincidences. But for a big summer blockbuster this has more smarts, style, punch and humanity than most.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lots of references to old Trek can't make up for lazy writing... Well OK maybe it can.,"Golly I think my title sums up everything I wanted to say. As far as basic plot goes, there's nothing particularly new here: a psycho super being plans to kill people and blow up things while the Enterprise is, for the millionth time, ""the only ship in the quadrant"". This movie is very lazily written, sort of like that homework assignment you slapped together on the bus to school but with a multi zillion dollar budget. But before you transport off this page, bear in mind the film's saving grace...There are a ton of groan-worthy, yet very effective, references to the old Star Trek universe, making this a pretty entertaining watch even though I sound like I'm slamming it harder than a shuttle craft making Emergency Landing Plan B (""B! As in BARRICADE""). That plus a ton of dazzling special effects and nonstop action prompt me to rate this movie a definite WORTHWHILE WATCH, even though my inner Trek nerd is screaming for you to avoid it like that episode ""Spock's Brain"".No, this is NOT a remake of the incomparable ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" (1982) although it does feature the characters Khan as well as Dr. Carol Marcus.No, Khan does not show off his bulging pecs as only the late great Ricardo Montalban could do.YES, there is a sneaky remake of the famous radiation ""you'll flood the chamber"" scene which is fun to watch.YES, Chris Pine does an admirable job of playing Captain Kirk as the charmingly arrogant young captain who doesn't like to lose.YES, Zachary Quinto does an admirable job of playing the stoic Mr Spock, and YES there is a cameo by Leonard Nimoy as the original Spock.YES, Dr, McCoy says ""Dammit Jim I'm a doctor not a ---!""and lastly, YES, at a certain point in the movie someone does, in fact, yell: ""KHAAaaAaAAAAAaaANNN!!!""So what more needs to be said. Great popcorn flick. Fun little nods to the old Trek series. It doesn't require too many brain cells. But then again, neither does ""Spock's Brain"" and we still love it.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I can boldly embrace both,"As someone who has grown up with the franchise, watched every show and every movie (I've watched the entire DS9 series at least twice!), suffered through characters/actors who I didn't care for (Tasha Yar, seriously?), I realize we all have opinions about what makes Gene Roddenberry's vision so lasting.That being said? I LOVED this movie. I even capitalized it I loved it so much. The play between the characters, the more human version of Spock, the absolutely delightful ""Scotty"" (although his sidekick is one of those throwaway characters I dislike) as well as a much better crafted plot this time made for a completely enjoyable movie. The action is intense, the friendship deepened between the characters, the twists and turns are a bit predictable at times, but that is reminiscent of the franchise as a whole. I am already excited for the next movie. I tremendously respected and appreciated the ties in this movie to the elements that make Star Trek great - strong story line, deep connection to the characters and a philosophical element. In some of the older Star Trek episodes the moral/philosophical element can be oppressively heavy handed. No so in the new Trek movie. The ideas of friendship, family and humanity are woven through this movie with subtly and I will outright admit I more than teared up during the climactic scene in the engine room. EVEN though I had already figured out what was going to happen, I have already come to care about, respect and enjoy the new actors in their iconic roles.So yes, ten out of ten. And let the haters, hate. Those who can not embrace change can go sit and watch old Star Trek reruns and bemoan the 'good old days' and spout off all the reasons why 'Star Trek ain't what it used to be'!!!!I, on the other hand, will boldly go and embrace the new with a continued reverence for the old. This movie makes it possible to love both.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Watch it and ignore the critics!,"We watched ' Star Trek - Into the Darkness this afternoon (May 9th 2013).I am not going to reveal specific details because this film is so new that I am aware that many people still have not had the opportunity to watch it, and I do not wish to ruin their experience.Having read the points raised in the 'maddog' review I just wanted to say that we found it to be a truly absorbing and brilliant film, and our views are so diametrically opposed to 'maddog' that I genuinely wonder if he/or she actually watched the same film - or slept through it and took a wild guess as to its quality.Star Trek - Into the Darkness is mainly a fast paced action film interspersed with scenes of human interest which facilitates the deeper development of the main characters and their inter-relationships. The phrase 'bonding under fire seems appropriate.I would urge people not to be dissuaded from watching this film because a reviewer cannot see the link between Gene Roddenberry's much vaunted ideals and therefore trashes J.J. Abrams work. Let me just say that as I am in my 66th year, I have watched ALL the Star Trek series and films and can advise that this film combines a serious reflection of William Shatner's portrayal of James T. Kirk but also matures Chris Pine as the film progresses. As Roddenberry was closely involved with original Star Trek series I therefore believe that he would approve the direction that Abrams is taking the latest incarnation of Star Trek.Star Trek - Into the Darkness is aptly named. It is rich in plot detail and exciting to watch. It will have many people sitting on the edge of their seats, willing those embroiled in battle to succeed. Even the villain (stunningly portrayed by Benedict Cumberpatch) warrants a certain amount of sympathy from all fair minded people.My advice - Go, Watch - and be thrilled by a brilliant film. We will go and see it again!!Our thanks to all those involved in bringing this to our screen - great job!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Enemy of My Enemy Is My Friend,"After violating the Prime Directive of the Federation interfering with the primitive inhabitants of Planet Nibiru, saving their lives from a volcanic eruption and exposing the Enterprise to them to save Spock (Zachary Quinto), Captain James Kirk (Chris Pine) is summoned by Admiral Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and loses the command of the Enterprise.Meanwhile, a Starfleet facility in London is bombed and the high-command has a meeting where the identity of the responsible, the former agent John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), is disclosed. However, Harrison attacks the commanders; kills Spike and flees to Kronos, the land of the Klingons. Admiral Alexander Marcus (Peter Weller) assigns Kirk to kill Harrison and brings seventy-two torpedoes to the Enterprise to accomplish the mission. Chief Engineer Montgomery Scotty (Simon Pegg) refuses to receive the weapons and Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin) is relocated to his position and Dr. Carol Wallace (Alice Eve), who is a science officer specialized in weapons, joins the Enterprise crew. When they arrive in Kronos, they are attacked by Klingons but out of the blue, Harrison kills the Klingons and surprisingly surrenders to Kirk after knowing that the torpedoes are on board of the Enterprise. Then he discloses that he is Khan, a superhuman that was awakened by Marcus from a cryogenic pod to prepare the star-ships with powerful weapons for a war against the Klingons. When the Enterprise is intercepted by a mysterious starship commanded by Admiral Marcus, Kirk asks Khan to help him to save his crew.""Star Trek into Darkness"" is a great sci-fi with a good story of Kirk and his crew and a powerful villain. The good acting and direction associated to top-notch special effects make a highly entertaining movie. Surprisingly there are bad reviews in IMDb that must be ignored by those that like this franchise. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Star Trek Além da Escuridão"" (""Star Trek beyond the Darkness"")",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Nowhere near greatness, hardly 'Star Trek's' darkest hour either","While it was not a perfect series (William Shatner's overacting, less than great production values and an iffy Season 3), the original 'Star Trek' series was a genre landmark and hugely influential and ground-breaking, also a mostly great series in its own right especially for the characters, the relationships and Leonard Nimoy's Spock.The films based on the original series were a mixed bag. A few great ones with 'The Wrath of Khan', 'The Voyage Home' and 'The Undiscovered Country', one in-between film with 'The Search for Spock' and disappointments with 'The Motion Picture' and particularly 'The Final Frontier'. There were ten 'Star Trek' films before this 2009 reboot, four being based on the 'Next Generation series where the only outstanding one was 'First Contact'. 'Generations to me was another in-between film and 'Insurrection' and 'Nemesis' were two other particularly problematic ones.Don't think 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is as good as the generally positive critical reception makes out, despite some really impressive elements (more so than those who dislike the film have made out), it is a heavily flawed film and does disappoint as a 'Star Trek' film. At the same time, as a film on its own 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is pretty decent but admittedly it could have been much better. While the disappointment is understandable and personally concur with a lot of the criticisms, it is nowhere near as bad as 'Star Trek' fans who hated it have said, coming from a subjective person this is not a 1/10 film.Visually, the film mostly looks great. The special effects are mainly fantastic and leave one in awe, while there is audacious and suitably moody cinematography and atmospheric lighting.Michael Giacchino delivers another winner of a music score, don't remember ever being disappointed by this man. Sure it is familiar, but it fits very well with the film and its mood and is unmistakable Giacchino, a beautiful score to listen to and has a lot of atmosphere.Where 'Star Trek Into Darkness' scores highly is in the action, it is staged in a way that generates a huge amount of thrilling excitement, tension and suspense. It's well shot too, and JJ Abrams knows how to deliver on the action and spectacle. The sound effects have a lot of authenticity.Regarding the story, 'Star Trek Into Darkness' evoked mixed reactions from me. It is rich in atmosphere and has some thrilling moments and truly exciting action, while the interplay between Kirk and Spock is brilliantly written and makes one feel quite nostalgic. The casting is in crucial parts bang on with some great performances. Chris Pine has garnered mixed reactions, to me he was more relaxed here and has a charisma that commands the screen.Zachary Quinto once again nails it as Spock, with huge shoes to fill, capturing perfectly what was so iconic about the character in the first place. Karl Urban is suitably cantankerous, Zoe Saldana is sexy and fiery and Leonard Nimoy makes a moving cameo. Best of all is Benedict Cumberbatch, who is sensational as Khan and is the best thing about the film, Khan is also the most interesting and most developed character and Cumberbatch gives him menacing intensity and sympathetic melancholy, a character who you fear but in some way understand his point of view.'Star Trek Into Darkness' has a lot of faults though. The script has some clunky moments, has comedy that really doesn't gel and is not very funny and fails to provoke much thought or have much depth, some of it feels dumbed down. Character development, something that 'Star Trek' at its best was particularly good in, is mostly lacking, outside of Khan, most of the cast actually are criminally underused and are very bland in personality (Urban was fine but was too much in the background), Alice Eve is little more than a window dressing plot device that felt incidental to the story and Simon Pegg (who is very funny in other roles) is irritating comic relief.Despite some good moments, the story was very problematic. That it has a lot of inconsistencies and continuity errors is just one problem, more of an issue was that some of it was in need of much more clarity because some of it is convoluted and under-explored, the big reveal is clumsy and far too obvious and the romance is shoe-horned, forced, underdeveloped and completely unnecessary.Although most of the film was well made, a few of the techniques that distracted a lot in 'Star Trek' (2009), especially the lens flares, still distract and look cheap. Abrams does action and spectacle well, but fails on what is a large part of 'Star Trek's' appeal when at its best which is the writing and the characterisation, both problematically executed and robs the film of heart and soul. The film is all big and noisy, but the brains and heart are missing.Overall, nowhere near greatness but hardly the franchise's darkest hour. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"An inventive, unpredictable, mesmerising space voyage! Spectacular!!!!","Truly spectacular, one of those rare amazing, inventive and often unpredictable blockbusters. The acting was great all round, especially Cumberbatch - wow, he was superb. The direction, cinematography and visual effects were all greatly innovative and brilliant; the screenplay fun, often humorous and has a lot of heart for all its characters which are all really well developed.The film has some cliché moments which can't be avoided often with a film this scale however they make use of them well and still pack plenty of surprises. As well as this, despite not being a proper Trekkie myself, some moments gave me goosebumps from the awesomeness from seeing the Enterprise for the first time for example, which greatly honoured the original series. J.J. Abrams' lens flares helped create more realism in a lot of the scenes despite the fact he often overuses of them.The villain was very interesting and the development, dialogue and motivations of his character were very convincing and inventive, Cumberbatch's fantastic acting greatly helped bring this character to life. Also the way he executed his plan showed a lot more cutting edge creativity than especially most modern blockbusters, not to say it's done nearly to the same level of genius but something I haven't felt in a villain's characterisation/acting since The Dark Knight.Overall, a mesmerising film with nice homages to the original series, one filled with heart, grace, innovation, superb characters and acting and some impressive, clever visuals and immersive 3D, one of the only times I can say that. Up there with the 2009 one, not sure which I prefer, possibly the previous one largely due to the more clever story, despite this one having a much better villain, still not sure though. Still a very strongly recommended film, may hit my top 100 simply because how much I was impressed by it. 9/10!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Star Trek: Transformers 4 would be a better title,"Star Trek: Transformers 4 would fit best to this, because it is not the Star Trek we are used to. This is simply an action movie, that happens to have phasers instead of guns, and beaming instead of taking a plane/car. I was expecting to see some science and understanding, instead I got the 1970s captain again, with the fist fighting enemies and kissing the girls. What happened to the optimistic bright future where money is not an issue and people work to better themselves? What happened to the Earth that was heaven? What happened to the engineers who make improvements to the ship using alien technologies, and not try to fix it all the time? What happened to technological competition and diversification? Where is the strategy? Smart ship tactics? All seems to be brute force in this movie. As a trekkie, I am quite disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Easily one of the best Star Trek Movies ever.,"As a long term trek fan, who has been a HUGE fan of all things this franchise has to offer, and knows a fair amount of the extra background this movie is great. Its great for regular non fans too. I will not spoil it but the story is a very good movie, contemporary and of its time without being irreverent to the prime universe.

"We need Star Trek Into DEEPNESS, not darkness.","We need Star Trek Into DEEPNESS, not darkness.In the movie theatre I heard a complaint from an old school Trekkie that the second installment of the Star Trek reboot had too many ""Little Archie and Veronica"" moments.This is true and it would be OK if that were just the icing on the cake. The real problem with the movie is that it runs like a typical SciFi action plot inserted under a Star Trek banner.This movie is missing the hallmark epiphany moments Star Trek is famous for. Mainly, it is missing the philosophical ""WOW"" factors that don't just blow your mind but rather expands it, making you realise that everything you thought you knew is wrong and that everything you thought the Federation had figured out is also wrong. These expansions used to pave the way for the audience to mentally and emotionally take that next step to, ""Boldly go where no man has gone before...""This movie has no epiphany. Where is the deepness that Star Trek is synonymous with? This movie gives us what? A federation struggling with internal corruption and terrorism, a la the typical disgruntled ex employee, who in this case was cryogenics frozen for 300 years, as is the plot. Big deal. These are familiar themes we've all seen in movies before. Just trade the Federation for any corrupt financial, medical, educational, government and or religious institution. Trade the ""John Harrison"" character for any Bond villain and you have a movie that sounds like a bunch of other movies or what the news broadcasts. Boring.To me the Federation meant a time in the future when Humanity had finally gotten its act together and to a certain extent had rooted out all this corruption and terrorism. Unless a Klingon or Romulan shows up, things are supposed to be refreshingly illuminating. Not something that degrades into ordinary, mainstream, average caveman fist fight showdowns.How can we boldly go where no man has gone before in the future unless we have thrown off the shackles of the past? What a sad/shamey day it is when a Star Trek movie presents a not so optimistic future just as dark as today's headlines. I can read/watch the news/The Matrix if I want that. IS THERE NO ESCAPE?!!! IS THERE NO HOPE?!!!Obviously, Gene Roddenberry's spirit could not find a way to keep the franchise on track. Will, (Vulcan fingers crossed) Trekkies and non-Trekkies alike know the difference between the wealth of deepness and the poverty of darkness?",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not as good as the first, but still great!","The previous Star Trek movie is a tough one to beat. It was (in my eyes) close to perfection (lens flares and all). So this movie had a tough up-hill battle ahead of it. I am happy to report that the writing, direction, cinematography and acting were all terrific. But it's not quite flawless. There are a couple of minor plot holes that distract viewer attention to some degree.Cumberbatch is brilliant. I won't divulge any spoilers, but I will say that the throw back to the earlier movies is very very clever and well executed.

Admirable Follow Up,"An admirable follow up to 2009's Star Trek, this film checks the boxes without taking many risks. While I enjoyed seeing the characters struggle with their responsibilities, there were far too many ""start over"" moments. That being said, each of those moments were short lived and I would have liked more in-depth storytelling.The cast is fantastic (just like the first movie) and Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan is a welcome addition. I especially enjoyed the moments which showed why Kirk is the youngest captain in Star Fleet (The ""gather in this room according to protocol"" scene is a great example).While the action was over-the-top just like its predecessor, there were also some clever scenarios that I enjoyed diving into. The interpersonal relationships were deepened and the lore was broadened (love the Mudd reference), it just fell short of the first film.Best Character: Chekov

There was a lot more Star Trek in this Star Trek movie,"While I gradually came to accept 2009's Star Trek as mindless fun, I remember sitting in the theater when I first saw it and just getting this sinking feeling, like a balloon with the air slowly being released. My reaction was the complete opposite this time around. Into Darkness surpasses its predecessor by leaps and bounds. This is a movie that should appeal as much to most Trekkies as it will to general audiences just looking for a cinematic thrill ride.JJ Abram's inaugural foray into this franchise kind of seemed to leave loyal fans in the dust in the rush to attract a wider demographic. Even before Abrams, I'm pretty sure there were complaints that Trek movies had become too much about space battles and the like and had gotten away from going boldly where no one has gone before. I feel like the writers of Into Darkness must have taken some of those criticisms to heart and set out to address them in what I think is a fairly clever way.The people behind this film got to have their cake and eat it too: they made the most action-packed Star Trek movie ever, but at the end of the day, it's also a reaffirmation of the core ideals of Star Trek and is a lot more reverential to the canon. Having said that, however, the question still remains whether it's possible to craft a movie that is actually about seeking out new life and new civilizations rather than simply paying lip service to that concept.Of course, not all Trekkies will agree with my assessment, but it's impossible to please everyone and fanboys are notoriously difficult to please. In my opinion, though, it's one of the best films I've seen this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Dumb,"A reckless young battleship commander hunts down the assassin of his mentor, but needs the assassin's help to counter a threat from within.Flashy action story with a confused concept. The opening sequence addresses the clash between the ethics of the organisation and the swashbucklng of our hero, but it makes a mockery of the thoughtful side of Star Trek and doesn't tie in with the rest of the plot. After that we're left with something like Top Gun - a barely disguised homage to American military might without any insight on the responsibilities of power or the potential of human collaboration. There is nothing to explain how the organisation could become so corrupted that it promotes war, and the threat from the villain seems to come from nowhere - I don't know much about the Star Trek universe, so I'm just commenting on the internal logic of the story, but the year 1945 seems to have significance.The drama is limited, with simple-minded relationships, and the actors don't need to do much. Best performances are from the villain, with the usual icy British superiority, and a bit of steam rising from Uhuru's passion.The director fits the pieces together fairly tight and throws in plenty of punch-ups, but there's not much of interest.Overall: nothing to distinguish this from a dumb action movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Boldly going back for more of the same - but better!,"In the time between this movie and the end of JJ Abrams' spectacular 2009 reboot the crew of the Enterprise have been enjoying a bit of galaxy hopping. However after a questionable decision on their last mission, Kirk finds himself out of favour with Starfleet command. Enter John Harrison, a rogue Starfleet operative with a taste for the melodramatic and a penchant for things that go boom.Kirk volunteers himself and crew to track down Harrison and bring him to justice but along the way Kirk discovers that not everything he believes in may be true.To go any further would be wrong and evil and spoil your enjoyment of the movie but let's just say there are some fantastic revelations which may take you by surprise.The tone remains much the same as the first movie although the secondary characters seem to get a bit more screen time on this mission. Chris Pine is a solid Kirk, displaying the bull-headed nature and incredible ego that Shatner bestowed upon his creation. Zachary Quinto nails Spock, getting the underlying struggle between his human and Vulcan origins just right.Newcomer to the series, Benedict Cumberbatch has an amazing screen presence, oozing menace yet at the same time capturing the essence of an arch manipulator who is just as deadly with his mind games as with a bomb.The movie belts along close to warp speed and the action sequences are slick and polished. The interplay between the crew of the Enterprise is entertaining and believable, giving nods to fans of the original TV show as well as keeping things contemporary.There is one moment in the film which Trek fans will either love or hate. I'm not going to spoil it but there is a section of the film where.....well I'm not going to say but if you are a fan you'll know it when you get to it!This is near enough the best film that I've seen this year and it pretty much lives up to the hype. If you loved the first one then you're definitely going to enjoy this. If you didn't like the first movie - what's wrong with you? Go and watch it again and then go and watch this one.Just for the record I saw this in 2D and it looked amazing.

To boldly make more noise than anyone before,"Abrams is merely an efficient technician, uninteresting as a man of vision. But we need guys like him, conservative and mechanical in their efficiency, who will hold down the paradigm as others more adventurous fight to shift it, who will remind us by the arbitrary limits they impose that there must be a broader space. It's always the routine and familiar that kindles dreaming.And this is just so routine. Abrams takes the Spielberg-Lucas model of climax after climax, starting with an Indiana Jones prologue. A few simple moral dilemmas form the backbone, inherited with a wink from the Trek genealogy. The hamfisted 9/11 allegory, enforced by terrorist bombings and a final 'plane crash' in Starfleet hq, is that we may covet revenge but we are dehumanized in the process. Khan as a vengeful mujahedeen, 'trained' by the secret military which is headed by a cowboy admiral hellbent on preemptive war. (Interestingly, everything about Khan's handling here bears Nolan's influence.)Soulless.So it is fitting that this guy is spearheading the next generation of established cinematic imagination, taking over from Lucas who is now retired, and Spielberg who is 'respectable'. I'm sure that in 20 years time he will be making his own respectable war movies. That kids growing up on stuff like this will fondly elevate the memory. And that his idea of artistry, Welles' action camera dotted by twinkles of color, lasers and flares, will be elaborated on in essays about his aesthetics, maybe.All of which is just a natural state of things, nothing to get up in arms about. It just means that the interesting stuff will be defined by contrast to him.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Khan has returned,"Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock shows more emotion in Star Trek Into Darkness than Leonard Nimoy did during the entire run of the series and the various big screen incarnations. Considering the stress that he and Chris Pine as Captain Kirk are under in this one it is understandable.It's hard to tell who the enemy is in this one. We've got a Star Fleet Admiral played by Peter Weller who is sending the Enterprise on one dangerous mission and it seems more and more like its real purpose was to provoke the Klingons into an all out war.Their mission was to essentially assassinate a man named John Harrison who has defected to the Klingon Empire. But the last time such an assassination was ordered it was for either Admiral Yamamoto and for Osama Bin Laden. And the people carrying those missions out did not have the weaponry of the Enterprise.Instead Kirk takes Harrison alive which fouls up the plans of a lot of people. And Harrison whose real name is Khan and is played by Benedict Cumberbatch has really got an agenda all his own.By the name you'll recognize this as kind of a remake of the classic Star Trek, The Wrath Of Khan. But if you think you know then as a good Trekkie what's coming then you're in for a surprise. Important variations are made to the plot.The high standard of good science fiction and characters of idealism and fortitude that all the incarnations of the Enterprise have shown are faithfully retained here. This is truly the next generation of Star Trek.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Prequel back to the Original Space Fantasy,"7.25 of 10. This is more of a Star Trek for the hardcore fans of the old series. Unfortunately, it holds on to some of the elements too much, not upgrading the science and technology. It's disappointing in that it doesn't boldly go to an entirely new crew, planets, and aliens. Fortunately, it feels like a 1-time step back to explore some of the unanswered mysteries of the story's origins. I'll be disappointed if it tries to become a series.It does boldly explore the pre-mission lives of the original Star Trek characters, giving them new dimension and a solid foundation. It makes you want to watch the old series from the start, but not a sequel.There are also some exceptional story and plot developments to make this unique and a good story in itself, villains that are much more complex than the simple alien adversaries of past stories. About the only place for this to go is a prequel of the prequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I am a long time Trekkie fan but this is a film that non trek fans can really enjoy.Also try to ignore the miserable bunch here who are bitching about it being a rip off of Wrath of Khan.

"A Solid, Exciting Second Adventure; Cumberbatch is Awesome","It seems 2013 is the year of fan rage, as it seems pretty much every major summer blockbuster became the object of their unmitigated anger. While the others seemed to infuriate fans for changing details, STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS appears to fall on the opposite end of the spectrum. People seem aggravated that the filmmakers were too eager to reference the source material (while at the same time, simplifying it for a wider audience). In the case of just about every major movie released this summer, I feel like I'm in the minority of people who actually enjoyed them, and that includes our second adventure in the new STAR TREK universe. It wasn't as good as the first film but it was a solid, exciting film and one of the best we're bound to get. It begins about a year after the events of the first film with Captain Kirk using his command of the U.S.S. Enterprise to violate just about every rule in Starfleet. When an unsanctioned mission to save a primitive race from extinction brings the wrath of his superiors and puts him at odds with Spock, Kirk nearly loses his command position before it every truly gets started, but a terrorist attack on a Starfleet facility in London leaves him with no time to dwell on it. After suffering a personal loss, Kirk makes it his mission to hunt down this terrorist, a man going by the name John Harrison, and bring him to justice. Pursuing the man deep into enemy territory, Kirk finally confronts him to discover that he's more than he appears to be and he might not be the largest threat on the horizon.I really enjoyed INTO DARKNESS. It's not quite as fun on repeat viewings but there's still a lot I loved about this movie. For better or worse, our new STAR TREK is a more action-oriented franchise and the action is always bigger than life. I swear, J.J. Abrams primary mission in these movies is to put the Enterprise through as much pain and suffering as he can to get the money shots that'll put audiences in the seats. We get the Enterprise falling through an atmosphere, rising out of an ocean, rising above clouds, rocketing out of warp speedevery conceivably cool shot he can imagine, he'll find a way to fit it into the movie. And I can't complain because, frankly, the effects in this movie are so awesome that these shots look absolutely amazing. Of course, there are also plenty of brutal hand-to-hand combat and phaser battles because our new TREK isn't a mission of peace. Once relegated to the occasional away mission, action is the name of the game now. The production design, makeup effects, and visual effects are all top notch as you'd expect from a nearly $200 million budget. No one can argue that this movie doesn't look fantastic. It's one of my favorite things about the new franchise; we get an updated, modernized interpretation of a classic universe. Speaking of classic, this movie manages to shoehorn in Klingons, tribbles, and casual references to Harry Mudd and Nurse Chapel.And here is where it seemed to get a lot of negative chatter. The writers and director have been accused of straight-up ripping off STAR TREK II because (and I refuse to consider this a spoiler seeing as how Benedict Cumberbatch is credited as the character on just about any cast list you find) Khan Noonien Singh returns and the movie makes more than a few loving references to THE WRATH OF KHAN. To give my opinion, no, I am not outraged about all the little homages scattered throughout the movie and I believed the plot was different enough from anything done in WRATH OF KHAN to avoid accusations of laziness. Aside from a major sequence near the end of the film (now THAT is a spoiler and I won't ruin it) that felt a little too on-the-nose and was resolved way, way too simply, I had no complaints in that regard. In fact, I thought Cumberbatch was an awesome Khan. He was sinister, intelligent, and an intimidating presence with his cold, calculating demeanor. He gave the constant impression that Khan was a powerful man and always in control of the situation, even when he shouldn't be. He was not as eccentric in the role as Ricardo Montalban in STAR TREK II, but I think he gives an equally powerful performance. You believe this man would slaughter every man and woman in his path to achieve his goals. Alice Eve is another addition to the cast as a weapons expert who invites herself aboard the Enterprise on its manhunt while hiding her own agenda (dodging some more minor spoilers here), but she doesn't do much. I don't know, maybe next time, I guess.If fans want something to complain about, there're better things to complain about. Despite not having watched any of the series regularly in years, I'm pretty sure the Enterprise isn't capable of flying within an atmosphere (which it does twice here), much less landing and taking off. How does the Enterprise go from Earth orbit to the heart of Klingon space in ridiculously fast time? How did Khan teleport across so many systems? Was another high- speed space jump sequence really necessary? I guess it must've been so popular in the first film they felt the need to do it again and up the ante. How was the construction of a warship kept secret in the middle of a bustling stat system? Why was the Klingon moon already destroyed despite not occurring until STAR TREK VI? Although I guess that last one could be copped up to the whole reimagined timeline bit. Regardless, the new franchise is one of mass appeal and, understanding that we probably won't see a STAR TREK film like the old days, this one's pretty good for what it is.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
the thrill is gone,"J.J. Abrams uses in 'Star Trek: Into Darkness' the prequels formula Reversing the effects of present-past and discovering the causes of the effects we have known in advance have paved the interest for many films. In the first film we already met Captain James T. Kirk as a young rebel, Mr. Spock who already has all the traits of his humano-volcanic character, while doctor Chekhov and technician Scotty play an important role in the plot the second series.The world is again in danger in this series and the main villain Benedict Cumberbatch is played masterfully by an actor that I like enormously and in this film manages to be a 'bad guy' of high quality. Themes popular in the 'Star Trek' series like the moral dilemmas between friendship and duty, love between humans and humanoids from other species of the universe, the principle of non-intervention in exploration, namely the avoidance of disruption of the historical evolution of less developed civilizations, are added to a contemporary theme in this film - that of terrorism. The HQ of the Federation Council which extends the UN replacing or in some way by the Organization of United Civilizations is the victim of a terrorist attack in London of the future, and hence complicates the start and the multiple threads of the main action in the film.What is probably to be criticized in J.J. Abrams and the producers work in this second series 'Star Trek' is the fact that space action is given undue overweight. It is natural for a science fiction film made in 2013 to look very different than a television series conceived in the mid 60s. Cinematic technology progressed, taste of a public that has seen so many in nearly half a century of films changed. Yet it seemed to me that the filmmakers have chosen the superficial entertainment path and personally I missed the thrill of exploring knowledge and that was evident in many of the Star Trek TV series and movies from the past. The focus is too much on graphics (exceptional, actually), the image of the future metropolis, the space battles and chases occupying about half the film. This Star Trek's J.J. Abrams looks too much like Star Wars. Technology of the future imagined by Abrams brings little additional elements to what we knew from previous series - 'transporters', communication systems etc. we are familiar with these, with the sole exception of the levitation beds in hospitals. The atmosphere of 'Star Trek' is found rather in small dialogs between characters who continue to build and define the next generation and become familiar to the public. It is probably one of the reasons the film's success and a good premise for the series that will follow.The journey continues, but the pace is hesitant, and the thrill is gone. Hopefully, only temporarily.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Gene Roddenberry must be rolling over in his grave,"If I could give it a zero, I would. The only thing to save this travesty is Zachary Quinto and cool explosions. If it weren't for him, I'd give it a 1.Really bad acting, coupled with a terrible version of the story of Kahn, and why in the world is everything on the Enterprise glowing like a flashlight?And then they had the gall to use the original Star Trek theme at the end? I can see why many of the old actors have a serious problem with the new movies.This is terrible, really terrible. Gene Roddenberry was greedy as can be, but I think he'd have a serious problem with this version. In the original, he wanted to show that humanity had finally overcome most of the things that caused us problems. The only place these things could still be found was in the expansion regions where it was still the wild west.But in this... everything from the uniforms, the slang, the music, and everything else is EXACTLY as it is now but shinier. Really? This is ridiculous.Abrams should be ashamed.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A convincing revamp with outstanding actors,"To set things straight, I'm definitely not a die hard Star Trek fan and I didn't enjoy some of the later movies made in the early nineties as some of these movies were overlong and soulless. I was though rather positively surprised by the reboot and beginning of the new trilogy that came out in 2009. This sequel which is overall already the twelfth Star Trek movie is just as good as its direct predecessor or even slightly better.Let's start with a couple of negative things first. The special and visual effects were decent but not as good as those in other current science-fiction flicks like ""John Carter"" or ""Oblivion"". The soundtrack was decent as well but not outstanding. The story was intriguing enough from the beginning to end and kept my attention high. It will surely please to old and new fans of the series but in my opinion the story was too predictable at some points for many experts of the series. You simply know that the good ones will survive and that the evil guy is truly evil and that's why some parts of the movie lack of suspense.What I really liked about the movie was something else: the acting! I really appreciate the original cast and many nostalgic and closed-minded fans might claim that no actors can equal the originals. In my opinion, this is not true. Chris Pine's version of Kirk is much more diversified, down-to-earth and human than what I recall from the originals. Zachary Quinto's way to take the role of Spock is simply incredible and his acting is simply outstanding throughout the entire movie. Add to this a brilliant over-the-top incarnation of Scotty by Simon Pegg and an obscure and unpredictable main villain like Khan who is very well portrayed by Benedict Cumberbutch. Even the secondary roles were very well cast and I couldn't find any faceless actor or actress in this movie. They all did a very good job which hasn't always been the case in the past of the series.Thanks to this amazing acting and the gripping and very typical story line that makes you rediscover many characters of the original movies, any fan of the series and anyone who is ready to give the fresh revamp trilogy a chance should go to the cinemas and enjoy this movie. It's not groundbreaking and remains somewhat nostalgic of course and I'm normally not a big fan of endless sequels and remakes but this new episode in the Star Trek universe is quite entertaining and addicting. I wouldn't buy the DVD but I will surely watch the third part in the cinemas when the time is right.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The 12th feature film in the Star Trek franchise and the second of J.J. Abrams results to be an exciting and thrilling roller-coaster,"When the crew of the Enterprise is called back home, they find an unstoppable force of terror from within their own organization has detonated the fleet and everything it stands for, leaving our world in a state of crisis. With a personal score to settle, Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture a one-man weapon of mass destruction . His behavior compromises a mission and turning back to his mentor Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood) , Kirk is demoted . But when an evil force led by Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch , though Mickey Rourke was considered for the role of Khan Noonien Singh) attacks Starfleet HQ and Admiral Pike in the process, Kirk along with his crew (Zachary Quinto : Spock , Zoe Saldana : Uhura , Karl Urban : Bones , Simon Pegg : Scotty , John Cho : Sulu , Anton Yelchin : Chekov and newcomer Alice Eva : Carol) takes command and takes the Enterprise deep into the ""forbidden zone"" and the Klingon (they were given a new look for the film) homeworld . Our heroes find an unstoppable force of terror from within their own organization and go out to capture a one-man weapon of mass destruction .This epic story is concentrated on characters as well as thrill-packed action and special effects although there're numerous of that too . The movie has thrills , tension , emotion, suspense and sensational spacial scenarios like is customary development of the franchise . Spectacular, exciting , fast-paced , thrilling this is the description of this new outing of Star Trek , film that reinvents the saga through a perfect pulse narrative that does not give a second of rest to the spectator who is trapped for two hours approx. in a genuine visual spectacle . Idealism ,humor , humanity , several agreeable characters and trademark effects abound and will please the enthusiasts such as the neophyte . As our heroes are propelled into an epic chess game of life and death, love will be challenged, friendships will be torn apart, and sacrifices must be made for the only family Kirk has left: his crew. The nice acting convinces , especially the avenger Benedict Cumberbatch in a super-villain role , Zachary Quinto, and the sympathetic Simon Pegg , while other players also make a fine work . And of course , special appearance of Leonard Nimoy in an emotive and enjoyable intervention. Stirring final amazing the spectator , in which the moving and spectacular scenes create a perfect union that terminates with an ending that leaves you stuck in the armchair facing the formidable spectacle as a privileged witness . Interesting screenplay , as screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman explained that the dilemma for the sequel was whether to pit the crew against another villain like in Star Trek (2009), or to have an ""exploration sci-fi plot where the unknown and nature itself is somehow an adversary"", like on Star Trek , the original series (1966).Breathtaking soundtrack by Michael Giacchino , he composes an impressive musical accompaniment to the film . This marks the first time a Star Trek film has shot outside the United States, with shooting in Iceland for special effects sequences. Furthermore , a colorful and evocative cinematography by Daniel Mindel . Paramount Pictures requested that director J.J. Abrams make the film in 3D ; however, Abrams wanted to shoot the two-dimensionally on film using IMAX cameras ; the two compromised, making this the first feature film to be shot in IMAX and converted to 3D in post-production . Suitable for family viewing , it's an entertaining adventure which young and old men will enjoy . Fans of the series will find very amusing and fun . It is fun to watch and Trekkies are sure to love it , resulting to be one of the best science-fiction sequels of all time and the highest grossing film of all the Star Trek movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Space Voyage filled with Mind-Blowing Visual Effects & GREAT Acting!,"STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS is the sequel to 2009's STAR TREK, directed by J.J. Abrams, starring Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana & Simon Pegg.The film shows Kirk (Chris Pine) as Captain of Star Fleet, and how he deals with mass terrorism caused by Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch) who has killed people as well as his closest relatives, along with Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto).The trailer of Star Trek: Into Darkness was extremely impressive; it didn't reveal any of the plot and kept the element of surprise for many, which was greatly appreciated. The movie provided everything anyone expects from a sci-fi flick- action, suspense, thrills and emotion, and J.J. Abrams has managed to show this in extreme finesse surrounded with spectacular visual effects.Note to anyone who wants to watch this- STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS can be watched by anyone; whether Star Trek fan or not. Neither do you have to see the first film to understand anything, as Into Darkness manages to start off a fresh page after Kirk is made Captain.The acting is GREAT. Chris Pine as Captain Kirk is always fun to watch. I loved Zachary Quinto as Spock; he managed to do it in his robotic way as usual Star Trek fans would expect. His role as a robotic, smart, law- abiding person paired with a care-free, large-hearted person (Kirk) proved to be a good friendship when played by Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. Zoe Saldana didn't offer anything SPECTACULAR, however, she did do a good job.Benedict Cumberbatch is becoming an even better actor with every role he does. He, first, had his break-through in Sherlock and has managed to probe he is much better after Star Trek: Into Darkness. His role as a villain is flawless; he is managed to show that shrewd, threatening person that Khan is. He has even managed to show his audience the combat skills he has. Other than Spock, Cumberbatch is one of the best things of this movie.Overall, I would say that STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS is a GREAT way to start off the summer holidays. It's got all the elements for a summer sci-flick and it manages to deliver. The only thing that keeps it short from getting a full 10 is the fact that after a few hours, you quite forget a bit of the film, but upon viewing it again, it remains sharp in your memory; the visual effects and acting fails to leave you.STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS- 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Cooler in every Aspect,"As a non Star Trek fan, i might say i found the film staying as far as possible from that universe, without spoiling all the joy to the followers.J.J. Abrams has a way of doing this and i'm sure he'll do it again with Star Wars, although it is a little strange for one person to be doing probably the most iconic sci-fi movies for two of the most devoted fractions of fan groups, despite the fact they don't like each other-the hardcore fans especially-not one bit.So, on with the film-i must confess i found the first film to be nothing special.Yes, some special effects thrown into it were indeed, spectacular, but the story itself was quite linear and straightforward.No intensity, no tension, only technicalities and quite the strange unit to be honest.It definitely had more for the fans, since it was basically an origins story, and that bugged me as well, because all i wanted was action, clever twists, some wit in the mix, and last, but not least-a great villain (which, albeit an A-lister, Eric Bana sadly isn't).But for god's sake-Benedict Cumberbatch is!The story was quite interesting, more than the first time for sure, some clever writing was involved and finally we get to see Kirk (Pine) and Spock (Quinto) actually act, you know-with real emotions and tears in their eyes.This time the action was more and even more impressive, some of the scenes were real space opera, a poetry of Kubrickan proportions.The tie-ins, as one friend, who's quite the Trekkie said, were quite a few, but this time around more delicately added and that also put a smile on my face.I recommend it to everyone and anyone who loves a good space adventure, even if he/she is not a fan of the series-because of that sole reason alone.Now, the script is more elaborate, more twists are involved and, ahem, John Harrison (Cumberbatch) is probably the best written villain of recent memory.Worthy of a mention are his scene-stealing appearances on the Enterprise as he was locked on the ship.Sherlock just makes acting look a child's play.The film itself is darker as promised, and i will see it again, because so much is happening at once, because it has it's flaws (everyone are superhuman, for instance, jumping back and forth through outer space looks like i can do it tied-handed and blindfolded).But it's moral dilemmas are overwhelming, and some moments are, in that respect, quite unforgettable and special.And for a film who wants to achieve much, greatness even, i believe this is the most important part indeed.It is a)-special, b)- harder to forget and c)just look at Cumberbatch, seriously, look at him.They say good actors are those, who can stay stone cold in one scene, and weep in the next-but he does both things.At once.In a single shot.And also i cannot say i remember anything from Kirk and Spock's first outing back in 2009.Only the technicalities on their ship pre-flight, the multinational flight squad, Anton Yelchin speaking weird (he does it again, but not as irritating) and some scene with a giant fire ray coming over from a planet (which i think , no disrespect, was destroyed- it even might've been Spock's planet, but it made no difference whatsoever, because i was not feeling it, because they were not feeling it).That's all can remember.But now they do, it all looks better emotional-wise and i'm grateful to all of the cast for that.Because of that, this time around, i won't be having the trouble remembering at all!An almost great, independent (from the old-school Star Trek universe) and original film.My rate 8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Star Trek: Into Darkness: Live Long and Resurrect,"It was a couple of years back when director J.J Abrams assumed the burden of creating an entirely renewed and fresh Star Trek. The result was a reboot: Star Trek (2009) was set in an alternate reality, and essentially featured the same characters from 'Gene Roddenberry's original series performed by a newly established cast. After three years, we finally get to see more adventures from the crew of the Enterprise, but the question arises: has Abrams managed to live up to the expectations generated by the first installment, or has he led his legacy into darkness?We quickly reconnect with the characters doing a 'suicide mission' on a vivid planet, inhabited by aliens, with only a couple of minutes to neutralize an active volcano. After a hell of an intro, we jump to Earth just to learn that Kirk had been demoted, and his former mentor, Admiral Pike, assumed control of the Enterprise. It's doesn't take much until he regains his rank, as a rogue Starfleet commander, John Harrison, executes a bombing in Section 31, a defense organization in London. Now it's up to Kirk and his fellow crew to face and stop the menace.The confrontation of the evil happens many times: in space, on a Klingon planet, at the Starfleet Command, on the streets of London. Thanks to this we can truly understand the sense of danger and peril caused by the villain. Although battles scenes mostly consist gunfights, spaceship battles and hand-to-hand combat, there are plenty of chase scenes well beyond the realms of plausibility. Many of these are accompanied by mind-blowing visuals and scenery. The vast, colorful planet from the intro looks absolutely amazing, but so does the wastelands of Kronos (Klingon planet), and the futuristic London. The soundtrack shouldn't go unnoticed, as it's a huge pillar of the movie's structure. The epic orchestral music always kicks in at the right time: mostly at huge clashes and chase parts. Old notes intertwined with new sounds eventuate something really goosebump-worthy and awe-inspiring. It sent a shiver down my spine when the Enterprise emerged from the sea for the first time.Into Darkness never ceased to amaze me, although on a bigger note it's no revolutionary either. As much as I wanted to like the story, I would rather list it as a weakness of the film. Planet exploration, philosophical questions, alien interactions are all sacrificed for the sake of the action and the explosions. It, in fact, reminded me a lot more of Mass Effect than Star Trek mostly because of that.To be fair, it's not always action. Although it's a pretty lighthearted movie, the plot deals with a lot of emotions such as developing relationships, or caring for lost ones. Thankfully the chemistry between the characters (primarily Spock and Kirk) works, and is pulled off by many talented actors. What really stood out for me was the exceptional performance of Benedict Cumberbatch for portraying such an iconic character. Admittedly the crew of Enterprise did a great job in their respective roles, Kirk reminded me a lot more of Capt. Archer than (previous, William Shatner) Kirk, which doesn't necessarily counts as a shortcoming.All things considered though, Star Trek: Into Darkness is everything that a summer blockbuster should be, or possibly more than that. With JJ Abrams on the deck, I truly believe that the new Star Wars is going to deliver.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Less cerebral than most but with strong action scenes,"Though it lacks the profundity and depth traditionally associated with the brand, ""Star Trek: Into Darkness,"" the twelfth installment in the movie series, has enough rip-roaring adventure and jaw-dropping visual effects to make it a satisfying experience for the action-oriented moviegoer.In this sequel to the prequel that successfully re-booted the series in 2009 (both directed by J.J. Abrams), some initially unknown terrorist (Benedict Cumberbatch) has begun targeting the leaders of Starfleet, and it is up to the Enterprise and her crew to root him out of his hiding place deep inside enemy Klingon territory.Thanks to the screenplay by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof, there's the same spirited verbal jousting between Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto) over the issue of feelings-vs.-rationality that's been going on for decades now, along with a bit of a discussion about the needs of the individual vs. the greater good, as well as about whether the Enterprise should become involved with military conflict instead of just space exploration. But, for the most part, this is a straight-ahead action movie and, as such, it unquestionably delivers the goods. Indeed, there are some truly astonishing action scenes leading up to one through the skies of a 23rd Century San Francisco that has to be seen to be believed - even if believability is never really the prime factor in films of this type.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Stunning effects, pays tribute to the original","Where to begin? The easiest part: the effects are awesome (although the 3D leaves a lot to desire). Nice explosions and flashy lights.Also, it pays tribute to the original by developing the personalities of the characters to something that actually resembles ST:TOS. But then you also have some things that do not quite fit, because after all this is a reboot and not a remake (I will not forget that Vulcan is non-existent in this version). So, there are some awesome elements that made me say ""This, THIS is Star Trek"", followed by ""Damn, I have to take that back"", then again ""THIS is it... no, not THAT... YES... NO"".Mixed feelings, but left with an awesome experience.

The more things change...,"...the more they remain the same.Star Trek-Into Darkness is the Superman Returns of the franchise. While it'll get very few marks for originality considering that its plot is a smörgåsbord of episodes and movies past, the movie chugs along at a blistering pace and is riveting and thrilling to boot. It helps that the actors have internalized the quirks and mannerisms of their original namesakes. A great watch for Trekkies like me but I'm not sure how much a first time viewer will like it or even BELIEVE a certain ridiculous plot twist adapted from an earlier movie. (Seriously! Out of all the plot twists out there they had to choose the weakest one?)Come to think of it the movie pays homage to more than one movie starring the original crew - saying more will be giving it away.Nonetheless, J J Abrams manages to keep things interesting throughout and Benedict Cumberbatch owns the scene whenever he's on screen and makes an otherwise flimsy story work. The bromance between Quinto and Pine lends a much needed human (or is it Vulcan?) touch to the proceedings and prevents the film from degenerating into mindless action and set pieces. Too bad Abrams won't be returning for Episode 3 and will be concentrating on Episode 7 of another well known sci-fi movie series instead. Despite that, the franchise should live long and prosper if the new director builds on this movie and continues with the story arc. Despite its lack of originality it's still one of the better Star Trek movies to come out in recent times.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Nostalgic Ride,"At first glance, Star Trek Into Darkness looks like it's going to follow a recent trend that highlights its villain who is plotting an ultimate destruction and serve some deep and compelling villainy speeches. Though, Star Trek already did that with The Wrath of Khan and it seems like they are doing it again but with the tone of a modern pretentious blockbuster. Surprisingly, it's a promotional trick and we instead get the same magic of its predecessor. Star Trek Into Darkness is as exciting as the last film. It also takes a lot of references to one of the series' classics which manifests nostalgia. But for some reason, it troubles finding enough innovations for the ones who've already seen that movie. Despite of that, it's still one of the most enjoyable blockbuster you'll see this year.The 2009 film wasn't as smart as a Star Trek film would ask, but the real reason why it's so good is it has the heart of bringing everything back to life while using blockbuster elements. Noticeably, non-fans(or yet to be fans) of the series enjoyed it even more, mostly because it is more focused on the mainstream storytelling than science. It's easy to forgive that since it's just a re-introduction of its universe. Now in this sequel, they are trying to be actually Star Trek. The plot is basically like The Wrath of Khan but with bigger thrills and less Genesis. The film adds some clever ideas to the plot, but the result is barely innovating. Even though it's fun to point out the references, the film seems to be better when it shows something new.The overall experience is nostalgic to both versions of Star Trek. Other than the references, it never abandons its own tone. The journey is full of life and the characters possess genuine soul. The performances are slightly the same from the last film. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto however made the friendship between Kirk and Spock much compelling than before. Karl Urban provides more humanity to his Bones. Simon Pegg seems to mimic James Doohan this time but he still manages to play his own Scotty in some parts. As expected, Benedict Cumberbatch delivers his lines in an utterly terrifying way, makes his little dimensioned character a nerve shattering villain.J.J. Abrams made it a total cinematic ride. The entire journey is perfectly big, letting the audience feel the thrill throughout the experience. In an era of over CG-ed blockbusters, this is probably the rare one that has the most impressive looking special effects. The CGI looks convincing enough in many details, even if you're seeing it in high definition. The action aims more to the fun. Unlike most blockbusters, this one lets the momentum and the camera do the best work while the effects are nothing more than just a background.If Star Trek Into Darkness is not that fresh then it's nostalgic for recapturing the best moments of the 1982 film, but we still get to see some new ideas. The introduction of the film kind of summed it up, the very first sequence takes place in an intriguing Mayan-esque planet while Spock mentions one of his remarkable dialogues. If you can't be bothered by the similarities then it's a pure entertainment with real suspense. There is no denying how electrifying this sequel is. The scale looks grander than any recent ""big"" movie. It's amazing in craft and fortitude, and the characters are still a joy to watch. It's generally not perfect. There are potentials that didn't live up that much, but if you can get over it then it's absorbingly fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"While it somewhat misses its mark in areas that feel like retreads of prior films, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is still another strong win for J.J. Abram's rebooted series.","Since it's release just over six months ago, J.J. Abram's sequel ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" has been the subject of much debate, scrutiny and back-and-forth's between fans and film-goers. Despite enjoying a very strong critical reception and generally very positive fan reception, there are some who are very critical of the film's merits, themes, storyline and characters.Where do I fall in this debate? Somewhere in the crowd who quite liked the movie, yet also is open and understanding about the common fan complaints, and able to acknowledge that it's not a perfect sequel.This time around, the crew of the Enterprise is sent on a mission of revenge against renegade Starfleet Commander John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) after he murders Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood in a small but significant role) and repeatedly attacks Starfleet bases in several terrorist-like attacks. However, various revelations about the nature of the mission will force Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) to question not only who Harrison really is, but also if his Starfleet superiors are even on his side.This is a film of many, many strengths.For starters, the cast is unanimously magnificent. Newcomer Benedict Cumberbatch makes for one heck of a compelling villain, giving Harrison much mystery, emotion and a very threatening nature. He's a phenomena in the film, and is easily the biggest highlight. Other newcomers including Peter Weller and Alice Eve are also fantastic in their supporting roles.And the returning cast is an absolute blast. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto stand out as Kirk and Spock, our two leads who are the focus of the film. Karl Urban and Simon Pegg also give a nice balance in their slightly lighter-hearted roles of McCoy and Scotty. And John Cho, Zoe Saldana and Anton Yelchin round out the cast, giving admirable performances as Sulu, Uhura and Chekov, although in somewhat smaller roles than the prior film, as the main focus is predominately on Kirk, Spock and Harrison.Abram's visual direction, as in the first film, is a blast and a half. He's one of the only working directors today who has figured out how to properly use the ""shaky cam"" style of camera-work. And his design choices, choice in shot and composition, and visual storytelling are first-class. (Although I will join the crowd in saying his apparent fetish for lens-flares does get old.)The set and costume design is fabulous, and it really feels like an accurate depiction of the future. The effects are absolutely awe- inspiring, from several deep-space battles, to a great sequence where out heroes are forced to drift through space from one ship to another, it's all amazing. And the musical score by Michael Giacchino, as in the first film, is an emotional, memorable masterpiece of sound, and is one of the highlights.The slight problems in the film lay in the strong, but flawed script by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof. Now, I know they are popular guys to hate on due to their other projects, but I do feel these three are talented writers when they are working with good material. They also are (unfortunately) capable of mistakes. But I don't hate their work by any means, and I do think the script for ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is well-written, tightly paced and generally tells a very good story.However, there is a problem that is very hard to delve into without going into spoiler territory. So I will have to remain vague with this, as I don't like giving away spoilers in my reviews. And that is the fact that this film contains many callbacks and references to a famous ""Trek"" film from the original series. And in fact, it could be argued that this film is almost an unofficial remake of a certain ""Trek"" film from the classic series. And in that sense, this film does pale in comparison, and it unfortunately does negatively impact this film. There's simply no way to watch this without comparing it to this other ""Trek"" film, and it does lower the score of this one a little bit, as it comes off as more unoriginal, less polished and worse written as a result. Just as I may give an official remake a lower score than an original, this film just isn't as good as the original film it is obviously trying to emulate, and thus it deserves a lower score.Still, that fairly major complaint being said (and it is a major complaint, as it is a huge elephant in the room while watching this movie), this is still a fun, solid, well-made sequel to the 2009 reboot. And I do think it's easily well-worth checking out.I give ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" a good 7 out of 10. It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun, and is an admirable film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Even if you're not a huge Trekkie like me,you cant fail to be impressed with everything this film has to offer,from the storyline,the actors and the special effects.i am really looking forward to the next one now,whenever that maybe.if this film doesn't sweep the board at the next Oscars,there's something wrong!

Boldly Going Forth,"This film is highly recommended.Space...the final frontier. That's our destination and those nasty Klingons are at it again in J.J. Abrams' second installment of the Star Trek series. The Enterprise, with its easily recognized and beloved crew that includes the trustworthy Scotty (Simon Pegg), the seductive but smart Uhura (Zoe Saldana), and the flinty Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban), go to battle to keep the interplanetary peace in Star Trek: Into Darkness. Also on board are Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) with his forced Russian accent, and of course, their stoic and reckless captain, Jim Kirk (the handsome blue-eyed Chris Pine), and his half-man, half-Vulcan friend, Spock (the immeasurably entertaining Zachary Quinto). Added to the mix is Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), a perky blonde Starfleet crew member who just may become Kirk's love interest. All are center stage to chart the course to boldly go where no man has gone before.￼Written by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Damon Lindelof, Star Trek: Into Darkness follows the series' idealistic philosophy of racial tolerance and peaceful coexistence while adding more than enough big battles and galactic warfare to show off the film's excellent CGI big budget effects by Industrial Light and Magic. The well-crafted action sequences do go on a bit too long in parts, but one does need to catch their breathe between action set pieces.￼Without revealing too much of the plot, the Enterprise crew is out to capture a terrorist bomber named John Harrison this time around. Abrams rejuvenates the popular series by resurrecting the next generation of younger actors to fill in for those classic roles and flattery is the highest form of imitation in this case. All of the actors take their coveted roles seriously, with special kudos for this mission going to Pine, Quinto, and Pegg.￼The screenwriters wisely incorporate numerous battle scenes while still emphasizing the human drama aboard the Enterprise. The simplistic storyline is merely an outline to the barrage of CGI that enliven the film and set up the background for the characters' intimate relationships. Making this particular film so successful is again that tried-and true, if somewhat predictable, winning formula that continues to work for both the television series and the film franchise: the uneasy alliance between Spock and Kirk. Their on-going disagreements and bromance are the most engaging parts of the film as they bond together to fight against those evil forces intent with world annihilation. Evil in Star Trek: Into Darkness is chillingly represented by its villain, played the talented Benedict Cumberbatch. The actor brings with him an intensity and intelligence to his performance, which helps to elevate the level of intrigue and danger.￼Abrams choreographs the action well and has crafted a visually stunning film. The director vividly stages the action sequences with colorful imagery, various aerial shots, and wonderful perspectives to intensify the dramatic elements at play. Production values are all top notch. Stunning photography by Daniel Mindel, detailed set design by Scott Chambliss, and strong film editing from Maryann Brandon and Mary Jo Markey contribute to much of the film's success. The prosthetics and make-up heighten the film's overall impact as does the aforementioned special effects. Michael Giacchino pays fine homage to the theme music and other flourishes he uses to enhance the action on screen.Star Trek: Into Darkness takes its audience for a terrific fantasy ride. Sci-fi fans won't be disappointed and neither will the average moviegoer. With this second addition to their series, Abrams and his able crew continue to make this franchise live long and prosper. Mission accomplished. GRADE: A-ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: I saw the IMAX 3D version of the film. Well worth seeing in this format.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Good Spectator will review wisely,"At first, I planned to watch F&F6, but with no intention to discriminate it, after I saw both of trailer, It was Star Trek as my final choice. I knew I didn't make a mistake just in the second when the movie begin. It was epic from the start, and for me, this movie had them all : Action, Great Effects, Sadness, Tears, Humor, Friendship, and moreover, It's quite a bloodless movie among their genres. Even the bad guy didn't end like what I expected, and It didn't disappoint me at all. This movie secretly taught me that there's always forgiveness for any mistakes. I don't know what exactly happen between Khan and The Enterprise, is he really that evil or as my inner said that he's just a pitiable guy. But at last, I was so satisfied with this movie. And I said this movie was not racist at all. Even each person use a different dialect, but I saw them as the director just wanted to show us how diverse our world'language are, there's so much unique languages and dialects besides English. My rating really shown my satisfaction, and if you think that I'm too exaggerating, well then, I believe my own taste :) Soon catch it and you know whether I'm right or wrong.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Star Trek Into Darkness,"I'm not a trekkie, and my first Star Trek film is the reboot STAR TREK (2009, 7/10), as a momentous pioneer to boost a whole new generation to embrace a revamped Sci-Fi franchise, it did a decent job thanks to J.J. Abrams' cachet in the category and the recurring hyped-up references from the soap sensation THE BIG BANG THEORY.4 years later, the second installment finally arrives as a leviathan summer blockbuster as its predecessor, the Enterprise's new intergalactic adventure takes off with the entire crew members back under the J.J. Abrams' helm, this time holding the villain name tag is the red-hot Benedict Cumberbatch, sports a dashing windbreaker, frowns while practices his merciless slaughter, hardly a novel creation, but he does invigorate the tension by delivering his spiteful lines with Bardic cadence.Once again, the same bad-guy-(willingly)-being-caught-in-the-middle-of-the-film trope bears the importance as a game-changing twist, then after a spate of nifty but anticipated internal hazards and warp chase, the final battle returns to earth for a bland point-blank hand-to-hand combat.Most obtrusively, Kirk and Spock's bromance has been handily elevated into another Platonic level, the near-death confession scenes overtly suggests it will exist as an unerring theme in the whole running, it is embarrassing to see the almost zero chemistry between Spock and Uhura, even for a dispassionate Vulcan, the innuendo is quite palpable, only Kirk can melt Spock's cold- hearted veneer and illicit his human part of being dramatic, impulsive and vengeful. Sidekicks are the same old story, Simon Pegg is entrusted to assume as the saviors at least twice, apart from his usual levity to induce laughters. Newcomer Alice Eve offers a gratuitous bikini scene in the wink of an eye, which awkwardly belies the rashness to cater to the film's core ticket-or- DVD-buyers (geeky nerds mostly), which is a clumsy and paltry strategy.The visual effect has its glorious achievement in some section, but there is a dearth of awe- inspiring imagination to outdo the ruck of Hollywood tentpoles. Much appreciation should be impute to the polished editing and narrative pace, the film seldom slackens to a dull moment for viewers to think twice about its logical practicality of the deeds involved. If it is not entirely appealing to audiences from all strata, at the minimum, trekkies will not cold-shoulder it and most likely, it is a qualified sequel to spur the vitality for another Star Trek binge in the near future. But an apprehensive concern is that since J.J. Abrams has embarked on to reinstate the more preeminent STAR WARS brand, I sincerely hope a new director will bring a paradigm shift for its third venture, it should not perpetually be overshadowed as a spin-off or a cheaper version of the former (at least the characters are more interesting and dynamic), what's more, it is anything but cheap gauging by its production budget, it has everything to challenge the elephant in the room now!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Star Trek: Into Darkness -  Review from a Non-Trekkie :),"I appreciate J.J Abrams and his vision for the new Star Trek movies (and hopefully it will become a trilogy). I am not a Trekkie by any means, but J.J has shown me how to appreciate Star Trek and its' characters :)Into Darkness is probably one of the best sequels to any film I've ever seen. Most sequels are just money-makers and usually not that great, but Into Darkness (in my opinion) is just as good as 2009's Star Trek. And the addition of Benedict Cumberbatch was a genius move.My reasons: (without spoilers) Captain James. T Kirk begins to learn what it truly means to be a captain. He's still very young and arrogant and he thinks that the rules do not apply to him. As a captain, he must learn what it means to make mistakes and learn from them when luck can no longer assist him.Especially when revenge in involved. From both Kirk and the villain.This movie had me and my four friends (all Geek girls, mind you, with no boyfriends) on the edge of our seats the entire time. This film had the perfect combination of humor, action and drama that would honestly keep anyone - Trekkie or non-Trekkie - excited.I won't spoil too much, but I think that this movie is beyond enjoyable. I will definitely see it again and purchase the DVD when it comes out. I have already gone to see it twice and I want to go again. I applaud J.J Abrams for his vision for his Star Trek series and I hope for another sequel, making it a complete trilogy.Honestly, my opinion, stay away from critics and reviews, since they will ALWAYS have something negative to say about this movie. Of course Into Darkness is going to upset the Trekkies and they won't see it, because it's not ""accurate"".Forget about it. Go see the movie for yourself. It really is an amazing movie. I give Into Darkness 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Where no man has gone before...,"I'm not a Trekkie. I never have been, and I probably never will. But when I saw Star Trek, I knew this series was something special. This is the Dark Knight of the second Star Trek series. It not only builds on the enthusiasm and care that JJ Abrams provided, but builds on the possible dramatic tension that Stark Treck brings us. Abrams has gone where no man has gone before in the Star Trek series. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and everyone in the first one returns, and they give fine, enthusiastic performances. Karl Urban as Bones is one of the many highlights of the film. Another one is Benedict Cumberbatch. I have to admit, I saw this twist about his character coming, this twist will definitely please Trekkies, and non fans alike. It parallels Iron Man 3's but, it has the momentum to keep the film going, which is all I can ask for. The lens flare is still there, not nearly as obnoxious as last time. Abrams is definitely trying to make this a trademark. If you want to see a good summer flick, I would really, really recommend this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good, not great.","This movie starts out great. It looks great, has great music and has me hooked from the beginning. I have little knowledge of old Star Trek so everything was fresh in interesting for me. Then it began to become Deja Vu from the first Abrams Star Trek. The movie almost presents the exact same setup as the first at this point. I guess its the second act that lost me a little, as twists and turns are literally telegraphed to the viewer. Moments that are meant to be sincere are rendered pointless, when EVERYONE knows whats going to happen. Even with all the clichés I enjoyed the movie, just got bored near the end. I will watch it again but after one viewing i'll say above average movie. Very strong first half followed by weak second half. Also the crowd I was with loved every minute, so I am sure there is plenty for Trek fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A fantastic film,"J.J. Abrams Star Trek debut was a huge success and making a film of equal quality for the sequel is a task. But Abrams and company have brilliantly risen to the occasion with a intense, fun, and thrilling film with a story that brings to mind a post 9/11 atmosphere. Chris Pine, Zach Quinto and the rest of the cast are outstanding, breathing even more life into the already iconic characters they portray. Benedict Cumberbatch burns up the screen as the much debated villain, definitely a star making turn for the great British actor. The story is good, allowing the characters to develop and grow, and the story has a very deep emotional core. The film is in my opinion a little bit action heavy, but the sequences are brilliantly well done. Special effects are outstanding, matching the atmosphere that the story and actors set up.

Good but Slightly Lazy,"Whilst a good film and better than the orginal version in some concepts (Kahn is shudderingly good). I can't help but feel the writers got a bit lazy. Kind of rehashed the orginal story a bit and moved some things about, just didn't grip as much as the previous film.Whilst all of that is true, its still a good story, albeit a bit long. The effects and big screen lure pack a big punch, some of the jokes got a bit tiring and bones grated a bit more.Over all good, just lacking slightly, perhaps if I hadn't seen the first remake, I may have been more impressed",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A raucous adventure.,"After disobeying orders to save an endangered people, Kirk and his crew go after the mysterious and ruthless Khan.Non stop action, this film is huge fun, it starts off with action sequences, and that's the format the whole way through, it doesn't stand still for a second.Writing this, it's almost a decade old, and I'd say it's aged pretty well, the special effects still look very good, some impressive visuals. The music is pretty good too, loud, but not invasive. It's a film I've re-watched a couple of times.The acting, was terrific I thought, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are both terrific, huge credit as always to Benedict Cumberbatch, who is pretty great here.

"Excellent, beats the first","I am really enjoying the re-revival of cultural stuff from when I was a child of the 60's, particularly Star Trek and most of the Marvel movies. I have always felt a good Star Trek movie is pretty much equal parts characters, plot, dialogue and believable special effects. In the first run of six Star Trek movies - I don't consider Next Generation to be ""Star Trek"" - they got thinner on the plot as the movies went along (sort of like in the original TV series). In its second revival this one is actually better than the first. I think Pine has more range than Shatner as Kirk and also can show a vulnerable side, although for a 60's TV show Shatner's bluster was effective. I can't speak as highly for Quinto, but I don't think there's a man alive who can out-Spock Nimoy. Nimoy WAS Spock so that Quinto acts like Nimoy more than he acts like Spock, if that makes sense. That said, Quinto comes across as too accessible and almost effeminate. They need to show a tougher, quieter side of Spock next time around. No one would ever call Nimoy effeminate. Urban does much better as McCoy than in the last movie. Scotty does very well despite his visual difference from the original, Uhura and Sulu are fine also. This movie starts out a little slow and over-CGI'ed -- a common major problem with current films -- but picks up speed as it goes along. I like the references to the original Star Trek stories but of course they risk credibility each time they do that in terms of series to series continuity. Admiral Marcus could have been played by Robert Lansing but he's been gone for years. Very well done, keep 'em coming!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Technically Bigger. Emotionally Smaller.,"JJ Abrams delivered a neatly-woven prequelboot in 2009 which admirably established already iconic characters with a new perspective and vision. What worked for that movie was that it was a refreshing take on the franchise, and maintaining the old roots.Now he returns with a sequel, and as the case is with most of the sequels, they tend to be grander and bigger than its former instalment.Star Trek Into Darkness is grander and bigger (also grittier, because we live in a post-the Dark Knight world), but unfortunately, it is mostly in relation to the action and technicality instead of emotional investment. And that's kind of ironic considering Abrams' TED Talk, where he insists on emotional depth with technical grandeur for entertainers with a giant budget. I do think he was trying for that approach as it's apparent from the amount of confrontations and conversations between characters amidst all the chaos and boom-bang! The effort is evident, but it is too lazily done.The film starts off with a promise of intriguing mystery, but the final reveal falls short of the worthiness of build-up. This also gets me back to the Abrams TED Talk where he talks about 'the mystery box'–I won't go in depth of that talk, see the video for yourself–and he's right about 'the mystery box' being in every work of his–LOST, MI:3, Cloverfield. The advantage of this idea is that you have the audience already anticipating something groundbreaking. You have practically already made a promise that it is going to be awesome. And the key here is that the promise has to be delivered. That's exactly where this films falls short. We have this compelling mysterious figure terrorizing the Star Trek Universe, but when the curtains go up, the drums don't sound as loud as they did before. It's just as predictable as it gets, in some aspects, for the better, but mostly for the worse.It helps that it has Benedict Cumberbatch being all badass and menacing– savagely terrifying. His voice is so evil cold that it sends chills down the spine. It also helps that Simon Pegg's Scott has his own shining moments. It helps that despite of its predictability, there are a few surprises in the bag. It also helps that Abrams' Lens Flare fetish is in more control than ever before. But all of this gets drowned in the disappointing bigger picture. There were a few occurrences where Michael Giacchino's weeping violin score was suggesting me to be really moved by what was going on the screen, but I just wasn't. The characters just seemed distant from me. What's ironic is that the movie's most heavily emotional moment is downright unoriginal, and is in fact lazily lifted from one of the older movies in the franchise, possibly meant as a homage. Homages, I feel, should not be an excuse for building up a story that's been told before. They also shouldn't be shoved in the story just for the sake of fan-service. There are so many references in the movie (good ones, some of them) that it is nearly a remake.I would add that the movie is visually breathtaking. I would suggest to watch it in IMAX, if possible, since some parts of the movie are shot on actual IMAX cameras, and carry images with immersing resolution. I would also suggest to tone the expectations down. It's fun, but not exactly an improvement over the first one.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Start Trek Into darkness is well worth a watch,"First off,I will admit I am not a hard-core Trekkie.Still Start Trek is one of those mega blockbuster movies that you just don't miss.To those relatively new to this universe I strongly offer u the following advice: Before watching this movie,Watch the franchise in some form,either the previous movie or the TV Show to gain some familiarity with the world and the characters.What happened with me(and what should n't with you) was it took me a while to connect with the setting and the characters and by the time I did get into the groove the movie was almost over.Now for the review,I am still debating with myself if it was a great movie or not maybe chiefly because of the aforementioned point(definitely a good movie though).The cast does a superb job and for me could not have done more.Chris Pine as Captain Kirk is brilliant.Karl Urban as Dr.Bones,Simon Pegg as scotty and Zoe Saldana as Uhura are decent.I am a Zachary Quinto fan and I cannot imagine a better executed Spock-Stern,Rule abiding,Stoic yet endearing and innocent in a way.The one who walks away with all the glory though is Benedict Cumberbatch as theintriguing ,charismatic and manipulative Khan.The CGI is exceptional.There are two- three scenes,one where the enterprise takes off from the sea and another in the end where a ship crashes and obliterates many buildings that are awe-inspiring and will blow your mind.The plot and the dialogs are average.Do not bother about the 3-D, it is non-existent(I caught the movie in Imax).I cannot put a finger on it but the movie seems lacking in some aspects.If you are not a trekkie,the movie may not exactly be stupendous or put a smile on your face,but yea it is one of those movies that you want to be good,you want to enjoy,you hope to enjoy.I hope hardcore fans and others enjoyed it more than i did .Dont miss it,watch it and decide for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Too Many Fistfights but Enjoyable,"As with most my age (mid-sixties), I've been through them all. Every attempt to nuance the regiment of characters that have spanned the realizable galaxy that is the home of the Star Trek conglomerate. I am pleased that there is less self-caricature than previously, less smirking and lame attempt at humor. This is an admirable attempt at a really good adventure. One of the reviewers likened it to ""Raiders"" and its ilk. The problem for me is that while I was taken in once again by a pretty good adventure story with amazing special effects, when I left, I had nothing that stayed with me more than a few hours. One of the problems with the high-tech world and the incredible expense involved is that we slip back to the lowest common denominator, lest we lose a less hip audience. My contention is that we can have highly intelligent science fiction without catering strictly to the nerd element or comic book purists. That involves writing. That involves not having an incredibly complex set of circumstances resolved through a fistfight on some Harold Lloyd, moving girder set. I think the potential is there. How about stretching things a bit more. When ""The City on the Edge of Tomorrow"" appeared lo those many years ago, the arrogant wunderkind Harlan Ellison took the Trek people to a wonderful place by ""writing a really good script."" Since Hollywood can do things it never could before, how about tapping into it and doing something incredible. I thought that our refugee from Sherlock Holmes had a great sinister quality that should have been embraced. So much for that. He is pretty much talk and pretty vulnerable.Again, I think this is well worth seeing, but I think that there is so much potential for something glorious.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very good,"Although JJ Abrams chose to throw Star Trek cannon out the window (wish he didn't but it's done) the story is fast paced and I liked it. The characters have good chemistry and it made me remember how it felt watching the banter between the crew in TOS. I agree that it would have been a better movie had it fit with the ST franchise but I am glad we have something Trek related. I gave it a 9 because I enjoyed the movie for what it was. I am looking forward to the next movie (which we be a long time coming unfortunately)! I will be seeing this one again tomorrow.By the way, Zach Quinto's Spock could be the original twin of Nimoys.

Boldly Going Where We've Been Before.,"""Star Trek Into Darkness"" (2013), directed by J. J. Abrams, is the second in the rejuvenated Star Trek franchise, following on from the similarly-directed Abrams 2009 entry ""Star Trek"". The decision to start afresh was a wise decision. Paramount Studios allows new audiences to become enticed with a series that was struggling under the weight of continuity and limp direction.However, if Abrams seemed like a gust of fresh air in 2009, in 2013 his approach has been disappointingly safe. Instead of striking out for new ways of dealing with Star Trek, he has here relied too much on the tried and tested. Even the exhilarating opening sequence that encompasses fantastic art direction and costume design is actually reminiscent of one of the opening action scenes from Steven Spielberg's ""Indiana Jones"" series. The cinematography too, by Dan Mindel is excellent, the primary colours of the planet and the multitudes of flashing lights in the otherwise stark interior of the U.S.S. Enterprise stands out beautifully. The striking reds and whites of the opening sequence also help make this one of the best looking major studio films of the year so far.Yet Abrams handling of characterisation and dialogue is as assured as ever, revealing his training in American television. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto as Captain James T. Kirk and Commander Spock respectively, enjoy an easy chemistry and banter that the rest of the crew, including Simon Pegg as Scotty and Karl Urban as Bones share. It is these character moments, chiefly in the first half of the film, that are the true highlights. Yet the film, like many other Hollywood blockbusters, is scared to be character-led, and opts for a generic revenge plot that tires itself with actions scenes that quickly lose their vitality and excitement.Still, Peter Weller is very good in an underwritten role, as is rising star Benedict Cumberbatch as Harrison.The main problem then, is the script, written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof. Not the dialogue, which builds an engaging repartee, but the plot. Action films build towards a climax through constant reversals of fortunes for the protagonists, but here it is all deplorably linear, subplots done away with presumably by the logic it would complicate the film too much. The opposite effect instead occurring: it becomes very simple and straightforward, there being only one genuinely unexpected revelation, which is too little for a movie over two hours long.Still, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is entertaining, and made with a great deal of professionalism, in particular the special effects by Industrial Light and Magic, and is consistently well-acted and directed. It is just the recurring problem of today's mainstream Hollywood films that most refuse to take chances.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Wonderful Star Trek movie that any fan, old or new, should watch!","I felt the need to write an honest (spoiler-free) review for this movie as I see a lot of hate for it. I'm a fan of yesterdays Trek; Shater/Nimoy, Picard, Voyager, DS9, Enterprise I absolutely love the old Star Trek universe. Coming into the first film in 2009 I was very open minded about it as I am a true Star Trek fan (I even went to my first convention this year in Philadelphia) and will watch the films regardless of them replacing the original actors. Although the 2009 film was a pretty good film and I agreed with the new cast, it did not satisfy my liking in rebooting the franchise. I wasn't crazy about the storyline and overall the film just fell a bit short of what I thought it should have been. Despite the negatives, I still enjoyed the 2009 film. With that being said, I absolutely had to see the sequel ""Into Darkness"". Today I went on to the U.S. release of ST:ID. I have to say, the entire movie was extremely engaging from beginning to end! There is not one second where I ever sat back and was disgusted or bored with any part of the movie. J.J. Abrams stepped up his game and delivered a true Star Trek movie this time around that should please fans both old and new!ST:ID takes place in the near future after the events of the 2009 film. Captain Kirk is now commanding the Enterprise and adventuring when a new enemy threatens the entire existence of Starfleet Command. I have to say as a fan there is not enough good things I can say about this film. The storyline, characters, even the sound effects on the bridge, it pays great homage to the Star Trek of yesterday while still being a fresh, new film. From beginning to end, we see plenty of Star Trek goodness. Lot's of starfleet command, meetings with admirals, a scene where a tribble is involved in some medical experiments, and even a very awesome scene where we see models of the first warp-capable ship from ""Star Trek: First Contact"" and the NX- 01 Enterprise from ""Star Trek Enterprise"" (a wonderful Easter egg/cameo for any real Star Trek fan). Also, not a spoiler, but we get a brief scene with the legendary one and only Leonard Nimoy reprising his role as Spock again! Lastly we see some other nice background stories finally started/told as well, like Carol Marcus, Kirks former lover from ""The Wrath of Khan"".One thing I absolutely loved about this film was the fact that it is going back to the ""story telling"" roots of Star Trek. This movie has almost the perfect blend of stunning CGI while still having those classic one on one conversations between characters. J.J. Abrams camera work was also much better. Less moving/wobbling camera effects, less off-centered camera angles, and dare I say... much less lens flares! The villain was also much better this time. Instead of a ridiculous looking, angry, tattooed Romulan (that I have sadly say poorly tied in with the Star Trek universe), we get a very sinister, mysterious, and menacing villain. Without spoiling the movie I will say old school Star Trek fans will be pleased to know who he is! This is easily in the top two best Star Trek films of all time. One of the very few, very minor pet peeves I had with this film which is why I didn't give it a 10 star rating is this. Mr. Scott and Chekov (among others) had relatively awkward/strange roles in the film that I won't spoil. To put it in other words, there was just a very strange balance of on-screen time for characters at times which is why I docked one star from this review. My second main reason is, although the story was good, I think it borrowed just a bit too much from another classic Star Trek movie who's name I will not say. These minor pet peeves of mine, however, are very small and easily tolerated. The rest of the film was excellent and definitely worth the price of admission.Overall this was an excellent Star Trek film. Whether you are a newcomer to Star Trek, an old schooler, or something in between, I think this movie has something to make everyone happy. Without getting into details, many old school fans who claim they are ""true fans"" of ST bash this movie greatly. I will say as a fan myself there is absolutely nothing wrong with J.J. Abrams, the new Star Trek universe, or any other parts of it. This is a great film and if you give the new cast a chance and sit back and enjoy the film, I promise you will like it!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Star Trek Into Darkness: Movie Review,"Inundated with aesthetically breath-taking visuals, bolstered with a clever narrative though bordering on the convoluted, ameliorated by an inspired take on an iconic Starfleet adversary, and seasoned with a measure of treachery, deceit and duplicity, Star Trek Into Darkness is blockbuster entertainment on the grandest scale. Undaunted by the runaway success of its predecessor, it boldly sores into the stratosphere as a revitalized intergalactic colossus transcending the modern day science fiction genre. On its Vulcan side, Star Trek Into Darkness is an intelligently scripted, sophisticated and shrewd specimen. On its human side it is frequently tempestuous, regularly humorous and every so often affectionate, it spectacles the conflict of human emotions in the most turbulent of times. Furthermore, beset with nostalgia soaked token nods and references to Star Trek's of old, teeming with witty dialogue, and awash with exhilarating action, J.J. Abrams' second enterprising effort in the celebrated series has plenty to satisfy obstinate Trekkies and casual moviegoers alike.Star Trek Into Darkness is a science fiction action-adventure movie co-produced and directed by J.J. Abrams. It is the twelfth feature-length film entry in the Star Trek franchise and the sequel to Abrams' 2009 Star Trek reboot, based on the Star Trek science fiction entertainment franchise created and established by Gene Roddenberry in the mid-1960s. It commences with the U.S.S. Enterprise and its plucky crew whose exploratory voyage has steered them in the direction of a primitive civilization on the fictional-Class M planet Nibiru. When Starfleet's General Order number 1, the Prime Directive is infringed the impetuous yet cunning Captain James T. Kirk is summoned back to Earth where he is reduced in rank from captain to first officer under Admiral Christopher Pike's command who reoccupies control of the Enterprise. Simultaneously, an unrelenting and inexorable former Starfleet Commander, Jon Harrison has instigated and launched an attack on a top-secret Starfleet installation on Earth. When Starfleet's high-ranking officers' lives are put in jeopardy at the hands of Harrison, Kirk with personal retribution on his agenda re-assumes captaincy of the Enterprise, and he and his crew embark on a mission of vengeance behind enemy lines to seize a supposed former comrade who's appetite for devastation knows no bounds. As the Enterprise and its crew are catapulted into darkness at warp speed, it soon becomes apparent that everything is not as it seems; a far-reaching web of deceit and duplicity is untangled leading to an epic showdown where allegiances will be brought into question and sacrifices will have to be made.Reprising his role from Abrams' 2009 Star Trek is Chris Pine, who uniform to his previous outing provides a stellar performance as James T. Kirk, the courageous, self-assured captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise renowned for his many female exploits and his end justifies the means view on Starfleet orders. His portrayal of the fabled Captain Kirk is akin to that of William Shatner in his finest hour. Also reprising his role from Star Trek Into Darkness' predecessor is Zachary Quinto as Kirk's notorious cohort aboard the Enterprise, the unyielding, super-intelligent half-Vulcan half-human Spock. Quintos' portrayal of Spock is exemplary, markedly and strikingly similar to that of Leonard Nimoy, the original Mister Spock otherwise known as Spock Prime. His ""unintentionally"" condescending normative judgement afforded for any of Kirk's dubious commands and his golden lecture like recitals of Starfleet directive are first-class. In consort with his razor-sharp retorts packed full of wit and his exemplification of emotional discovery, Quinto provides the movies stand-out performance amongst other remarkable character interpretations including that provided by Benedict Cumberbatch who plays the films main antagonist, the malevolent and genetically advanced former Starfleet Commander Jon Harrison. Cumberbatch is suitably menacing and articulates Harrison's dialogue in an especially chilling manner. In addition to this, his animated facial expressions and piercing stares mould an ominous character that translates on-screen to a believable and genuine threat to Starfleet and to the Enterprise. Karl Urban returning as Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy with his cranky nostalgic wisecracks and gags is great, and Zoe Saldana reprising her character of Uhura is particularly good in her intimate scenes with Quinto/Spock, which divulge the plights in their strained relationship.From calamitous ruin to a triumphant rebirth, Abrams' second Trek sees the U.S.S. Enterprise experience a multitude of extremities, with the Enterprise and its exuberant crew looking as elegant as ever upon its full revival. Both of Abrams' entries in the formidable franchise are highly commendable and praiseworthy, but his latter effort with more nail-biting uncertainty and a splendidly unnerving villain slightly edges it. Star Trek Into Darkness and its precursor may be treading old ground, but it is doing it boldly. I have no reservation in saying that in the hands of J.J. Abrams, the Star Trek franchise will continue to live long and prosper. Dammit, Jim! I'm a doctor, not a fortune-teller.Full review available at: http://thetoddsmoviereviewblog.blogspot.co.uk",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Glitzy, fancy, unoriginal, pompous","ST:ID is NOT a SCI-FI movie. Its a popcorn action movie. This is incredibly difficult to understand because Abbrams took a franchise known for being allegory to our society (racism, communism, democracy), full of lessons on morals and self discovery, and turned it into ""die hard in space"". It is exactly what Star Wars EP1 was for the old series.This is a completely different movie than what you probably expect or saw in trailers. I honestly don't know why I'm giving a 6 and not lower:* Hundreds of scenes have distracting over bright effect - very distracting when trying to pay attention to dialogue.* Nothing special about dialogue or characters... unlike the old movies, you do not get a sense the crew are all comrades who have been through a lot.* ADD sufferers you're in luck - most of the scenes are so jam packed with dozens of extras and shiny machinery, its difficult to tell what's going on.* Cowboys. Not the future. Movie is full of tech contradictions. You got phasers and teleporters but can't use them - instead lots of running and punching. Its all strange and out of place.* Star Fleet is the Navy? Forgetting for a moment how absurd it is that the WHOLE crew is 20 yr olds. Even today's armed forces don't sent out warships with 70 cruise missiles to kill a terrorist.. not even for Bid Laden.* The movie is completely unoriginal. Its famous scenes from movies 1-5 in a blender. I would not have been surprised if whales showed up. If you like a movie that repeats dialogue from older movies than all the power to you.In conclusion, ST:ID is out of place today or any day. Should have made a completely new franchise - something along lines of DS9. This special effects extravaganza completely lacks any sci-fi, philosophy and crew comradery the franchise is known for. In some ways its so absurd I thought I was watching a ""Scary Movie"".",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Liked it a lot!,"I've seen every TV episode and movie that's been made from the Star Trek universe. I love the original series and movies for what they are. They're great fun, and they really explore the characters and their interactions.I saw the new Star Trek last night and whereas it might have not had the same level of character development, I really enjoyed it.Without giving away too much, I like the shout outs to the old movies through the dialogue and the characters introduced. The one thing people seem to be hammering this movie for, is the rehashing of existing characters or story lines. I, unlike these so called ""purists"" choose to look at this not as ripping off of old ideas, but instead as this:With the 2009 Star Trek, we were introduced to a new time line, in an alternate reality. This now gives the writers and producers the opportunity to do basically whatever they want. By reintroducing some of the same characters and trials, they show that even in alternate realities, some things are still inevitable. I didn't look at this movie and think, oh they're just ripping off ideas from the originals... I thought, wow so this was meant to be.If you can go into this movie with an open mind, you will probably love it. If you think Star Trek peaked in the 1980s... Save your money, and spare us your negative reviews.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Little Too Derivative,"I liked the movie, but would have liked it even more if it wasn't retelling a story we'd already seen—especially one that is considered, by many, to be the best of the original Star Trek films. (And then there was that one scene, albeit ""flipped,"" that was taken directly out of the original film. It made me wince.) However, the cast was great, including the ""guest"" stars, and they were all given some good scenes (except maybe Chekov and Sulu, who got short shrift this time out). What's more, the Klingons stayed off the cutting room floor, and there was plenty of action to go around, so there is a lot to be enjoyed, here. Still, I'm looking forward to something new and original in the next movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
To boldly go where no movie goer has gone before!,"For all the Star Trek fans, the sequel to the 2009 hit has come! Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock(Zachary Quinto), Ulhura (Zoe Saldana), and the rest of crew have come back to tackle another threat that has come to mind. The ever maverick Kirk, goes to a foreign planet that is so primitive, he lets his crew get discovered. That violation gets him demoted and sent to Starfleet. But a bombing in London gets him back to the Enterprise after the terrorist kills Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood). The terrorist is Commander John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who is later known as Khan! Khan is a superhuman being who is genetically enhanced to withstand the harsh atmostsphere was released by Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller, ""RoboCop"") who is responsible for the mess. His daughter Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) who helped out Kirk and the Enterprise crew. The photon torpedo that Dr. Marcus and McCoy find didn't have special ammunition, but are used to hold the cryonically placed beings of Khan's people. And the rogue Admiral was responsible for this. Kirk and Spock have been put through the test, and they have return the favors from each mission. Very logical to say the least. This movie was high impact, high quality, and high action. Got to see what the Klingons look like in this version. And it kind of close to the 1980's version of Part II & Part III. This is a real improvement from the first one. It's a must see, 5 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
First movie in years to enthrall me!,"Keeping it brief, this movie is excellent, especially if your a Trekkie fan and also if your not.The actors cast in their perspective roles are none less than perfect( although Scotty does fall a tad short). It is a movie full of action, but also believable characters, true to the original series of the 60's and 70's.JJ, has caught the bond between Spock, Bones, Kirk, Scotty and the rest, from their mannerisms, to the quips and banter between all, great one liners and snaps, but that was what existed between the original cast, well executed Best movie of the franchise so far, Abrams delivers when he wants to and this time he does, my hat goes off to you sir, well done movie, well executed, well written, Hollywood in there but not overpowering, all in all, thanks for a good movie.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best film of 2013 so far,"¨You think your world is safe? It is an illusion. A comforting lie to protect you. Enjoy these final moments of peace. For I have returned to have my vengeance.¨First off I have to say that I loved J.J. Abrams' reboot of the Star Trek franchise in 2009 and I was highly anticipating this sequel. I had my reservations of whether or not Abrams was going to be able to maintain the same level of success he achieved with the prequel since the originality and freshness of the characters was going to be gone. It is much easier to reboot a known franchise and make it fresh with the introduction of new characters and letting us know how everything began (sort of like what Batman Begins did), but it is much more difficult to make a worthy sequel to such a beloved prequel. Somehow I think Abrams managed to pull it off once again by introducing a great villain and maintaining the freshness of the original film with some great chemistry between Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto along with the rest of the crew. At many points during the movie it even felt like a buddy comedy instead of a blockbuster sci-fi action film, but then Abrams managed to mix it all together quite nicely. It may be much lighter than The Dark Knight, but I felt he did something similar to what Christopher Nolan did with his trilogy by giving us a great villain and giving the movie several layers. This sequel may even be better than the prequel although many people may disagree with me. At least I think Abrams was able to maintain the same level of entertainment once again. This is a very fun and engaging movie with some great characters and spectacular visuals. This is the best film I've seen this year and by far the most entertaining one. I was never a big fan of the Star Trek TV series or the original movies, but I was completely hooked with the reboot and Abrams once again teams up with screenwriters: Damon Lindelof, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci to give us a gripping script with some great twists that Trekkies will probably enjoy. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but if you've seen the film you know what I'm talking about. Star Trek into Darkness is the most fun I've had in theaters this year.The movie takes place one year after the events of the prequel as we follow the crew from the USS Enterprise and their Captain, Kirk (Chris Pine), as they encounter new missions into foreign galaxies. In their latest mission they are trying to save a civilization from a volcano eruption without them knowing of their presence. Kirk and his First Commander, Spock (Zachary Quinto), manage to save the planet, but Kirk does so by breaking some rules. This doesn't go well with Spock who despite being saved doesn't agree with breaking protocol. When they arrive back to Earth, Spock informs their bosses and Kirk is discharged from the fleet. While this is taking place a former member of Starfleet, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), bombs an installation in London and later attacks a high ranking officers meeting at the Starfleet headquarters before managing to escape. Pike (Bruce Greenwood) is killed during this incident and Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) reinstates Kirk as Captain of the Enterprise in order for him to hunt down the terrorist. And so the new mission begins with Kirk and Spock back together again with the rest of their crew: Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Bones (Karl Urban), Scotty (Simon Pegg), Sulu (John Cho), and Chekov (Anton Yelchin), all looking for revenge.The relationship between Quinto and Pine's character was probably the highlight in the prequel, and here once again we get to see how their relation has developed over time. The scenes they share together are really entertaining, but the supporting cast is exceptional once again with Simon Pegg and Karl Urban giving the funniest performances and lightening up the mood. Cumberbatch makes for one of the best villains I 've seen this year and his performance is incredible. The twist with his character is really clever and it made me want to go back and watch the original films. The film is so good because it focuses on the characters and their relationships more than on the action and visuals, which are incredible nonetheless. I really look forward to what JJ Abrams and his crew are going to bring to the table in the Star Wars franchise because what they have done here was spectacular by combing comedy and sci-fi action. I am a huge fan of pretty much everything Abrams has done, ranging from what he did with the Lost series to his latest film prior to this one: Super 8. It will be very hard for another summer blockbuster movie to top this one this year. It has really raised the standard and the bar for the upcoming movies. Please go watch this film, you won't regret it.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Benedict CumberBOSS,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a superior sequel in every way compared to its 2009 predecessor. J. J. Abrams' second effort in the franchise travels galaxies further in action, characters and overall storytelling which makes the sequel overall, indisputably an enjoyable experience.Cats would be all over my tongue if I attempted to approach Star Trek Into Darkness from the perspective of a Trek fan due to my unfamiliarity with the Star Trek universe that fans hold dear. Rather, this 2013 instalment is a much more approachable story than Star Trek (2009), and this mass appeal may discourage some loyal fans to the series, though I am unable to confirm such a claim. What I can say is that the film simply entertains and certainly makes Paramount's profuse marketing worth the effort. Even more so than the lavish yet appropriate CG effects, the character interactions emerge victorious in the quest for cinematic supremacy. The experience is only heightened by the trekmendous cast, particularly Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto andBenedict Cumberbatch (Yes, he is that good he deserves his own paragraph). The Sherlock actor absolutely dominates each and every second of screen time through voice, actions, persona and the intentions of his character John Harrison. He is so spectacularly, ostentatiously gracious is where he takes the character, and that destination will almost undoubtedly flourish over time, into one of the most memorable motion picture villains of the early 21st century. Each time his scenes conclude or the camera cuts away from him, inside you feel a little disappointed ""ohhh, ahhh"" hoping for his return soon due to Cumberbatch's franchise-defining performance. If you fail to take much away from Star Trek Into Darkness, I can almost assure you that the iconic, villainous portrayal by Cumberbatch will be imprinted into your mind for a long time to come.While Cumberbatch's performance remains isolated from the film's other elements in its magnificence, the interdependent relationship between James. T Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) prospers so greatly as their relationship develops, and feels more genuine than their previous collaboration four years ago. They share such a magical dialogue between one another, filled with wit, rhythm and even emotional chemistry, which is most explicitly examined during the unexpectedly heartfelt climax of the film. The writers (Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof) warrant an enormous amount of credit for displaying how films that are primarily action based, can in fact posses scenes of characters verbally interacting with one another and still remain as strong blockbuster fun.Of course, Star Trek Into Darkness wouldn't achieve its blockbuster status by having its array of adored characters talking for two hours. No, the film requires an enormous amount of visual effects in order to achieve its title, and fortunately, the action is actually quite remarkably enjoyable. Dazzling images of majestic terror, colourful settings and of course explosions captivate your gaze for 132 minutes as they make you feel you are drifting through space for the first time, surrounded by unknown sights to behold. All the while, Star Trek Into Darkness manages to stay on course and not allow itself to divert into overlong and frustrating routes of action.The film is certainly not without its conveniences to presumably satisfy its audience; though ironically by doing this it dissatisfies the viewer as the level of predictability increases throughout and the story's resolution irritatingly pounces on an opportunity to conclude itself 'happily' and keep the narrative self-contained. This is primarily frustrating due to the manner in which the film could have ended: as an emotionally investing, sacrificial and unpredictable satisfying film. Instead, the plot's direction puts the clutch into reverse and ends up going back on itself due to its level of predictability as equilibrium is restored.If you are able to forgive the film's weaker elements and preserve judgement for the highly enjoyable experience that surrounds the characters and action, then Star Trek Into Darkness is likely to fulfil everything that it has promised. Even if in six months the four words Star, Trek, Into and Darkness fail to mean anything to you, be warned that the wrath of Cumberbatch's prevailing performance will likely remain prevalent amongst the mind's of us cinema-goers when considering who the greatest cinematic villains of recent history are.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good follow up,"As a scfi fan quite excited to see this film I unfortunately left disappoint a little. JJ Abrams said this is a stand-alone film where the audience does not need to have seen prior Star Trek films to enjoy. This is true to a certain extent where you realise it references and reuses much Star Trek history. I thought this is a good and bad aspect of the film. The reason is because whilst it is unoriginal to a degree it enables old fans to be acknowledged and new fans to enjoy the film. Old fans might also see the crew, besides Kirk and Spock, have minimal screen time. I was also disappointed with this because they almost disappeared. However those who know the history of this franchise will enjoy it more because of these references to past star trek works.From the beginning of the film action occurs regularly and at varied scales. Any fan of action films will be awed by the large set piece sequences unfolding before them with satisfying SFX, great art designs, and sound. Visuals clearly are one of the strong aspects that most, including me, immediately are impressed by (especially the warp battle scene). Also seeing a futuristic Earth is great and I really wanted to see more of it than we did however what you do see is great.Acting from all was just fine. Not one line of dialogue was out of place.The story itself is good but as said earlier reuses and references too much Star Trek history to be praised for originality. I know this is an alternative universe where events only up to a certain point are changed but the reasons for everything that occurs is largely one persons imagination, i.e. we don't see events which generate the supposedly perpetuated fear. I believe that 'Into Darkness' is an incorrectly chosen title because there isn't much darkness in this film.In critiquing the story think the antagonist's action are too extreme for what he aims to achieve; he is experienced in war, has a calm demeanour, is methodical and is strategic. Somehow despite his motivations for his actions the collateral damage incurred doesn't fit. This makes no sense to me because we find out who his target is all along. If he is very skilled and capable then why kill so many others when one person is your target. Friends have said 'he is a complex bad guy' whereas my impression is his character doesn't match his actions.You shouldn't be surprised that with little screen time the crew of the Enterprise hardly develop as characters, except for Sulu, Kirk and Spock. They do get their screen time but we see no growth or change in the characters. Hence the crew become backdrops to transport Kirk and Spock around to have a swash-buckling adventure.If you are interested in seeing this film please do. You will be entertained and escape from reality for a few hours. Whilst you will have some enjoyment you might leave a little disappointed like I did. The reason is because the story reuses and references too much past material, the antagonist's character and actions are a mis-fit; and the Enterprise crew (besides Kirk and Spock) are minor characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Best watched in a forgiving mood,"I think I should explain my position towards the whole ""Star Trek"" franchise before getting into this film. While I have (now) seen all the ST movies, I have actually seen very little of the various ST television shows. So I'm not quite an expert on ST. I have heard, however, that the TV shows were often cerebral to a degree, and I think that element is one thing that's missing with this particular ST movie. The movie often eschews a human element in order to bombard its audience with action and special effects. Now, the action AND the special effects are sometimes very good. But there are a number of times when something quite absurd and/or unbelievable happened that had me mentally groaning out loud at what I was witnessing. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see the movie. Let me state that despite these flaws, the movie isn't awful - it's not boring, and does pack in a reasonable amount of entertainment. But as I indicated in my summary line, it's probably best to hold off watching this movie until you are in an undemanding mood.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Strong sequel to the Star Trek revival from 2009,"In 2009 the Star Trek franchise was given a serious upgrade with the monster budget blockbuster Star Trek - The Future Begins. It was directed by JJ Abrams, who took the movie into a different direction. It was a very vivid movie with lots of humor, action and of course outstanding special effects. Many true Star Trek fans didn't like it, because it was way different than the old Star Trek movies and series, but I really loved it, so I had high hopes for the sequel Star Trek - Into Darkness. And I wasn't disappointed.Into Darkness starts with Kirk saving Spocks life, but by doing that breaking fundamental laws. Kirk of course doesn't care at all about those rules. His friend's life is way more important. Spock on the other hand reports the violation, which costs Kirk his command of the Enterprise and drives a wedge between their friendship. After a terrorist attack on the Star Fleet headquarters shakes things up dramatically, Kirk goes after the man responsible. The rest of the story I won't reveal in case you are reading this before you watch it.Where Star trek 2009 could be annoying for Star Trek fans, because it was so different than the old Trek stuff, this one will probably be even worse. Many elements from old Star trek movies are used, including a very important character: Khan. But the new Khan is played by a white British actor, whereas the old Khan was an Indian man. The name Khan doesn't fit the looks of the chosen actor at all. Also some of the dialogue from the old Trek movies is used, apparently. So Trekkies be warned. there might be a lot you will not like, or disagree with.There are other issues with the movie, though small ones. Especially some of the supporting actors get very limited screen time, where I feel they should have had much more. Scotty, Sulu, Chekov, Bones, Uhura and the Star Fleet commander played by Peter Weller all get their moments, but not enough to let their characters develop in the way I feel they deserve. Also, the storyline feels less important than the chases, fights and other exciting moments. It all goes by so fast that it feels like you will miss something if you blink.So much for the cons. Because this movie has a lot of pros. Especially the cast. We can scream until we lose our voice that Khan should be played by an Indian guy, or at least someone from an exotic country, but Benedict Cumberbatch is absolutely awesome as Khan. He is cold, unreadable, unpredictable, and has such an air of power around him. The Trekkies who feel bad about Khan not being played by an Indian guy should give Cumberbatch a chance. He will not disappoint, believe me! Peter Weller is also great as the Fleet commander. The rest of the main cast we know from the 2009 movie, and they do a good job as well.Other important strong points of the movie are: high pace (a bit too high for me, but many will love it), impressive special effects (especially the encounter with the Klingons looks very good) and the plot has a few twists that I found very nice. The plot of the 2009 movie was pretty straightforward, so I feel it was a good decision to make the plot of the sequel a bit more complicated.I enjoyed watching this movie a lot. Of course it was slightly less impressive than the 2009 movie, because we already knew most of the cast and what the special effects would be like, but the bad guys were great and I never left the edge of my seat. Into Darkness isn't perfect, and the Trek fans should keep in mind that it's going to be way different than they would expect from the old movies and series, but it's very entertaining and exciting, and I'm already looking forward to the next one!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Brilliance of STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS,"J. J. Abrams (Super 8, Alias, Fringe, Lost) has excelled in television and movies particularly resurrecting Star Trek by reinventing its essence for new audiences while respecting its origins. In Star Trek Into Darkness, he expands on keys characters and continues his mastery of plot and non-stop action. As summer entertainment, it is a class act and sends the science fiction/adventure series on a spectacular trajectory. It is also the best Star Trek movie since The Wrath of Khan.Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) are pursued by a primitive tribe on an alien planet as Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) attempts to prevent a catastrophic volcanic explosion from within. Their activities call into the question The Prime Directive where nothing should alter a civilization from without. In fact, Kirk's outrageous, rule-breaking behavior gets him in hot water with mentor, Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and Starfleet. At the same time, a horrifying explosion in London reveals the presence of a mysterious man (Benedict Cumberbatch) named John Harrison, who exhibits a remarkable intellect and physical prowess. The cryptic Harrison is pursued to Kronos, home planet to the warrior race of Klingons and the threat of all out war. Overseeing the mission directive is Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) whose presence is felt in unexpected ways. It all leads to a revelation that threatens not only the Enterprise, but Starfleet and Earth.As the original TV series often dealt with contemporary issues, there are strong parallels with current headlines in the form of terrorism. In fact much of the film has a grim, dark tone as the crew must face a superior, ruthless adversary, and a couple scenes of mass destruction have a 9/11 feel. There are a number of references to the old TV series and original Trek films as names, locales, music, and even dialogue are lifted and cleverly interjected. Tribbles, anyone? And you've got to love those retro uniforms especially Saldana's! Pike and Kirk have what amounts to a father-son relationship, and this is tested in a pivotal moment. We witness this relatively new crew as it becomes more cohesive under duress, and that is part of the fun as we watch McCoy's character and the beginnings of his amusing, trademark gripes. There are plenty of heroics from our stars, and Scotty (Simon Pegg) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) shine in key moments. You only wish to see if the classic trio (Kirk, Spock, and McCoy) could mix it up more, but you do see the core beginnings of their dynamic bond. There are strong, recurring themes of loyalty and sacrifice for the good of the majority, or in other words, ""the needs of the many"" Cumberbatch, (TVs current Sherlock Holmes) is outstanding as a powerful adversary. Weller is particularly effective as the imposing Admiral with a hidden agenda.The visual effects are impressively on display when the starship Enterprise explodes into warp speed and when devastating terrorist acts decimate a major city. The pacing is quite good, so don't think too hard on credibility gaps. Where does Harrison come from? Anybody check his blood type? Why is Starfleet headquarters virtually unguarded? And what's the deal on those torpedoes? Abrams is a master showman and he knows how to engineer cliffhangers upon cliffhangers. The film has a memorable climax that will ring déjà vu with a twist, but is nonetheless quite emotional. It solidifies the Kirk-Spock relationship forever and could have served as one of the best endings in Trekdom, but the filmmakers chose to springboard to another exciting moment which leaves the door open for future adventures of the five year kind. To say any more would spoil things. A third film in this installment would be hard pressed to surpass the energy and sheer acumen he demonstrates in this sequel, but Abrams has proved he can followup a directing gig by remaining the producer with another talented director taking the reigns and still achieve spectacular results (see Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol). For the man who has been chosen to take over Star Wars franchise, the sky's the limit.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Visually amazing, but ultimately uninspired","this movie seems stunning in terms of cinematography and filming technology. With better scenario and dialogs, it could have been a very good movie. But, it was completely predictable, and fancy special effects alone do not make a good movie. Not once are you surprised by the turn of events in this movie, and there's so many bad movie clichés in it, and so many things that just doesn't make any sense at all. Do not go and see it for the plot and writing. The plot is a monumentally formulaic ""be a good friend and partner"" riff. We have seen all the characters before in a hundred other films !Taking everything into account, the movie is beautiful, but it feels like the main goal was to show off the effort of special effect wizards. The movie would have benefited from more detailed characters, and a less boring and predictable plot.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why are't we moving captain....,"Benedict and again Benedict...
The movie is a sample of great cast. Previous Star Trek cast plus Robocop as a villain and wonderful Cumberbatch as Khan. His English is so pure that several lines get into your memory. Benedict simply makes the movie better in everything:""I am better""

Stakes are high as Kirk fights for his family,"Not being a huge Trekkie, I wasn't particularly interested in watching this sequel to the rebooted franchise. But given its obvious box office success and consequent Oscar nomination, it climbed in my watch list and I experienced STID. I believe that the first Star Trek from Abrahams is a bit overrated, as I find it to be a welcomed adventure film but not worthy of the rating it scores. Having said that I would probably put this entry in a similar spot as its predecessor. It offers a wide variety of thrills and uncertainties, while presenting us with emotional sides to most of the main characters. As any Star Trek fan would agree, Kirk, Spock and Khan are the most highlighted characters in the film and they all are played with the right kind of charisma. Pine once again offers determination and leadership as James Kirk, a irreverent man who will do anything to keep his crew (family) safe. Quinto is spot on as Spock, a Vulcan that's calculating but also influenced by his human half to not only serve Kirk in the right manner, but also to connect affectionately with Uhura. Finally the MVP of the movie is clearly Benedict Cumberbatch, who is superb as Khan, a ruthless villain that shows a huge psychological advantage throughout the film, until he meets his ultimate demise.Star Trek Into Darkness is a fun and great movie experience. Some fans may complain about its lack of greatness and its detachment from Trek themes, but since I am not a die hard fan, I don't feel there's anything to bicker about.Rating 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The most ambitious Star Trek film to date.,"This second installment of Star Trek follows a now experienced James Tiberius Kirk as he captains his crew on the prestigious USS Enterprise. He has now taken to the chair but not Spock's lack of emotion when it comes to certain situations. As a result of compromising a mission to save Spock's life, Kirk is relieved of his captaincy and is demoted to first officer. This doesn't last long as there is an attack on Starfleet's archives in London by an enemy that no one is aware of but Fleet Admiral Alexander Marcus. Kirk is then sent with his crew to find the attacker with limited knowledge about who he really is.Star Trek Into Darkness is definitely the most ambitious Star Trek film as it has almost everything you want in a Sci-Fi film. I'm not familiar with the past Treks but from what I hear they didn't manage to explore some of the things the modern adaptations have for instance Earth during the 2200′s and Kronos. Thank god for the development of modern technology for we wouldn't be exposed to such awesome sites as these. Thus heaps of satisfied fan-boys.What I love about this film is that it's more than just a space adventure, it's nothing like Star Wars as people might think. From what I've read Star Trek has always been about developing stories that encompasses drama and character, not so much about the thrills of space shootouts. Star Trek Into Darkness definitely has the action and large scale thrills that previous installments lacked but it also has a strong plot and story line. It's more of a space crime thriller than a full on action which I found quite refreshing. The action actually had substance, it wasn't just silly and gratuitous, there was a believable reasoning to each action sequence.What really differentiates Star Trek from any other space film is its filming style and overall look. We get too indulge our eyes to a colorfully crisp film with heaps of lens flares, which I actually like a lot. It gives the franchise a new identity but also gives the impression that the future is bright. The film's opening is probably the best example of a beautifully filmed shot of vivid colors aided massively by a great set.I like how this film tried it's best to film as much as they could authentically, making it really hard to pick out what's real and what's CGI. Huge props to them because it improves the film massively. The design as a whole is awesome, I don't usually notice costumes that much but they're freaking NAICE in this film, I want nothing more than to have a Starfleet jacket now.Performances and cast don't need to be mentioned as they were as solid as the last film. Slowly giving their own twists to their previously acted characters. I like the chemistry that they have which makes you as a viewer really buy into the crew being another family for these characters. What does need to be mentioned is the villain played by Bennedict Cumberbatch who is just phenomenal. I think quite a few people may agree with me when I say he's gotta be the best villain of 2013. His character is more than just a ruthless super human, he actually show's genuine emotion which almost makes his actions justifiable emphasized when he asks Kirk ""is there anything you would not do for your family""; then the mind games ensue. On the first viewing these mind games are great fun making the film a whole lot more tense; who's telling the truth and who's your enemy? Overall, great popcorn flick with more substance than your used to in your average blockbuster film.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
JJ Abrams reworks Star Trek 2,"Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) ignores the Prime Directive to save Spock (Zachary Quinto) on a mission. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) is relieved. After terrorist attacks killing Adm. Pike, Adm. Macus (Peter Weller) sends Kirk on a mission to kill renegade John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who has escaped to the Klingon homeworld Kronos. They are joined by weapons specialist Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) and a new type of photon torpedo despite objections from Scotty (Simon Pegg).I appreciate the idea of reworking Star Trek 2 in this alternate universe. However if we are to compare the two, there are differences that don't shine a favorable light on this one. Whereas the 1982 original was operatic, poetic, and fun. This one is loud, lumbering, and dark. JJ Abrams must have expected the comparisons. This one is definitely flashier, and better looking. The CG sequences are awe inspiring like most of them today. We have advanced quite a ways.The original was one of good versus evil. They were simple sides. This one, we're trying to use Khan, then we're fighting him. It's not as clean of a storyline. There was a lot of minor questionable things like.... Why hide Enterprise in the ocean? Why put the bodies in the photon torpedoes? How did they get back to Earth all of a sudden? They're all minor and ignorable. But it builds an uneasy sense that something's not right. My analogy is that the 1982 movie is a perfectly solved Rubik's Cube. This one JJ Abrams jumbled all the pieces, put glitter all over it, and photoshop the heck out of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Old Star Trek Fan,"I watched the original Star Trek TV series, starting from episode 1 of the first season, when I was a boy. I've loved Star Trek in its various incarnations ever since, including these two recent movies by J.J. Abrams, who seems to have a soft spot for the original Star Trek and pays homage to it in numerous ways in both of his Star Trek movies so far.This is a very good, very entertaining and interesting movie just on its own, and it seems to me that those who are giving it horrible (1 and 2 star) reviews might likely be Star Trek purists and perfectionists who have reduced Star Trek to a static universe that never even existed in the original TV series.For example, why don't any of these Star Trek purists complain about the portrayal of the Klingons in this latest movie and in so many Star Trek movies and series before it, because the Klingons in the original low-budget TV series looked, dressed, acted and spoke like Earth humans, for example in the famous episode ""The Trouble with Tribbles.""I think that J.J. Abrams pays a tremendous amount of respect to Gene Roddenberry's original concept and realization, while allowing his own creativity to enhance the characters and plot lines typical of the original.Good job. Great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A Fast,  Flawed yet Fun Sci-fi Adventure of the Starship Enterprise","There is a line that protagonist, Captain Kirk says in this movie- ""I don't know what I am supposed to do but I know what I need to do"". Director J.J Abrams clearly felt the same while helming the sequel to the 2009 reboot hit Star Trek.There is everything in this movie that is 'needed' for it to be successful. The old crew is back, there is meaner villain and the special effects are simply astounding. The post processed 3D is surprisingly complementary to the CGI. In fact it is safe to say this is the best looking sci-fi movie ever and the fact that it is a stark trek film seems fitting. However the endearing element of 'adventure' which is intrinsic for a star trek feature seems grossly deficient.The USS enterprise crew is tasked to hunt down a terrorist named John Harrison. It initially seems like a simple retribution mission to avenge the death of innocents. However startling events unfold that threatens to wreck the space ship and the crew. There is a constant sense of peril throughout. It works for some time but then resolutions are slapped out so rapidly that by climax, you will probably know how it will end. Chris Pine as James T Kirk takes the best parts from his original character(leaving behind the cringe worthy overacting from his 60's counterpart), Scotty played by Simon peg takes up most of the screen time among the supporting cast. To his credit, he does a fine job and deserves it. Zoe Saldana is brilliant as ever, sportively playing 'Uhura', a side kick and lover to Spock. Karl Urban as the favorite interstellar surgeon Dr. McCoy(Bones) seems to be mostly paying a homage to DeForest Kelly(60's) Bones, complete with 'Dammit! I am a doctor not a torpedo specialist' line and the trademark one eyebrow raise. Alice eve(Dr. Marcus) is quite forgettable while John Cho as Sulu & Yeltin as Chekov all play their roles remarkably well.But the star of the show is Zachary Quinto as Mr.Spock. Qunito proves in his second outing that he is this generation's finest Vulcan. He balances the role perfectly by playing tribute to Nimoy's spock(60's) and bringing in his own originality in a perfect mix. Cumberbatch as the villain(by now everyone knows which role he actually plays!) initially seems miscast considering the race , accent etc. but all that can be forgotten when he says ""I will walk on your cold corpses"" in an eerie sociopathic tone.(Reminds one of Alan Rickman's villainous roles).This is a non-Trekkie review. I have seen a couple of the original episodes and some movies and don't care if a Klingon pronunciation is wrong. But I am a sci-fi junkie and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Spock would probably comment 'This film is going to be a blockbuster, logically'. But we humans would enjoy it a little more if the emotional scenes weren't so forced and there was a bit more of the 'going boldly where no man has gone before' parts.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Very enjoyable film, even better than the first.",I have never watched any of the previous Star Trek stuff or given it much thought. I watched the 2009 film as it was a brand new modern version and tells the story from the beginning so it didn't matter that I was new to the franchise. I really enjoyed that film and was surprised to enjoy this sequel even more.All of the characters and the basics are set out in the first film and so they are all developed further in this film. The relationship between Kirk and Spok was a really amusing aspect of the story line and Chris Pine and Zachary Qunito played these contrasting characters very well.This film has a great range of action which includes physical fighting as well as a lot of fighting the kind you would only see in a science fiction like this. The character of Khan was quite captivating and Benedict Cumberbatch was very memorable in this role.I definitely recommend this film (and the first one) to anyone whether you are already a fan of Star Trek or not. This was a science fiction full of action and funny moments too and I think people of all ages would enjoy. I hope there will be more to come.,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It's visually stunning. Really, it's a good movie, especially if you're a trek fan. It's really easy to spoil the film, and if you read the IMDb much at all you'll see spoilers. So go give it a shot.

General,"They say you are either Star Trek or Star Wars and I was formerly the latter , however these latest Star Trek movies and in this one in particular although not converting me , mean I will watch any future film in this series.Obviously as elements of the film develop you know certain characters cannot be killed off but that does not stem from the action or get you thinking what is going to happen next.A great start to the movie opening up the general plot line with the usual twist thrown in to make you question yourself whether you're original thoughts were right or wrong. The. Action is a constant but not ridiculously so, the scenes where the action is less the plot line keeps the film together.

These movies really get cast well.Just when I thought the plot was getting predictable, it didn't, with the exception of Peter Weller's roll, because, well, it's Peter Weller. I was hoping they would expand Karl Urban's role this time because he can be so much more as an actor, but, maybe next time.Two hours flew by. It was fun, fun, fun!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
J.J. goes full circle with Trek sequel,"""THIS IS A MILITARY MISSION. I THOUGHT WE WERE EXPLORERS!"" - Montgomery ScottIt has always bothered me that most Star Trek movies revolve around a military assignment instead of exploration. What makes the original TV series so brilliant is that it tackled social and political issues through the voyages of this space ship. J.J. Abrams clearly understands this and has finally made a Star Trek film where the militarization of the franchise is challenged.In the story, a terrorist named John Harrison is attacking Starfleet and Captain Pike ends up being one of the causalities. Hungry for revenge, Kirk agrees to go on a covert mission in Klingon territory to kill Harrison. Everyone thinks this is a terrible idea and so Kirk decides to simply arrest Harrison instead. Once he does, he discovers Harrison isn't the man's real identity and that a Starfleet Admiral has tricked the Enterprise into potentially starting a war with the Klingon's.As the movie comes to an end, Kirk realizes that there's more to him than being a bloodthirsty man-of-action and he agrees to Captain the Enterprise into the famous 5-year mission depicted in the original TV series. For that, I thank you, Mr. Abrams. And hopefully, whoever takes over the franchise will be smart enough to continue on this path and, once again, give us the socially and politically relevant stories that made Star Trek popular in the first place.Overall, Star Trek Into Darkness might be the most satisfying Trek film since The Voyage Home. The cast got comfortable in their roles and played off each other beautifully. The action scenes are exciting and creative. The visual effects and overall design of the movie are top-notch. And, Michael Giacchino hits another home run with his music. If there's one complain I have about the film it's the lack of screen time for Benedict Cumberbatch. He's phenomenal as the villain, but if you blink, you'll miss him. Mr. Robocop, Peter Weller, had the meatier role. He's great too, but come on, more Sherlock would have been nice.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I'd say that was a 6, this was a 7. Mind you I am far from a Star Trek fan.It was worth seeing for anyone who likes action and/or sci if movies. My Star Trek 'geek' friends loved it a lot.

Great action and storyline. 7/10,"Review: I was a bit worried about them attempting a Wraith Of Kane, but after watching it, I quite enjoyed it. The cast have great chemistry with each other, especially Spock & Kirk who bring wit to the franchise. Kane was played well by Benedict Cumberbatch and the storyline line was thought through and executed well. The budget was also used well, but the blue flair throughout the movie did get on my nerves. It seems like the director, J.J. Abrams, is sticking to the order of the original franchise, which should work up well if he does a good job. In all, this movie has something for everybody and the Trekkies out there won't be disappointed. Enjoyable!Round-Up: I'm glad that this movie made a profit because it didn't blow up at the box office but no one had a bad word to say about it. I'm also glad that the director was able to get the same cast back that he used on the first movie because this film wouldn't have worked without them. On the downside, it is slightly a bit to close to the first movie, but I hope that the director will change it up a bit for the next outing. I do think that they should have used Kane more, like the original movie, but that's just me being picky.Budget: $190million Worldwide Gross: $234millionI recommend this movie to people who are into the Star Trek franchise and who enjoyed the first movie in this franchise. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is Star Trek alright. It's excellent. Could be sublime though.,"Let me start by saying that I love Star Trek and Science Fiction in general. I re-watched all Star Trek movies more times than I would care to admit. I know, or at least I'm convinced that I know, what Star Trek is about. I loved the Star Trek reboot, first in 2009 and now its sequel Into Darkness.It's all there. The moral dilemma, the friendship theme, the human weakness, the human brilliance, the strong and emotional characters, the philosophical theme. Yes, even the battles, not found in abundance in all Star Trek movies but still an important part of the show, especially in some particular Star Trek movies. Only now, it has better effects and better production value in general.There's verbatim dialog yes, but that's only known to us, the Trekkies, the people who know Star Trek inside out. And, I really enjoyed those moments. It feels good to be back home you know?To the haters I say: I agree with some of your assessments, the film could have been even better, plot-wise, tech-wise. I agree. It could be sublime, it's only great to excellent. But, what about the excellent acting performances? What to say to those special effects? What to say to the twists and turns, and the surprises that keep you glued to the screen not knowing for sure what will happen?This is an extremely fun and entertaining movie. And, it's Star Trek alright. Is it more action-packed and has it more special effects than the average Star Trek fan is used to? Yes. But, it makes sense for this movie in particular to be like that (some original movies were also more action-packed than others).So, give yourself a favor and go watch this movie in the theaters. You will not regret it. Of course, if you are not willing to accept a breath of fresh air, and you're unwilling to make room in your mind to accept this reboot (or any reboot), because it will never be as good as the originals... Well, that's really not the point I have to say. The point, I think, is to go to the movies, have fun, relate to the characters and learn a few things, or at least take something with you that makes you think.Highly recommended. 9/10Certified by long time Star Trek fan.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Long awaited follow up film that keeps the series floating for a new generation,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter a perilous mission on the planet Niburu, where Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) is reckless in saving the life of Spock (Zachary Quinto), the two once again find themselves at odds when Spock reveals some truths about Kirk's fabrications. But they find themselves thrust back together again when embittered ex Starfleet officer Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch) launches a one man reign of terror.Despite following the current trend of resurrecting an old franchise and making it in to a marketable new series, J.J. Abrams has spaced out (no pun intended) his follow up to his 2009 re-generation of the series, preferring to keep the fans in suspense following that film's critical and commercial success. And he proves that taking one's time and not being too quick to make a quick buck on the back of a winning horse works wonders with this solid, satisfying second instalment that should prove worthwhile to mega fans and more casual trekkers alike.Abrams takes a no dawdling approach, starting as he means to go on with a thrilling chase sequence on the planet Niburu, with Kirk and an associate finding themselves being chased by some scary inhabitants with white, bold heads. From here on in, he maintains a steady pace, never letting things drag on for too long until the next action spectacular. The tone never gets too heavy or serious either, with tongue firmly in cheek most of the time. The 'Into Darkness' suffix feels misplaced, given the film's more light hearted feel compared to the original's dark, brooding style. That's not to say darker, more serious subject matter is not explored, as the film is another modern blockbuster that isn't afraid to tap in to current affairs that have everyone on edge, such as terrorist attacks and concealed intelligence. The film respects the audience's intelligence and expects it to do the same.Performances wise, Pine and Quinto ane still a cracking mismatched buddy buddy act, Pine an eager Martin Riggs to Quinto's Roger Murtaugh, while a support cast including Simon Pegg, Alice Eve and Robocop himself Peter Weller add class. But the stand out personality is Cumberbatch as the villain, effortlessly owning his screen time and chewing the scenery with his dark, foreboding presence as the villain. To top things off, Abrams lets another Brit boy have a crack at the big time, with Noel Clarke in a supporting (but still very noticeable) role as an ill fated man.Abrams has figured out how to make this old franchise appeal to a modern audience, and ensures the length is never a drag and the action never lets up. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Trek-commened, another entertaining adventure","After a terrorist attack the crew of the Enterprise set out on unorthodox assassination mission.The time travel-alternate reality concept used in first film allows an old adversary to be awoken early allowing the writers to come up with an intriguing story. Although Kirk is played excellently once again by Chris Pine the writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof frustratingly portray him as indecisive, nevertheless, it gives Kirk a chance to walk some unfamiliar territory allowing him time to develop which gives fans something new.The closing act suffers from a predictable MacGuffin for Kirk's return, this hiccup aside the showdown with Spock is staged brilliantly as with the action setups throughout. The action coupled with the fantastic special-effects, music score by Michael Giacchino and J.J. Abrams slick direction delivers on expectations and entertainment value.There's a star studded cast including Bruce Greenwood and Peter Weller who is excellently cast as Marcus. Anton Yelchin's Chekov is given more to do while Karl Urban (Bones), John Cho (Sulu) and the exquisite Zoe Saldana as Uhura are given less to do in this outing. Nevertheless, it is still a real pleasure to watch them in character. Alice Eve is a notable addition especially for old school trek fans as Carol. Funny man Simon Pegg is Scotty once again and has some of the best moments with his silent alien sidekick returning as a welcomed addition. Without drawing comparisons with other incarnation's outings Benedict Cumberbatch is perfectly cast as the intellectual, superior, genetically enhanced foe of Kirk.Like it predecessor if you've never seen Star Trek it doesn't matter as the story can be viewed as a stand alone sci-fi adventure film. However, die-hard fans should love the references to earlier Star Trek stories and characters. Highly Trek-commened.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"James Kirk is the captain, Spock is the first officer. Enter John Harisson, a man from their own community which becomes a big threat to the whole galaxy.","This is one of the Landmark films made by J.J. Abrams. HATS OFF to the whole team of Star Trek. They have made a film which is not only Good- looking in effects only, but it has lot more to offer. Firstly, I am not a very big fan of Star trek, but this movie just blew my mind away due to many reasons. The Acting was phenomenal by every cast member. Indeed, the Scene stealer, in my opinion, was without doubt Benedict Cumberbatch. What an exceptional portrayal of a 'Clever' villain. From his entry till end, his presence was felt at each moment with a certain anxiety. He has really done a great job. His dialog delivery is just pure excellence in many scenes (I cannot point out, but you'll get to know as you see the movie). Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto were equally good and flawless in their roles. Great Performances and Emotional appeal. Secondly, The Movie's plot and direction are top-notch. The Large Scale CGI Effects. The whole Sci-Fi setup. The Camera-work. The Background music. Everything just molded so well on celluloid that the Impact of the film just boosted. I saw this movie in 3D. I personally never favor a 3D movie. But Surprisingly this movie contained very well executed 3D scenes, which astounded the audience at several moments. They were not the best but still surprisingly were not bad at all. Music was also note-worthy. There is always a silent scene in a star trek movie. In the previous movie (2009) it also had a complete silent scene if people would remember. There's one in this one too. It was one of the highlights of the movie, where the audience was like 'OMG'. Lastly, The only regret i have is this that the plot was just okay. It had ample scope for many twists and thrills. The movie is more about effects, acting and Sci-Fi. The Plot should have contained that edge-on- the-seat factor like the dark knight. No doubt movie had some thrills, but were less. This was the only con i felt about the movie. Otherwise the movie is perfect in all means. A must watch in 3D cinema. Highly recommended for Sci-Fi lovers. :)",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The franchise marches on...,"Hate to spoil things for ya, but we KNOW all the good guys will survive this movie. Why? Because they all went on to star in a legendary TV show which ran for 3 years and 6 spin-off films. Yep, this is the second prequel flick to the original Star Trek, and it's just as much of a white knuckle ride as part one, with some unexpectedly moving scenes thrown into the bargain, too. All the cast really DO look like younger versions of their older counterparts, and it's their camaraderie which provides many of the best moments. There are those amazing special effects too... But meh, you could have guessed that.I do have a number of small bugbears though... for a start, the climax never seems to end. Forget about pausing for breath, it throw around 5 crisis at us in a row, and by the end of it all you'll probably feel physically drained. And how is it that this superhuman nemesis they're after is able to take out an entire squadron of Klingon warriors almost on his lonesome in hand-to-hand combat, but can't even dispatch Mr Spock in a fistfight towards the end? I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for this. Perhaps Spock could give it to me himself. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best Movie EVER,"The last movie I went to, I ended up walking out of way before the end. That being said, I have been a Star Trek fan since the original series but lost interest after the series and movies ended and all of the players and names changed with the spin-off series. This movie slams you back to the future. The characters have been modified a bit for the changing times but you fall in love with them all over again. I laughed, cried, jumped and stayed on the edge of my seat from start to finish. I don't want to give away anything, but this is MUST SEE. I would have watched it 2 or 4 times in a row if possible. J. J. Abrams was spot on with one. Grab your pop corn and drink and enjoy the ride aboard the Enterprise.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Entertaining but flawed, enjoyable overall","I was actually kind of excited about this movie. As a kid I'd loved the Star Wars movies and knew them well but had never seen anything to do with the Star Trek universe. It's always been a mysterious world to me. Of course I've seen plenty of little snippets from the TV show, but only enough to know the very basics. The new Star Trek reboot seemed to be getting a lot of praise and I did find the previous film pretty enjoyable with lots of potential for good sequels.Into Darkness was very disappointing at first. It tries too hard to be dramatic and funny at the same time. It's paper-thin. I never liked J.J. Abrams' style - I thought Lost was awful and avoided it as much as possible although my family watched it. His characters are always arguing, staring at each other, sweating. They're always emotional, frustrated, flawed. The problem is they're always dumb. They don't think or solve problems. Or if they do, they do it in a very controlled way that is dictated by the script. It's hard to describe but everything he does seems far too controlled. I can't believe they're letting him reboot Star Wars as well, I think it's one of the worst movie-related decisions I've ever heard of but then that's another story...Once the actual plot of Into Darkness got going, I was more interested. At least it doesn't hold back much. It's like a kid playing with their toys - the good guys are nearly going to die but then something happens and they make a comeback and the bad guys escape and so on. Everything is done at the very last second. Everything is on the line, nothing is halfway. Spaceships can appear out of nowhere, chases can go on from one location to another, people can change sides or reveal secrets that change the situation.But also, the physics is what a 6-year-old might expect to happen in space. We hear the spaceships. As soon as a spaceship's power goes out, it immediately starts falling towards the nearest planet regardless of whether it's in orbit or not. Kirk tries to kick something into place but he keeps kicking it at the wrong angle which had me nearly yelling at the screen. There is warp speed travel and after an early, unexpected stop, the heroes are a whole 300 thousand kilometres away from their destination. That's a tiny distance in terms of space, it only takes light one second to travel that far. So really, they're right on top of their destination and probably should have actually exited warp even earlier. These are obvious, huge plot flaws. They are distracting because they are easy to get right. Especially when films like Interstellar are being made, we have a right to expect less stupidity and more ingenuity. The universe is an amazing place and we barely get any cool insight from these awfully dumb movies.Benedict Cumberbatch is the best part of the movie. He's intense and interesting to watch. His character has an air of mystery about him. He's powerful and his motives are unclear. He makes a very satisfying antagonist. The special effects are satisfying overall and most of the action is reasonably well directed. There were a few funny moments. The chase scenes were a bit exciting but often laughable as well.However, it's pathetic how much the film-makers tie themselves down to the original series. It feels like there are more references than new ideas. Just make your movie! Create something new! Take what you like from earlier movies and episodes and use that merely as your jumping off point! Being too big a fan of something really limits you as an artist and that seems to happen here. They're afraid to step out of expectations. There is not enough boldness or originality. Abrams makes formulaic stuff that ""pushes the boundaries"" in a very safe, PC, conventional way and this movie is no exception.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Action packed and exciting, would watch again!","I randomly decided to go see this film today because not much else was on. I've never really paid much attention to Star Trek as a series and I never even saw the 1st movie of these two, but I loved this movie, and I am pretty picky with films! (Maybe I'm biased because I'm not some oldschool trekkie, but who knows). Anyways, lots of action, a lot of edge of your seat moments, not dull at all, exciting, good acting from most. I would give it a higher score if it wasn't for Chris Pine whom I CANNOT stand as an actor. I don't know what it is about him but I just cannot take his acting seriously, and his acting is just meh, not something I would remember, competent at best. I don't know, he just didn't seem very Captain Kirk, maybe if they made a Star Trek tween movie I would understand, but this...not so much, I imagined someone a bit older and more mature to play his role. (Its like having Russel Crowe play Spock or something crazy, it just does not go!) NEVERTHELESS! I loved the film and didn't leave feeling disappointed, and Zachary Quinto's acting (Spock) was AMAZING like usual. If you're looking for a film to see and aren't sure give it a watch, you don't have to be a trekkie to enjoy it! :)",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Fun....ignore the nit pickers,"Maybe I'm just easily entertained. Maybe I just enjoy big action science fiction movies so much that I am willing to over look what I consider minor imperfections. I am a die hard Star Trek fan who can trace his love for the show all the way back to the original run of the original series. Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, ""Bones"" McCoy and the rest of the crew of the fictional star ship always kept me entertained no matter how bad some of the scripts were. And believe me...I do recall some bad bad episodes...the Space Hippies episode comes to mind. But I digress.Yes....this was pretty much a non stop action ride. Yes it had some holes in the script. Yes it had some clichés. But I enjoyed the action. I enjoyed the acting....yes I said the acting. Brendan whats his name (I am afraid to write his last name for fear of misspelling it) stole the show as ""John Harrison aka....oohps....can't say that name"" as the main villain. But Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachery Quinto as Spock had their acting moments too. The supporting cast also had their moments too.As to the nit pickers who dissect such minor points as the use of such expressions as ""my God"" and ""Good God""....give me a break. I can't swear to it but I do believe that those expressions may have been used in the original show. I really believe that many of the people who are giving this movie a 1, 2 , or 3 star rating went in predisposed to hating this movie. Give this movie a chance.

Thank you JJ Abrams...for ruining the Star Trek franchise forever!,"I went to see this turkey last night. Gene Roddenberry is probably still spinning in his grave one week after its opening night in Los Angeles. All of the characters are one dimensional caricatures with absolutely no depth. The main characters acted like cardboard children, the Klingons have maybe one line and were shown in only one brief, CGI laden scene. The script is atrocious, passing off insipid dialog as witty, snappy zingers and ""I'm so clever"" one liners. The main villain...well, I could write an entire review just on this one topic alone: Disastrous. All this coming from someone that genuinely likes Benedict Cumberbatch in most everything he has been in. What this talented actor was given to work with, IMHO, is no less than criminal. But that aside, the plot...oh my, the plot (Plot? What plot?). Introducing Khan as an English white boy with a yuppie haircut? Really? Khan Noonien Singh was a genetically enhanced Indian prince with a major God complex. Ricardo Montalban was Khan, rest his soul. He was Khan in The Space Seed and he was Khan in Star Trek 2. This faux pas right there was patently offensive. The way Star Fleet command was portrayed as a top down militaristic organization beholden to the warmongering ambitions of just one man (Admiral Marcus) was patently offensive. And that lousy cameo by Leonard Nimoy...WTF??? I HATED this movie. Thank you JJ Abrams for destroying the Star Trek franchise forever!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Doesn't let you down any second,"The only reason I am not giving it a 10 is because nothing can be perfect, but having said that, if you ask me for any scene from the film which I can consider boring or dull or which doesn't keep you on your toes, I'd be forever looking for an answer.The movie has amazing visuals and a brilliant storyline, one whose flawless execution keeps not a dull moment in the movie.I saw this movie today as it premiered in India, having waited for several months with bated breath.J. J. A's Star Trek is not the original star trek. It does not have the same storyline, thanks to the clever script of the first movie.

all the things,"I both like and hate this film.Kirk is horrific. And I say that while usually liking Chris Pine. But this is not James T. Kirk and I'm sick of this false version of him. He's nothing but a rebellious brat who never learns his lesson. Spare me.John Cho. I'm going to say something unfavorable here. Hikaru Sulu is not Korean. He is of Japanese heritage. Which is why the original actor, George Takei, was Japanese American. Not Korean. Cho gave a decent enough performance, but he should not have been cast as a Japanese character. Asians should not be considered interchangeable anymore, people. There are loads of brilliant actors of Japanese descent, even if you have to go to Japan to find them. And guess what? Most of them even speak English. Wow, who knew. *rolls eyes*I won't bother going too deep into my intense dislike of Zachary Quinto as Spock. He just doesn't work in that role, never has, never will. And while I like Zoe Saldana overall, she is not Nichelle Nichols, the woman who set the bar for Nyota Uhura that no one else will ever be able to touch.BUT, we do have Benedict Cumberbatch, and while I believe it would have been a smart choice to actually cast someone like Dev Patel for the role of Khan, Benedict saved this movie for me. Because he outperformed almost everyone. Except for Karl Urban and Simon Pegg who were solely used for comedic relief and did their jobs well, however pitiful their character development. I am not a Cumberbitch and never will be, but I appreciate a charismatic performance as much as the next person and Benedict sure delivered on that. You know it's bad when you're rooting for Khan all the way through the film because the crew of the Enterprise are so annoying.Except for Anton Yelchin as Chekov. You gave a good performance with the minuscule bit of screen-time tossed your way. RIP.At the end of the day, it's actors like Bruce Greenwood, Anton Yelchin, and Benedict Cumberbatch who made this film remotely palatable to me. Otherwise, this isn't Star Trek.

edge of your seat stuff,"Abrams has done an amazing job reviving the franchise. The second film had a lot to live up to from the first and it definitely surpassed my expectations. It had you emotionally evolved from the outset and my nerves were in shreds by the end. The screenplay was brilliant with the right amount of intensity, humour, emotion and action.The way they've moved forward with the new timeline was very well done allowing past stories to cross paths with the enterprise but in a completely new light. All the actors did there characters justice with Cumberbatch making an amazing villain. I'm not a huge fan of 3D but the film worked extremely well in 3D.

Good movie... Although with some underused characters,"I am very picky in watching sci-fi movies, they tend to be too ""inward"" (= slow, few lines) or too technological to me. Star Trek series holds a nice balance between them and, therefore, I have seen all on them; without a wow! feeling, but still having a good time. The movie in question had the latter influence on me, I was eager to know how all the space mess created would end. Well, sometimes there were lots of explosions and flashes, but great (Benedict Cumberbatch, Simon Pegg - Brits outperforming Americans again :)) or good (the rest) actors prevented the movie to become a purely technical course of events. Some actors, however, could spend more time on screen (Zachary Quinto, Anton Yelchin) and the character of Dr. Carol Marcus provided no additional value to the movie. As for the main star Chris Pine, I am not a fan of him, he is not a top-A-whatever grade actor to me. On the other hand, he was not annoying, although I would have expected to see his presence less and others' more on screen :) Star Trek Into Darkness is definitely for you if you like space action with versatile characters. Sci-fi fans following the book should probably avoid it as the script is a mix.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Rather entertaining and well acted,"I read a few of the negative reviews for this film and to be frank I cannot entirely disagree with what they had to say. There was indeed not a lot of thought provoking dialog or situation in this movie. But...it was really rather entertaining none the less, and the Khan character was fantastic. That voice! Holy cow...it was like he was speaking some enchanted language that just made you want to listen. And while a lot of summer ""blockbuster"" movies have tended to rely too heavily on special effects rather than story to entertain the audience, this film did a great job, I think, of putting the effects in service of the story...as it should be. As I have said in other reviews...good effects will never save a bad story...but good effects can make a marginal story more entertaining. So...well done.

The least Trek of any Trek film,"Star Trek has finally been bitten by the Michael Bay bug where explosions and blurry action scenes seem to substitute for quality film-making.This is an entertaining film without doubt but it is too un-Trek like to be considered one of the the better Trek films. The director himself said he wanted to make a film which someone who didn't know the back story nor was a Trek fan could still watch and enjoy. This was a poor move and it shows. There are too many inconsistencies with it in terms of holding true to the Trek style where dialogue, suspense, deep plot lines were the norm and set Trek apart from most sci-fi movies. This new film is just too bang! boom! zing! and lacks enough link to the themes which made each previous Trek film (bar a few exceptions) special additions to the Trek family of films.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If you like Star Trek, DO NOT miss this on a big theater screen","If you've ever been a fan of Captain Kirk and his journeys with the crew of the starship Enterprise, I'd recommend beaming into the theater and checking this out 'cause I think it's their most exciting adventure ever - and it will never better than on a big movie screen.I won't spoil any plot; but I must say, the potential of some of the stories and characters are now being explored and realized in their most dramatic ways ever.The new actors playing these characters have found how to make them come alive. My only quibble is that Mr. Spock seems to now be written as more of a fussy tight-a** - he's so much that way it stretches being ""logical."" I realize they're just trying to pump up the drama, but he questions Captain Kirk's decisions so brutally it seems a serious effort to undermine him.Zoe Saldana as Lt. Uhura - guys, look out.

But it lends believability, actually - why would men go on five-year space missions? With her on board, all questions are resolved. What's even better is that she does a great job acting - as does the entire cast.

Absolutely Amazing,"Just when you thought the first movie was good, the second one is even better. JJ Abrams returns to make a movie that is much more dark and much more intense.

The whole crew of the Enterprise is put to the test in this epic movie. Think if Into Darkness as what The Dark Knight was to Batman Begins. That much more diabolical and fiendish.

Spectacular!,"J.J. Abrams' 2009 reboot was slightly disappointing for me. I felt that it needed a little bit of an extra boost of action to keep science-fiction\action film lovers (like me but except I like not love it) occupied with the system. After 4 years, it's surprisingly and (I think for many) expected sequel arrives to prove that a follow-up to a successful movie could be more successful and approval over the first outing and yes J.J. you've done it this time!""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a knockout sequel which overlaps the action and excitement of it's predecessor. I never watched the original ""Star Trek"" series but anyone who's a newcomer, like me, to ""Trek"" you should give this a go.The ensemble cast return again as the young vision of the Star Trek team (Chris Pine: Kirk, Zachary Quinto: Spock, Zoe Saldana: Nyota Uhura, Simon Pegg: Scotty, Karl Urban: ""Bones"" McCoy, John Cho: Sulu, and Bruce Greenwood as Christopher Pike) with 'Trek' newcomer Alice Eve (Carol Marcus) on board. ""Sherlock""'s Benedict Cumberbatch portrays Kahn, the next suspicious and dark villain (after the strange and average villain Nero, portrayed by Eric Bana in the predecessor) who wants to destroy Earth, without making any spoilers at all. I must admit he's quite good at playing Kahn and even especially for Simon Pegg, who plays Scotty. He's got a bigger part in this than the first entry, even funnier, in which is what Pegg's normally like. He isn't as brilliant as in his films with Nick Frost (Paul, Hot Fuzz and hopefully in the upcoming The World's End) but he's still quite good.The special effects are dazzling. You see shots of CGI London in 2000 years away from skyscraper view which works well with the 3D. You can see St. Paul's Cathedral (I didn't see it) still hanging there if you take a lookout (this isn't a spoiler it's a hint). There's many futuristic buildings lying around to make it look like a typical futuristic city unlike in present day.Did I mention the 3D? Yes I did. And just to let you know the 3D is incredible. Like with the special effects it stands out with the film and introducing the world of ""Star Trek"" to non-Trekkies (like me) in an exciting way. According to Abrams, they shot the film in Imax (which probably has some very good Imax shots) and converting the film into 3D during post-production, expecting the experience to be slightly ruined by the unnecessary use of 3D because believe me, I seen many films at the cinema that have bad uses of 3D (like Gulliver's Travels and Narnia 3 and many more which I can't think of), but unbelievably, I've never seen any converted-3D film as good as this. And because of this, this is one of the best films I've seen in 3D, and the first 3D film in converted 3D which I like the most. Especially Abrams' lens flare trick (read Abrams' Empire issue for info) which works well with the 3D (look out for that as well).Abrams boosts some exciting, thrilling and noisy action sequences to the film, more powerful than it's predecessor's. But UNLIKE it's predecessor, other than the gun and Enterprise fights, the face-to-face fight scenes are just brutal. Just punches until it goes too far. Probably Abrams' writers, Robert Orci & Alex Kurtzman (Transformers 1&2) and Damon Lindelof, wanted to add more violence to make it more thrilling. No luck, just unnecessary (you'll understand once you're watching it). Don't be disappointed. You'll agree.There's still plenty Enterprise ship battles, Abrams hasn't left those bits out. Goodness no he hasn't.Just to remind you, this isn't Star Wars from George Lucas. It's Star Trek from J.J Abrams. Speaking of which, Abrams is going to helm ""Episode VII"" next. Don't you just think for a minute that Abrams slow down with science fiction?It may be the start of Summer 2013 according to rumours, but ""Darkness"" could be part of the beginning of it. It's a summer blockbuster that packs a powerful villain (played by a professional actor) an understanding (and maybe sometimes be incomprehensibly confusing) plot and good and exciting action and 3D (that'll quite possibly turn up in upcoming action blockbusters (such as Pacific Rim, Man of Steel and more). Out of everything I've said about this film, it's a successful and must-see sequel you should catch in the cinema before it's too late because (I think) it's the only best experience for it (I saw this before May Half Term so I'm sending in a late review).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
J.J.'s Best Film Yet! - Star Trek Into Darkness,"​By: Ryan Nilsen Star Trek Into Darkness Directed by: J.J. Abrams Starring: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Zoe SaldanaJ.J. ABRAMS HAS BECOME A sci-fi god at directing! This is the follow-up sequel to the quite remarkable 2009 reboot of the popular Star Trek franchise and it's a good one! Into Darkness is the best film Abrams has directed in his career. This film improved on many areas it had faulted with its predecessor such as acting, story, and screen flare! The big hubbub about the first Star Trek was Abrams usage of ""screen flare"", which is created with a specific type of lens used when filming that J.J. admires. What some thought was an overkill use of screen flare in Star Trek, I can assure you, Into Darkness's screen flare is nothing close to overkill and the actually just reflected the style Abrams elicits. It made us all know we were watching a J.J. Abrams flick. ​All actors gave terrific performances especially Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock). Cumberbatch plays the villain in this epic tale, a one John Harrison. John Harrison is actually a front for someone else a lot menacing, but at the risk of spoilers I won't go any further except if you go back and watch the old Star Trek The Wrath of Kahn then you may have some idea After John Harrison commits terrorist attacks on both London and Star Fleet, that's when Cpt. Kirk and his extraordinary crew (including Spock) must hunt him down and save worlds. Now, one of the many reasons Star Trek Into Darkness is one of the most anticipated movies of the year is because director J.J. Abrams has been selected to direct Star Wars Episode VII. Many fans were both excited and worried when news broke out that J.J. would be directing it, as they should be. Star Wars is without a doubt the most well-known movie franchise and top sci-fi movie ever made, so to be the guy continuing the story of a galaxy far, far, away comes a lot of pressure! In my opinion, I think J.J. Abrams is a fantastic director, whose films are getting better and better, and with his track record of Lost (2004-2010), Alias, Mission: Impossible III (2006), Star Trek (2009), Super 8 (2011), and now Star Trek Into Darkness he is more than capable of directing Star Wars Episode VII. Into Darkness will have you wanting more leaving the theater. It is ""good"" non-stop action filled with humor and Easter eggs for the die-hard fans. While Iron Man 3 was a premature blockbuster for the summer, Star Trek Into Darkness is the official kick-off to the summer blockbuster season!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Completely misses the tone of the enlightened future that Roddenberry envisioned...,"So it seems JJ Abrams has traded in too many lens flares for too many closeups. The working title of Star Trek Into Darkness could probably have been ""Chris Pine's Facial Pores"". Seriously JJ - there is such a thing as long and middle shots too you know, and what's more - if you use them - when you *do* use a closeup, it has more dramatic effect, just sayin'...Anyway, directorial style flaws aside, my big gripe with STID is that it's ""just another"" sci-fi movie. What always set Trek apart was that Roddenberry created an enlightened future, a refreshing change of pace to most sci-fi, and the conflict therefore had to come from cleverer places. But with this reboot every character is constantly bickering, I frankly left the theater with a headache as if I'd just been to a teenage kids birthday party. I can get bickering, and grit, and violence from *any* sci-fi feature, and sadly now it seems like Trek has followed suit and lost its original edge. It's not until the very final minute where a little bit of the original Trek feel is re-established, but for me that was far too little, far too late.There's some giant plot holes too, if you're actually thinking about what's going on. It seems like Abrams hoped that if he put enough glitz and dazzle on the screen, most people would entirely miss the fact that they are there. I guess his gamble was correct, since the film is currently standing at an 8.4 IMDb score.It's not all bad. Benedict Cumberbatch is an incredible, intense villain and the film is worth seeing for his performance alone. And as with the first, the rest of the cast is exceptional. There's nothing wrong with the acting, music, or look of this film... just a lot wrong with the script and the tone of the whole thing. If you're not a Star Trek fan, you'll likely enjoy it... it's big, frenetic, popcorn munching silliness. But if you are a Trek fan, particularly of the quieter explorations of the human condition that TNG did so well, then you might be pretty disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Into Darkness,"After watching this movie and in 3d, its was well worth it, loved the story and bringing in another original character was done with flare and tact, he played his part well, and gave some foundation to the original story.The action was great, and not a lot of time where you were bored watching this movie.I have watched all the original series, including the movies right through, and into the next generation and so on, and have found that this movie held true.After reading a review about the bra scene with Alice Eve I found this to pathetic, complaining about her being in her underwear and that it made no sense, Kirk always got his shirt off in the series always that ladies man, so why not have something similar in the movie.One thing I am disappointed about the Chris Pike, they way his life played out was not true to the series, in the first season ep 1 where Chris was captured on that world to be a zoo exhibit and then escaped, he then handed the captains chair over to Kirk in the following ep, and later on in the series, Chris was in a wheel/hover chair, unable to move, grown old and wasn't able to speak, and spock takes him back to that planet, where he is transformed back to youth (illusion) and lives happily with that girl he fell in love with.I felt that the movie didn't continue on this thread and changed this outcome, it would have been nice to stick closer to this than with the way they did in the movie.Saying this, the movie was certainly not let down by this, a great movie and cant wait to be able to own it, looking forward to having the whole collection of the star treks.The movie also had the many connections to the original series,and is funny if you know the original series and are able to make those connections.My son was surprised that we were understanding the movie more that others that didn't know the connections, so now he is into watching the old series before watching the movie, we felt because of this we got more out of the movie, so if you can, you should view the series before the movies.My hope is that they will make more movies and even further the series on TV if possible.I would recommend you all to go and see this movie, certainly worth it.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Whatever I was expecting it wasn't this!,"Oh my goodness I'm actually in shock. JJ Abrams has created not a just a Star Trek film but a true standalone film as well. I should probably add that his description is coming from a STAR WARS fan and so yes this may well be illegal but I actually enjoyed this film a lot! The first movie was entertaining and all, but it fell slightly short with regard to the action and the story and so we all came away from it saying ""great"" but not remembering it. This film still managed to retain the original highlights of the first which we all loved - the acting, the humour and the special effects but added a real feeling o heart to the proceedings which cam from a number of factors:Firstly the acting: Chris Pine was good in the first one but I felt he was trying a little too hard to go from zero-hero. In this one it's easy to identify he's found his character, it feels a lot more relatable and emotional. Zachary Quinto, delivered an awesome performance - which even draws a tear from some at one scene which I won't spoil for the benefit of any who haven't seen the film. Everyone upped their game but none more so than Simon Pegg - who's definitely taken the time to refine his Scottish accent but also his character as Scotty has a more predominant role in this story. But the stand out performance HAS to go to Mr Benedict Cumberbatch: he created a performance in which the audience could, in a way, feel sorry for him at one point - yet still manages but to be incredibly menacing with a villain who people want to see take on Kirk and Spock.The action is on a much larger scale with the battles in space but also on the ground - it's fair to say that the final fight in particular is reminiscent of the scene in attack of the clones when Anakin jumps between speeders, but it a lot more effective as we as the audience feel a lot more involved with that fight due to the raw emotion from the actors and the brilliant fight choreography.The script has been written so much better, so there are a lot less cheesy lines and a lot more decent ones.The only reason as to why this movie got a 9 out of 10 is because for me some characters were lost in terms of why they were there in this movie - Zoe Saldana is a great actress yet, as in the case of the first one, I simply didn't understand why she was there. The same can be said of Karl Urban's McCoy - a character who I'd previously liked in the first one but who struggles to shine in this one other than perhaps the last few scenes.Overall however even if you're no Trekkie - GO AND SEE THIS FILM, it's definitely worth it! And if this is a preview of things to come regarding Star Wars I can say we're in for a treat from Mr Abrams!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Does it get any better than this?,"No it does not. This movie had everything anyone could possibly want times mega 3D action to boot. As a long time Trekkie I couldn't be happier with the direction J.J. Abrams is taking the franchise. It is packed with a humorous reverence for all things original Star Trek, but adds so much more to the mix. The crew clicks well together just as the original crew did and the stories are fresh but also familiar. I don't want to spoil anything. This is a movie anyone with a strong heartbeat will enjoy.

'Star Trek' was an unexpected triumph and one of the best films of 2009. However, can lighting strike twice? Well, 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is superb evidence that it can, because not only is it a great movie, but also one of those rare cases where the sequel betters the already good predecessor.The film finds Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and the Enterprise crew begin to fracture as their most powerful enemy yet, a terrorist within Starfleet, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) declares a one-man war on the organisation. After a number of terrorist attacks, Kirk decides to embark on a manhunt to stop this ruthless villain.'Star Trek Into Darkness' opens with a blistering action sequence that sees the Kirk and 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban) fleeing from a tribe of fierce natives, while Spock (Zachary Quinto) descends into an erupting volcano. Brilliantly, the pace doesn't let up, it rattles along at the speed of a freight train (or more appropriately, a starship at warp speed). If anything, this sci-fi sequel confirms J.J. Abrams as a master of pacing – no scene is too long, too short or drags in any way. The action setpieces – from a gunfight in a maze of ruins to a chase through San Francisco – are truly breathtaking.But with so much action, is much space allotted for the ensemble cast? The answer, thankfully, is yes. The Kirk/Spock dynamic (passionate hot- head and impassionate man of logic) has always been at the very core of Star Trek's appeal and here, it is at its very best. Much of this is down to top-notch performances from Pine and Quinto, who continue to work wonderfully together, and also separately. The other cast members all get their moments to shine, whether it's Scotty (Simon Pegg) drunk or Bones' cracking one liners (""Jim, you don't leave a heist when the runaway car has a flat tire!"")A shining standout though, is Benedict Cumberbatch as the villainous Harrison. In the previous Trek instalment, Eric Bana's Nero made for a solid, if unremarkable foe; however such is not the case with Harrison. Cumberbatch is a formidably intimidating villain, made all the more menacing by his cold and calculating manner along with a sense of there being method to his madness.One of the best things about 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is the perfect balance it strikes between being one for the fans and also a film that newcomers can readily enjoy. For the Trekkers, there are clever and often funny nods to the franchise (Tribbles! Gorns! Red Shirts!), but for people who've never seen anything Trek-related before, this is just as accessible – ""The aim was to make a movie that could stand on its own terms"", Abrams outlined. This is a non-stop thrill-ride of a movie with three-dimensional characters, humour, rug-pulls, heart and plenty of lens flare. This isn't just a great sequel or a great 'Star Trek' movie; this is a great movie fullstop. 'Star Wars VII' is in very safe hands indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""star trek for people who hate Star Trek""","If you love the star trek franchise because it consistently delivers thought provoking interesting stories without the brutality and violence that Hollywood seems hooked on, you're going to be as disappointed as I was with this movie.It looked big, the acting was really good, but JJ Abrams for some unknown reason decided it was necessary to remove the essence of what makes Star Trek different and replace it with some Michael Bay antics. At times it was like watching someone play a video game.It was a really well made waste of time. No insight into the human condition, no thinking necessary, just eye candy and forgettable events.And that's a shame, cos there was some great acting going on here. all the cast delivered well especially Cumberbatch and Quinto, some great looking effects, but why bother? When interviewed on the daily show Abrams actually said he wanted to make this movie for all the people who didn't like Star Trek. Isn't that just the stupidest thing you've ever heard?",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A wild  ride through space,"I went to see the movie but was prepared not to really get excited by it. But watching this movie, I had a blast. And the audience applauded afterward. I was fortunate to see the very first episode of the original TV Star Trek. Became an instant fan forever. However, there were a few minor things that I think would have made it even better. The first one: Spock looked a lot like the original, but his method of delivering lines should have been more precise so he sounded less like the other crew members. I knew Leonard Nimoy at the Pasadena Playhouse School and even then his speech was perfectly clipped to play Spock. The second thing: The movie was a bit overdone. Some action scenes lasted too long. Overkill is not always that enjoyable. The third thing is that at the very end they should have said ""Course Captain?"" ""Second star to the right and straight on 'til morning"" Of course it's a quote from Peter Pan, but it's remembered just as much from Captain Kirk in Star Trek. It is incredible that a TV series that was canceled almost before it got a good start has lasted so long, and fought and won the hearts and minds of so many fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fantastic Sequel!!,"I wouldn't consider myself a Trekkie, but I loved the 2009 Star Trek. This movie had a lot of hype and I was one of them on board with it. It's safe to say, this movie surpassed my expectations!! I have a lot of good things to say about this, so in the words of a great man: Shall we begin?I will start with the acting. Everyone did a fantastic job. All did very well for their role in the movie, like in the 2009 version. However, things got interesting when Benedict Cumberbatch was announced as the main baddie. I love the guy, Sherlock is one of my favorite TV shows of all time and he kills it as Sherlock. When he was announced, I literally pooped my pants. When the first trailer came out, I was sold. He was one of the best parts about this movie. He had presence and was VERY menacing. Dude owns it as a bad guy.The SFX looked fantastic as usual (lens flares don't bother me). Nothing looked cheap, it made it feel more realistic (how I wished I watched it in IMAX) The story was simple enough, though a little rushed at the end. But it worked for this movie as it definitely feels like a part 2 of a series.One thing I like the mention is the sound. The music was great, the theme made it feel awesome. But the punches... my God, man! The punches felt very brutal. It was like... if the T-800 broke your bones by stomping on it, not the best description, but I'm going with it.Overall just a fantastic movie.I give this an A+It was better than the first one, to me. And in terms of sequels so far, I can say that Star Trek Into Darkness is a better sequel out now as compared to Iron Man 3.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This movie is a rare example of a sequel being better then the first one. The best film of the franchise. I say A-,"""Space, the final frontier..."" After saving Spock (Quinto) but disobeying orders Captain Kirk (Pine) is demoted. When a former member of Star Fleet, John Harrison, attacks headquarters and a close friend of Kirk's winds up dead he is chosen to lead a crew to find Harrison.

Nothing short of ideal blockbuster filmmaking,"Having inherited the keys to ""Star Wars,"" J.J Abrams has seen a rash of outbursts from skeptics in the last few months, picking up steam with this, the release of his second adventure with the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Surely one man cannot control both nerd worlds, right? Well, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" offers more proof why everyone should just let him try.Abrams has an acute understanding of creating universally enjoyable entertainment not really seen since Steven Spielberg in his heyday. His use of mystery as a tool to pull viewers in creates the sensation of a two-hour thrill ride, which is essentially what we get with ""Into Darkness."" Equal credit goes –of course—to his team, especially writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof, who each add yet another shining bullet point to their respective resumes.Much of the formula that made the initial ""Star Trek"" reboot a success gets implemented in this script. The pace of the film never lags, delivering persistent action, suspense, mystery or some combination of the three, stopping only for character-developing moments (and usually ending them with a sudden bang). The ace in the hole—and what makes ""Into Darkness"" a better film by a slim margin—is Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain.If you're familiar at all with Cumberbatch's work, particularly in the title role on BBC's ""Sherlock,"" you knew that at some point he would play a significant villain and absolutely nail it. Fortunately for ""Star Trek"" fans, Abrams got the first chance to unleash Cumberbatch on a mass-scale audience. His role allows him to be the perfect combination of a formidable physical and mental threat, and the script has you clawing for the truth from the onset that it only magnifies Cumberbatch's strengths. Eric Bana's Nero in the previous film pales in comparison.""Into Darkness"" continues much of the focus of the earlier film, adding complexity to James Kirk's (Chris Pine) gutsy and arguably reckless decisionmaking, Spock's (Zachary Quinto) inability to feel emotions and the friendship between the two. After the opening scene mission on the planet Nibiru in which Kirk violates Starfleet directives to save Spock, Kirk loses to the Enterprise back to its former captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood), but his probation doesn't last long when Starfleet's own, John Harrison, (Cumberbatch) blows a Starfleet archive in London and essentially declares war with the federation. Running at the chance to catch Harrison, Kirk plunges the Enterprise and its crew right into the middle of a deadly no-win scenario.There's a lot of who's really the bad guy manipulation/mind games on the script's part that doesn't exactly fit together nicely all the time in terms of what's really going on, but the level of danger and urgency never fades and that makes ""Into Darkness"" an ideal blockbuster. Once again, Abrams and co. aren't afraid to pick up the Enterprise like a hyper toddler and shake and smash it and its crew until there seems to be no hope (except for that perfect window to save the day that was set up by some earlier occurrence in the movie).As Abrams has said multiple times in interviews, he was never a fan of ""Star Trek"" growing up, so he aimed to make these films accessible to a wider audience. ""Into Darkness"" definitely is, with plenty of goodies for fans of varying degrees. A sequence on the Klingon home world of Kronos satisfies the hard sci-fi and ""Trek"" fans' curiosity about the extent of Abrams' take on this universe, while also teasing its potential. You're going to want more Klingons after this film.Right there is what ought to give ""Star Wars"" fans some confidence in Abrams: the curiosity factor, the scratching at the surface of the lore that attracts a geek following and appeasing it, while at the same time still delivering a focused, entertaining film that emphasizes the importance of the characters. The biggest problem with the ""Star Wars"" prequels as compared to the original trilogy is the poor quality of the characters and relationships. Just restoring that element to the mix guarantees a certain measure of success with the new ""Star Wars"" films.""Star Trek"" is in a really good place after ""Into Darkness."" The first two films work together in terms of the character relationships and themes, and while there will always be room to test the bounds of Kirk and Spock's friendship, to use an example, the door has been opened for the Enterprise to explore anything and everything Gene Roddenberry's rich universe has to offer.~Steven CThanks for reading!

One of the best Star Trek movies,"I just seen this movie yesterday evening, and i must say that this is one of the best Star Trek movies i have ever seen.This is the first time that the second movie is as good as the first (i mean of the reboot movie Star Trek: The Future Begins 2009), normally it was 1st good second not, third good fourth not, and so on and so on, but with Star Trek Into Darkness it's as good as the first (maybe even better).And it has the Star Trek feeling, Star Trek fans knows what i mean, you can look at a old Star Trek movie like Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (which i love the most of the Kirk/Spock movies), and then look at this movie and have the same great feeling, and the blink at the old movies you get when you look at this movie is also great, and that they stayed with the same music tune as the first one (Star Trek: The Future Begins) is also great, and at the end of the movie you hear the old music from the old movies.And i can't wait to see a third movie of this great reboot movies series, this is a hit so i almost know for sure that they are gone make a third movie.If you like a good Sci-Fi movie then you must see this movie, this is i think the best Sci-Fi movie of 2013.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Into Darknrss,"The galaxy again needs saving and the crew of the star ship Enterprise is save the day. In Star Trek: Into Darkness, Starfleet is in danger from a terrorist who seeks revenge and destruction upon them, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch, Sherlock). Captain Kirk (Chris Pine, Unstoppable), Spock (Zachary Quinto, Heroes), and Doctor McCoy (Keith Urban, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King) are determined to bring him to justice. Even if it means entering enemy space to the evil Klingon homework, Kronos. J.J. Abrams returns to his revival of the science fiction epic: Star Trek, originally created by Gene Roddenberry, to deliver us this fast-paced, space-exploring film. It is a film with acting worthy enough for fans, but I am disappointed with its plot and the use of the characters in it. The terrorist, John Harrison, seeks revenge on Starfleet and plots the destruction of the archives in London. Seeking Harrison, Kirk and the Enterprise crew seek him on the planet, Kronos. After a battle where Harrison nearly single handedly defeats a host of battle-hardened Klingons, he surrenders to save his crew who are, unknowingly to Kirk, on the broken down Enterprise. There he is questioned by Kirk and is revealed to be the legendary Khan, a genetically engineered war criminal bred to be superior in everything. One of my biggest problems with this movie is that the role of the villain isn't solely on Khan, but is partially also on Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller, Robocop), who backstabs the Enterprise to silence Khan. My problem is that Khan is THE villain; the greatest adversary the Enterprise of the original series has ever faced, later emphasized by Spock Prime (Leonard Nemoy). The character Khan is fueled by the need for revenge. In Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan, he has the urge to find and kill Captain Kirk, portrayed by William Shatner. Now, in Into Darkness he is filled with rage to kill Admiral Marcus. My expectation of the film was that it would be similar to Wrath of Khan, however it fell short. My hope for the future of this franchise is that Khan will return in some way to seek Kirk. Also, I am disappointed with Spock's use of emotion. Emotionlessness is a staple of the character Spock and to break it is cruel. One of the best castings of the film is Zachary Quinto as Spock, butthe plot just destroyed the character. For example, having a romantic relationship with Uhuru. Spock is supposed to find emotion confusing and useless, not show it actively. Some people might argue that Spock is emotional because of the death of his mother and home planet, Vulcan. This is a plausible explanation, but Vulcan's are known for their control of emotion or something very bad could happen. J.J. Abrams continues to show his skills as a director. The special effects are superior to any movie of the year. For acting, Benedict Cumberbatch makes his first appearance to the American public after a successful run with BBC on the show Sherlock as Sherlock Holmes. In Into Darkness, Cumberbatch is outstanding as Khan. Keith Urban showed great skill playing McCoy with using great metaphors, a characteristic of McCoy. The role of Captain Kirk was reprised by Chris Pine, whose performance was adequate. Overall, J.J. Abrams uses the alternate reality to successfully revive Star Trek. Into Darkness is a great movie for the fans but compared to the original films, there are major flaws in the film. I recommend seeing this movie to anyone, so they can enjoy it and also critique it like I have. Hopefully, Khan will return.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Movie.A must-see!!,"Well, this movie was absolutely fantastic. Star Trek will continue to raise new generations!!! I believe that it has earned a position into the top-3 of Star Trek movies(the others are First Contact(1996) and Nemesis (2002), the first with the best villains, the Borg and the latter with the best to my opinion space battle ,between Enteprise E and Scimitar).This movie has everything!!! The story is great which is an adaptation of ''The Wrath of Khan'' script and mixed up with other elements such as Admiral Marcus and his plans.The acting was good. Chris Pine(Kirk) and Zachary Quinto(Spock) perform in a very good level. Simon Pegg(Scotty) is great and incredibly funny and he excels in his role. But the true star of the movie is KHAN played by Benedict Cumberbatch.This guy is awesome. His is the best villain we have ever seen in Star Trek. He is ruthless, cold, merciless, genius but also very well back-rounded and it makes you feel sorry for him when his talks about his companions.Another point is given for the love-affair between Spock and Uhura. It was something that was missing from previous movies(with the exception of Diana Troy an Riker in Nemesis).The music was great like the previous movie and it's nice to see how Star Trek music has changed through the years by remembering the original series theme. The change is to the best and it adds to the movie.I do not know why some people hate it. I mean it's all there...the mystery, the exploration, Gene Roddenberry's goals with the addition of new visual effects which make it more beautiful and a little more action in order to introduce Star Trek to new fans and make them watch the series, without changing the original ideals o f the Star Trek Franchise.Great movie which deserves a little more respect.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Disappointment,"Star Trek Into Darkness was releases last week of 2013 and is the sequel to 2009′s Star Trek remake. After the success in 2009, J.J. Abrams and his crew had very large shoes to fill, and didn't necessarily do the job. As much as I wanted to love this movie, it being a sequel to Star Trek and casting one of my favorite actors as the largest Star Trek villain of all time, sadly I was severely disappointed.The acting was the strong point of this movie, aside from the special effects. These actors had done an excellent job playing these legendary characters in 2009, and had the great opportunity of reprising their roles. All of the returning actors, specifically Zachary Quinto and Simon Pegg, did very good work in their return to space making Into Darkness still and enjoyable film. The only newcomer to the leading cast was Benedict Cumberbatch playing the great Khan (I would say Spoiler Alert except everyone already knew this was going to happen.) Cumberbatch is one of my favorite currently rising actors, I have especially enjoyed him in the BBC miniseries Sherlock and in 2011′s Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, so I was very anxious to see him take on a role in the Sci-Fi spectrum. Again I was disappointed, not because Cumberbatch wasn't good, honestly he did the best with what he was given, but because the writers seemed to really bring his character down. Which brings me to my next point.In 2009, the greatest strength of Star Trek was the writers and their ability to imitate the original TV series while adding modern intrigue. In 2013 however, the writing failed and brought down the movie entirely, even though it was the exact same writers with the addition of Damon Lindelof. One of the most enjoyable parts of Star Trek in 2009 was the almost perfect replication of the characters, creating dialogue and situations that reflected the characters all those Trekkies knew so well. This success was dropped for Into Darkness, as it seemed the writers made the severe mistake of imitating the characters from 2009 rather than imitating the original characters, allowing the very few mistakes from 2009 to be maximized. The story also dropped calibers. In the remake, a very complex story that was still easy to follow and reflected all the characters personalities perfectly, yet still being believable circumstances, was made, which essentially made the movie the success it was. For Into Darkness though, the story was mediocre with often clichéd scenes, that made the story predictable and even boring. The best idea for the story was to bring the character of Khan back, which was a good idea, but that's as far as they got. Their follow through with Khan was very lousy, he was actually hardly in the movie at all. When his character was defeated, which was in a rather inconsistent way for his character, I was very surprised as I thought that the movie had plenty of time left, until I looked at my watch and realized that I had been watching zero plot or character development for two hours. Unfortunately, director J.J. Abrams never seemed to step in and make this script that had been written poorly a success, as I realize more and more that Abrams is a technical director and seems to focus more on the special effects of the film. Which I must note, was very good.I really wanted Star Trek Into Darkness to be very good; I loved Star Trek from 2009 and the fact that they had brought Benedict Cumberbatch into the mix for the sequel excited me even more. However, I was not pleased by the product of the film-makers, and was overall very let down. Oscar nomination have not yet come out for this year, and won't for a number of months, but any real Academy Awards success for this film is unlikely. It will probably pick up some nominations for visual effects and sound work, but definitely nothing else.I give Star Trek Into Darkness a very disappointed 7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fast Octane Fun,"Being a little detached and almost ignorant of the cult classic TV Show, I left cinema with the joyful sensation of having enjoyed a octane fun-packed film.With no past experience of the franchisee to count on, JJ Abrams directs a beautifully shot film with special effects that leaves one optimistic about his chances of making the upcoming Star Wars reboot a success. Although borderline at times, I believe the comedy humour worked well with Simon Pegg and Anton Yelchin proving many a raised smile.Plot wise the movie simply doesn't hold up, but you are rarely given a chance to digest this fact, by the fast-paced nature of the plot. The other possible negative aspect of film for me was Cumberbatch's performance, after many a Sherlock episode I was left a little underwhelmed by this soulless, rigid, statue like performance.Kudos to Mr JJ Abrams for rebooting a cult classic to new and old followers.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very Good,"Khan ( Benedict Cumberbatch) makes his appearance known by destroying a library archive and also Starfleet headquarters. It is up to Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and his crew to hot-wire the Enterprise and run down Khan to finish him off.Okay, folks here we go again. Remember this is a reboot, it's not your father's Star Trek. Yeah, I know: tough getting used to.This was very good despite some criticisms. Actually, too much CGI, and Special Effects, - and they were terrific - but that's the trend these days. We still don't like the relationship between Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) as it's just too forced and no chemistry comes out of it. Spock's explanations are cookie-cutter spiels that we have heard way too often. Nothing new. And, when there is an emergency at hand he'll go on for 2-minutes of why or why not and quote regulations. Yes, the old Spock (Nimoy) did the same thing, but did it quicker. See? This is the perfect example of why we like Capt Kirk who runs on gut feelings and not many words. Old Mr. Sulu (George Takei) always said, ""Aye, Captain"" but the new Mr Sulu (John Cho) says, ""Yes, sir."" We like ""Aye, Captain"" better.What else did you not like? I did not like that the head of Starfleet Command, Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller), goes rogue. We like having confidence in the men at the top. This was uncalled for. Dr. McCoy um "" Bones"" (Karl Urban) played his part exactly like the old Bones (Deforest Kelley) would have. In other words, he complained about everything, but he needed to be more animated. Next time, okay? One day we'd like to see Bruce Greenwood get more screen time. He played Christopher Pike, the first Captain of the Enterprise.Breaths of fresh air: Scotty (Simon Pegg) who said the same thing the old Scotty (Doohan) would say, but the New Scotty has better facial expressions. The other breath of fresh air was Benedict Clumberbatch. We enjoyed his presence, commanding voice and superior delivery. Great job. If any of you saw the movie: ENEMY MINE, then you will enjoy Captain Kirk partnering up with Khan for a brief mission. Say, what?Still very good, even though we get a lot of redundancy. Hey, let's move on and assume the audience knows the characters in and out. Okay? Stop repeating the same things over and over again.Old Spock (Leonard Nimoy) makes an appearance giving guidance to New Spock. This needs to stop or just bring the old crew back and we'd all be the happier for that. Bringing the Old Spock back was not necessary. Nice to see him, but still: not necessary.Chris Pine is a very good Captain Kirk. And, this is hard to believe, but at times he almost looked like William Shatner. Like I said: hard to believe.And, guess what are back? Tribbles. Yes, you read that correctly, and they play an important part later on. Hard to believe, I know.All in all, this was very good. The plot is a good one when you hear Khan spell it all out for Captain Kirk.I know I have to get over comparing new Apples to old Apples. Hey, I 'm working on it. It's just not easy. These reboots bring out the ""yeah, but "" in me. I'm working on it. .. (8/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only the S-word was heard at times. Not often.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"OK, but a little disappointing","I loved the JJ Abrams' 2009 Star Trek reboot, so I'm not one the haters of the new franchise. I though Abrams had injected a welcome new energy and scope to the ST universe. The film was fun and inventive and had me looking forward to what they were going to do next. A sequel is always a difficult matter, because you have to deal with people's expectations and those are often impossible to match. It seems to me that Into Darkness suffers from the need of giving MORE of everything that made the first installment so successful: more action, more CGI, more noises, more jokes, more emotional scenes. There's just not any time to breathe in this film. The action scenes, for instance, are just too confusing and noisy. I would have preferred a more classic and less frenzy approach to the action shooting. This is Star Trek, not Jason Bourne. I also think that Abrams tried too hard create bombastic emotional moments for the audience. Personally, I think it is too soon for that. This is only the second film of the new franchise, and, since the first one was more of a pilot, we are watching the beginning of the adventures of the Entreprise. As the film starts, the whole crew is already falling apart. Too soon for that. It's too bad, because the plot had great potential and the villain played by the great Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the best I've seen in a ST movie. When he's on screen, the film grows. Overall, Into Darkness is a decent piece of entertainment, but one that would have benefited of a tighter script, more focused on the story and the villain.

Chix Chat on Film review: Keep on Trekking baby,"This second film in the reimagined Star Trek movie franchise has everything that a Trekker could ever want and more. For someone like me who grew up with the original television series and then went where no (wo)man has gone before with the feature films, I never expected that the stories would evolve into something with such 'wow' factor as J.J. Abrams and team have crafted. Once again my assertion that Mr. Abrams is my favorite and the best contemporary director has been proved to be well deserved. But he obviously has a deep insight into how to translate the dialogue from Orci and Denioff into a spectacular vision. This film has the perfect mix of action, adventure, comedy, romance, drama, and suspense. To balance out all of the emotions that were experienced in this story and create a film with an engaging plot and stunning visuals is a major feat. I was surprised to learn who the primary antagonist was, and the manner in which the story was woven around him made the story even more intriguing. I was thrilled that Uhura (Zoe Saldana) had an opportunity to really showcase her linguistics and as Catt said, it was time the Klingon's came into the picture. I've been a bit tainted when it comes to away missions because of Galaxy Quest I always consider crewman six's inevitable doom. Prior to now I did not feel as if the scale of the Enterprise or the hardware like the warp core were appropriately conveyed. Seeing the scale of engineering and the other areas of the enterprise left me awe stricken, because after all, the ship is as much a star of the franchise as the characters. My only complaint with this film was the scoring, in some of the sequences the theme music was just too over the top and made me feel like I needed to find the volume knob so that I could turn it down and refocus on the film. I get it that the music gets louder so the audience recognizes how intense the situation is, but that little trick wasn't necessary since the action scenes were full throttle and none of the excitement would have been lost if the music had been at a moderate tone. I have anxiously waited four years for this film and was utterly thrilled with the end result. I give it a green light",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not an all time classic,"Even within Sci-Fi genre, this movie is barely mediocre. What disturbs me most is that it has virtually anything to do with the original Star Treks and its sequels. The characters do have similar names, but that's it. Star Trek has always (or at least most of the times) been based on a good story, not spectacular tricks and some van Damme style violence. But in this movie the actual storyline is thin as rice paper and its more like a C-class action movie. And since this is supposed to be in the time line BEFORE the ST-original series, why the bridge had to be designed to be so futuristic? In general the whole idea of making something preceding the original series sounds not so good. Since obviously the saga will go on even after this movie, I'd let the old crew into history and made something like a 3rd generation using the characters of both DS9 and Voyager and some totally new ones. Kathryn Janeway's character could have been used as the high command of the whole Federation Starfleet.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Be it for the action, the villain or if you're a Trekkie, everyone can boldly go Into Darkness","Rebooting a pop culture cult classic with a 50-year legacy is no mean feat, but successfully doing so twice while juggling loyalists' expectations and attracting fresh eyeballs is an accomplishment. Director J.J. Abrams' 2009 take on the original science fiction TV series more commonly popular among a niche audience transformed it into fun mainstream fare, producing a box office hit that surpassed all previous outings. Remarkably, most of its success was driven by overseas sales, an achievement considering that Star Trek films are known for not travelling too well beyond American shores.In this 2013 follow-up, we take off with a sprint in middle of a mission on an alien planet. Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Dr Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban) are escaping from an aggressive horde of indigenous beings on the brink of civilization. In the meantime, resident paragon of reason and truth First Officer Spock (Zachary Quinto) is tasked with suppressing an erupting volcano with a freezing device. This prologue will feel like déjà vu for viewers who caught the nine-minute trailer preceding the IMAX screenings of The Hobbit back in December. While Spock navigates the complicated waters of a committed relationship with romantic interest Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Kirk lives it up as a bachelor, bedding and picking up attractive aliens at his convenience. The core dynamic between the two leads is quickly established, playing Kirk's brawn and passionate ""leave no man behind"" approach against Spock's adamant reliance on rules and obligations. What makes a great leader? It may be the unlikely melding of these two extreme perspectives.Despite the overall success of the mission, Kirk's superior / mentor Rear Admiral Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) reprimands him for disobeying direct orders, after Spock submits the mission report without his knowledge. This results in his demotion, but the arrangement turns out to be temporary when the bombing of a secret Starfleet intelligence facility and subsequent acts of terrorism throw the Federation into chaos. The adversary is identified to be a certain ex-officer John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), who has gone into hiding in hostile Klingon territory.An enraged Kirk regains command of his ship, the USS Enterprise, and in typical fashion goes right into the fray on a mission to kill. Armed with 72 undetectable missiles of questionable origin and an entire ship crew advising against the operation, there is every indication that things will take a dangerous turn. With the help of the alluring weapons specialist Dr Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), the crew engage an opponent who's practically the equivalent of Superman.Chronicled on an alternate timeline, Into Darkness is a product of creative tinkering with familiar characters while retaining the spirit of creator Gene Roddenberry's stories. It's easy to draw parallels with today's newspaper headlines and political discourse with its accompanying moral quandaries – Star Trek story lines have traditionally been analogies for real-life current affairs – be it the morality of weapons of mass destruction, what constitutes justice, the costs of revenge or whether the utilitarian reasoning is necessarily the best way forward.Although the motivations of individual characters receive screen time, this doesn't translate to greater clarity. Cumberbatch's character in particular could have used a more compelling and convincing backstory, considering how the entire movie (even the promotional material) apparently revolves around him. While the big reveal was delivered well by the British thespian, more attention could have been paid to fleshing out the trigger points and rationale.Into Darkness is polished to such a high shine that it's almost blinding: Gleaming spaceships calmly sail against a backdrop of black space and the impeccably tailored uniforms are so crisp it's distracting. Perhaps even more distracting are the lens flares reflecting off nearly every frame, which felt artificial when used so liberally, despite fitting the space travel premise by approximating solar glares and connoting ""hi-tech. That said, the action is first- class, with thrilling aerial chases, fight scenes and set pieces of total destruction that justify the price of an IMAX ticket.Scene-stealing star of the movie Cumberbatch is the cool personification of warped morality: empty of empathy, brilliantly manipulative and ruthlessly efficient both mentally and physically. Having bulked up considerably since his last outings in War Horse and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, he rises up to the occasion for his numerous action scenes and fully deserves the praise his co-stars have lavished on him. Quinto delicately portrays Spock's emotional growth and journey towards maturity, spurring a few memorable laugh-out-loud scenes. Suitably rough-around-the-edges, Pines' earnestness is put to good use as a leader whose first instinct is to protect the ones he loves despite his heavy responsibilities.As Abrams has shared, the film wasn't designed solely for die-hard Trekkies but targeted to movie fans in general. It establishes itself as a standalone movie or it can interpreted as part of the overall series, ultimately appealing to the mass audience as a whole. One shouldn't let unfamiliarity with the original series hinder a chance to catch this.www.moviexclusive.com",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Using Celebrity when not necessary,"The new cast of Star Trek is awesome, but the filmmakers seemed to think they needed the great BC to take over the focus.

"Star Trek - Into Darkness, I can feel it!","So it came - the long awaited 2nd Star Trek movie of the ""new"" reboot of the Star Trek franchise.I will not say much, but those of you who know Star Trek OGS - and have seen Wrath of Kahn (1982)(I've seen it 11-12 times, my favorite Star Trek movie EVER - those who have seen it once, I urge you to see that movie several times, it just grows on you and gets better and better) - will find this movie so exciting and experience a major nostalgic joy- ride. I felt that in this movie, the characters more CLEARLY show the characteristics shown in the original cast. Bones had this serious dictation, talking in metaphors - Scotty's dialect and personality was more clear - I felt this about all the other characters as well: Uhura, Sulu, Chekov and Spock. That being said, I simply have to bow down and give huge credit to Benedict Cumberbatch for his amazing portrayal of Riccardo Montalban's legendary Kahn character from both the OGS and Wrath of Kahn. I can guarantee you - Montalban would have gotten the chills if he had lived to see Cumberbatch's portrayal of his own character - just pure perfection in regards to acting and he stayed true to Montalban delicate and calm portrayal of Kahn. Just pure goose-bump acting right there!Trekkies, you KNOW what to do. This movie will bring you back and take you forward - hopefully, not INTO darkness, but closer to the light.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A thrilling adventure!,"STID is a great Trek film which will please new fans and old. Perhaps not the purists though but I will get to them. I watched it a second time today (in 3D) and enjoyed it as much as the first time. Again, I benchmark the use of 3D against Dredd 3D and in this effort I would say it is not quite up to par. It's not bad, but it is just used the way it is in most 3D films these days, to add image depth and immersion.On the film itself. I like JJ's handling of the franchise. He also has a budget to make this incarnation which the previous films could only have dreamed of. So you do get to see stuff you always wanted to see in the previous trek film franchises. So again you get mind bending special effects and settings never before seen such as Earth (at ground level), Kronos (never really fully explored much since ST:TNG/DS9) and the use of ships within planet atmosphere's (and under an ocean!).Well versed trekkies will note many of the changes to the original timeline again in this film and those changes influence the story to a large degree, particularly where the antagonist is concerned.JJ has also appeased long time fans be getting in a lot of character development and the actors seem to pull it off very well. I note it only because this is an essential element to a trek film, particularly where these characters are concerned and a failure by a cast to meld properly (excuse the pun) has caused problems in syndication (NX-01 crew!). The character arcs and intense story work extremely hard to 'fit' into a movie sized meal though and the intensity is maintained from start to finish. You don't get the audience fatigue like you may have gotten from The Dark Knight, but it was close for me. There are some elements to the film which don't take themselves to seriously though and the hat tipping to the original timeline is included. Not sure I like that, but it's not a distraction for me........ except for......you guessed it.......the purists......who have been quite vocal since the film debut.An open letter to anti-JJ Star Trek purists.Dear fellow Nerds,FFS let it go. This is not your father's Star Trek. This franchise had to change to survive, and while I agree with you that the Rodenberry legacy has been de-emphasised to some degree, it is not totally lost. Surely you must realise that today almost two decades on from when Star Trek on the big and little screen peaked, that any Trek is good Trek. Stop being a bunch of whiney andorians and bring back the love. Or continue bitching....it doesn't matter.......you know you'll be going to the cinema to see it anywayYours Faithfully,King Nerd.Overall though I rate the film a solid 9/10. Good character development thanks to competent actors, awesome special effects and never-before- seen sequences and a great story which compliments the entire history of the franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as satisfying as the first one but still worth seeing on the big screen,"Because of the first one this became one of the most anticipated summer sequel. And for the most part it met my expectation, although a bit flawed. Usually the second installment is the one that really brings out what a movie like this is all about. Since the build up is done with the first installment, now it's about how the good guys utilize what they have to fight against the bad guys. Without much in the way of showing it. Since it's usually the third installment that tries to go grand-scale and sometimes even conclude the story. And a lot of times it has a stand out enemy for the good guys to battle, which this one most definitely has. However despite it having fan service and a lot of cool battles and tactics going for it. I just didn't find it as absorbing as the first one. It's however more focused on the bond between Kirk and Spock, with more strategic battle tactics and a arch-nemesis that is not only smarter intellectually but physically stronger. And is a very difficult opponent even with the whole starship fleet combined. Benedict Cumberbatch is just awesome as Khan who is a real formidable opponent for the whole starship fleet. Overall this is a entertaining and exciting summer sequel that is worth seeing on the big screen despite it having a story that isn't all that well interwoven and just isn't as satisfying as the first one.7.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""To boldly go where no man has gone before""","Director J.J. Abrams brings yet another adrenaline-filled sci-fi movie to the big screen. Abrams once again proves himself in each technicality of the reboot he took up of this wonderful franchise which erstwhile film makers couldn't work on. The previous 11 Star Trek were all good to watch nevertheless the TV series were way better, but this latest Star Trek movie is surely the best of all. This is a decent reboot for the franchise. So ""Set your phasers to stun!""True to Abram's panache, at 132 minutes, this film is fairly long. There wasn't a moment where u'll feel that the movie was lagging. The cast's performance was impressive. Explorers as they are (in role), the characterization of each role were exemplary.Talking about the movie cast - more screen sharing time for each character not unlike the previous one, the antagonistic KHAN portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch (the guy from SHERLOCK) was the one I loved a lot. Cumberbatch has nailed his character and I loved every frame in which he was present.The growing bond of friendship between Kirk and Spock was handled very well. The 3D effects were just awesome, and well executed. Film score by Michael Giacchino was fitting well in every scene. The cinematography was exceptional too - that and BGM is good enough.""Live Long and Prosper \\//""I give it a 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More of the same on the USS Enterprise,"After J.J. Abrams' impressive 2009 reboot of Star Trek, I found myself eagerly awaiting the next installment. With a little fine tuning to the quality of the script and giving some depth to some of the main characters, Star Trek could have become a classic. The issues with the first film I thought would be addressed for the sequel, making it far superior to an already great film. Unfortunately, it all turns out to be more of the same. Star Trek Into Darkness meets most expectations while exceeding very few. Like a truly great sequel, everything feels back and in its proper place. The cast members all feel comfortable in their given roles, almost similar to watching the TV show. You know where they all belong. This is an improvement on the original, which squeezed the crew into their roles on the Enterprise much too quickly. Kirk (Chris Pine) is more tolerable in this film. His frat boy mentality, while still present, is dialed back a bit now, so it feels like a characteristic more than a personality. This opens up opportunities to add some dimension to Kirk's character. Unfortunately, the film just doesn't take that risk. He is a young (inexperienced) and reckless leader, who is often brave and selfless when it comes to his crew. His role is as safe and cliché as ever and adds nothing new to the part. This is, regretfully, how most of the characters end up filling their roles. Particularly Scotty (Simon Pegg), whose sole purpose is comedic relief. It's frustrating because as funny as he is (he actually is!), the character is nothing more than a walking one-liner waiting to happen. Most egregious however, is Carol (Alice Eve), which, upon first introduction, I thought was going to be a strong female character. This opportunity, as quickly becomes evident, is completely squandered as she is reduced to nothing more than eye candy and jokes for Kirk and Bones (Karl Urban). It would have been better, to not introduce her character at all, as she is completely unnecessary.Even the villain, Khan, played by the magnificent Benedict Cumberbatch, is a disappointment, albeit to a much lesser degree. He ends up appearing more interesting than he actually is, mainly due to Cumberbatch's acting abilities. When we are first acquainted, Khan exudes an aura of mystery and menace. I still have goosebumps from when he says, ""I am Khan!"". This feeling doesn't last however. Khan flourishes in the shadows; his ambiguity is what makes him successful. As his layers slowly strip away, his motives become weaker and in the end nothing is left but disappointment. In this sense, Khan becomes a metaphor for the entire film; the build up is fantastic, but the movie cannot resolve its many facets successfully. Exception to this is the gifted Zachary Quinto, who plays Spock. You can tell that Spock is the character that the screenwriters (Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, & Damon Lindelof) enjoyed writing about the most because he is the only well-developed character in the movie. The best scenes develop out of his cracks of human emotion hidden behind his tough Vulcan exterior. These are brought out from his relationships he shares with the film's main characters: his love for Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and why he hides his emotions from her, his bromance which blossoms into a deep friendship with Kirk, and his rage with Khan. Once again, Leonard Nimoy, makes a cameo as Spock from the future, which is one of my favorite parts of the original. However here, it feels unnecessary, and I wished it was scratched. His purpose here is to give insight into Khan. The revelations he gives, should have come about naturally through the movie, instead of all at once, adding more suspense to the film.I felt that the film didn't know how to bring all its wonderful pieces together for the end. A good example of this is the relationship between Kirk and Spock. Throughout the movie, the relationship slowly evolves but it falls apart in its climax. The story ends up faltering to make room for some soap opera-esque drama. There are ways to display the friendship sentiment differently and more suitably. The film looks fantastic. One of the key perks of Abrams' first Star Trek was the look of it. Into Darkness, takes the alluring action from the first movie and amps it up. Space looks as gorgeous as ever and all the ships and equipment have a brilliant sheen to them. The action set pieces, particularly the volcano in the opener, are beautifully designed and staged. The screenplay here is also an improvement over the original. I was impressed by how much funnier this movie was than the first, which tried often and failed. On the whole, the story is a marked improvement over the first installment, even with its hiccups. And before the end, where all the various plot pieces and character relationships don't quite fall into place, the movie functions at top level. Maybe the film is called Into Darkness because it works best there.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Star Trek Episode II: Attack of K...,"Four years have passed since J. J. Abram rebooted the Star Trek franchise with spectacular results. We finally have a solid sequel for all to enjoy.I'm no Trexpert but I know common tropes like Dr. McCoy's cantankerous outbursts or the tribbles when I see them. Chris Pine is a wonderful actor but the script still hasn't furnished him with enough material or classy moments to outshine the likes of Zachary Quinto and Benedict Cumberbatch. Yes, he can bed alien babes, get into fist fights and hang from dizzying heights but we have yet to see him display the tactical skills and strength of character that made Shatner such an iconic Captain Kirk.Then again, Pine is doing very well at shouldering an immense burden. The movie is quite staggering in action and scale. Unlike the modest budgets of the space-faring action films in the 80s Abrams has been entrusted with a mind-boggling $230 million. Big money can be a big turn off since it usually implies complacency or compromise.The creators are a teeny-wee bit guilty on both counts, but a bit of pandering is forgivable. The pressure to make back the money, not to mention the moral responsibility of pleasing all the hard-core fans, must be immense. He did seem fatigued during the London stage of the publicity gauntlet and apologised in advance to those who think he has compromised on essence of Roddenberry's creation.If one tries to judge this film on the ""classic"" standard of Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan (or even The Empire Strikes Back) then it pales into comparison. This is not the nostalgia talking here: it is a fact borne out a better script, better dialogue, better editing, and superior score by James Horner.It maybe better to compare Star Trek into Darkness favourably to Episode II: Attack of the Clones. Both films start with a terrorist attack on a capital city, followed by an assassination attempt on a high-ranking political leader. The villain is then tracked across space to a remote location where genetically-altered soldiers are waiting to be activated for a war fabricated by a secondary villain.As a Lucas toy boy I must say this film is leaps and bounds better. The scene where Spock and Uhura fight a superhuman bad guy on the roof of a hovering junk ship tops the pursuit of the bounty hunter on Coruscant and brings the Spock-Uhura dynamic to a nice conclusion.The Kirk-Spock bromance is spot on once again and a scene where they bicker in an elevator brought to my mind a scene of Anakin and Obi-Wan (only much better of course).There are course numerous other visual similarities to other sci-fi and fantasy genres like Mass Effect, Battlestar Galactica, or The Avengers, which have either been imitated consciously or have (more likely) seeped in through a sort of creative osmosis. And Peter Weller appears too, 'nuff said.Despite the healthy mix of influences and sources of inspiration there is something not quite right about this film besides the obvious overuse of lens flares and over-the-top action set pieces (the film STARTS with Spock in erupting volcano!)I'm sure that critics and die-hard fans will identify the film's weaknesses in the weeks ahead. For some viewers Into Darkness may seem like a step backwards after a successful reboot; much like Quantum of Solace or Sherlock Holmes 2: Game of Shadows.Yes, there are plot holes, missed opportunities and ways this film could have been elevated to classic status had a bit more thought been put into the script/screenplay. One the biggest disappointments (for me) was not ending the film with Kirk returning to the Enterprise after a stint in hospital only to find the bridge crawling with tribbles.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Saturday matinée action movie 75+,"A visceral follow up to the reboot of a few years back (it actually does seem too long a break for a franchise like this), this is an action packed movie well suited to gourmet popcorn. There is a plot...but only having walked out of the theatre just over two hours ago, I'm stuffed if I can coherently describe what the drama is all about. In other words, I suspect that Mr. Spock would have a field day with the logic of this movie. In any case, the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise must travel to enemy territory in order to capture a human villain responsible for the destruction of a Starfleet building in London. Things do not go to plan, as the saying goes. No doubt the seeds of subsequent sequels are sown in this movie.As far as Star Trek movies go, this one is entertaining but I'm not sure how much repeat viewing it has due to its confusing narrative...or at least I don't think it would be repeated viewing in a small space of time. Of the original cast Star Trek movies, I most enjoyed the one about saving whales (whatever that one was called). I'm guessing this movie will also serve as the grounds for a reboot of a critically acclaimed original cast Star Trek movie. However, that one seemed to presuppose knowledge of the original cast TV series (which was before my time and I've yet to see)...and that won't be the case for the reboot...which is good.Any criticisms of this movie I have are minor...it's boy's own adventure material...absurd action scenes where you really could imagine Mr. Spock saying ""That's not safe!""...if he wasn't doing such derring do himself...which he does! For the reboot, I do remember Leonard Nimoy making an appearance in that...as he does in this sequel...which makes me wonder about the mechanics of his character's appearances and interaction with the rebooted crew. The villain of this movie also seems fancifully overpowered. And I worked out how an unfortunate outcome could be reversed before you got the visual clue. Lastly, Chris Pine's Captain Kirk seems a bit too young for mind, given his brashness and swagger.Be interesting to see if the sequel to this movie will be so long in coming out. The events of this movie make me wonder if consequences will follow for actions taken in this movie by the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Into Darkness"" is the Dark Knight of Star Trek and Abrams the young American Nolan!","After the great success of critics and winning the love of thousands of fans that was the ""Star Trek"" from J.J. Abrams, a sequel was promised. Usually when a sequel to a blockbuster don't usually work well, being simply being horrible or don't even reach the foots, as the first one. But J.J. Abrams hits his hand on the table and imposes its place in management and his great talent as a director and doing a FANTASTIC work.""Into Darkness"" is another proof that a sequel can be gigantic while overcoming the predecessor in many details. Without belittling the first one that is fantastic but ""Into Darkness"" is also very different from the first but keeps the same pace of entertainment and loyalty to the original saga.The story begins a year after the events of the first movie with Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) along-side with the crew of the Enterprise (with all the cast from the first film) continue on their missions throughout the galaxy to do justice find uninhabited planets. After a ""successful"" mission all are called back home where they are faced with an enormous terror taking place on all the cities of their world due to several terrorist attacks within the organization. Now Kirk and the Enterprise crew embark on a manhunt after the unknown terrorist (Benedict Cumberbatch) who seems to be a renegade from the organization. A mission that will take them to a desolate planet where war reigns, behind one man's weapon of mass destruction, a mission where Kirk and Spock will meet all their worst fears and danger plaguing closely to them and their only family, the crew.The story follows a different rhythm from the first film that was part remake and part prequel, ""Into Darkness"" it also is but also carries the job of a sequel, but nothing is lost. While the film keeps very loyal to the first one, it also remains faithful to the original saga and thanks to the screenplay really well written and structured by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof that manages to carry with it many influences from the old movies (scenes and even dialogs) mixing everything with a simply brilliant originality.Not only overcomes the first one on writing, but also the direction of Abrams also improves in many details. Keeping the same of pace entertainment and giving superb action sequences also bringing the franchise to a whole new level. Everything in the film looks bigger, since the gigantic scenarios shot in the greatest perfection and reality giving a rate of galactic adventure and action.The cast also excels all greatly improved in their performances and their characters explored more. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto continues to deliver a incredible chemistry in their characters further deepening the friendship of Kirk and Spock with superb performances. But the performance that surprised everyone and even more his character was Benedict Cumberbatch and his villain.... (I can't mention the name without spoilers) with a fantastic performance, superbly embodying his character showing cruelty and intelligence, someone not to be overestimated. And once again overcoming the first one that didn't have a strong villain as as Cumberbatch.In my opinion ""Into Darkness"" overcame the 1st fantastically, all thanks to stunning visual effects; superb writing and direction; a good pace of time with snapping breathtaking action sequences along-side with fantastic performances. ""Into Darkness"" not only can be one of the best works of the ""Star Trek's saga"" but also be one of the best sequels and sci-fis ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I truly enjoyed the movie,"I won't go into details of the movie, since many have already disassembled the plot lines and synopsis. I truly enjoyed the reflection of old bonds and the introduction of new ones.

There were fantastic ones (Wrath of Khan)and some not so good(come on....ST IV?). I found this franchise to be a refreshing introduction of the original franchise with some wonderful additions. I enjoy the banter and development of the characters. I hope that JJ Abrams continues with the story.

To boldly go where no one has gone before  Into Darkness with Star Trek,"My generation grew up on Sunday morning Star Trek series created originally by Gene Roddenberry At one point of time I and all my friends thought of growing up to become Space Trekkers like Captain Kirk or Mr. Spock. Mr. Spock the lovable no-nonsense Vulcan and the Enterprise's (as the space ship is called) First Officer who needs no introduction was a role model to us and has us kids aping his actions and look. When I come to think of it this fixation with the series has not grown any less with age and even after 30 years I still admire and love the characters as much.Into Darkness takes off from the first part of the Star Trek movie, with Captain Kirk heading the USS Enterprise and a selected crew to complete a mission to protect a Class M Planet Nibiru (It's so cool when you read something like a Class M planet on screen). The starting sequence however sets the precedent for the bitter-sweet but stronger than oak friendship of Kirk and Spock. Kirk with his ""bend the rules"" attitude and Spock with his ""no-nonsense logical approach"" take us on a whirlwind space trek on a manhunt to take on a dangerous one man army. The Man on a mission to destroy the Starfleet is not seemingly what he is portrayed and the secrets that are unveiled form the basis of the plot. Star Trek is one movie where the plot needs to be as justifiable and strong as it characters because we expect them to perform superhuman feats. The plot though not as strong has been worked out brilliantly in terms of science and technology and will definitely keep you riveted to your seat. This is one movie I enjoyed in 3-D because it is fun to be exploring the final frontier as a part of the Enterprise's crew. The first part was exciting because it showed us the origin of each character and how they became a part of the Starfleet, but I believe the second part and all the consequent parts would take us on an exploration beyond our imagination and it would not be fair to compare one to another (which a lot of people are doing).The characters are the heart and soul of Star Trek and I could write a separate post on each one of them and maybe I will one day. Chris Pine as Captain James Tiberius Kirk is brilliant with his boyish charm look and rebellious attitude. An undisciplined man in the most disciplined army of explorers Chris Pine is ""made to order"" for this role and like the English would say it ""as cheeky as they come"". His friendship with Mr. Spock is legendary and despite Spock's clinical approach, Kirk always manages to teach him a thing or two about relationships as well as leadership. Chris Pine is fast becoming onto a cult figure like William Shatner the original Captain Kirk.Zachary Quinto I am sure would have been a big fan of Mr. Spock himself to have auditioned for the legend's role. The casting for Mr. Spock would have been the most difficult for the production and Zachary Quinto would have been God-send for them. He fits into the role (with his Vulcan chiseled face) of Spock effortlessly like he was born to do it and fills in the shoes of Leonard Nimoy (the original Mr. Spock) with great ease. Leonard Nimoy has been a part of both the movies playing the older Mr. Spock from future and Zachary performance is unmatchable even in scenes shared with the original. His chemistry with Kirk is the highlight of the movie their dialogs have been written well with a lot of wit giving us the lighter moments.Bones or Dr. McCoy played by Karl Urban is subtle, understated but a man who even Kirk listens too. Karl displays a personality and persona which makes him the perfect choice for Bones originally played by DeForest Kelley. Zoe Saldana as Uhura, the communications officer and Mr. Spock's love interest is attractive and intelligent in character. John Cho (the famous Harold from Harold and Kumar series) as Sulu the resourceful helm officer of the enterprise (the driver of the spaceship to put it bluntly) and sometimes the acting captain is a treat to watch. Anton Yelchin as Chekov who doubles up as the navigator and an absent minded engineer has captured the accent brilliantly and uses it to charm you throughout the movie.Simon Pegg as Scotty, the chief engineer and the funny man on the enterprise is no surprise and lights up the screen with his English accent and wit no matter how serious the situation is. Scotty comes as a savior at the worst of the time and Simon Pegg managed to pull of the sequence brilliantly with his subtle brand of humour. Benedict Cumberbatch as the one man army is both sinister and believable as Khan and the most hunted man in the Galaxy. He is as expressive as a chameleon and displays multiple personas as Khan. He is a brand of villain to watch out for both in the movie and in his future outings.The action sequences are impeccable and even though over the top, the technology used makes them s believable. Director J.J. Abrams with his penchant for directing action movies leaves no stone unturned for this one. These men and characters are taking a legacy created by Gene Roddenberry (a visionary and genius by any standards) to the next level and venturing into unchartered space  ""To boldly go where no one has gone before"".",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Flawed But Still Good,"This movie essentially picks up where its predecessor leaves off with the main characters having somewhat established themselves in their individual capacities. More or less. In this specific film a terrorist by the name of ""John Harrison"" (Benedict Cumberbatch) has created significant destruction on earth and has fled to safety on an uninhabited part of the Klingon home world of ""Kronos"". Believing that he is about to give top secret information to the Klingons, ""Captain James T. Kirk"" (Chris Pine) and his crew are sent on a top-secret mission to seek out and kill John Harrison from a great distance with newly developed long-range torpedoes. But things don't go as planned. At any rate, rather than disclosing what happens next and possibly ruining the movie for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that this was an interesting movie for the most part. Overrated but still interesting. As in the last movie the makers of the film choose to take segments from previous Star Trek television shows or movies and completely rearrange people and events to fit their specific story. And the use of good CGI and plentiful action manages to camouflage any discrepancies. At least for the most part. As such modern viewers will probably enjoy the film for what it appears to be-an enjoyable science-fiction movie. Those who grew up watching the original television series or the Star Trek movies from years past will probably notice the disparities and will base their overall judgment of this film accordingly. Personally, I thought it was a good movie. Flawed but still good. I rate it as slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time,"I saw Star Trek yesterday and I almost cried when the movie ended. J.J Abrams is congratulated. I do not know how but he created an atmosphere that I thought I was a crew member. The plot was totally unexpected. It was not a movie about a battle between good and evil. It was a movie about the hard decisions that we have to make every day and how they can influence us. Despite thinking that Cumberbatch would give more I think that all the actors had an excellent performance, especially Simon Pegg. About the visual effects and sound I think that Into Darkness is a potential candidate to win the Oscars of ""Best Visual Effects"", ""Sound Mixing"",""Sound Editing"" and maybe ""Best Makeup"". The team of J.J Abrams made a dazzling work much better than the first Star trek. If you are a lover of Sci-Fi and Thriller movies I strongly advice you to see the movie in cinema faster as you can. It is simply the best Sci-Fi movie of this year and one of the best of all time.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty fantastic! Spectacular ride,"Even though the film just came out, the notion among many critic reviews seems to be that while it's definitely a success, it's a definite step down from the 2009 version. The 2009 version is the only Star Trek- related thing I've ever seen, and I absolutely loved it. I thought it was pretty much the perfect blockbuster, and probably the best blockbuster of the last several years. It was definitely fun, but in a way that blockbusters rarely are these days. There was a gleeful attitude that the film carried, one where it wasn't just the action pieces that had you giggling with delight but the writing of the characters. I'm happy to say that Into Darkness carries that same level of excitement and absolute delight. It's definitely more action-packed, but it never feels like excess for the sake of it and instead it's a great experience.The cast here is at the top of their game, with Pine coming across even more charismatic, watchable and completely likable and Cumberbatch being the film's MVP and delivering a true performance worthy of much hype. Karl Urban was the one main cast member from the original that I didn't really like, but he's greatly improved here.Overall, I think this was fantastic and I'm so ready for more of these. It's truly the only big franchise right now I truly care about and the only one that doesn't feel half-baked. I do think I prefer the 2009 film, but both are on the same level and it's not out of anything this one did wrong.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Star Wars Trek,"No, it is not the ""Star Trek"" you grew up with......and probably it isn't Star Trek at all. Like its 2009 predecessor, this movie is not the enlightened future Roddenberry envisioned and has more plot-holes than your average swiss-cheese.And again it really didn't matter to me, because it was just a fun ride.Like the first movie, I liked the action so much so (still way too much lens-flares, though), that many of the plot-holes only became obvious to me, after I took a few moments to think about the movie. But basically, if you can make a movie so entertaining, that you don't notice all the plot holes on your first watch and be entertained, it is still a good movie.I assume that is also the reason why the most reviews here either hate it or really like it: People who like the ""Star Trek""-legacy and would like to see it continued are severely disappointed by this movie. But people who don't care about Roddenberrys ""better future"" or see the ""Star Trek""-legacy as ""redshirts dying"", ""too tight uniforms"" and ""technobabble"", enjoy this flick as a good popcorn movie.So if you still need to see this movie, do not expect ""Star Trek""... expect the kind of action you wanted the ""Star Wars"" prequels to be.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An excellent reboot of a reboot,"""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" was brilliant, and it fixed all the problems that its predecessor created. At the end of that movie, all we had was a Kirk who was nothing but an unrepentant bad boy with no regard for anyone but himself and his own disrespect for the rules. That's not a leader, so putting him in the captain's chair at the end ruined that movie and made it feel ridiculous. But ""Into Darkness"" addresses that problem right away by having Kirk screw up and get pulled out of the captain's chair, and the rest of the movie covers Kirk's learning and growing process -- the things he should have done in the first movie to make him worthy to occupy the chair. Plus, this movie does a great job integrating the rebooted plot line with the pre-existing Trek universe, and the plot was just as good as the characters and the dialog. So overall, it was MUCH better than its predecessor, and I'd rate it a solid eight stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great sequal of an even greater first movie,"I expressed my love for this franchise in the review of the first movie and Into Darkness lives up to its predecessor.

In my opinion, the producers and the writers did a great job in preserving the dna of the original series. The team efforts, the characters, the overall atmosphere... it's all there, but everything is upgraded to the 21st century. I truly think the casting has been done by someone with a sharp eye for actors that can carry the feeling of the era the original series were broadcasted.I loved this movie as much as the first one.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Simple story, beautiful effects, amazing acting","First of all, I have to say that I am not an old school Star Trek fan. Not that I have anything against the franchise, but I am not old enough to have been with it from the beginning and I somehow never found the time to pick it up from the start.That being said, I liked the movie. It wasn't awe sticking, but it was OK, if you're in the mood for an actiony SciFi. The plot isn't deep enough to generate a long analysis. The story is pretty straight forward and the plot twist (if that's what it was) is extremely predictable. Also, the movie kind of dragged on for me with long action, special effect riddled scenes. I realize that is part of the appeal for most SciFi movie goers, and the special effects where impeccable, but I usually loose interest during these scenes.The acting was amazing. Benedict Cumberbatch gave a stunning performance. Way above the standard for these kinds of movies, just going to show that he can really pull off any type of movie/character. The rest of the cast wasn't bad either, not at all, but it was my personal opinion that Cumberbatch sort of left them in the shadow.All in all it's not a bad movie to watch, especially if you're a Cumberbatch fan, but don't expect surprising turnings of events or thought provoking depth.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"As long as you know it ain't really ""Star Trek"" and don't mind, you're in for a nice ride.","As an old fogey of 49, I can't help but love the original ""Star Trek"" series. To me, this is THE ""Star Trek"". I had difficulty with the last Trek movie, the reboot, as it just seemed to violate so much of the original canon. However, given a bit of time, I guess I can turn off my brain and ignore the inconsistencies between the old and the new--even if the notion of an 'alternate universe' where such inconsistencies are accepted is something I still struggle with a bit.Since this film came out several months ago and by now there are 1832934 reviews (more or less), I won't make my review that long and I won't explain the plot. Sure, it's once again inconsistent--with an entirely new beginning story of how Kirk met his nemesis, Khan. And, it's inconsistent in a few other ways. However, it IS exciting to watch--and never really lets up. Plus, a few of the inconsistencies were still nice homages to the original (such as near the end when a DIFFERENT crew member enters the engines to save the ship and then says goodbye). Overall, a lot of action, a few nice explorations of characters and a film that lovers of Simon Pegg will ADORE since Scotty is given a much larger part in this one than in previous Trek films. Well made all around and well worth seeing. I assume they'll be making more of these and I hope to see them as well...unless they suck like ""Star Trek V"".",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great film,"Good story, great acting, only thing my wife and I keep thinking/discussing in a slightly negative way is Simon Pegg as Scotty.

Would like to see McCoy get more lines as I think he's a really engaging character and one that DeForest Kelly would I'm sure be proud to see. Chris Pine's capturing of the ""essence"" of William Shatner is also amazing - small things like the mannerism and attitude - brill!If only Simon P could be a little more believable?",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Sequel that shines...,"Spectacular sequel that manages to reproduce the wit and charm of the first film. 'Into Darkness' also hits a great stride with its many exciting sequences that are nicely linked together. JJ Abrams joins Neil Blomkamp as some of today's top sci-fi talent and is certainly the best pick to re-imagine the new Star Wars films. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto step back into Kirk and Spock as if no time at all has elapsed between the two films. These two characters are bound closer together by learning the value of self-sacrifice as well as discipline. The rest of the cast also slides neatly back into place thanks to another great script. Peter Weller is brought in as a star fleet admiral and manages to stand out amongst the other veteran actors. The breakout performance here is Benedict Cumberbatch, moviegoers will be seeing much more of this actor in the future. As the lead villain, Cumberbatch manages to be a commanding presence and an undeniable talent, his work here reminds me of another breakthrough performance decades ago from fellow Brit turned A-list talent, Alan Rickman (Die Hard, 1988). 'Into Darkness' is what sequels should be and another ride through Gene Rodenberry's universe couldn't be much more fun than this.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Solid Star Trek Entry - Star Trek Into Darkness,"I sure would like to have some of those genes that Benedict Cumberbatch displayed in this film. That said, this Star Trek entry, Star Trek into Darkness is very good in several respects, but suffers from the same disability that the first one had with Chris Pine.We knew that Pine would not die in this film because he got married and died somewhere else in the first film. He is not married yet in this film. So much for an iota of suspense. Despite that enormous flaw in logic. And continuing problem of sparing every major player (we all know they are not going to kill off any of the major characters), the film is still very entertaining.The performance of Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange in real life) easily steals the film, as he displays his superior (in every way) acting ability. There is an improvement in the minor character of Bones, as he is more involved in this episode than in the first one. Scotty is also improved. I cannot help but think this is more of a TV series rather than a series of movie sequels. The outstanding production values continue to make it a worthwhile visit to the movie house.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
""" The enemy to be feared is in the Heart of all you cherish ""","This newest film called "" Star Trek into Darkness "" was written by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci and directed by J.J. Abrams. From the beginning, Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock (Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto) are at odds with each other over Kirk's recent life and death decisions. In additions, Kirk is chastised by his commanding officer Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood), now an Admiral. Just as Kirk is about to be relegated to a lessor status, Star Fleet H.Q. comes under attack by Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch) an old Nemesis which throws everything into a complete turmoil. As a result, the starship Enterprise and it's crew are placed on a collision course with the Klingon Empire which might end with all out war. Friendships are tested and so too is the Enterprise with it's special cargo brought aboard despite Scotty's objections which could prove disastrous for all concern. The film is incredibly filled with action scenes and much intrigue. Nearly all the characters are in conflict with each other as the director tries to mold the old with the new. Still the script calls for much action to keep this newest offering exciting right through Warp drive. Cast members like Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho and Anton Yelchin reprise their earlier roles. All in all this newest addition is an action packed sequel to Roddenberrys' original series and it lives up to his standards in every way.

Really well done.,"I have recently got into Star Trek, all of the Star Treks after being around to watch the original Star Trek as a kid with William Shatner. I am now a fanatic of all of the Star Treks and I am so glad the movies are well thought out especially the cast because replacing Shatner and Spock is a mammoth task and they do it superbly in the movies. Chris Pine even sounds like Kirk and Quinto as Spock is amazing, truly amazing. The rest of the cast is also well cast and enjoyable to watch.Into the Darkness is visually fantastic to watch and the storyline is great. Khan returns and a Star Fleet admiral betrays the essence of Star Fleet and is a war monger and who better to portray the traitor but Robocop..I have read many other reviews here where the authors knows who wrote the score and outlines details about the movie but they never seem to detail why the storyline fails in their critique. I am as critical as the next person but movies are movies and Into the darkness has a good storyline, fantastic cast, excellent effects, heaps of action and honours the original Star Trek in many ways. What more do people want.I must mention Benedict who plays Khan, what a fantastic choice for Khan.. and the icing on the cake. I often review movies many years after they were released so I don't feel right explaining the storyline and going into detail when most people have already seen the movie by now..",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining but amateurish,"I generally don't like J.J.Abrams. I think he is a phony who thinks he is the king of science fiction. As a science student, I do think sci-fi requires some imagination and some artistic freedom that enables the Writer/Director to create an enchanting tale which while being ""a little"" scientifically inaccurate is enjoyable and often serves as an inspiration to future generations of technology as well as film making. Star Trek Into Darkness does not come into that category. While the story and special effects are engaging enough to keep the audience in their seats, I wonder if the movie was able to keep the viewer's mind of questions like ""Is that possible?"", ""Ohh...Come on..There is no way that could happen. Could it?"". The only experience I have with this franchise is this movie along with its predecessor which was not that great as well. I have seen parts of J.J.Abram's so called sci-fi work like Lost, Super 8, MI 3, Fringe etc. and my conclusion is that he is very bad at science. The blatant use of plot devices that make no sense to any person who may be remotely familiar with science can be seen in his every work. STID is not an exception. Though it suffers from the Director's vision and competence, the film is not repulsive at all. In fact, I felt that I should disregard whatever faults the film carried in order to enjoy the film and I did. Benedict Sherlock does well to portray a dangerous villain. Apart from that acting is mostly average. Incredible things could have been achieved with that budget and a premise such as Star Trek. But, Abrams fails to produce anything original except a few things that help him get out of corners that he writes himself into. See the film if you have an eye for special effects and the British Sherlock. As I said, it is entertaining but amateurish, which is better than most of Abrams work.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good science fiction action movie with drama,"Star Trek Into Darkness movie story is centered around three main characters Kirk, Spock and Khan. Khan, the villain of the story kills several people of Star ship's organization in the beginning of the movie. And no one knows why this guy has done so. Kirk and Spock with the Star-ship crew chase this bad guy and capture him as a prisoner. After that a little twist involved in the story which may increase curiosity in audience.The story also shows the emotions involved between Kirk and Spock as good friends. Spock (an alien character) who thinks logically and never get angry can also feel deep love inside for a human being that is very well shown with perfect scenes in the movie.The actors have great job. But the movie may not be liked by people who are just fond of great action and great animation effects.

A not so suspenseful or memorable blockbuster,"This film tells the story of a captain who is ordered to go into space and send missiles at a rogue fugitive hiding on an uninhabited planet. As he uncovers more information beneath the surface, his morality, loyalty and courage are tested.I am unfamiliar with Star Trek films, so the first on the planet with red plants really lost me. I thought it was going to be some kind of comedy, especially when Simon Pegg appears! Fortunately, after that scene, the story becomes more an adventure and thriller. The story is fun and thrilling. Dr Spock's strict adherence to rules is quite funny. I am quite lost as to why Simon Pegg was cast as an engineer. He is too well known for his comedic roles, and I cannot take him seriously in his role. In addition, the humour he portrays in his character is not in line with the general atmosphere and tension of the film. Maybe that is the reason that I think there is not enough tension and suspense in the film, even though the plot clearly intends to be tense and suspenseful.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Star Trek movie which did not fail us, again!","I really like J.J. Abrams Star Trek movies. They are incredibly good, full of excellent VE, actors are always good, action is almost non stop. What else can you ask from a Star Trek movie? And especially if they go to the Klingon home world. Why? Well, 1992 when we had census in the former Yugoslavia I found Klingons so sexy when they asked me for my nationality (a very important question in that census) I answered that I am a Klingon and my native language is Klingonese. From the moment I watched the original Star Trek series to the newest films I always enjoyed all of that world which Rodenbery invented. What an imagination and brain! The saying: Beam me up Scotty! is a legendary one. We use it whenever something out of ordinary happens, something we cannot comprehend, and we have to admit there are a lot of those moments this rotating Earth gives to us. Didn*t you want to be beamed up if you were a New Yorker during 9/11? Or in any of those incredibly crazy moments we can not comprehend.Which part of the film I like the most?

A Sequel That Does Not Disappoint,"To me, the first film was a near perfect science fiction/action movie. The sequel is also very good and offered tons of entertainment, but not quite as good as the first.J. J. Abrams continued to show that he was a go to director for the action genre, while not neglecting a story to go along with it or disrespecting the source material. It made sense that he was a natural choice to carry on the 'Star Wars' franchise. My main criticism, which he even admits and has since rectified, is the constant use of lens flares. It's so over the top in this film that it's as distracting as it is blinding.Really could not ask for anything more from any of the cast members. Pine, Quinto, Urban, Saldana, Pegg, and Cumberbatch were all amazing, along with everyone else.The Lazarus trick was maybe a tad too unrealistic, but it made for a happy ending so I'm okay with it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Little things, like way too many different uniform types, inconsistencies in the wear of headgear and more.The special effects are stunning, but often they interfere with the story rather than driving it.

It's solid,"I know I saw this one in cinema when it came out and was pretty content with what I expected to be a sci-fi action movie back then.
After watching it a second time my opinion of the movie has not worsened, it might actually have improved a little here and there when comparing it to other major hollywood productions these days:The movie ticks every box when going over the sci-fi action but also the writing-checklist.
The plot has a properly developed arch with setups and payoffs. Its stakes are high and so is your investment and the suspense. There might be a plot hole here and there but they're minor in themselves and ultimately unavoidable in space anyway.
The characters show actual development and special traits and weaknesses. They actively deal with issues like friendship, love and obedience. The actors all perform really well, although the main attraction of course is Cumberbatch. I'd even go as far as saying he's the main reason for me liking the movie so much: ""My name is *Khan*""; Chills, literally!
Then there's action that can be best described as awesome with great cgi and admittedly a bit too much lens flare, a score that gets you going and lots of star trek gadgets.But isn't ""ticking every box"" a kind of weak reason to like a movie? For me personally in this case it isn't: all the parts are there and they even fit very well, I just love it!
But apart from this personal opinion it's also worth being highlighted in a broader context: nowadays multimillion hollywood productions can deal with not even looking at the checklist of basics, produce utter garbage and still be a commercial success. So why not like a movie that shows it understands and appreciates the laws of writing?One more word on the flood of 1-star reviews: I hope I showed why those are mostly unjustified from a technical viewpoint, but they seem to come from a very emotional direction anyway. Of course, none of the above mentioned traits exceed somewhat high expectations, no element of the movie blows your mind, and some weaknesses (no spoilers) should actually be discussed. But hating a solid sci-fi action movie for not enlightening you and blowing you away like Star Trek used to back in the days? That sounds very much a question of expectations and not of craftsmanship in filmmaking.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fully entertaining and great watching experience,"I watched it at midnight show yesterday and didn't expect too much after seeing early rough reviews from the critics, but after the movie ended I felt nothing wrong with this and truly far from disappointment. Once again J.J.Abrams shows his directing ability and continuing to amaze audience after what he had already done in 2009 with a solid piece of work. 'Into Darkness' is one of the most entertaining and satisfying action movie I've seen this year. It's fun, thrilling and spectacular at some scenes especially last 45 minutes of the film. The acting from their three main casts (Chris Pine, Benedict Cumberbatch and Zachary Quinto) also can't be taken lightly. Especially for Zachary Quinto, his character here has a lot improvement and he has done his challenge incredible. There's no doubt about the visual, it's been outstanding and stunning, you couldn't ask more than this. The IMAX visual is also amazing and worth to see.Besides that, 'Into Darkness' has less complex story. Character of the villain is not introduced clearly and appeared too sudden. The thing is probably because 2009 'Star Trek' has already been too perfect, J.J.Abrams had made high standard in the first franchise that even himself hardly to level it. I think J.J.Abrams has pulled out all of his idea in first 'Star Trek' reboot that makes this movie not that special and feels repeatable. The storyline in 'Into Darkness' isn't as complicated as the first movie so don't worry if audiences haven't watched the previous movie, they still could enjoy this. Afterall, 'Into Darkness' is a great action package and something you shouldn't miss. It might be not as good as the first franchise but it's still one of the coolest movie you'll ever experience. It may be too early to say that it's the best summer blockbuster movie this year, but it could be the great one.

"If You Liked J.J. Abrams' Star Trek, Then You'll Like This One!","Treading on the same path as the previous chapter, the second instalment in the rebooted Star Trek franchise retains the freshness, vibrancy & momentum of the original, adds a few upgrades of its own to give it a more polished look but just like its predecessor, it stays on the same level from start to finish, thus bringing neither excitement nor escalation to the plot.Set one year after the events of the first film, Star Trek Into Darkness finds the crew of USS Enterprise going against a new enemy that has risen from within their own organisation and who makes his intentions clear when he detonates an entire fleet & leaves the world in complete chaos, following which Captain Kirk leads his team on a manhunt to apprehend the man responsible.Directed by J.J. Abrams, Star Trek Into Darkness finds its director in prime form for he has crafted this picture with same rigour & passion with which he made the previous one work. The script further expands the rebooted universe, adds newer elements & also resurrects a notorious antagonist this time, and yet the whole experience is pretty much the same as last time.The set pieces are wonderfully detailed & grander in appearance. Cinematography presents a slightly darker tinge while maintaining the same kinetic camera-work that worked in favour of the last feature. Its 133 minutes of runtime isn't felt but the story never shifts gears at any given point.Also, the use of CGI is overwhelming at times. And Michael Giacchino chips in with yet another amazing score.Coming to the performances, the returning cast of Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana & Simon Pegg do exhibit a better grip on their respective characters but this time, it's Benedict Cumberbatch who ends up stealing the show for his screen presence is infectious while his performance is quite impressive and yet, the notorious character he's revealed to be never seems convincing enough & feels a bit forced.On an overall scale, Star Trek Into Darkness does everything a sequel is supposed to do, is an enjoyable, entertaining & adequately satisfying ride for the most part, is further boosted by Cumberbatch's stellar performance, plus packs in a fine dose of spectacle in its riveting tale and yet, the whole experience of sitting through it is virtually the same as the previous chapter.

"Well acted, well cast, doesn't quite live up to potential","Star Trek: Into Darkness is a well cast, well-acted, well directed film, which still manages to disappoint at nearly every turn. Christopher Pine, Zachary Quinto, and (especially) Karl Urban, as Kirk, Spock, and Bones respectively, do no disservice to their namesakes. Pine's Kirk is confident, macho, intelligent, and brash, often to a fault. Quinto portrays everyone's favorite Vulcan Spock quite well, he is calm and collected, and there is weight, and implied wisdom behind his words. Karl Urban plays Dr. Leonard McCoy so convincingly, with such curmudgeon , even when he quips "" Damn it Jim I'm a doctor not a ______"" it feels real, not like some shoe horned catch-phrase.The film is very well paced, the beats are exciting and interesting, and the film never feels boring despite its considerable length. The action is expertly choreographed, from Star Ships blasting each other from orbit, to Kirk speeding down the corridors of the Enterprise. This is all enhanced by the magnificent special effects. High quality effects are really just par for the course now for any decently budgeted Hollywood film, but even conceding that, it still looks fantastic. The score is adequate, but compared with previous Star Trek film scores, it really pales in comparison. In the past Star Trek has employed world class composers such as Leonard Rosenman and Jerry Goldsmith, a sharp contrast to Into Darkness composer Michael Giacchino whose credits include "" Cars"" and "" Ratatouille"".Star Trek has always been overwhelmingly story driven. It is, at its best, cerebral, thought provoking science fiction. This is not the case for Star Trek : into Darkness. The plot is predictable, to an almost comical extent. Few films in the last decade can claim to be as strictly formulaic. All the standard action movie tropes are there, they really pulled out all the cliché's this time around, no pulled punches. The result of all this is, the final product feels much closer to a throw away summer blockbuster, more akin to Transformers or the latest Die hard than anything recognizable as Star Trek.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A Large-Scale, if Action-Drowned, Space Epic","A skillful space-faring overdose of adrenaline, if not really my idea of a Star Trek film. Into Darkness has the makings of a curvy, complicated red tape thriller, but its predictability, superficiality and outright refusal to go more than five minutes between jump-cut-loaded action scenes halts the germination of that seed relatively early. With the exception of big-bad Benedict Cumberbatch, who manages to be both admirable and despicable in even doses, the film is thoroughly overacted and the touches of fan service that I so relished in the 2009 reboot seem far more forced and unnecessary the second time around. There's also a notable lack of gravitas to the proceedings, in my opinion one of the hallmarks of the series, with an unfamiliar trigger-happy temperament lending the impression of an adult who's regressed into a period of renewed adolescence. That's not to say it isn't enjoyable: the action sets, though frequent, are constantly fresh and exciting, while its daring in even-handedly tackling the subject of a 23rd century terrorist is progressive and topical.

And why re-use a villain from a previous movie, that was simply beyond my comprehension.Given, I have never been a ""Star Trek"" fan, more of a ""Star Wars"" fan, truth be told. But still, I have watched the movies for the fact that they are a big part of the Sci-Fi genre, and they have been entertaining. But there is just something profound missing from the entire Star Trek universe somehow. What it is, I don't know.The people playing the various roles here in ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" were doing good jobs, both newcomers and those returning from the previous ""Star Trek"" movie from 2009.I am sure that Trekkies around the galaxy will enjoy this movie tremendously. I watched it as a Sci-Fi movie, without a prior attachment to the Star Trek universe, and as such it did provide good entertainment. Sure, there were clichés to be found here and there, and the outcome of the story was predictable. But enjoy the movie for the thrill ride, the action, the journey into space, and boldly go where no one has gone before.In my opinion, then ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" wasn't fully as enjoyable and entertaining as the 2009 ""Star Trek"" movie, because the 2009 movie had a more solid and thought-through storyline. And as such, this movie is getting a 6 out of 10 stars rating from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Big Time Trek/Sci-Fi fans are missing the point...,"So I feel I have to get my 'Trek Cred' out of the way here. I am not a 'Trekkie' in the true-est sense as I have only glanced at the books and the expanded Trek universe, however I was big into the Next Generation when I was young for a brief time and last year took it upon myself to go back and watch every series of Trek + every movie in the order they came out... and I did it.I have a better admiration for a series like Deep Space 9 than before and even the original Trek... although the original Trek is far, far more campy than some seem to think it was...Today we see that movies are having a hard time with stories. Across the board TV has become the new avenue for telling a good story (Game of Thrones as an example) because they have so much more time to develop the characters and the world.The tricky part with this Star-Trek re-boot is that JJ had to take all these existing characters and attempt to appease the original fans and bring in new fans by changing it enough to not just make each movie a science or lore lesson.This movie, for me, was a solid 8. It's not the best Trek movie and it's not even close to the worst (hello Generations...).I'm also quite surprised at the comments that complain about this vs Star Trek 2... where this one made some sense... but don't mention that Star Trek Nemesis was actually a worse rip-off in every sense and a far worse film...My only one complaint was that this film didn't have a well done space-battle like in Star-Trek 2. That battle Kirk vs Khan was handled better than I think any battle i've seen in any Trek and I was hoping to see something as interesting as that.Overall the acting is great, plot is fine, action/CG is good but over-the-top, throw-backs worked well... it is a little bit of a shame that Trek has been turned into Science-Fantasy/Action from Science Fiction but I think it holds just fine.9 Posted to offset some of the ridiculous 2 scores, unless all those people want to go back and give Nemesis a 0.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Plunging into Darkness,"We last left our friends on the USS Enterprise with peace and tranquility on board and on earth back in 2009 – but now all is not well in the galaxies and everything is not right in Star Fleet. There is a traitor amongst them – a traitor that holds a grudge, a traitor full of clout and darkness, a traitor that leaps for joy at the sight of death and destruction.John Harrison a.k.a. Khan is not your typical villain he is a villain full of surprises and leaves you on the edge of your seat thirsty for more destruction as he attempts to end Star Fleet as we know it. We are left wondering at every turn what Captain James T. Kirk (Pine) would do as well as his First Officer Spock (Quinto). We are left with questions what will become of our villain.Sowhat will become of our heroes from Star Fleet? Is there another adventure for them? Will Khan seek revenge? Those are questions what will be answered until we meet again.To Boldly Go Where No One Has Gone Before.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty good fun,"I was unsure about this film. Mainly because I disliked the plot of the first one leading us down an alternative time-line/universe for this reboot. So unsure that I didn't even bother going to the cinema to watch this. Watching the DVD however changed my mind as I enjoyed this film quite a lot. The plot could be viewed as a re-hatch but Cumberbatch was extraordinary in the role and it had a good feel. The pace of the film is good and you never get to that bored bit where you look at your watch to wonder how much more of this there is (the acid test for a film I feel!). I wonder if there will be a third as they very much returned things to the beginning of TOS so what to do next is unclear. Anyway, director might be busy with Star Wars for the foreseeable.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Some old territory, but still a smart sequel","This is the long-awaited sequel to a blockbuster science fiction franchise that has seen highs and lows over the past few decades. It is probably the best indicator of what JJ Abrams will bring to a Star Wars sequel, and I'd say things are looking very good.After a thrilling James Bond-like opening mission, Kirk and the Enterprise return to Earth. In London, rogue agent John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) has bombed a Starfleet archive, and Kirk gets permission from Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) to hunt him down.From the opening scenario involving primitive aliens, cliff diving, and exploding volcanoes, the film keeps a pace going that would give the original series whiplash. William Shatner's crew may have had time for philosophy and contemplation, but with Chris Pine on the bridge the philosophy must be discussed between phaser blasts. Action fans can rejoice at this. Sometimes the speed and clutter of the frame was overwhelming, but JJ has proved to be a more than capable action director with a clear hold on his audience.A superficial improvement in the sequel is the reduction of lens flares. It doesn't bother me, but many people complain that the first film has too many. Happy for you then that JJ is such a nice guy because he has bowed to the people's will and given you what you asked for. Giving the audience what they want, however, is exactly what causes trouble in the film. Not a lot of trouble, but enough to make this sequel not quite as good as its predecessor.Where the first film had a streamlined plot that spiralled around it's time-travel premise, Into Darkness has an element of chaos that is both good and bad. As the plot unfolds and the villain surprises Kirk, the chaos plays to the danger and suspense that comes with such an unpredictable opponent. But in gaining mystery and suspense the film sacrifices tidy storytelling, which shuffles emotional scenes and action scenes in jarring ways. As far as criticisms go that one is pretty weak, but it's the best description I can give for the slight disappointment I felt.The writers have picked up the alternate-time line characters where they were left and have followed them forward with the understanding that even on a new time line, they could encounter elements of the original series. At times, references to the original series get in the way of good storytelling. This is a problem that only Trek fans will have to deal with, however, since the film as science fiction, as action, as adventure, and as a fun ensemble is solid. Even if references to the original do get in the way, they are such good elements that it would have been a shame to lose just because Spock Prime (Leonard Nimoy) messed up the time line in the first film.When sequels like The Dark Knight come along they are met with astonishment because good sequels have been so difficult and rare. Before Nolan returned to Gotham there was only The Godfather Part 2 and The Empire Strikes Back to cited as undeniably great successors. Though I won't place Into Darkness in their league, it is still a fantastic sequel. With JJ doing Star Wars it is unlikely we will see another Star Trek for 3-4 years unless a new director is found, but when the next film comes it will have a lot to live up to in both of its predecessors.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Its a reboot/remake,"I really enjoyed the first Star Trek reboot, the entire time travel thing changing the course of history makes it easy to start a new story and keep the Trekkies happy.I must admit I have never really been a trekkie but I did enjoy the original show and the next generation series but didn't really watch the others so much. The prior Films were hit and miss, some were good and some were average and others were just dull.One of the original films I did like however was the Wrath of Khan and this film is a new way of introducing that character. The plot is pretty solid with some twists along the way but is easy to understand so it makes a great popcorn flick without just being all action and no story.Pine makes a great Kirk, hot headed and a ladies man which is exactly how I remember the original Kirk played by Shatner, Zachary Quinto makes a great Spock also and it is he that takes on board much of the action in this film. Scotty played by Simon Pegg once again provides the obviously funny moments but some of the funniest moments do actually involve Pine.There is some good comedy dialogue in the film as well as parts that reveal the characters a little deeper but mainly the main characters as we find out little about Checkov and Sulu in terms of back story or character although they do feature in the film a decent amount.Now if you are not a Star Trek fan or familiar with the original films then it doesn't matter at all but if you are then you will enjoy the references to the earlier films and series, some are very obvious and some are very subtle but they generally make you chuckle.The FX were excellent and we get some great shots of the Enterprise throughout the film as well as Earth in its future state and a brand new spacecraft that looks cool. The open world scenes are often breathtaking on Earth and on other Planets which always makes for a visual treat.There were a few moments that for me were not executed as well as they should have been when certain grandiose speeches were a bit out of sorts but none of them came from Cumberbatch, he was flawless in his delivery and execution and portrayed the villain to perfection always cold but you never knew if you could trust him.Pine when needed also has some great moments but most of his parts are on the cheesy side and at times he still looks like he is settling into the role of captain and you often think there are better people for the job but his actions and bravery have got him to the top rather than his merits or intelligence as sometimes he comes across as a bit dumb.Alice Eve is a new character ( I am not sure for how long ) who plays Dr Marcus and she adds a new female element but is mainly there for plot purposes I think.Peter Weller also comes in as and Admiral of Star Fleet and he did a good job on the whole but for me there was a part of the film where it came across a bit hammy and it let the scene down for me but he plays a small part generally.Karl Urban has little to do here except be Bones, he again hams it up but for all the right reasons and is often hilarious without saying anything particularly funny but that may be only if you are fluent with the original Bones.Overall it was a good experience and I am already wanting to find out what the crew of the Enterprise will be up to in the next instalment, its a space action/drama at its finest without being too serious or intense, it may not be meaty enough for the major Sci Fi fans out there ( and I am one of them ) but there is still enough to keep most people happy.8/10 from me which I think is the same as I gave the previous film. I will definitely watch this film again in the future, maybe even on Imax 3D next week as I only watched the 2D tonight.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Where no logic has gone before...,"Star Trek Into Darkness is an entertaining romp but I shutter to think about the generational chasm separating this generation from the one that was privileged to see the original movies in theaters. Are we so jaded that we need explosions every couple of minutes? Are we so brain-dead that we miss all the logical flaws?Apparently it takes a few seconds to go to a homeworld that's 21 light years away and back. Apparently Starfleet has only 2 ships. Apparently McCoy has time to do completely irrelevant lab experiments while chaos ensues around him. Apparently it's common practice to park the mothership on an uncivilized world, needlessly risking the lives of your crew and prime directive, just for the sake of having a spectacular set piece. Star Trek Into Darkness throws logic out the window in favor of brainless action. The script was clearly written around major action sequences, with dialog and plot (holes) slapped together like patchwork.Viewers be warned: leave your brain at the door - you'll better enjoy the movie that way.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Brilliant At Times, Overblown At Others","It seems the people associated with the legacy of Gene Roddenberry can never find the power themselves ""to go where no man has gone before"" (which sounds awfully sexist even as I write it)....Many of the Star Treks are only rehashes of previous Star Trek shows, or rehashes of Star Trek movies, or rehashes of rehashes of either----a common theme to Star Trek movie scripts. This one's no different. And, it's not only a rehash of previous Star Treks, but it also rips off key plot from another movie, K-19 The Widowmaker.I truly loved 2009's Star Trek movie (NOTE: perhaps the one true exception to the lack of novelty which afflicts the ST genre) which introduced us to the young persona of the TV show cast. It was an excellent movie, though there were times when it stretched credibility. One thing that a movie, even a fantasy sci-fi, ought to respect is biological limitations: when we see a person in a serious fight receiving numerous blows from objects, fists, feet, elbows----and then we see them with virtually NOTHING showing as damaged (no bruises, cuts, scrapes, swelling, etc)...it loses me. I really want some verisimilitude here. Any movie which involves physical harm should show the induced harm and unless there is some form of accelerated healing ---which is part of the cover story Star Trekkers will advance--- the sequelae of the fight ought to be as realistic as possible. Jack Nicholson's character had his nose cut in ""Chinatown"" and wore a misfitting face bandage for quite a while. It was appropriate, and it engendered more of a sympathy for his kindred humanity. The more we can identify with the sufferings of characters, the more we can feel for their travails....the more we can project ourselves vicariously into their travails.But ---when there is a terribly violent fight....and the person suddenly stands up and dusts themselves off and looks unscathed....the reality has been compromised at a very visceral level.I have two primary objections to this movie and both involve the extremely unrealistic nature of recovery after battle damage, both to the characters and to the vessels they occupy.I refuse to ever give out details that would constitute spoiler for those who haven't seen a movie, and I find myself constrained here to not say more than generalization. Which is too bad. It would be nice to take the real key scenes to which I most object and detail why they so offend. But I won't.On the very plus side we have some excellent acting. It is difficult to fault any of the acting in this movie, it's that good. Camera work is at times gorgeously beautiful. The opening sequence itself I thought glorious. The city scapes are the stuff of an architect's wet dreams. The CGI digital sequences flawlessly and seamlessly flow. I love the 3D for movies like this.Overall, what I felt was that the movie started very very well, moved to some very nice plot complications and maintained a high level of tension effectively for the viewer, but ended somewhat weakly-------had they been able to keep that same strength throughout the entirety of the movie I would have given it a 9....but because of the failure to observe simple biological boundaries, and because the plot attenuated toward the end I could only give it a 7.Liked it a lot, but didn't love it. Vastly preferred Star Trek (2010).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A near perfect 2013 update of the Star Trek Enterprise,"I've always been a trekkie as compared to a Star wars fan. But being quite impressed with JJ Abrams first Star Trek outing in 2009, which currently is number 225 on the IMDb top 250 list, I most certainly can bargain for this one as well. I enjoyed the first one, but THIS IS STAR TREK of 2013.Again, as in the TV series we are introduced to an enemy so strong, routed back to some 300 years ago. A dangerous enemy which should have been extinct, but thanks to old fashioned cryo-technology of which we here today already as discarded as useless, of course.We get the morals of which we love. We get to see Earth as star fleet headquarters in London. We get to see the out of space San Francisco, even the real Spock in a time warp. In a way this is a homage to the old series in a way I found it difficult to manage. And then it's also an update to what it has to show off in 2013 in big budget. Because the TV series was low budget TV, made out of brilliant ideas.This is grand sci-fi. A grand story with everything that is needed. It's a story that stands on it's own feet, as well as giving the right nods to the old series. All of them. The ship. The logos. The ideas. The colors. The beams, warps and shields. The crew. The Star Trek! Enjoy the ride, and wait fore more. This felt like a prequel to all that we loved back then. How many film will we see in the future Star Trek franchise, or should I say enterprise, now when they go out on the five year journey? You can only image!I really start to imagine what JJ Abrams and his staff can do to save the Star Wars enterprise/franchise, because he will! What a relief for those who love the Star Wars! I never really did, and though it got worse and worse. But I think JJ Abrams visions will make Star Wars what it should have been, updated to 2014-15-16 as well. Old Sci-Fi ideas get reborn by JJ Abrams, and so it will with Star Wars. Most guaranteed. JJ Abramns is the one and only sci-fi God for old sci-fi franchises!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
beware the wrath of Khan.,"Star Trek : Into Darkness is a re imaging of the Wrath of Khan. And One that stands up there with the original. I found the film to be a thrill ride from start to finish. Here Captain JAmes T. Kirk finally fullfills his potential to be one of the greatest Captains that starfleet has ever produced. Kirk is brave but without humility. Smart but stupid he takes risks without thinking of the consquences. But most of all Kirk doesn't hold to the rules that starfleet has he makes his own. And in this adventure Kirk realizes several truths. Rules are for everyone. And that a Captain is vulnerable because of his Crew. His crew is his family. And Kirk will sacrifice everything for them including breaking all the rules. But what happens when Kirk meets the unstoppable Superman Khan ? For the first time Kirk will find he isn't the greatest at everything and that Khan is a Superman. James T. Kirk will find everything he believes in to be challenged truths will be tested and lies will be found out.Chris Pine brings his A- Game here as he makes the movie his brash swaggering Kirk is the show. Karl Urban brings the heart as his McCoy is still one of the best things about the reboot. Quinto is excellent as Spock torn between rules and reg. and doing what his gut instinct tells him to do. He brings that struggle out perfectly. And Simon Pegg finally gets a chance to shine as Scotty. He's given enough to do and enough to give Scotty a important job in this movie. Ben Cumberbatch is superb as the tortured and yet arrogant Khan who is willing to do whatever is needed to save his people.Star Trek : Into Darkness is neither Dark or gritty. What it is ,is action adventure and a great time at the movies.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
pure 10 :),"I just wanna tell this movie deserves pure 10. It has everything inside itself: action, effects, excitement, story, acting and all 5 elements are at the highest possible level. I can't find anything that is on lower level than best. It is usual for sequels to be less good and interesting than their first parts but if we are talking about Start Trek movies by J.J. Abrams it's absolutely contrary. The main thing that has become rare in this 21st century is solid story inside sci-fi movies. That's not a case for this one. I can't describe how positively surprised i am by those 2 parts of new Star Trek. To be honest, i watched first part just a week ago, liked it and looked forward to go to the cinema to watch this one. Before i watched those i thought Star Trek movies are for kids only, but i was sooo wrong! :) I recommend this movie, as well as the first part to absolutely everyone, no matter how old you are and what genres you like most.

"'Die Hard' in space - 6,5/10","Ever heard of Die Hard in space? Well, here you have it. As much as there are things to enjoy in this movie, there are more things that aren't half as enjoyable. Now, I am not a fan or a fan boy of Star Trek in general, I haven't been watching the old series and the way I understood it, you don't have to do that in order to watch and enjoy both of J.J. Abrams Star Trek films.Let's just forget the plot-holes, the loud booms and bangs, (bad)jokes and loud music for a few seconds. Benedict Cumberbatch did a superb job as a villain and Zachary Quinto who is just great as Spock and I felt for both of them as characters (for a little while). I couldn't care less about Kirk, and the way I understand it is that he's supposed to be a very iconic character.The visuals in this film were actually pretty stunning, the production design was beautiful to look at and you of course got a bit of lens flares in every scene - which I didn't have problem with in the beginning, but if you're known for having a lot of lens flares in your movies (which is very easy to add) then I think you'll have to find a different style. It felt as if Abrams wanted everything to be perfect, and that's where I think he/ or this movie failed. There were moments in it which as I said, was actually pretty good, but those were the moments in which everything felt human/natural and authentic; and we didn't get a lot of those moments.I couldn't engage in this film personally, not even as a person who loves visually stunning movies. It's as if a robot made this movie because after a while, I did not care about the story, what the characters felt or wanted and especially what 'Khan' wanted and that was a big problem for me who actually looked forward to seeing him. The movie was all up in your face. A pretty empty film with a lot of surface and no spirit that lost my attention after a while.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fun, enjoyable and colourful but missing something integral.","The Star Trek universe didn't really excite me. I enjoyed the original series reruns as a boy and watched several of the films before deciding The Wrath of Khan was probably as good as it was going to get and that I couldn't deal with watching the wrinklies staggering across the screen in roll-neck jumpers any more. Then along came 2009's Star Trek with a Batman Begins jumpstart.It was a moment (well, 127 minutes) of eye-opening reassessment. J.J. Abrams had cleverly, spectacularly reinvented the franchise for the fanboys and the jaded alike, and the USS Enterprise was back in some fashion! So, naturally, expectations were very high for Star Trek Into Darkness. How could the wizard who conjured it back to life not succeed?WellNo, it's not fair to go as far as to say Abrams has failed. He hasn't. Far from it. Star Trek Into Darkness is a fun film, has plenty of spectacular moments, countless visual feasts to consume and lots to enjoy, but it just doesn't touch his first effort. I departed feeling unsatisfied. It should have been so much more and it felt incomplete despite being rammed full of effects, action, dramaStar Trek Into Darkness is a new take on a familiar story with a villain (Benedict Cumberbatch – I'm not sure if there'll be cries of ""Plot spoiler!"" if I reveal his character) on a mission of destruction and revenge; roles are swapped, action ramped up, emotions toyed with and, rather than feeling tired, it gives a sense of comfort. We're with old friends here, both in terms of storyline and characters, but there's a danger of complacency and a real presence of flippancy. Far too often drama or tension gives way to a quip and the positioning of a tongue deeply in a cheek. I didn't buy 'funny', I bought spectacle, but too often the magnificence is diluted by frivolity.There are moments when it works, like the first couple of interactions with Scotty (Simon Pegg) and his pet, Keenser (Deep Roy who, strangely, isn't worthy of a credit on IMDb), but after a while it just becomes tiresome. That said, Pegg slips into the character more convincingly this time around; or maybe it's just that Abrams trusts him with more screen time.There's sufficient on screen to keep the fanboys happy with numerous references to the Star Trek canon, peripheral characters that mean little to most viewers and the obligatory nod to previous incarnations (both with actors and model spaceships lined up) and, visually at least, there are plenty of scenes of pure CG magic. The digital and physical sets are beautiful and the opening scenes, though a little too Indiana Jones to be taken seriously, are an exquisite blend of striking reds, bold yellows, stark whites and, finally, as the sea enters the frame, startling blue. It's a visually gorgeous sequence that feels a little tainted by cheap dialogue.There are periods where Star Trek Into Darkness feels confused. No, not confused, cluttered, as if too much has been stirred into the soup with no real idea of what the overriding flavor should be. We are given a two-hour game of musical chairs with the captain's seat in which every characteristic gets a shot at being in charge of something or just watches longingly from the sidelines: sexy Carol (Alice Eve), priggish Spock (Zachary Quinto), nervous Chekov (Anton Yelchin), grumpy Bones (Karl Urban), supercilious Uhura (Zoe Saldana), dependable Captain Pine (Bruce Greenwood) and, of course, rascally liability Kirk (Chris Pine). It's like watching a weird recasting of the seven dwarfs all vying for attention when they should be doing their jobs.Despite this being the second film in the reboot, Star Trek Into Darkness spends too much time introducing us to characters rather than allowing them to progress the story. We know who they are, so why does it need to be spelt out again so precisely? And why, oh why, does Abram still insist on Chekov mispronouncing his Vs as Ws? Yelchin is Russian, so surely he knows better. Admittedly, I don't have a lot of Russian names in my address book but I've not met one yet who actually drank wodka, other than in unimaginatively stereotypical movies.On a positive note, Cumberbatch makes a very dependable villain. He relishes the opportunity to exude power and menace and emerges the prominent star, or at least the most memorable performance, of the film. Strangely, though Kirk should be the hero of the piece, he is almost lost in the mayhem and his standout scenes are memorable largely for the presence of others: Carol removing most of her kit, Spock being stoically cantankerous or Pine just having the screen presence to swat Kirk aside.Not that it matters. Star Trek Into Darkness is fun. It's worth wasting a couple of hours over. It's just that it feels like the 'difficult second album' after a huge hit. Let's just hope Star Trek 3 is back on track.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great sequel,"In my years of being a movie goer, there have been very few movies that have surpassed the quality of the first. Not to say the first star trek was bad, but this had the chance to be a repeat of the first but instead it was the continuation of the story with hints of the first. Sure JJ Abrams level of paranoia was kind of ridiculous and I kinda knew what would happen but none of that mattered. He steered the movie into ways that made complete character and story sense. On top of all that, it looked amazing in IMAX 3D. Many movies that go the 3D route are headachy and a mess but this was awesome.If there was one complaint I had, some of the ""science"" looked fishy. I mean I get it, it's science fiction but come on, as our society moves forward would it be so wrong to have science that isn't there to just look cool?Other than that I loved every minute of it.

Incredibly well crafted,"Myself and the spouse have watched every prior Star Trek episode, movie and derivative from the sixties, and we loved this movie. It is the best so far.

Daughter had objections of not knowing why some plot aspects were important. Son in law loved it as much as we did, regardless of not knowing all the older stories.We saw this new one in an XD 3D equipped theater that made me feel I was there with the story. Well worth it.

Really bad,"This has to be one of the worst scripts ever written. They took the best of all the movies and series and made a best of film with slight variations to the plots and using the excuse that they're in a different time line. They even brought back Kahn. Why even try to recreate Kahn? Ricardo Montalbans villain portrayal is one of the best in movie history. It's kinda like a band covering a #1 hit song. You can't do it any better than the original or expect it to be better than #1. Why even try? The special effects where great and the movie was somewhat entertaining, but I hate it when Hollywood takes a series and twists it around and doesn't stick to the original knowns.

J.J. Doesn't Get It,"I know I'll sound like an old guy, but J.J. Abrams just doesn't get Star Trek. Maybe that's just fine because he is searching for a new and younger audience that probably doesn't get Star Trek either.Star Trek was never about the special effects or action. Most of the best Trek stories from all of the television shows (TOS through Enterprise) didn't rely on either. Action and special effects were always there, but they were used to tell a story instead of becoming the story.To be fair, there is one thing to like about the new Star Trek reboot. The cast is great, and it is easy to see the original actors through them. After that, I'm over this thing. It is just an action movie series using Star Trek's name to sell tickets.If you think this is great science fiction in the Star Trek universe, then enjoy it. If you are looking for something more and want to really understand what Star Trek is about then queue up ""Measure of a Man"" from TNG, just one of many classic Star Trek episodes that expose this new ""reboot"" for the sham that it is.

One of the Best Star Trek Films,"Already there have been many criticisms of this film likening it to 'Die Hard in Space' well my answer to those critics was that Die Hard was 'Star Trek on Land'. There is also no way to compare it to Die Hard which after just 5 movies is as stale as last weeks bread.It was always going to be difficult to make a Star Trek film that would not alienate, (sorry for the pun), long-time Star Trek fans and also appeal to the next generation, (sorry for that one too), of movie-goers who are not Star Trek fans.This movie seems to have done that quite admirably with tie-ins to the older Star Trek films and TV series.Although the film is over two hours long it seemed a lot less because there was hardly ever a dull moment. Star Trek always needed to be at the cutting edge of any special effects available at the time, so the use of cgi was always going to be needed in abundance.I was long awaiting this movie as it promised to keep the Star Trek story going after a run of almost 50 years. This movie does it better than the awful 'Enterprise' and 'Deep Space 9' TV series which were more likely to have put people off Star Trek for life.Perhaps the people who will complain the most are likely to be Star Trek haters, and also the most critical of Star Trek's avid fans. They are the ones who scrutinise every detail under a magnifying glass. As for me I found the characters to be close to the original ones as possible with just a few differences which are quite acceptable.On the whole I have no qualms in giving this movie the thumbs up and a perfect score of 10 as it ticked almost all the boxes for me. On just a few times when it didn't, I am willing to overlook.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A captivating visual voyage,"Infused with captivating visual, impressive action pieces and solid acting from the cast, Star Trek Into Darkness is one of the best movies of this year yet. It is near relentless in its action, and although the plot is not as crisp as the first, its great cast does more than make up for it. As far as graphic prowess goes, it's hard to find any movie of recent time that has the same caliber, it's highly superior to the point of merging the landscape and people who inhibit it as a believable rendition of life on a futuristic world.The relationship between crew is engaging as it's developed between breaks from life threatening situations, the cast seems comfortable with their roles. Zachary Quinto amazingly portrayed Spock as cold and compose second-in-command and it's great to see him banters with Benedict Cummberbatch as Khan, both are known due their respective TV series. Benedict looks and sounds very enigmatically intellect, he just oozes confidence with sophisticated voice as if he was a young Patrick Stewart.Chris Pine as James T. Kirk prominently appears as the brash rogue leader of the Enterprise, his interactions with Spock are often funny in bromantic way. Zoe Saldana, John Cho, Simon Pegg and Karl Urban round out the crew, each brings significantly different vibe with them. Simon Pegg has more comedy-oriented role to bear, as he usually does, although it doesn't work every time, he gives a strong performance nonetheless. Karl Urban has a lighter role as venturing physician of the ship, it's good to see him in more casual tone than his other roles.Script and screenplay work in such hasty pace, it has just barely the time to cover everyone, but they all have their time to shine. With well written dialogue, especially Spock's and Khan's brilliant delivery, the movie offers suaveness in supplement of full blown cinematic action, which utilizes incredible 3D effect and impeccable motion. For once, I don't really mind the debris flying to my face. Colors are greatly refined, it has mostly quaint silvery palette aside from when it's needed to have brighter dye. Breathtaking scenes are in abundance, despite the fact that majority of the movie plays out inside the Enterprise.While I feel the first title has better plot, Star Trek Into Darkness is a more than an excellent sequel. In IMAX it shines even better, offering crisp graphic on the level of Hugo or Life of Pi. Set pieces are integrated fluidly throughout the quiet lengthy production, it tirelessly gives bigger explosive stunts than before. It is an incredible voyage prior the journey where no man has gone before.Rate 8/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Star Trek: Into Darkness, is a great action film. It is not a great Star Trek film.","There is a lot to enjoy and feast on in, Star Trek: Into Darkness, the visuals are once again fizzling with a pristine look and sparking explosions, and the snappy dialogue is back. Now Into Darkness never reaches Avengers level of funny, but there is still a chuckle in seeing Mr Spock's inability to be well be ""normal"" and Scotty still provides some important comic relief. But, for me, there was something missing. I only really started to be fully engaged when I realised that Star Trek is just fun. And at the moment of typing that last sentence I could feel the Treckies slipping away from me. However, fleeing Treckies, Into Darkness stops to work when you try to squeeze some real emotion out of it. And, perhaps unfourtunatly, Star Trek: Into Darkness, is a great action film. It is not a great Star Trek film.For the full review, take a look at kierankingfilm.blogspot.co.uk",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This movie was the best I had seen all year,"This movie was truly amazing. It was better than the last one, definitely. What I loved best about it was the HUGE twist it had. Usually, when the producers of a movie preview a trailer, worldwide, they tend to give away the whole plot of the movie. But when I first saw the trailer of this movie, I was left with a mystery to what they have done to Khan, and when I found out, I was absolutely mind blown.Now, I would recommend that you don't listen to the reviewers that have said things such as 'don't watch it because of the graphics,' 'don't watch it because of the lack of the creativeness of the plot,' and 'don't watch it because of the lack of sci-fi it has.' I respect all of those opinions but they are pretty false. The movie has outstanding effects and an outstanding story plot. And seriously, how is this movie lack sci-fi? That's the biggest bull I've ever heard in my life.I give this a rate of 9/10 and a 10/10 would recommend you'd watch. But if you consider watching it, please watch the first one so you could have a better understanding.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Just a great movie of a great franchise.,"The very negative comments here are clearly from 'Trekkies' who have never really left the original series, as good as it was. But, things have moved on. Chris Pine plays Kirk very well and I never thought anyone could ever play Spock, but Zachary Quinto is just excellent. The story, although a seeming rehash of 'the Wrath of Khan' is pretty good and although it has elements of the original, it has been thoroughly modernised for the 21st century, and to be honest, I found Benedict Cumberpatch's portrayal of Khan far better than the Ricardo Montalban interpretation with his silly plastic pectorals. It was also really nice to see Peter Weller again and I think Karl Urban was inspired casting, although I hear, sadly, he won't be playing any more roles as 'Bones'. I suppose I have to ask myself the question, what was JJ Abrams supposed to do? 'Not' use CGI effects to the max? Perhaps the die hards would have preferred another 'Class M Planet' with dead flat studio floors amid the rocks? Anyway, I think it's a exciting fast paced brilliant production worthy of the Star Trek name.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Trip Into Darkness,"With ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" J.J. Abrams directs his second Star Trek movie following Star Trek (2009). In comparison to the first movie it is clearly visible that the crew of the Enterprise now know each other better. In the first movie they had to introduce all characters to each other, explain how everyone got to being aboard Enterprise etc. In this movie this is no longer necessary and the film can therefore concentrate on its plot.WARNING: SPOILERS! PLOT The plot is definitively more sophisticated than in the first movie. In the first movie a Romulan traveled back through time to revenge on Spock and after the destruction of Vulcan faces Kirk and Enterprise in an epic space battle. Although a similar space battle is also fought in ""Into Darkness"" this time the storyline is more complex. This time the distinction between good and bad is blurred - in both antagonists (Khan, Admiral Marcus). For example, Khan's motive is not only revenge but also fear for his crew and this is what motivates his actions and lets the viewer sympathize with ""the bad guy"". Admiral Marcus, in contrast, at first seems like a (slightly) militant Admiral (but not a foe) until it is revealed that he has built a secret starship and wants to apprehend Khan at all cost (e.g. ordering Kirk to fire torpedoes at Khan's location on the Klingon homeworld,and his fight against Enterprise when Kirk doesn't hand over Khan to him).Although I liked the plot structure in General (Nibiru Mission - assaults on earth - Enterprise's hunt of Khan - and final confrontation with both Khan and Marcus) there were some moments that I didn't like very much.1) Enterprise hiding under the surface of the ocean on Nibiru - This was simply illogical and only written into the plot because of the ""cool"" effect of the Enterprise emerging from the water. Why didn't they simply stay in orbit in order to remain undetected by the prewarp civilization? 2) The ""Wrath of Khan"" reference in the end - When Kirk enters the room with the lethal Radiation in order to get Enterprise's engines back online I already knew that this was meant to be a homage to Star Trek II. The only difference is that in this movie Kirk ""dies"" and Spock stands at the glasdoor, talking to his captain for the supposedly last time. The dialogue sequence was almost exactly copied from ""The Wrath of Khan"". It felt like an (over)dramatic broad hint to fans of the ""old"" movies. A bit less would have been more, at least in this case.3) Saving Kirk with the superhuman blood of Khan - Of course it was clear that Abrams couldn't let Kirk die (because he's an essential part of the Enterprise crew and because of future movies)but the solution with Khan's blood came a bit too quick. Bones sees the tribble move, and seems to synthesize a cure from Khan's blood without any difficulties.CHARACTERS KIRK - Kirk has certainly developed since the first movie - he seems a better captain than in the first movie (caring for his Crew, also questioning orders given by superior if they are ethically / morally wrong). However, he still tends to do unnecessary (stupid) things such as hiding Enterprise under the ocean and trashing Khan on Kronos (he should know that this is pointless - it won't bring Admiral Pike back to life)--- good performance by Chris Pine SPOCK - Qunito better adopts Spock's cool logic than in the first movie. Spock reacts rationally but - when Kirk ""dies"" - he also Shows his human side (much more than the ""old"" Spock) by crying and furiously shouting a certain name. BUT: When he pursues Khan on earth, he even adopts Kirk's bad thrashing attitude - by beating Khan almost to his death until Uhura stops him.BONES - Urban Plays Bones both in his traditional grumpy way known from the original series but also with his very own humour.SCOTTY - Fortunately more involved in the story line and not only as comic relief. He even saves Enterprise by sabotaging Admiral Marcus's ship and helping Kirk to secure the bridge. Nice Scottish Accent by Pegg;-) ADMIRAL MARCUS - good Performance by Weller. However, he somehow diminishes to a secondary antagonist in comparison to Khan.KHAN - Cumberbatch's charismatic acting really makes Khan the strongest character in the movie. Cumberbatch's voice really sounds very threatening and he masters both emotional scenes (in his cell on Enterprise)and fighting scenes very well. It is great to see Khan as a multidimensional character and not a one-dimensional-revenge character (compare Nero from 2009's Star Trek).CONCLUSION: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Extremely exciting,"I had several major problems with J.J. Abrams first Star Trek movie. Just briefly, my big three complaints: it's too action-oriented, where Star Trek is supposed to be a little more philosophical; it moves too fast; they've really screwed up the character of James T. Kirk, and Chris Pine is by far the weakest actor in the movie. The sequel, unfortunately, retains most of those problems. I guess, though, that I've just come to accept that this is what a J.J. Abrams Star Trek movie is going to be like. The fact is, I quite enjoyed this film. The one major improvement is Pine's acting. He definitely seems more comfortable in the role. All the other actors, as with the previous installment, are excellent, particularly Zachary Quinto as Spock. This one also has stronger, more memorable villains than the previous installment (it was Eric Bana, I remember, but I don't recall what his deal was). The pace here is, again, breathless, but, for the most part, it's really well plotted. The action sequences are gripping as Hell, and the character work is so excellent it's all really involving. I definitely recommend this if you're at all interested.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wow,"WOW! J.J. Abrams does it again! Ten years ago who would have thought that somebody could completely revamp the Star Trek franchise? And not only revamp but REVIVE a franchise that had seemed to have long since seen its hayday. Sure, Star Trek fans were still in the millions and their passion was strong. Yet, here we are after the second installment in the new Star Trek series and it feels as though the original shine, shimmer and intrigue never left.Abrams gives us his follow up to his amazing re-imagination of Star Trek. Leaning more towards the kind of recipe that often leads to disaster in action films these days, he blew our minds with something truly new. Fans of the original Star Trek went crazy, and non-fans went crazy. Like me, I had ALWAYS been a Star Wars fan through and through. After seeing Abrams Star Trek I put away my saber and hood and adopted a phaser and Starfleet garb.It had all the right ingredients (despite what I said before about the recipe), furious action, the wild expanse and intrigue of space, a cast of actors/actresses who feel as at home in the Enterprise as Shatner and Nemoy did so many years ago. It included a villain in an insane Romulan (played the unrecognizable Eric Bana) that not only you could hate but one you could fear. It opened with one of the most powerful scenes in a film from recent memory, one that altered the normal recipe to make your viewers cry at the end, Star Trek made you cry at the beginning. You saw the relationship and development of Pine and Quinto as they embraced Kirk and Spock, fulfilling every footstep set down by their predecessors, and creating a few of their own.This presented one HUGE problem for Abrams. How could he possibly top it? Like many before him, Coppola, Nolan, Lucas, Spielberg etc, he now joins that elite group of filmmakers who can best their first attempts.Into Darkness stays true to its name, emerging you headfirst into a much darker realm of Star Trek than we have seen before. Despite the darkness, the film maintains a light mood and some good comic relief from time to time. Like Bones always says ""Dammit man I'm a doctor not a....*insert tag here*"". This is STILL funny. It also helps that Abrams starts this movie off AGAIN with another powerful scene. Not as emotional as the first films intro but this one was lighter, including lush greenery (reddery?) that is in complete contrast to the darkness of the rest of the film. Yet when the Enterprise departs and we hear the new Star Trek score an overwhelming feeling of ""OH YES! HERE WE GO AGAIN!"" cheers and swells inside of you like a child waiting for the ice cream truck.I won't give much away because surprisingly this film had a couple unexpected twists and turns. I will suffice to say that you are in for quite a treat once you go to see this film. The acting again, is superb. Another problem I felt that Abrams faced was how to make another iconic villain like Nero. Benedict Cumberbatch to the rescue anyone? By deepening his voice to a rumble usually only found in the minds of those reading The Hobbit (Cumberbatch will be voicing Smaug in the upcoming film this December) he can fill you with chills as you stare into his icy, inhuman eyes.This film surpassed all expectations. If anyone had doubted Abrams talent before, he has hushed the naysayers. Be prepared to be plunged Into Darkness....",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Utterly entertaining action movie, but an odd Star Trek","The last Start Trek movie I watched was about 15 years ago or so, so I watched this one as a stand-alone movie, without knowing what the previous new generation Star Trek films were about or the story was coming from. Well, surprise surprise, the movie was utterly entertaining and engaging. It was so enjoyable that I didn't even check my phone once.Overall, the story is a deviation from what Star Trek used to be, more a galactic battle than an exploratory trip. The philosophical exploration is almost absent from this film, nothing that makes me ponder, wonder or reflect. And the little thing there, is nothing new, original or worth noting. I didn't mind it because I truly enjoy action Sci-Fi films, and this is a good example of the genre. I liked that there is some sort of exploration of Mr Spok's character, his motives and inner life.It was great to see a few familiar faces that I always love to see on the screen: 'Robocop' Weller, 'Hot-Fuzz' Pegg, 'Sherlock' Cumberbatch, and all-round-actor Greenwood. Pegg is hilarious as Scotty, and adds the humour and wit that the movie needs. Cumberbatch is perhaps the best of the lot, as the ice-cold intriguing Khan. Zachary Quinto is also good as the robotic not so robotic Mr Spok, and the rest of the cast are all right in their respective roles. There is a great cameo that you don't want to miss if you are a hardcore Star Trek fan.The production is great regarding interior design, city landscaping, robotics and special effects. Very sleek overall. However, it failed to me in two fronts: the dressing of some of the Enterprise crew, who seemed to be wearing active-wear more than any futuristic clothing. The second, some of the alien characters looked pathetic, like humans wearing rubber masks not real aliens.There a few things that really annoy me in Science Fiction, because if they are there, I don't think the director, producers or writers are taking the viewers seriously. Science-fiction is fiction, for sure, but there are things that cannot change because, basically, that is impossible, those are the laws of Nature and of the Universe. One of those things is going to a planet called Kronos, which is not in our Galaxy, with a different atmosphere and environment to Planet Earth, and see the characters going out of the spaceship breathing normally. The other is thinking that a person who is exposed, unprotected, to humongous levels of radiation would come alive or could be revived using whatever.If you don't take the story too seriously, this is a terrific action film with an entertaining story, great wit and visually spectacular.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Star Trek: Into Awesomeness!,"The movie starts off in a flurry motion filled with excitement & action immediately replacing your mood with thrill & wonder.As you watch more, you begin to appreciate & enjoy the futuristic setup in every scene so beautifully done with care & detail that hundreds of people help build. And the acting of every character going hand in hand with the set stage turns out to be flawless. It just goes to show you exactly how far people are willing to take their dreams and make them a reality.So much effort & imagination goes in to making something like a movie look so real & feel so real. Any idea in a movie script generates all kinds of side props, and so much of energy & dedication go in to make everything seem just right just so that the original idea is made to look & feel as real & vivid as one can possibly imagine. It almost grips your very soul and pulls you into their universe making you believe you are actually there in the moment through every scene. Now THAT's good story telling.The very title of the movie Star Trek if you realize has already had a magical effect on you & your mood that you'll probably understand even further if you are an true FAN. A trek to the stars. Sounds like an impossible journey to the average people, and yet, we too can experience this joyous sensation through this movie.You get everything, Kirk's Heroic Nature & with the ability to think on his feet and battle any situation HEAD-ON(Chris Pine), Spocks Quick Intellect & Reasoning with twisted styles of emotional, critical & Logical Thinking(Zachary Quinto), an exemplary villain Khan with inhuman strength & skill who appears to be a one man army whose wrath knows no bounds(Benedict Cumberbatch), Crazy Fight sequences with both, Man & Machine & all the High-Tech Gears, and of course, J.J.Abrams Legendary art of direction.It can't go wrong.

"A Star Trek on steroids, why this violence?","So I finally went to watch Star Trek last night. Disappointing, I give it a 6.5/10 since I have the feeling I witnessed the birth of an hybrid between Star Trek, Star War and Matrix on steroids. The special effects are definitely great, the story is interesting but the actuation is pathetic with dialogs at the level of kindergärtner discussions. J.J. Abrams tried desperately not to bore the viewers with their own thoughts by creating this high-pace movie full of explosions and ultra- violence. There is not a moment in movie where the viewers can really appreciate the superb special effects.Space exploration is cool enough on its own, so this unnecessary violence ruined the movie and made me feel uncomfortable while watching it.

Explosive and exceeds expectations,"I will be the first to admit. I hate Star Trek. I am not a fan of the older films or the TV series. I found them dull, mundane and boring to say the least. However, when the re-boot came out a few years ago it blew me away and as the curtains closed left me with all sorts of ideas regarding how good the sequel would be. What can I say, it doesn't disappoint in any shape or form.It has all of the same breath taking moments as its previous instalment and including moments of sheer brilliance. Pine (Kirk) heads up the cast once more with his brash, rock and roll, playboy approach to the captain and Quinto (Spock) is suited fantastically to the role. However for me it was Cummberbatch (Khan) who stole the show. What a performance!! I always analyse villains in my movies and as far as I'm concerned no one touches Heath Legder's Joker or Gary Oldman's crazed cop Stansfield in Leon The Professional. However, this guy gets close. Every time he is on screen the tension builds and due to this the excitement of seeing him on screen builds every single time he is off of it. His hatred for everyone and everything is demonstrated incredibly well and his 'secret plots' remind me of the madness and secretness of the Joker from The Dark Knight.Overall this was breath-taking and I rarely say that about any film that is released in this day and age. If you are sitting around wondering weather or not to take the plunge with this one, I would recommend that it is well worth your 8 quid! Better than the previous film..... Most definitely.

Almost Fell Off The Edge Of My Seat!,"Jam-packed with excitement, terror and most of all adventure. From the word go there were high expectations of the Star Trek crew to pull off an adaptation of the original television series, to impress current fans whilst also gaining more. The first film was a definite success, showing Captain Kirk as a reckless young man full of spirit. In 'Star Trek Into Darkness' this depiction fades very slightly and we see Captain Kirk's courage much more obviously and his will to do anything to ensure his crew's security. Khan, I felt, was a perfect villain. Matching Captain Kirk in many key area's of their personalities, he creates a great friction between the characters and is almost a mirror image of Captain Kirk which is extremely interesting to watch. The CGI effects, as always, were outstanding. The whole film was alive and buzzing keeping the suspense tight and the power at full. The creators obviously set their phasers to stun the audience and succeeded.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Modern politics meets sci-fi meets action thriller,"JJ Abrams' reboot of the Star Trek film franchise attempted to bring everyone on board, providing something for long-standing fans and newbies like me alike. He continues to do this successfully in Into Darkness.Much like the TV series, the film has discussions on important philosophical ideas such as the Prime Directive and the concept of pacifism and non-intervention. The narrative of the film in particular hinges on terrorism and the Federation's response to it. However, unlike the small-screen series it conducts these discussions while entire cities explode and characters jump of out of spaceships in outer space.Into Darkness moves along at a rattling pace and the fight and chase scenes through the streets of Earth have a sense of weight to them. Benedict Cumberbatch has excellent screen presence as the cold and menacing villain Khan and Zachary Quinto is fantastic as Spock.

'Star Trek Into Darkness' keeps frenzied pace of first movie; adds social commentary creator Rodenberry insisted on,"Remember that excited feeling you had when seeing ""The Empire Strikes Back"" for the first time ever? How about that stunned feeling you felt when Darth Vader tells Luke Skywalker he's his father? That's the sort of feelings I walked away with after watching ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" I'm so happy I avoided all spoilers for it. I walked into the movie blindly and was so thrilled I couldn't stop smiling through the entire thing.After a terrorist attack on the Federation council, James T. Kirk sets out with the crew of the Enterprise in search of the man. The terrorist, John Harrison, has fled into Klingon territory. Kirk is ordered to take him out through the use of a torpedo. Kirk disobeys orders and travels into Klingon space to capture the terrorist and bring him back to Earth where he will stand trial for his crimes. However, a rogue Starfleet officer wants to take justice into his own hands and only Kirk and the Enterprise stand in his way.I've read a few of the reviews floating around out there and must say I agree with some of them. ""Into Darkness"" is a true ""Star Trek"" film. While the 2009 film was full of action and humor, it didn't have the social commentary Trekkies came to expect from earlier entries. That's not the case with ""Into Darkness."" What we get here is the best of both worlds. The action aspect of ""Star Wars"" is still present, but it's coupled with the smarts ""Star Trek"" is known for.There are so many fun little tributes to the original series in ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" What's crazy is none of them feel desperately forced into the story. Writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Damon Lindelof peppered the homages throughout an already exciting storyline, which helped long-time ""Trek"" lovers find something familiar to latch on to. At the same time, the references wouldn't leave someone new to the franchise wondering what's happening.My only real complaint with ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is the handling of the McCoy character. Writers took a funny habit the good doctor had in the original TV series and drove it into the ground. Every time we see McCoy, he uses some sort of metaphor to describe the situation. It starts to feel like the stale joke your buddy tells every time you see him. After the first ten times, it's just not funny anymore. How many different plays on, ""Dammit, Jim! I'm a doctor not a speed boat captain!"" can you laugh at before it gets old?I was impressed with the CGI and special effects in the film. The movie looks beautiful and the actors meld seamlessly with their artificial backgrounds. There are times where the Enterprise looks a bit animated, but it's nothing to complain about.""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is the movie die-hard Trekkies wanted to see in 2009. All the elements creator Gene Rodenberry wanted the show to have are present. However, it comes wrapped in a package that will appeal to a broader audience.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Exhilarating fun in the final frontier,"In the universe created by J.J. Abrams, the cultures of the past Trek genre define the actions the characters take against contemporary adversities and issues. Adroitly, he satisfies both the Trekkie in us as well as the ignorant big summer movie-goer. With his action-packed, thrilling homage to the series, Abrams takes The Enterprise boldly to where no man has gone before. 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is an immensely enjoyable summer movie that yet has the brain and heart for those who expect a journey onto the final frontier.James Kirk (Chris Pine) continues to be driven by his motivated instinct while being the rough-edged, rule defying Captain of Starship Enterprise. Against all his righteousness, he is always challenged by Spock (Zachary Quinto)'s logical and bookish persuasions that lead to some tongue-in-cheek conflict. After saving an endangered species from an impending volcanic eruption, Enterprise returns home to Star Fleet headquarters to the news of a terror attack on their London offices. The Mastermind is a rogue officer John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who subsequently attacks the emergency meeting of Officers. Thus begins the game of chess where Kirk and his crew have to outsmart, outmaneuver and outmatch Harrison and bring him to justice. But in their journey, they will encounter betrayal, vulnerability, a test of nerves and some Klingons. Scotty (Simon Pegg) has quit because he doesn't trust the torpedoes aboard the ship, Chekov is challenged with the ship's mechanical failures, Spock and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) are having a troubled relationship, Bones (Karl Urban) is ever tensed about Kirk's health and the mission's health and Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) has cruel intentions for the Enterprise. In this scenario, Kirk will have to make some bold decisions while considering Spock's logical and moral notions if they have to overcome the unstoppable super-soldier and emerge unscathed from such adversity.Abrams' team of writers have a topical script that sets contemporary threats in a futuristic wartime. Action explodes in a frenzy as the script propels at warp speed, thus providing wholesome entertainment. Meanwhile, the strengths and idiosyncrasies of the Enterprise crew members are well exposed to lay the foundation for this franchise to expand. Chekov's charming lines such as 'Captain on the bridge!' set a new tone while Scotty's brilliance in the ship's engine room assures us of its longevity. Sulu is competent and finds occasional comfort in the Captain's chair and Bones adds a more humane and caring element. Uhura's audacity and dedication to the fleet are laudable whereas the new girl Carol (Alice Eve) looks to be a promising eye candy if nothing else. Thus, the supporting cast have chunkier roles with more emphasis on laying the foundation for their characters while justifying their purpose on the bridge. Quinto excels as Spock, whose half human-half Vulcan sensibilities can often times be perceived as cold heartedness. His matter-of-fact mannerisms are not always well received by Kirk or Uhura but as he exposes his reasoning, we witness Quinto's excellence in embodying the character. His fist fight with Harrison in the climax is ridiculously old schoolish compared to what we witness throughout the movie but that blame rests upon Abrams only. Chris Pine carries the burden of credibility very well. As the Captain, he may be reckless but he portrays focus, composure and wit in every situation. Pine depicts the multitude of emotions convincingly and establishes his presence in the company of Quinto and Cumberbatch.Benedict Cumberbatch proves why he is such a prized actor. Arguably the best Sherlock ever, Benedict has the power to express emotions in mild and serious situations in exemplary manner. It takes a long time to figure out if Harrison is truly evil or is he a pawn in a bigger war and therefore, his multi-dimensional character offered variety and depth for Benedict to portray and he did it brilliantly. As a mastermind who becomes a force to reckon with for the entire Star Fleet, Benedict leaves us admiring evil.J.J. Abrams has perhaps made the funniest and wittiest Star Trek and has also directed it into darkness. The evil is far superior for an ordinary captain and his crew to counter and it does take each of the characters to break away from their mould to overcome this threat. Abrams has brought the characters together as a team that we can get accustomed to while building those bonds through often quirky dialogue exchanges or heated confrontations. On the other hand, he depicts Starship Enterprise in all its grandeur in the scenes when it emerges from the ocean, as it frequently goes into warp and as it suffers damage in battles. Just like that, he connects the audience to the ship and its crew for the many journeys that are in store. Abrams did not redefine a genre here. Instead, he opened up a genre to the general movie-goer by keeping it entertaining enough for a big summer movie. Hardcore trekkies may find few flaws in the story-line but they will appreciate the subtle references to the plots and characters of the previous films and TV shows. The visual effects team will leave the creators of 'Oblivion' applauding for them at the award ceremonies with the stunning work in creating the future San Francisco and London while depicting other worlds and the beauty of space as Enterprise leaves its Warp trails.Into Darkness is a solid followup to 2009's 'Star Trek' and it paves the way for journeys into the final frontier with Starship Enterprise while satisfying geeks and alluring mere mortals. With a talented team of writers who assisted in 'Lost', a visual effects team that sets a pretty high bar and some dedicated, versatile actors who could enliven their characters, J.J. Abrams provides a rich, vivid and thrilling escape into space that has loads of entertainment to be a summer blockbuster.

Should have been better,"I really enjoyed the 2009 film and anticipated the sequel would be as good or better. But having seen Star Trek - Into the Darkness twice now, I thought it was a great movie up until the surprise revelation (I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it yet). After that, it kinda with down hill for me. I felt cheated the way the story turned out as it seemed like the writers got lazy towards the end. I was somewhat stunned at what I had just witnessed on-screen and after seeing it again, I still felt the same. I guess maybe I'm a crazed Star Trek fan to think that.Other reviews have focused on the good or on the bad. I tried to be less analytical and see this movie for what it is. A mainly a fast paced action film interspersed with scenes of human interest which facilitates the deeper development of the main characters and their inter- relationships. Namely, A summer blockbuster. So even with my concerns, I do believe Star Trek - Into the Darkness a very good movie that Star Trek fans and non fans would enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Brilliant,"This film was great, didn't really need the 3D But i thought the 3D brought the Enterprise to life. The actors were well chosen and as its own movie is AWESOME. Instead of just being the simple good guy vs bad guy the film has layers and decent amount of action. There are good character scenes emotional wise, you really see their feelings they express it very well. It was cool, It was Exiting and it was worth watching.I recommend this film even if your not a massive Star trek fan (Like Me)Well Done JJ",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good, but not as good as the the first","This is a good movie, but only because the cast have so faithfully recreated the appealing characters of the original cast. The rest of the actors also do quite well. But it gets caught up occasionally in a secondary plot and a political message and loses its focus.I also had what I like to call a ""Titanic"" moment. I know a lot of people loved that movie, but when I saw the leads dancing around in the freezing Atlantic waters which apparently had been warmed to bath temperature by flooding into the ship, any suspension of disbelief I'd had came crashing down. And that was a real event! This wasn't quite as bad, and I won't mention the STID moment that hit me like that to spoil it for anyone who reads this, but it was rather large. The science in ST is always a little fantastic, but this was sophomoric. Hint: it has to do with gravity.Also, there should be someone with a ruler ready to whack JJ on the head for the next movie and say ""You did that in the last one!"" I also missed the slightly skewed ego maniacal strut that another actor once gave a certain bad guy. Speaking of which... Any movie only needs one of those, not two.I don't want to complain too much because all in all, the movie is enjoyable. I'm not sorry I spent the money, and will definitely watch it again when it hits Blu-ray.With every movie I see, I always listen to the crowd leaving the theater to see how much they enjoyed it. They were buzzing in delight after the first one, not this one. The cast lifted this one a full two points in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Connoiseurs May Relish This Trek,"Connoisseurs of ""Star Trek"" may fall in love again with tribbles and Khan Noonian-Singh. Those not familiar with Star Trek will still enjoy this stand-alone story which doesn't even require the audience to recall the first of J. Abrams' resurrections, with much the same acting crew, in 2009.I first watched James Tiberius Kirk, Mr. Spock, Dr. Bones McCoy, Scotty, Lt. Uhura, Mr. Sulu and Chekhov, go where no man or woman had gone before, back in 1966. I get as much of a kick out of this movie.The pilot of the first Star Trek series, a two-part episode entitled ""The Menagerie,"" starred Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike. With his sapphire-blue eyes and charismatic personality, Hunter had been successful earlier playing Jesus Christ in ""King of Kings."" Bruce Greenwood fleshes out what Commander Pike was truly like before his injury depicted 47 years ago in Roddenberry's first stab at creating the Federation.William Shatner was an up-and-coming young actor who had achieved considerable fame in Stratford Ontario, acting in quite an array of the Bard's histories, comedies, tragedies and romances. Shatner had been impressive in such films as ""Judgment at Nuremburg,"" ""The Brothers Karamazov"" and ""The World of Suzi Wong."" Christopher Pike in the current reboot has to be Kirk, believably, without being Shatner.Even to attempt to recapture the imagery, the cadence and the poignancy of those early shows would be very daunting. For director Abrams to meld numerous fan-favorite characters, themes and scenes, producing one of the best Star Trek films I have seen, is truly admirable.Karl Urban's tone, pace, his Southern accent, even his body language and timing, channel DeForrest Kelly's Dr. McCoy, right down to the doctor's paranoia about technology, especially the idea of his molecules being discorporated, then recorporated, when he is asked to ""beam down."" The Chief Engineer doing most of the beaming down, Commander Montgomery Scott, is re-imagined by Simon Pegg, who takes Scott where James Doohan, the original Scotty, had not gone before, making Scott just as important in several scenes as any of the principal characters. Both Scott and Uhura figure prominently into the resolution of the many tangled webs in the plot in ways that Doohan and Nichelle Nichols, the original Uhura, would be proud, and maybe even more than a little envious, of.Zachary Quinto's interpretation of the young Mr. Spock is breathtakingly like the Spock that Trekkies know and love, yet Quinto makes that character his own, as well, newly-minted. The brief impressive cameo by Leonard Nimoy, himself, is tantamount to a Vulcan mind-meld between the older and younger actor. Quinto's acting skills somehow both recapitulate and reinvent those of his predecessor.Chris Pine is not William Shatner. Somehow, however, Pine manages to act more headstrong, more impulsive, and even more of an outrageous maverick who seems to think that rules are like candy canes to be crunched and swallowed or spat out, before reinventing new procedures that defy the Prime Directive to solve thorny galactic conundrums.This movie cranks. With a running time of about two hours, there is no lull, no dead space, no time for your adrenalin to abate even a little. At several points, the suspense was almost unbearable, when I could not imagine how the entire crew might escape certain death.Abrams, who has also produced ""Lost"" and ""Super 8,"" is at the top of his form.The cinematography is extraordinary, accentuating, amplifying and delineating scenes and moments like a Greek chorus.Generally speaking, the Academy Award Committee turns a blind eye toward science fiction films, but it is just possible that they may make an exception in terms of the way this movie was filmed.The great scientist, Sir Arthur C. Clark, warned 53 years ago in ""Profiles in the Future,"" that ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" That's how I felt watching this movie. These professional pretenders produced one believable illusion after another. Cognizant of brilliant benchmarks that went before, movies like ""Alien,"" Abrams has created a movie that can stand up to the great ones.Most amazingly, Abrams has created a Star Trek movie that does not require its audience to remember Ricardo Montalban in ""Space Seed,"" or Roddenberry's ""Star Trek III,"" both of which this movie powerfully alludes to.The suspense and excitement actually accelerate as the movie flows along. That is rare. Abrams and crew are to be praised as artists who care about their craft and their legacy. In Hollywood, that is extremely rare. To attempt to enrapture Trekkies, Trekkers, and the uninitiated -takes guts.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
HK Auteur Review - Star Trek Into Darkness,"The crew of the USS Enterprise meets an unstoppable force of terror from within Starfleet, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to capture a one man weapon of mass destruction.The central relationship between Kirk and Spock is the most compelling element out of the entire Star Trek canon. My peers frequently debate me about Star Trek: The Next Generation but my viewing experience of TNG has only been the movies. Unfortunately I missed it as a television series. For my money, there's been nothing nearly as compelling and iconic as Kirk's hot-blooded brash instinct versus Spock's cold logic and the temperamental humane Dr. McCoy caught between them. I love what they each represent and their eternal triangular quarrel. They want to work together to solve grandiose problems but they all see different on the approach. Never does one of them ever solve the solution completely with their own philosophy and often it's a varying combination of all three that saves the day. It's about hearing people out, being unassuming and adapting to new ideas. When Star Trek: The Original Series debuted in the mid-60's, Gene Roddenberry intended the original show to have a major political agenda and aimed to present an optimistic version of what man can be at their very best.Much of the essence from Star Trek: The Original Series remains in Star Trek Into Darkness, it contains themes about colonialism, political intervention, foreign policy and terrorism. But it is there only if you want to read it. These themes are expressed in a muted fashion as the thematic discussions are always running parallel to major action set pieces. As if the material was like a shark that had to keep moving at breakneck speed or it will risk dying of boredom. Personally, I never minded those thematic discussions in the previous Star Trek films. A few more quiet moments wouldn't have been bad either. Just saying. Now that J.J. Abrams is helming the next Star Wars movie, the ""Star Wars vs. Star Trek"" geek war that existed when I was a teenager might very well be over now. A Star Wars influence is present in the film and I ponder what elements Abrams will bring over.The script is workshopped to an inch of its life. Heck, it's indicative in the film's ""no colon"" title. The fact that the writers have been quoted stating that ""There's no word that comes after the colon after Star Trek that's cool."" has been clearly spent way too much time pulling their hair psychotically, obsessing over every detail and perfecting the story over coffee-spilled paper. Seriously, is there really a group of people out there that feels negative about colons after the movie title? Does that really justify warping (yes, pun intended) English grammar? This sounds like ranting but I really mean this as a compliment to their supposed geek madness.The cast delivers as they did in the previous installment. I do think having watched the previous installment helps immensely as there are not a lot of character building moments for everybody. But the actors are all well casted in their roles and fortunately every crew member still has something to do. Zachary Quinto shines as Spock and his friendship with Chris Pine's Kirk is a believable one. Their friendship is the heart of the movie. Simon Pegg gets to do something new as Scotty. Benedict Cumberbatch is a great villain. He owns the audience. One minute he is savagely evil, the next minute we slightly sympathize with him and then he shifts again. On that note, I can't wait for Sherlock season 3.This is a very ambitious film that has a lot of things to accomplish. It's trying to deliver a story with multiple characters, please both the non-fans and the fans, go to new territory but also honor the spirit of the original series. The film essentially wants to have its cake and eat it too but it accomplishes it really well. If J.J. Abrams' gave any more pop culture nods as he does in this film, his head would fall off. I cheered at the spectacle of the action scenes, laughed at the in-jokes, and almost cried at the film's climax. It doesn't go to new territory as much as the first one and I hope they do go somewhere new for the next installment.I want to see it again and look forward to the third installment. Hopefully it won't take as long as this one.For more reviews, please visit my blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I Liked it Very Much,"I cannot say I LOVED it, but I did LIKE it, very much. It is a 21st Century reboot of a beloved series. Let me first say that there is no way the any director or group of actors can recapture the magic of the original Star Trek series of the 1960s. Mr. Spock's subtly sarcastic and thinly veiled elitist tone played by Mr. Nimoy is untouchable. The egotistical yet fiercely caring and loyal, calculatingly yet impulsive, Captain Kirk played William Shatner was done brilliantly with a figurative *wink* at the audience. Therefore, it would be utterly ridiculous to even attempt to duplicate the magic of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. And, the story lines were also fantastic, considering the limited time and budget the writers/producers had to work with. I think that is why they keep rehashing them, because they were so well written and thought out in the first place. If you check all of the Star Trek series, many of the stories of the 1960s were redone in some shape or form in each of the series of the 1980s on, including the movies.However, JJ Abrams and the actors have managed to capture the essence of Star Trek; good acting, action with some humor thrown in. I do like the new Spock and Captain Kirk. I like the fact that they are still the major players, because that is true to the series. I like the fact that the key to their teamwork is their friendship and eventually mutual respect. Zachary Quinto has managed to emote some of the sarcastic tone of the original Mr. Spock as well as his inner struggle. Mr. Quinto does have a hard act to follow, as does Chris Pine as Captain Kirk. But, he does have the charm, good looks, wicked humor to pull it off. And yes, Kirk for the most part gets every girl, except Lt. Uhura. Benedict Cumberbach looks nothing like Richardo Montalban who played Khan in the series and movie. Yet, he managed to make the role his own; the commanding, fierce ruthlessness and physical presence. Lithe, lean yet muscular enough to convince us of his physicality. Eloquent, elitist, dismissive of others, his body language and facial expressions appropriately communicate his attitude of superiority.The special effects were fantastic. I saw it in 3D and I must say the visual effects people had a field day. But, there was still enough focus on the story so that you did not feel like the whole movie an orgy of explosions and CGI. There was some creative license taken with the story line, so if you are a purist, it will upset you. However, if you listen carefully, there are hints and allusions (details) in the story that only hardcore trekkies would recognize, which I won't give away (the movie has just been released less than two weeks ago after all). I do not think that Star Trek has lost its way, the essence of Star Trek is still there -- if you look closely enough. I could not give this movie a ten because of the changes to the original story line surrounding some of the characters.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I have a mix feeling about this.,"Today I watched STID. I am not a Trekkie but I am fan of Star Trek for a long time. I have watched original Star Trek movies. Wrath of Khan is my favorite from the series. I loved Star Trek(2009) and I respect Mr.J.J. Abrams works. Even a week ago I re-watched Star Trek before watching the new one.Now about this movie. STID is a good movie, no doubt. Story balances James, Spock and Khan very equally. Scotty plays a vital role and others characters like Uhura, Bones, Sulu, Chekov gets limited screen time. Adding Alice Eve as Dr.Carol was a good choice. Benedict Cumberbatch did a fantastic job as Khan, beside him Zachary did great job. While Chris Pine did lost some of his charm as James T. Kirk. He was great in first movie but he is kind of average in this one. I didn't cared about him much.For me this movie some how failed to create the impact I experienced on watching Star Trek at 2009. May be I should watch it again. I am 26, I enjoyed Iron Man 3 few weeks ago. I am was excited about this movie but it didn't worked like that.Last Words: Star Trek Into Darkness is good movie. A good experiences in 3D, Great Vfx and sound effects. 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Star Trek Into Darkness"" Review","""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a more personal story than the first film. It really delves into the relationship of Kirk and Spock as well as Kirk finally becoming a leader that the enterprise needs and deserves.J.J. Abrams again does a fantastic job at directing. His camera work and set pieces are well composed. He manages to balance great humor with a lot of emotional and dramatic depth. I, in particular, really like how every character is showcased well. They don't just take the back seat to Kirk and Spock. Action sequences are well choreographed and really gets the blood pumping. There are so many moments where I am legitimately worried about the faith of a character.The characters are great and retain a lot of what we love about them from the first movie. Kirk, Chris Pine, in particular shows a lot of growth. He slowly turns from an arrogant captain to an actual leader. Spock's dedication to Kirk is commendable and he has some really great moments near the end of the film. Zachery Quinto is amazing as this character to a point where he matches even surpasses the original. Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan is great. His portrayal is menacing and he even has moments where we feel sorry for him.Overall ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a really great movie with lots of great action, a compelling story, and characters that are incredibly likable. Michael Giacchino's score is fantastic and comes in at the right time to where everything just becomes better. His score has a layer of mystery and adventure in it that just absorbs the audience into the film. The one problem I had with this film is towards the end. It had me scratching my head, but it has to do something with Khan and his blood. However, that's just a minor nitpick in a fantastic movie. I give it 4.5/5, entertaining, compelling, and a lot of fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Brilliant ,Breathtaking and Amazing...!!!","Saw Star Trek Into Darkness last night and was totally blown away by the movie.Since i was a kid the first series that i fell in love with was the Gene Roddenberry's classic and the characters Captain Kirk and Spock, and since then i have watched all the spin off's and the movies that were made after that , while the original series is still my favourite i like the other spin/offs as well and when they rebooted the franchise like any other trekkie i was exited and when i watched the movie in 2009 i really liked it and it was the best movie of that year and the new one Into darkness is going to be one of the best if not the best movie of this year , the beauty of Into Darkness lies in its Spectacular Visuals , Story line and the characters , what i like the most about it JJ Abrams did not deviate from the original idea he still kept it very much alive unlike other directors nowadays and the credit must go to him for making such a brilliant and spectacular movie , i liked the new additions Cumberbatch and Alice eve , cumberbatch portrayal as the main antagonist in the movie was truly superb and no one could have done it better than him ,so folks forget all the B grade movies that have released in the past week or so and watch the Star Trek Into Darkness even if you are not a trekki you will be amazed by the movie.

"Spectacular in every way, another great addition to Abrams' collection and possibly the greatest film in terms of entertainment of all time.","When I first watched the 2009 Star Trek reboot, I thought that - despite it's flaws - nothing could compare entertainment-wise. That was until I watched its darker, grittier sequel, Into Darkness. The flaws from the first movie are gone, and there are a number of great additions to the series, which I wholly hope will continue.Into darkness is an action-packed, but well-paced movie for hardcore Trekkers and newcomers alike. The writing and screenplay are excellent: the storyline is thoroughly enjoyable throughout and draws from elements of some of the best Star Trek films from the past. Our heroes are back, but this time they're even better: Spock (Zachary Quinto) is Vulcan as ever, and Kirk (Chris Pine) is a humbler, more Shatner-esque captain. Actors in supporting roles all do fantastic work. No star's acting can be faulted.Most impressive of all, the villain (whose name I have withheld to avoid spoilers), played by Benedict Cumberbatch, is both compelling and fantastically developed. Over the course of the movie, I began to empathise with the seemingly misunderstood antagonist, but - with a sudden, well-placed plot twist, I started to hate him, more than any other movie villain before. I took pleasure in seeing the crew of the Enterprise finally deal some blows, and genuinely felt part of the movie. Into darkness made me cry, cheer and rage in the best of ways, like I never had before.As with any other Abrams movie, the special effects are incredibly impressive. The director has a way of making the large feel large and the epic feel epic, which really adds to a movie like Into Darkness. The direction was, in a word, spectacular. When I watched the film, it was in 3D IMAX, and I can honestly say that this was one of the few movies 3D added something to. It had me on the edge of my seat throughout, and during several different parts of the film, the entire audience jumped. I had never seen that before other than in a horror movie. I really was impressed and will be seeing it again as well as buying it on Blu-ray and adding it to my collection of favourites.The only criticism I cold possibly make is that the soundtrack - though one of my favourites - is a little overused. It does not detract from the experience at all, so I didn't feel that such a minor fault was worth me deducting a point out of 10.If you love the Enterprise or don't, Into Darkness is a fantastically entertaining experience throughout its two and a half hour runtime. It's definitely my favourite film of all time, and I believe it's going to make it into the IMDb top 10 movies ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of my favorites (must see movie).,"I seriously enjoyed this movie through and through. As a major Star Trek fan I have seen just about every Star Trek movie and TV series made, with the exception of Deep Space Nine, (and maybe one or two others that slipped through the cracks).I was absolutely impressed with technology and awesome interior displayed on the ship. The cities and landscaping that the CGI helped to create was fascinating.I wish all the Star Trek pictures had the ability to use this CGI technology.To me, with the money, technology, CGI, and brainpower they put into this movie, this has got to be the best Star Trek movie ever made!Aside from the absence of all the original cast members (William Shatner, etc) The new generation of actors (not to be confused with the NYG TV series) did a fantastic job continuing the on with the saga of Star Trek.On the downside, there were a couple things changed in the abilities of the characters. These abilities don't really match with the other movies and their plots. So if you keep an open mind, these new changes are good enough to make the movie an absolutely awesome movie. Just ignore those minor changes OK?This is a MUST SEE FILM FOR 2013",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Into Darkness is polished pop cinema that's also one of this summer's best releases.,"Star Trek Into Darkness is an exciting science fiction action film, with more emphasis on action than on science fiction. It's a sequel that's on par with Star Trek (2009). Trekkers may again be disappointed with director J. J. Abrams' work because he replaced much of the intelligence of the old Star Trek with humor, spectacle and, dare I say it, violence. But what else can one expect from summer blockbusters these days? It's a sign of the times, and if you want to know why it is so I recommend reading books by American historian Carroll Quigley. The well-chosen cast remain intact and provide more of that humor and interplay that people liked so much in the previous film. They do a good job. With the direction of Abrams they all deliver good performances. Chris Pine was likable before but he only got better here. I think that Zachary Quinto doesn't play Spock as well as Pine plays James T. Kirk. Quinto is fine in the role, but if you compare his performance to that of Leonard Nimoy it's clear that he's lacking. Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov was one of the standouts in the previous film. It was always interesting to see him on screen. Here he's as good as ever but he was given less screen time than before. And it's not just Chekov. It seems that all the secondary characters have less dialogue this time around. More time is spent on the action. Compared to the old Star Trek films this is a difference. But the character relationships are still there. Much of the humor is provided by Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy and Simon Pegg as Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott. The 2009 film lacked the presence of a strong villain. This time writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof make up for that with an antagonist who's a real challenge for the entire Enterprise crew. Benedict Cumberbatch deserves the praise that he has received. He's determined. He's cunning. He's ruthless. He's sympathetic when he needs to be. The alternate time line that was established allows for some neat changes to the events in the old Star Trek films. The biggest draw, however, is the eye-popping action and the exciting, slick set pieces. These are aided by Dan Mindel's appealing cinematography and Michael Giacchino's bombastic, rousing score. In conclusion, Into Darkness is a bright futuristic adventure. Considering it's high entertainment value it's no surprise that it has become a commercial success. I recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sci Fi light,"To please the mass fan base is very difficult. And Star Trek and/or any of the spin offs that came from it, has a huge fan base. While I was more aware of the Next Generation TV show than the other shows that exist, I still appreciate what they're doing in recreating something known. I liked the first one (even despite the criticism it got) and thought it was really good.This one continues in the same vain, with great action and superb effects. Quinto and Pine really dug into their roles and the relationship they're having is what makes this movie really good. Having Alice Eve as a new face in it (her character will have people trying to guess what she's up to) also helps. Funnily enough her beautiful body seems to have distressed a few people who thought it was too ""erotic"" for a Star Trek movie. Before I even watched the movie I asked around (in Germany) and no one could pin point a scene that they thought was too risky! After watching it, I still think: ""Too much ado about nothing"".So let that not hinder your viewing experience! Enjoy a really good Science Fiction movie",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Solid Sci-fi Escapism,"After a four year hiatus, J.J. Abrams has brought out a sequel to the critically acclaimed Star Trek reboot, and on the whole it is a satisfying return, if not as fresh.After a series of terrorist attacks by former Starfleet agent ""John Harrison"" (Benedict Cumberbatch), the crew of the starship Enterprise launch a mission to retrieve the fugitive and make him face justice. As can be implied, there is more to Harrison's plot than mere anarchy, and returning leads Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), are forced to face their own motivations and allegiances in this high-stakes sci-fi adventure.What is always good about sequels is that, having already introduced the primary characters, the film can warp straight ahead (see what I did there) into the narrative. In doing so, we are treated to an awesome opening sequence, in which the Enterprise's crew must save a primitive civilization from an erupting volcano. This gives an idea of the overall pace of the film, one that hardly relents in its breakneck speed and overall aura of suspense and excitement.The clash between Kirk's hot-headed approach to problems and Spock's logical conclusions is no longer one of the primary focuses of the film, though their unusual relationship is still covered, with humorous results. Scotty (Simon Pegg) is in fine form once again as a strong source of the film's comedy. Other crew members, such as Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Sulu (John Cho), aren't given an awful lot of screen time, which is to be expected in a film that has just over two hours to explore multiple planets and plot devices.The real highlight in terms of performances, however, is Benedict Cumberbatch as the elusive John Harrison, who obviously has much more significance in the Star Trek continuity than his name initially implies. Harrison is both brutal and demented, as well as sophisticated and ingenious, a kind of warped, evil version of the Sherlock Holmes that he is renowned for playing.Michael Giacchino's score, as in the first film, is utterly fantastic, evoking the tone of epic swashbucklers and classic 80's blockbusters. The set pieces as well are well above the quality of those in most recent multimillion dollar action films. There is the odd moment where a reference to previous Star Trek films or series a thrown in awkwardly, though this is only sporadic.On the whole, Star Trek Into Darkness is a commendable, solid action-adventure which I would rank more or less on par with its 2009 prequel, with highlights including Cumberbatch's performance, and the scale of some of the action sequences. I would recommend this for most cinema-goers who are looking for a fun escape that has a great balance of humour and action, something which J.J. Abrams has pulled off successfully numerous times.Final note: Though not ESSENTIAL, I would recommend viewing the 2009 film if you have not already. It gives a proper introduction to many of this film's characters and provides a proper context for the reboot series' continuity.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Old rehash of a story, why no fresh material?","First the third installation is going to be bad for the true fans, mark my word.I am a big Star Trek fan, I have watched the original series countless times and know some lines by heart. I have watched every episode of next gen, voyager, enterprise and some of deep space. I did not like the first Star Trek movie, for the most part I liked the old cast movies enough. The Next Gen movies were pretty bad for the most part. We had so many bald villains in next gen and even in the first of the last series, they aren't exactly memorable characters.I enjoyed the first of this series enough. This one was pretty good, they didn't totally destroy any of the characters, like they did to IronMan 3.I can see myself watching this series again and I don't do that much. It was a simple plot, but I did like the interaction of the characters.The only negatives: I think they under utilized Doctor Mccoy, as he only had one liners throughout his parts. bOy and this new Mccoy gained some weight. They used Uhuru way too much IMO.They never use the replicator and I would have liked to see that kind of tech. I kinda like when you saw the old cast eating etc in the original series.My primary concern is they used an old villain again. Since the series can go anywhere since the past was altered not sure why they didn't do something fresh. At least they didn't give us yet another bald villain. These remakes are just lazy writers who have no imagination.I guess the cast is ready to do one more movie, The third movie in the series is usually when they kill the series for the fans. I see this in Star Treks future I am afraid. Since none of the actors will be back for a forth, the writers will basically kill off what is left of any loyalty they had for the fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Darker & Still A Lot Of Fun,"This new ST movie lacks the freshness & surprise factor of the franchise's reboot. (The last ST succeeded way beyond our expectations.)However, it is still a blast to watch. The characters play off each other beautifully, Burt Cumberbatch makes a great villain, the script inverts (subverts?) things in surprising & satisfying ways and there is just the right amount of sly humor to go with your popcorn.I was most surprised by how heavy & philosophical this movie got at times. Star Trek has never tried to hide its humanistic beliefs. That's what has helped make this such a viable & potent franchise over ALL of these years & virtually forced its resurrections by it fan base. (BTW: I don't call myself a Trekkie --Trekker?-- not that there is anything wrong with that.)The negative backlash is unwarranted & it definitely has a right to exist.

WoW!,"I don't consider myself a die hard trek fan. Yes, I have watched every single ST movie as well as most of the original TV shows but I vote not from some bias like others have done here, my vote is purely on what I saw, heard and felt watching this movie. Hands down by far and large this movie is a solid 9 out of a possible 10! Everything was just right in this movie. The effects were simply top notch! The new twist with the villain was amazing to say the least. This is one of the few Star trek movies that have a real intensity about it. From start to finish it was all action. Not once was I bored.To all the people who voted 1's and 2's for this movie, please do us all a favour...GIVE YOUR HEAD A SHAKE! After I submit this review I am going to watch this movie again as it was just that good!!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A little compressed but highly enjoyable overall.,"This review starts with a confession: I never really loved TOS. As a now 28-year old I instead used to watch TNG, DS9 and Voyager in my mid-teen years. In the time I was really immersed in ST I could still feel the strong echoes of the impact of TOS, but the series seemed outdated to me when I watched it. All I occasionally saw was a vision of the future that had become prehistoric and a chubby Kirk being a silly pervert. I did watch all the Star Trek movies including the TOS ones and especially enjoyed the second and fourth ones. To sum it all up, I have grown some affinity with TOS but it pales in comparison with the newer series.Recently I watched the 2009 movie for the second time, but not after I reintroduced myself to the second and third Star Trek movies first, to get me immersed in the TOS universe again. I did not do this when I watched the 2009 movie for the first time and I was happy to notice that I liked the movie better than the first time I saw it. It's full of nods to TOS that fans will grin upon and has an engaging storyline, convincing cast and nice pace overall. My only complaint was about the villain which didn't really left a powerful impression on me.Star Trek Into Darkness succeeds like it's predecessor in similar fashion but has a much more intriguing villain. To truly appreciate him you have to watch the second Star Trek movie before you go watch this one. The plot kept me invested throughout the movie while being entertained with some nice head-butting dialogue between Kirk and Spock and an even higher pace than the 2009 movie. This high pace comes with a price though. Acknowledging that STID possesses a far different style than it's spiritual predecessor from 1982 and has all the hip traits of a modern action movie (continuous use of CG, exaggerated colours, high pace of scenes) this pace sometimes makes it feel as if the movie runs past itself sometimes. After two hours of enjoyment I still felt as if the movie was rushed somehow, as if the whole thing should have lasted longer. This feeling is in stark contrast to what I felt watching the second movie, which is far more subdued but still peaks tension-wise where it needs to. So, this sense of 'hyperactivity' is my biggest complaint regarding this movie. Smaller ones are things like a particular rushed emotional response of a certain character after what probably should be most shocking event of her life.That being said, I truly enjoyed this charming and entertaining movie. It makes me yearn for the return of a Star Trek series, but without a dull captain with a stupid beagle. Woof. STID has a cool villain, great action scenes and a Kirk-Spock emotional dynamic that feels like a worthy tribute to the older movies and hopefully a cause for continuing the TOS reboot!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Phil Collins' Star Trek!,"Now if you're not a real music fan, you probably will not follow this review, but history of Genesis (rock-band) splits into two distinct parts. Genesis was a progressive rock group in 70's - one of the best we can say. All the songs are perfect, all lyrics are crazy, the shows were theatrical and amazing. That was Peter Gabriel's Genesis.Then after Gabriel leaves, Phil Collins takes control and turns the band into a pop-group in 80's. Old skool Genesis fans still remember Invisible touch and especially I Cant Dance with pain. This is Phil Collins' Genesis. It is always criticized as being shallow, lifeless, dumb version of 70's progressive Genesis.Now these old skool critics tend to forget that there was no place for a progressive group who makes 22 minutes of complex songs in 80's music. 80's were about fun, new wave & light party music. And you know what, Phil Collins just made this passage for Genesis very cleverly and fine. Just listen to Tonight, Tonight, Tonight or Land of Confusion. These are great 80's songs. To be honest although one of my all time favorite groups is 70's Genesis, I also really love 80's Genesis.Aaand at last coming back to Star Trek Into Darkness, this is Phil Collins' Star Trek. Old timers (progressive trekkers) will possibly hate it - but if you're a hardcore sci-fi fan, you'll really enjoy this movie. Think of it as Star Trek of a parallel universe, where physical laws can be flexible according to our heroes needs.Still if you're not convinced, go see After Earth to realize how bad a sci-fi movie could be and run back to see this again!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A good watch!,"Though the script is a little more complicated than the first movie, J.J. Abrams did a decent job with it. The direction is pretty neat, and the screenplay is decent. Chris Pine does a very good as Kirk, while Zachary Quinto does a brilliant job as Spock. Benedict Cumberbatch is equally good as Khan. The rest of the cast did a good job. On technical front, the visuals are excellent. Most of the IMAX shots were graphic works, but good. The rendered 3D work was excellent, but shooting with 3D cameras would have made it even better. Nevertheless, I loved the effects. Music by Michael Giacchino is good, while cinematography by Daniel Mindel is perfect.

"Average 2000's action flick, hurt further by the shameless milking.","I've been trying to write a short review about this movie, but I just can't - below is simply the shortest version I could be satisfied with. There's just too much I want to say, because I honestly thought that ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" would be the breaking-out film that would re-ignite this new franchise after ""Star Trek 2009"" failed so miserably.I vaguely recall hearing that notion from a few people who had watched it, so I figured that despite ""Star Trek 2009""'s complete failure to impress me, I'd still give the series another shot. Unfortunately what I got was mostly just ""Star Trek 2013"" - like the first movie, a good action piece that is heavily marred by constantly trying to remind us that it is a new-and-improved Star Trek and that we should all be really impressed.To explain what I mean, I'll repeat for this movie the same assertion that I made about ""Star Trek 2009"": it's a decent sci-fi action flick which has no real connection to the Star Trek franchise whatsoever, except by constantly dropping references to Star Trek memes and reusing elements from that franchise. In other words: The filmmakers could've started a new universe, made up new characters to go with their new actors and new style, and neither movie (2009 nor Into Darkness) would've suffered. In fact I argue that they both would've been improved, since there would be more run-time to invest in actually making the protagonists sympathetic, the villains interesting (I'm looking at you, Nero), and the plots both interesting and sensical.Instead, J.J.Abrams and crew are putting gigantic amounts of effort into convincing us - today's viewers, whether Trekkie or otherwise - to believe that this films series is a part of the Star Trek franchise. They're essentially milking the remains of that (admittedly dead) franchise without embracing it - a form of cinema necromancy. Cinecromancy!Trying to start a new franchise is risky, of course, and why would you try it if you can just transplant an entire existing, devout fanbase into your new project? It's financially sound - you get a lot of people in theatres for almost no effort - but unfortunately does not make for quality entertainment. You sit there in the theatre for two hours wondering why they keep telling you it's Star Trek. And what's worse, as these movies show, you need gigantic amounts of effort to keep up that pretense!So yes, as an action movie and light-hearted sci-fi I believe ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a reasonably-good movie, and you can rest assured that J.J.Abrams knows his stuff when it comes to epic-looking action sequences (though, after 20 years of watching Hollywood action movies, particularly in the last decade, this stuff is starting to look pretty old to me). On the other hand, that heavy-handed attempt to cram as much ""Star Trek"" into this movie as possible alongside the action sequences means that everything else suffers: The plot is flimsy, simple, and expectable; The characters draw very little sympathy - and you're expected to sympathize heavily with them for most of the non-action scenes to work at all; Once again we get a villain who's reported to have some qualities which are never shown (Khan is a genius superhuman? He's certainly a combat machine, but his plan and behavior indicate nothing about any extra smarts); And once again Starfleet seems to be running on the mentality that crewing its flagship with emotionally-stunted, hormone-driven, immature young officers is the way to go - and only luck gets them out of it alive.(Amusingly that last point is actually commented on by the movie itself, but that only serves to make it more obvious as you sit there trying to ignore it.)The bottom line, again, is the same for this movie as it was for Star Trek 2009: If they hadn't tried to force this to be a Star Trek movie, they might've had the time and effort to make a decent film. Instead we got two decent action flicks that have little to do with Star Trek but waste energy trying to convince us that they do - giving both of them the air of shameless capitalization that I personally do not want to smell in the theatre for two hours straight.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awesome sequel,"I couldn't imagine that the sequel of the terrific reboot of the Star Trek saga could be better than the previous movie. It is! Star Trek Into Darkness is better than Star Trek (2009) in all aspects. Deeper script and a wonderful villain make this movie so enjoyable for everyone, however you aren't Star Trek fan.Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are like the ""Yinn and the Yann"", two opposite characters that are the center of the story.Benedict Cumberbatch is simply, the best Star Trek villain ever.

Fulfilling..,"""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is the highly anticipated sequel J.J. Abrams' 2009 reboot of the ""Star Trek"" franchise. After the events of ""Star Trek"" the crew of the USS ""Enterprise"" have returned to their regular routine. They are sent to a distant planet to observe an alien race. Their mission goes terribly wrong as a natural disaster threatens the lives of the planet's indigenous civilization. In efforts to protect the planet, the ship's first officer Spock tries to control the situation, but his life is soon in grave danger. Captain James T. Kirk is forced to disobey the ""Prime Directive"" to safe Spock's life and exposes the enterprise to the planet's civilization. Upon returning to the starfleet's headquarters, Kirk is stripped of his position as ship captain, but is appointed as the first officer to admiral Montgomery Pike, who takes Kirk's place as commanding officer of the ""Enterprise"". Parallel to this, an unknown terrorist is plotting an attack that not only threatens the safety of the starfleet, but the entire ""Galactic Federation""Despite director J.J. Abrams overly stylistic direction, I immensely enjoyed ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"". The awe-inspiring action sequences gave me chills and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance was excellent. His voice literally made his character so great. When I went out of the theater, I wasn't sure if I liked the film, but now after some consideration I have come to the conclusion that I loved it. Even though it is action packed, it still provides a great story and plenty of substance to keep the viewer engrossed all the way through the film (though it dragged on a bit close to the end). Often times big budget action films have mediocre acting, again this is not the case with this film. The entire cast provides good performances, but Benedict Cumberbatch stole the show.I don't have a whole lot to say about this film other than it had great special effects, great action, great pacing and great characters. The only downside was that towards the end the film dragged on a bit. Other than that, ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is another win on the behalf of director, J.J. Abrams.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Star Trek Into Darkness - Noodles Review,"Yup, I'm a Star Trek fan. Yes, I'm a Benedict Cumberbatch fan. How about we put those two together and see what happens? Well, this... the best movie of 2013 thus far. I loved the first movie (not the first Stark Trek: The Motion Picture) from 2009 that was sort of a reboot of the franchise but sort of not. The concept of it was that it opened a new timeline, sort of a parallel universe. This means that while everything in the original shows and movies did happen, all of the events in the new movies are also happening to the same characters in a different timeline (or parallel universe). This gives leeway for a lot of things as it gives the opportunity to the people making the film to create their own ideas for it, without altering any of the source material. Therefore, a lot of awesome stuff happens in the new movies.The first thing you gotta talk about in this movie is Benedict Cumberbatch. He is absolutely awesome in one of my favourite shows, Sherlock, and he owns in this movie. He's menacing, smart, efficient; everything we need. One of my only gripes about the first movie was the villain. He didn't suck or anything but he just wasn't totally awesome; and I understand that because that one was introducing the characters and the whole world. But they got it all right in this one because Cumberbatch = awesome. If he's in a scene, you even totally disregard anyone else in the scene because he literally steals every single scene just be being present. Overall, I think you get the point that he's intense. Kirk and Spock are awesome as well. There's a lot of really enjoyable moments concerning their relationship as shipmates. They banter back and forth, intentionally disregard each other, and yet still work together and respect one another. That's a real buddy movie right there. Then there's Scotty who's the comic relief of the movie and Simon Pegg really does him justice. However, not all of the characters are as greatly important. It's not that they're irrelevant, but they aren't as perfectly fleshed out as they could've been (or Cumberbatch is just stealing all their talent).Speaking of talent, the director, J.J. Abrams showcases his pretty well in this movie. While some people don't like his many lens flares, I feel they add more to the film's style. One thing that doesn't need style to be great in this film is the action and epic things that happen. The movie is filled with adrenaline and barely ever gives you a breather. Plus, it's filled with tons of money shots! If you don't know what that is, it's a really awesome scene in a movie (usually depicted in the trailers) that you know costs big money but it just makes your jaw drop. Example from this movie: the scene in the trailer where the U.S.S Enterprise crashes into the lake. Yup, it's there and it is awesome. While there's awesome and relentless action, the story's pretty dense too. It's compelling, heartfelt, and fun. It even has layers, which we don't really see in action movies often today; while there's the action between the good guy and the bad guy, there's drama, politics, and other events going on that really add to the movie.If you know someone who says that they don't wanna see this movie just because Star Trek is dumb or nerdy, they are clearly either stupid or a jerk. This movie and it's predecessor actually make Star Trek a cool and entertaining thing for everyone to watch and undoubtedly enjoy. There's great and exciting action, a strong and compelling story, fun moments, and Benedict Cumberbatch is absolutely awesome. Star Trek Into Darkness is one of best movies of 2013,",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Here we go again,"I wrote about the JJ Abram's Star Trek in 2009. This sequel is not an improvement over the first. Kirk is just as clueless, reckless and guided by what's happening at that moment. Spock is even more human in this then he was in the first. Bones, Scotty and Checkov seem to be there to provide comic relief and no more. Uhura seems to have no more professionalism than a high school teenager. What happened to my Star Trek crew that I once knew and loved? They are certainly not present in this movie. So, I've given up hope of something better.As the old saying goes. If you can't beat them. Join them.What do I mean by that? Well, if you can forgive the poor characterizations, this movie is fun, albeit in a bubble gum kind of way. It is fast-paced, full of energy, colors and life. It is the kind of fun that families could enjoy watching together. And maybe that was the point of this movie. If it was the point, then the movie was a success! I am giving this a 6, because if I'm being honest, it was a disappointment compared to the first movie. And, even though I got caught up in the fun, it really had no other redeeming qualities. So it deserves a 6.Live long and prosper.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another great Star Trek,"Bring a long time Star Trek fan, I'm very pleased to see this kind of reboot for the franchise. This movie, Star Trek into Darkness, ranks as one of the best. The main thing I love about this movie is the story. The story line about Star Fleet and their need for Khan display a dichotomy of Star Fleet that parallels the early movies in the franchise that links it back to the Undiscovered Country and the original movie with Khan. It also explores what hatred does to a man showing that Marcus has ill regard for his daughter and is only concerned for is own personal goals.Watching Kirk and Spock's characters to continue to develop is also another great part of this movie. Assuming their roles and putting slight twist that still resonate the earlier movies.With a story like this, it makes a movie easy to watch over and over so you can always find things that helps relate other parts of the movies together.The one thing I didn't like was USS Vengeance was a bit over the top, little bit too big and powerful. I get the point, but a bit over board.Over all, I could go on forever here, but great movie. Can't wait for the next one. Someone please slap some since in JJ and get him back over here to complete this series!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertainment for the non need for cognition audience,"As a reviewer who has not watched any of the star trek videos growing up as a child, I guess I had low expectations for this movie. I did not watch the series, because I knew it had corny fight scenes such as the actors awkwardly dodging lasers in narrow hallways as they hold their lasers by their hips.Corny, if I could summarize the movie in one word, I would say that was the word. Whether it would be restoring the entire power of an entire spaceship with a single button or fixing the jigamajigger flux capacitor by banging it a few times, I can say I had more convincing action sequences as a kid playing legos.I would say, what made the movie worthwhile were the complexity of characters, drama and international relations. Spock for example was always at a conflict with himself and the emotions he had little of. By the end of the movie we see characters develop, personality change and an intriguing complex fountain of the star trek science fantasy world that I have come to appreciate.I did get into the scifi aspect of the movie, I really did, but how could I enjoy a movie when the action sequences chose to obey the laws of cartoons rather than reality. For that, I give it a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The new franchise's most entertaining film to date,"Was it entertaining? Yes. Will it please die-hard Trekkies who miss the original crew? Yes. Will it please TrekKERS(fans of ""The Next Generation"") and their laughable longing for ""cerebral"" story lines fit for sleep-inducing television but not for a big screen blockbuster? No. If 7 wooden crew members spending 25% of a film sitting around a table trying desperately to sound intelligent is your cup of tea...don't bother seeing this film. If you simply want to be entertained by a cast and crew you can actual cheer for and laugh at...this is your film. If you want a wooden crew with no clue as to what a sense of humor is...this is NOT your film. This is Star Trek TOS and although the body of this story arc is serious, it's not without its funny bone. While Karl Urban still hams it up a tad bit as Dr. McCoy, the rest of the cast do their job well in their respective roles. As for the film's antagonist, I have to admit there is a lack of ""gravitas""...but only for longtime Trekkies who can't get the original actor out of our heads. This is the trap of bringing back a character from the original series. I suppose a newbie Trekkie could care less but overall the plot and most importantly, the PACING is vastly improved over the '09 film.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Star Trek's stunning superior sequel,"I enjoyed the Star Trek reboot that was released in 2009, so much so that i thought that would have been hard to top. This superlative sequel proved me wrong. Kudos to the writers for a character-driven action screenplay that is laced with smart humor. Director J.J. Abrams nicely balances the action, suspense and drama without losing any steam in the middle but with regular edge-of-the-seat moments. The cast is a fine ensemble, but Chris Pine's standout performance as Captain Kirk confirms him as one of the finest actors of his generation. Also adding to the movie's attributes are the special visual effects, well-choreographed fight sequences and the sublime music score. A truly spectacular effort that exceeds expectations.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good but not Great,"Flipping through the reviews I've notice either a lot of 10 out of 10 or the disappointed 2 out of 10 neither is warranted. This latest version of JJ Abrams Star Trek Universe has a lot to like for the casual and serious Star Trek fan and unfortunately a lot to dislike.I'll start with the good stuff, the cast in these two films has been phenomenal. Back in 07 or 08 I was very nervous about the casting and very happy about Abrams, now the opposite could be said. Anyway from Chris Pine to Anton Yelchin they have all managed to create their very own characters and yet still maintain the original cast's energy and essence. Truly whether you are a life long Trek fan or have just come aboard this cast I believe in the long run will be one of Abrams greatest contributions to the Trek Universe and I hope we get to see them in at least a few more films together.The look, feel and pace of this film is on par with Abrams first Trek that should come as no shock. The effects are out of this world truly a film to be seen on the big screen and if you have the means an IMAX screen is probable the only true way to enjoy all the masterful visuals that come out of this film. Abrams was also able to use low tech to produce a nice feel to the film long time fans will enjoy seeing models of the Space Shuttle, NX-01 Enterprise, and Cochrane's Phoenix. If you like a none stop action packed roller coaster films then you will enjoy this film Abrams managed to push the pace even more than his first Trek film. From the open till the end there are few moments to catch your breath and take in the story which might have been intentional.Now the bad, some might feel Abrams has created an epic film which is the case with the visuals but the story falls well short of anything epic. Unfortunately for this fan Abrams has missed a great opportunity to create something more than a stand alone film story wise on par with any basic run of the mill action film. For anybody who has watched Trek over the years their is one essential theme through out their stories or at least the good ones and that is the progression of the human condition or growth. Abrams in my view had set the stage for a grand story with his first film flipping the universe on it's head and destroying Vulcan were very grand a epic moves but in what Universe would Nimoy's Spock let that Stand! This is where Abrams has failed to understand the world of Trek these characters don't stand for mistakes and will sacrifice there lives to correct those mistakes. Nimoy's Spock had made the grandest of mistakes in the first Trek and Abrams missed the chance to the tell the story of redemption in this film. It's funny probable the best story of redemption in Star Trek came from the Wrath of Khan, Kirk underestimated Khan and it cost him dearly and he spent the next film The Search for Spock in redemption. What did Kirk say at the end of the film ""It would have cost me my soul if I hadn't tried"" Shatner's Kirk had real growth at the end of that film. So the use of Khan in this film was also a missed opportunity, Khan was catalysts for growth and change in the original characters but I have a hard time seeing what his purpose was in the this film other than being the typical villain they could have left his name as John Harrison it would have made little difference to me.In to Darkness although very entertaining has very little to do with character growth or development two staples of Trek stories. I'm glade Abrams is moving on to do Star Wars his filming and story telling style might be better suited for that franchise. I'm hopping for more of a Christopher Nolan story teller for the next Trek but I'm not holding my breath =)! Enjoy the film!!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Star Trek Movie,"While the previous Star Trek gave the franchise a desperately needed shot of adrenaline, Star Trek Into Darkness resurrects the franchise into full force. Kirk and Spock are on a planet where they must save the alien race from certain doom. Both violate the prime directive so many times, it is enough for Pike to yank both of them off the Enterprise, or at least out of the captain's chair. Then, things turn dark. A mysterious federation officer has staged a terrorist act against the Federation. Kirk's job now is to track down this man and kill him under the order of Admiral Marcus. Kirk, though, captures the fugitive and discovers his secret: he is Kahn, a ruthless 21st century genetically altered human. He wants Marcus killed for a sinister betrayal. Ironically, Kirk cannot trust either Marcus or Kahn. This movie has a few strikes against it. The idea of reusing Kahn for a nemesis was a good idea, but terribly marketed. Abrams denied it was Kahn for a long time. However, that is marketing. The cinematic problem was a movie a bit too long, and one that desperately wanted to play homage to the original Star Trek Kahn movie. I laughed at Spock's ""Kaaaaaaaahhhhhhhn."" It was forced and downright stupid. Finally, because of this plot piece, it drags the movie out a little too long. Another gripe is that, just like the previous installment, Dr. McCoy is not used well. My biggest issue was that JJ. Abrams makes the galaxy much smaller with the warp drive - which makes planets that should be days or possibly weeks away a mere three or four hour jaunt. Adding to that silliness was the new transporter technology makes it capable to beam hundreds or thousands of light-years across the galaxy. On the other hand, it has a lot going for it. The Kirk/Spock relationship is the core of the movie. The characters also have to learn and grow. Scotty becomes alienated because of the secrecy and sinister nature of the assignment. The space battles are epic, and we get something we have always wanted to see: a star ship falling through the atmosphere. This is a good movie providing some good, epic, battles and stories for a new generation of Star Trek fans to enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
KEPTAIN on the BRIDGE (R.I.P. Anton Yelchin aka Checkov) The 5 Year Mission Begins but we shall Miss Him,"JJ Abrams reboot 4 years ago was surprisingly brilliant (if not a 10/10 film then it's a 9)So is ""Into Darkness"" better? no, but boy does it come mighty close to matching that inventive reboot.JJ and co have balls, the subject matter of this film was very, very, very risky, like most i'd read the rumours was he wasn't he? does he doesn't he? Really, I can't believe they took on this story, they could have ended this series here & now but it's so Entertaining & well structured that even a Star Trek fan like me can only applaud the audacity of playing out this story.It's Fun with a capital F...brilliantly paced with some truly gorgeous shots of the USS Enterprise. There's some interesting twists & surprises and it features a super villain :-) in the form of Benedict Cumberbatch.A wonderfully political film with sensational action set-pieces (the likes of which ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" can only dream of)The picture starts of with a brilliant James Bond type pre-title sequence with a nice fun nod to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and I love the resolution to this early encounter & what the aliens inhabitants scrawl in the sand...Kirk was always disobeying the prime directive (do not interfere with other civilisations...yeah right!)Then comes the set-up for the film with a dying girl...after this it's wonderful scenes of fun, action & political discussion / tactics.A well known race shows up (looking a little different but I liked 'em) after Kirk & co try try set up a meeting with them but which ends up in a fun space chase (JJ's gonna love playing with the Millienium Falcon, although I still think the Enterprise is the better looking ship)We have a terrorist attack on Starfleet, a space suit flight that is thrilling & an interesting Space Battle / Stand-Off resulting in some truly epic shots of the Enterprise in trouble and we have Spock sprinting through the streets phaser drawn...this sounds simple and it is but it's thrilling.I love we got to hear Alexander Courage's TV theme at the end of the film setting up the 5 year mission to boldly go where no one has gone before.There will always be JJ haters (the lens flares are nearly always mentioned but it's pretty much his signature now, although i'm hoping we get just the 1 or 2 in the new Star Wars film & we know what they should be right? a light-saber suddenly appearing perhaps being wielded by someone surprising? and a bright sun suddenly glaring due to the Millienium Falcon flying out from it with Han on his way to save the day)Star Trek: Into Darkness is a very well made film that Entertains all the way.This cast is just Brilliant...An adventure like this every 2 or 3 years is OK with me.Chris Pine is Kirk (I never thought Shatner could be surpassed) Zachary Quinto is spock Karl Urban is Dr McCoy (great quips here but it would be nice to set the 3 of them interact more like in the TV series) Simon Pegg is scotty (and he's brilliant & fun here) Zoe Saldana is Uhura (and sorry but that tight fitting costume she's wearing early on in the film is just sensational) John Cho is Sulu (superb moments piloting the shuttle early on & then taking the Captain's chair) Anton Yelchin is Checkov and IS the guy who says ""Keptain on the Bridge""Alice Eve well you'll see, she's gorgeous & sensational & will be a fine addition to the crews future adventures.A mention should also go to Peter Weller who's brilliant.It was mentioned years ago that Star Trek might go the young Starfleet Academy route but I wasn't convinced, instead we've got a younger Kirk, McCoy & Spock and co heading into their 5 Year mission on the Big Screen and that thrills me. Yes it's not the Trek we all really remember on the TV screens & you may not like JJ's choices but cinematically it works perfectly.JJ will do well to get a cast this good for the next Star Wars.Paramount should sign them ALL up for at least another 3 more films as they are PERFECT together.BTW Just heard that the new Star Wars will be filmed in 35mm & that they are going old school with model sfx...done right, this is gonna be a nostalgic triumph!Another Super ""Star Trek"" film with an up up & away rating of 9/10.JJ Abrahams two Star Trek movies might not be as the original TV Series but boy do they make for GREAT & ENTERTAINING Movies.UPDATE: I've updated this review and changed the summary above to honour a young guy (a wonderful cast member of these JJ Trek films) ANTON YELCHIN who so sadly died yesterday. He was a GREAT, FUN 'Checkov' & I loved how he raced to save Kirk by using the transporter.He was brilliantly cast...they ALL have been brilliantly cast, they are the NEW CREW of the STARSHIP ENTERPRISE and I for one will dearly miss seeing him on the BIG screen engaging on more Missions (I really hope STAR TREK : BEYOND is a good 'un)",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Friends and Family Plan,"Greetings again from the darkness. There is always a bit of uncertainty when discussing or reviewing anything Star Trek related. So many rabid fans are more knowledgeable and keyed in to all the details. I am not. While I enjoyed the Gene Rodenberry TV series, and the subsequent movie versions, obsession never hit me. Because of this, my views will vary from those Trekkies and sci-fi experts.Director JJ Abrams re-invented the franchise in 2009 with stunning results. That ""new"" Enterprise crew returns here: Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Karl Urban as Bones, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, John Cho as Sulu, Anton Yelchin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty. The new addition is Alice Eve as Carol, daughter of Admiral Marcus (played by RoboCop Peter Weller). Abrams is wise enough to know that this story needed a great villain so he revisits Khan and casts a spectacular Benedict Cumberbatch (the sleazy dude from Atonement).This movie works because of the crew's chemistry. We believe they like and respect each other ... even while breaking orders. The film works even better thanks to a villain that establishes a believable threat. Cumberbatch plays a super-human force with a mixture of Shakespeare and Hannibal Lecter. He delivers lines in a way that you have no cause to doubt his intent. This is a nice contrast to the warm fuzzies coming from the crew members.It can't go without mention that there is a shocking display of crystal blue eyes on display. Chris Pine, Peter Weller, Benedict Cumberbatch and Alice Eve all flash baby blues that jump off the screen in 3D. The only reason the sea blue peepers weren't more distracting is because of what I refer to as FXOD ... a special effects overdose. It seems as though each summer blockbuster feels the obligation to go bigger on the visual effects to get noticed. As often happens, the effects are just too much. Luckily, the characters and story are strong enough that it stayed on track.If you are a casual Star Trek fan, this is one that will entertain you. If you are a Trekkie, you have no doubt already seen it twice and have blogged about all the errors. Next up: 2016 for the third entry in the Abrams franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent follow up to Star Trek Reboot,"JJ Abrams returns in this sequel to the Star Trek reboot movies. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana and the new cast return. Kirk uses his discretion around a Prime Directive and his command is threatened. Suddenly a new bad guy surfaces and starts reeking havoc on Star Fleet. who is this guy - seems like a super human.Well only Kirk can go after this bad guy named Harrison, rogue ex-Star Fleet staff. Venturing into Klingon territory, we learn the truth about Harrison. We also learn the truth about some factions in Star Fleet. Kirk again needs to decide if he can do the right thing in face of tremendous pressure, as does Spock. A fine battle takes place between good and bad, with a surprise ending that long time trekkies will appreciate. Even tribbles play a key role.The movie is fast paced again. The acting and portrayal against the original characters once again is spot on, particularly Dr McCoy and Scotty. You gotta love these guys - you can see the cast is having a blast with this. You will too. I can't wait for the next installment in these new Star Treks. Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun but unintelligent,"I enjoyed the first film. It was good acting, good action, put together in a clever plot that rebooted the franchise in a respectful, satisfying way. It spent entirely too much time between Earth and Vulcan, but I didn't really miss the philosophy or sense of adventure and discovery, even though these deficiencies are why I don't think one can consider it a ""Star Trek."" This one has some of the same virtues as the first, but falls incredibly short on plot.The action is better than the first, and the chemistry between characters is still there, though the movie suffers from too much focus on Kirk and Spock and not enough McCoy (Karl Urban's DeForest Kelly impression is always the best, mainly because I think it is partly parody) Cumberbatch steals every scene he is in, never acting subtly but never overwrought in his villainy either.But even though I mostly enjoyed it for these reasons, I can't let this film and its weak plotting off the hook. MILD SPOILER ALERT. It continues the ""alternate timelime"" trend, borrowing some of the history of the original. The problem is it doesn't do it very gracefully rather it borrows narrative elements and then alters them in a way that might seem clever at first, but are less so when you think about it. It's like a poet who thinks he or she has a good poem after only making the words rhyme--the symmetry is there, but ultimately it's only fan service that will ironically never please the the folks its trying to.The problem is that the film tries to be original in a way it can't be original. Rather than focusing on a new, smart plot (""going where no ST film has gone before"") it brings together old characters and themes for not other reason than to say ""hey, look its a new version of an old character."" The futility lies in trying to please too many people, and the story suffers. On top of that there is some unnecessary political commentary, apparently trying to please yet another group of people.Oh yeah, and LENS FLARES.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is a very fun sci-fi movie that shouldn't be missed,"Before I start this review, I might as well tell you the story that happened during my movie experience. I was watching the movie with one of my friends, when all of a sudden, I had to use the bathroom. I went out of the room and used the bathroom. When I walked out, I went into the theater room. What I noticed was that my friend was gone and there was a couple sitting in the seats we were sitting in. I also noticed that it was the end of the movie. I was so disappointed! So I walked out of the room and I saw, at the other end of the hall, the sign showcasing ""Star Trek Into Darkness"". I walked into the wrong theater! So I walked back in, sat next to my friend, and watched the movie. So, I saw the ending of this movie twice. Not that it's really a bad thing. Now that we got that out of the way, Star Trek Into Darkness review. In this movie, Kirk made a mistake of showing his hi-tech fancy doohickeys to a primitive planet while trying to save Spock's life, getting him demoted to a pilot status. During this time, a man named Khan is doing bad things on the Vulcan planet Kronos. Kirk is sent there to stop him. Okay, now onto the review. The story is great. It's intense and kind of dark. You can really connect with the characters. I really like how all the main characters are likable, with great acting to match. At a few points, during the movie, I was having a conversation with myself about this; ""Was this the best casting choice for Kirk?"" Yes. He may seem awkward at times, but he is awesome. This movie is intense! There's lots of gun battles, chase scenes, ship battles, fist fights, and even one character crunching another character's skull in (I can still hear that sound). They are really cool and always keep you on edge. This is a sci-fi movie, so you know it's going to have special effects. These are good. They've got color, they've got detail. Excellent. The only real complaint I have with this movie is the occasional dorky film direction and line. There aren't very many, but they are noticeable, especially early on. Speaking of which, the first few minutes of the movie weren't all that special. Yes, it's intense, and yes, it forms the central plot, but I feel it could've been done better. It seems like it started off too fast. Overall, this movie is excellent. The cheesy moments and too fast beginning are definitely overshadowed by the great acting, thrilling story, likable characters, intense action, and sweet CGI. I think this is better than the first, and the original was amazing. The movie was so good, it was shocking.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
the best star trek film,"Wow what a film, having seen all the films this one is the best by far.It takes things beyond the reboot movie and expands on the characters.One point to mention is Simon Pegg is good in this film but having just seen worlds end I was amazed how young he looks in this movie, the magic of the movies I guess.By far the best part of the film is were the enterprise crashes through the clouds only to reappear later, a brilliantly shot piece.I await more films with hope as things can only get better.Lets hope JJ does not leave it too long for the next oneOne final thought is how gutted must William Shatner be having missed out in being in these like Spoke is.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good Not Great,"Star Trek is a good movie but not a great one. I am not a big fan of Star Trek to be honest and even thought the TV shows were boring, except Enterprise which I thought was pretty good. Most Star Trek fans hate Enterprise though so that should tell you if you're a fan of the original and next generation series you and I probably won't agree anyway. I thought the 2009 Star Trek film was pretty good and this was at least as good. Great action and adventure. After Capt. Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise find an unstoppable one man weapon of universal destruction from within their own star fleet, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture him before it's too late.

I am Completely SHOCKED! ( 7.8/10 Stars ),"Okay, I have seen this movie and that was somewhere in 2014 but not in the summertime, I rewatched this movie in the summertime. I actually bought this movie, and I am super glad I did. It is freaking awesome. I just loved it. But let me just say there is something really fishy going on here...How can this movie get a 7.9/10 stars on the IMDb If all I am reading here is mostly NEGATIVE reviews?It just does not make sense at all! This movie is HIGHLY Rated on all the other websites...like saaay ROTTEN TOMATOES! It is certified FRESH and 90% of the audience liked it and 87% of the critics liked it. It also did super well on Metacritic,....a solid 72/100 and the user score? a 7.8/10. So what the HECK is going on here ? this is the only website where I am reading mostly NEGATIVE reviews..everything else is positive ! Why is that ?In the first few pages of reviews..there is mostly negative reviews...same thing goes along somewhere in page 13 to 17 and same at page 24 to 27 but at page 34 or 35 or 36, the reviews got a little bit more positive. I just decided to stop there.Anyway, I give this movie a 77/100 and a 7.8/10 stars. The cast as usual is great. I just love the cast, and I love the new add on too. There is a NEW character and she is a cute blonde women! She made the movie more live as well, she was a great add on to all this. She is Alice Eve as Carol Marcus.Special Effect? GREAT! loved the guns...looks like the guns from star wars. My favorite scene is when the black ship crashed landed into London, and knocked down a lot of buildings. Boy, that scene is just amazing. And I always cannot help but think of all the people that died right there. Overall I have this movie and seen it several times...great Joy Hollywood, you made another lovely memorable sci fi film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"An adrenaline pumping,heart thumping cinematic experience","You know summer is here when Hollywood blockbusters start raining at the Box Office. This Year the like every year we have a huge arsenal of to- be blockbusters lined up to treat the viewers all over the world. The season started with Iron Man 3 being the frontrunner and now passing on the baton to Star Trek: Into Darkness followed by Man of Steel.This week's movie Star Trek: Into Darkness directed by JJ Abrams (writer of lost, fringe, Armageddon, director of MI: 3,star trek etc.) is a sequel of the reboot of a cult classic adventures of the crew aboard the explorer space ship USS Enterprise. The story is set in a future where humans have explored new life sustaining planets where some species predate human existence and some are relatively new. The USS Enterprise wanders in galaxies to search for life forms and maintains a peace treaty with most of them as the sole motive of the explorations is to maintain peace throughout the universe. The movie begins with an adrenaline pumping ,heart thumping ,jaw dropping action sequence set in the blood red forest of planet 'nibru' where Captain Jim Kirk and his medical officer are being chased down by spear throwing natives, simultaneously Spock is trying to prevent the extinction of the species of the planet by exploding a cold fusion bomb in the erupting volcano thus trying to alter the destiny of the planet for which he gets panned later. Jim Kirk escapes the natives by jumping into the ocean but spock is not so lucky and gets stuck in the erupting volcano with the cold fusion device ready to explode. He is ready to sacrifice his life to save the life of the species by detonating the device but is saved by Jim kirk at the brink of spectacular cold fusion explosion, stopping the volcano from erupting and the species of annihilation; something they were not supposed to do as altering the course of destiny leads to devastating ramifications. Jim gets demoted, spock gets reassigned and THE CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE BEGINS. In the days following the events described above a new terrorist emerges (Khan Noonein Singh) played by the ever charismatic 'Benedict Cumberpatch' who threatens the world by raging a war against its leaders beginning with direct attack on the USS Head Quarters and murdering its leaders in cold blood. Then begins the Man-Hunt for the absconder who has taken refuge in the un-inhabited territories controlled by the Klingons who are the arch enemies of humans. Going to those territories would lead to an all out war between Klingons and humans which would take earth INTO DARKNESS but not bringing the terrorist to justice would raise questions on power the USS itself.Secrets are revealed, relationships are broken and tough choices are made to walk the thin line between good and evil. Thus making it into a racy cinematic experience which maintains its pace throughout the 133 minutes keeping you hooked to your seats all the time. It's a movie nobody should miss irrespective of whether you have seen any of the star trek movies before. Watch it you won't get bored even for a minute.Pros: Spectacular action sequences, good story and well written characters, enthralling background score, Benedict Cumberpatch Cons :Not a very original story",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Cast off Into Darkness,"Space the final frontier. It seems that no matter how many movies we make about the black void, we still continue to push the limits as to what lurks out there. While numerous movies have failed in their challenge, there are some movies that shine brighter than the stars that decorate the screens. One of these treasures is the Star Trek series, both show and movies, which deliver the science fiction adventure to other words and sticking to the physics pretty well. Although I was a little shocked at Abrams reset of the series, I still enjoyed the modernization of the series and the update in graphic/action. Now four years later, Abrams has come back with another sequel in an attempt to keep the interest alive. How was this movie? Please read on to hear my opinions.Just like the last movie, Abrams pulls out the stops to get the tale going with a rush out the gate. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and his crew are out on a mission trying to save everyone from everything. Amidst the beautiful world and rather impressive CGI landscapes, the action gets the audience's attention quickly, perhaps even bringing you to the edge of your seat. Of course this is only the beginning, and throughout the movie the action just continues to vamp up bringing in more lasers, highly choreographed moves, and ship on ship action. All of this is brilliantly captured with cinematography that keeps up with the fast pace, only going into shake down mode when necessary (i.e. the ship gets hit). Now don't get too upset and worried that Abrams has turned this franchise into a kung fu movie with flashing lights, no instead the action is integrated with the story and drives the plot to help avoid any slow parts. Is it the best balance? No, but for this reviewer I like a faster pace so long as character development isn't sacrificed. Unfortunately the developing team did get a little carried away at points where a few chase scenes or an epic crash felt a little dragged out, or maybe it was just the fatigue I felt at two in the morning.Now let's turn our attention to the plot of Into Darkness. In a nutshell it's good, it's fun, and it has a lot of character development to keep people interested in the story. The relationship between Kirk and Spock (Zachary Quinto) in particular was rather well done, blending in a variety of comedy, anger, and a variety of other emotions that made it feel like I was watching two brothers fight. Yet just like last time, these two are only a segment of the character pillar and not the whole thing. Abrams and his staff did a great job integrating the entire crew into this film, getting all of them involved in some major way. Sulu (John Cho), Scotty (Simon Pegg), Bones (Karl Urban), and many more provide lots of laughs, plot elements, and a variety of other qualities that keep the movie just as fun as the first, yet with more drive behind it. In this film, the audience gets to see new sides to these classic characters as they are pushed by the darkness that surrounds them. Most of this darkness is due to the new villain played by Benedict Cumberbatch. The casting crew did their homework or got lucky when they got Cumberbatch onset. This man had the look, the tone, and moves that a good villain needs. I don't know if it was his acting or the character design that impressed me more, but this dude kept the story exciting and diverse as he threw new challenges into the fray. Of course tactics wasn't the only thing this dude had going for him, awesome moves, skills with weapons, and other qualities that I wish not to mention at the moment. Yet despite the sheer awesomeness of Cumberbatch's character, they still made him a little too strong, giving him the qualities of an unbeatable God that was a little too stretched for me.Abrams success with the characters and action are just the tip of the iceberg of success with this movie. The man managed to integrate a lot of movie aspects in a balanced manner that again kept the audience into the movie. There was plenty of comedy in the film, whether it is a well delivered line or a Star Trek reference that fans will absolutely love. When the audience wasn't laughing they were captivated by the ""twists"" and ""turns"" of this predictable story line. Parts of the movie even had people crying, or at least silent, as they awaited the fate of their favorite character. As I already said, the action was very well spread, constantly building upon itself to an exciting end game battle. All of this was a formula for success for me, and I wish that other movies could take the hint and incorporate this style into their movies, *cough Transformer, cough Newest Iron Man, cough a lot of other movies cough. However, I don't know everything about the art of making movies so I'm sure I'm missing some pieces to the puzzle.Star Trek into Darkness is a great science fiction action movie to get the summer started off. Great acting, beautiful CGI work, and balance left me clapping at the end of the movie. Sure the story was predictable for me, and yes some of the intensity was lost on me with their obvious foreshadowing, but still it was a tale worth getting into. As for the 3D, I can't give you much on that since I saw it in the cheaper 2D version. However the scenes I pictured popping out at me could be cool and not too cheesy. My score for this film is:Action/Adventure/Sci-fi: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Very Entertaining And Gripping Movie,"I went to watch the movie with some expectations; I was expecting it to be good but not really great. However what I watched was a great piece of cinema. This movie scores on various fronts, be it direction, cinematography, CGI/VFX, background score, Plot. Let's start with plot first, the first half of the movie runs two parallel plots, one for the antagonist and one for the protagonist, both are done fairly well, the first half is more of a build up and hence some might find it a little slow. The twists have been placed brilliantly, especially in the second half the climax, the anti climax and then another one to top it. For a Sci Fi franchisee movie this was definitely a winner. The Direction was top notch, Spock's dialogues, Benedict was phenomenal as the antagonist, Alice Eve made her mark in the limited presence that she had in the movie, Pines was good too. Some of action scenes are excellent in direction and implementation, the gate crash scene, Spock chasing the villain, A space ship crashing in the city, and many more. What were unexpected were some really good emotional scenes in the movie, especially those involving Spock. The movie paid homage to the original star trek series at various point and used great back ground scores, though over all the scores were pretty average. This movie is tightly packed, with first half being slightly boring but the second half is a straight 10/10. Enjoy the movie, have a great weekend ",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Lots of fun, but a tad too familiar","Star Trek : Into Darkness""You are a pawn, Kirk. You can't even guarantee the safety of your own crew.""There's no denying 2013 is a good year to be a sci-fi fan. Offerings like Oblivion, After Earth, Pacific Rim, and Riddick all promise to keep fans of the genre quite happy. However, it's J.J. Abrams' sequel to his masterful 2009 Star Trek reboot that is arguably the most anticipated release of the year, and rightfully so.The 2009 film was an accomplishment; successfully modernizing the series while remaining decidedly true to what Star Trek is expected to be. Now, four years later, does the sequel, ""Into Darkness"" live up to its' predecessor?That all depends on what sort of film you want to see.If you're all in for an action-filled, gut-wrenching adventure featuring the cast and characters you love from the reboot, then this is the movie for you.The sound design is some of the best I've experienced in recent memory. From photon blasts to screeching metal to warp drives, it's unbelievably immersive. Jarring, subtle, soothing, adrenaline inducing, loud, it's what sound in a film like this should be. Everything – even simple punches – have a weight and realness to them that is often overlooked in films.This beauty extends to the musical score as well. Haunting melodies and rising crescendos are superbly placed to manipulate the mood to exactly what the viewer needs to feel at the time, whether that be wonder, dread, or excitement.The returning cast members – from Pine to Urban to Quinto to Pegg to the superb Bruce Greenwood - are every bit what they were in Star Trek 2009, and have arguably improved in their roles.Quinto's Spock has noticeably grown, as has Urban's Bones McCoy. Pine's Kirk is a less explicit progression, but has successfully shaken some of the annoying frat-boy persona he exhibited in Trek 2009, which in itself is an accomplishment I can applaud.The new cast members serve their roles for the most part – minus Alice Eve, who seems perfectly content to act as a hollow shell placed in the film to be nothing but eye candy.Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan, on the other hand, is a force to be reckoned with; Vastly superior to 1982's Khan – played by Ricardo Montalban, this new Khan is a sight to behold.Equally menacing and relatable, there were many instances in the film that I truly felt for him and thought he was justified in his villainous actions. Cumberbatch's brooding, emotional portrayal is one the better characters in the series history, and I can only hope he'll somehow be used again in the future. As engaging as he was, the final turn-about of his character arc was sadly predictable.That is where we come to the bulk of what is wrong with ""Into Darkness""For all its victories, the film was almost too familiar for a returning fan like myself.It leans on its source material – 1982's aforementioned ""The Wrath of Khan"" – like an ugly crutch, all too often borrowing plot points and twists in unneeded ways.2009's reboot also did this, but in a far less greedy way, and ultimately managed to be original and surprising. ""Into Darkness"" does not succeed in this regard.While the story is serviceable; if you're an old fan, chances are you've seen a lot of it before. This means many of the scenes meant to evoke shock or suspense may ring hollow, because you already know the outcome.On occasion, Abrams has an inspired stroke, and instead of lifting a plot point, turns it on its head and gives us a legitimate twist that we can appreciate, but too often he eschews this in favor of trying to play to our nostalgia.I was much more impressed with Oblivion's story line and unique ideas than I was with the script of ""Into Darkness"", which is rather sad. Star Trek has always been more of a thinking- man's sci-fi, but this new film falls squarely in the action/thriller department. If you're looking for a good thought-provoking romp through the future, I recommend Oblivion.Overall, ""Into Darkness"" is lacking in comparison to its older brother - and it seems to its competition this year as well. I will give credit to its final act, which was superbly engaging and had a pair of wonderfully executed twists – though they may be lost on newcomers to the series.The film is lots of fun, and if your introduction to the universe was the 2009 Trek, then you will likely be perfectly satisfied with this merely adequate sequel, but if you're a veteran of the world, you may be a tad disappointed.In closing, I cannot help but feel let down. Into Darkness was engaging while it lasted and had plenty of great moments. The humor was frequent enough that it prevented things from ever becoming too dark, while also keeping it's distance during the most dire of situations; and as previously stated the final act of the film was a superb ride.Yet, there are so many little things that while competent, were not astounding. So much potential literally brimming around the surface of the display, but never being fully realized. Does it deserve a place in your collection? Yes, though perhaps not on your ""classics"" shelf. ""Into Darkness"" will find itself much more comfortable alongside contemporaries like Prometheus or Terminator : Salvation.E. C. Cook 20137.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I thought it was a good sequel,"I had no expectations for this film and I think that's why I liked it. Unfortunately a jerk movie critic spoiled some of the plot twists, without warning. Even so, it was a good film.The CGI was spot on, and this film had a lot more action than the first Abrams rendition. A lot of people complained that it was loud, dumb and unoriginal. That's not the case at all. I personally have never seen any star trek prior to these reboots. Any content in the film is new to me. I'm aware of all the characters, like Kirk, and Spock, as it'd be hard not to know of them. But it was established in the first film that this was an alternate universe. They were changing the flow of events for every character. Even if Abrams pulled ideas from previous episodes or movies, it's not the same.It's also a double edged sword. If Abrams ignored any of the previous movies, or episodes, fan-boys would be upset that he veered too far off from the originals. Now they complain that they're too close to the originals. Ugh.It was a good sequel, which is a rarity nowadays. The only reason I'm giving it a 7 is because it was good, but it didn't blow me away. Would I buy it? Yes. Would I see it again? Yes. Did it change movie history? No.I'm now looking forward to see what Abrams can do with Star Wars.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great film that stays true to the Star Trek faithful.,"So, I treated myself to a night out, on my own, at the IMAX for a bit of Trek. Granted in 1966 when Shatner first eyebrowed his way to the forefront my father was 14 and I was 20 years from conception. I am no uber Trekkie but I did grow up watching reruns and know the series well. I was prompted to write a review by mutterings I heard from a young whipper snapper (i'm an aging 26) as I left the screen on Wednesday night. He said ""The overacting was ridiculous."" I would echo this sentiment in the most positive way possible. In every way the overacting was ridiculously true to the original cast.The film itself was great. From the special effects filled beginning (reminiscent of Insurrection) the plot jumps straight in. The side plot, difficult relationship bit, as in the 2009 reboot, is between Kirk and Spock. This is very well done, appropriately cheesy at times. Quinto does a great job of showing an emotionally immature Spock and gives a great performance all round. Pine seems to have settled in to his role much more this time around. Maybe not quite getting the inappropriate pauses in all the wrong places but that will come. With time.The plot continues to unfold at great pace giving us our villain Khan. Cumberbatch is menacing, scary and cold with his reptilian stare, truly making the role his. I think even the most faithful will agree that his performance is brilliant. At no point does he seem 'just like Sherlock' which is an achievement in itself. He portrays emotion with apparent ease and bring a new interesting Khan angle to the Trek canon.The action continues relentlessly throughout the film. Although at no point does this feel inappropriate it is great when the action slows. It is worth a note that the film clearly benefits from not having to re- introduce all the characters and relationships. The IMAX screen did the SFX great justice with the 3D truly complementing the fast paced action. I do still find 3D motion blur a tad distracting and feel this sort of Abrams SFX bomb will really benefit when technology catches up with this issue.The film finishes with a long and epic climax. The 'dragged along' girlfriend on my right (not mine I might add) clearly amused by my involuntary fist pumps but am I bothered? no. well a little.The show stealing performances were without a doubt, Quinto's Spock and Cumberbatch's Khan. However that should not take away from the rest of the cast who were not overshadowed by these performances. Urban was great as Bones. Very true to the original in standing up to Kirk at times and talking in riddles.I have heard criticism of Pegg's Scotty from a number of people. I am going to respectfully disagree. He puts his own spin on the character slightly more than the rest of the cast but not to any detriment. I am yet to understand the problem with employing a Scot to play a Scot but it is a theme.One smaller role worth a mention is John Cho as Sulu. I love this guy. Mainly because whenever I see him I remember watching him shout milf at a portrait over ten years ago. He plays a young Sulu wonderfully. At times his character balking but then rising to responsibility handed to him.The fact I have gone over some of my favorite performances here should not take away from the great show given by the rest of the cast. Bruce Greenwood continues as the father figure that our new, alternate reality Kirk never had. Zoe Saldana plays on as the Uhura that Spock always dreaded about and Anton Yelchin is a hilarious as the nervous but very competent Chekov.Where the first film was introducing characters and explaining alternate realities, this film is pure action and plot. Very enjoyable and a great addition to the Star Trek canon. Rodenberry would be proud.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just WOW!!!,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***Into darkness explores a contemporary array of topics, philosophies and concerns including heroism, terrorism, fascism and interracial relationships. All this is set against a backdrop of warp factor 9, leaping off star ships into space, running away from erupting volcano's and deactivating lethal bombs within milliseconds to detonation.The main playoff of characters revolves around Spock's rule abiding inflexible Vulcan logic versus Khan (Benedict Cumberbach) as a dark and brilliantly manipulative galactic terrorist. Loyal followers of Cumberbach as Sherlock Holmes may find themselves longing for an element of morality in this ruthless fanatic but ultimately there is none. Cumberbach, Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine as the impulsive hot-headed Kirk who leaps before he thinks and ultimately makes life saving decisions from his gut, compete with equal excellence to steal the show. There is intensity, passion and great interpretation of what I thought to be a faultless script. But if I had to pick a winner, I would say in this instance, it would be Zachary Quinto who's portrayal of Spock is almost flawless – (I say almost because Leonard Nimoy IS Spock and always will be).My only slight question would be around the saving the ship scene where Captain Kirk gives his life for the 'needs of the many', which in the original 'Wrath of Khan' was a role reserved strictly for Spock – creating the famous sequel 'The Search for Spock'. The scene suggests a following of the original set of 6 films – or was it perhaps just a little dipping into the original? We shall see with what follows in 2016.To conclude, 'Into Darkness' is a thrilling joy ride of nonstop edge of your seat action sequences that are perfectly filmed and executed under JJ Abram's skillful and enthusiastic directorship which is getting to be seriously impressive. Whilst containing jaw dropping action and effects, it loses none of the humour of the original films and still plays off the characters with as much wit as ever. Karl Urban and Simon Pegg are true to form as the moaning Dr McCoy and the ever practical Scotty. But this movie surpasses every other Star Trek movie with a brand new slicker, faster, louder and very well acted take on the classic Sci-fi movies that I grew up with.Although it remains true to form, make no mistake, this has a much wider box office appeal which will shunt Star Trek into a new era and probably spawn a new not so geeky following. So in conclusion, Trekie or not, if you like action, great effects and pure entertainment you're going to love this film.Seriously recommended! I wanted to watch it again the minute the credits rolled. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Bit Long but Non-Stop Action and Fun,"Star Trek Into Darkness (2013)*** (out of 4)Sequel to the 2009 film has Captain Kirk, Spock and the rest of the gang having to travel into a dangerous territory to try and capture one of their own who has turned bad. I guess I should admit up front that I'm not a fan of the series. I've never seen the television show, have only watched three of the original films and I was rather lukewarm on the 2009 film. With that said, I thought STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS was a great looking film even if its story and conclusion were rather predictable. I guess I can understand why so many people out there are upset that this is mainly an action picture but for those wanting just the thing they're certainly going to be rewarded. From the opening scene to the very last, director J.J. Abrams does a very good job at making all of these scenes feel fresh, fast and very much in control. The opening sequence in the volcano was especially good looking as was another sequence where Spock plays the action hero. All of the action scenes look extremely good as the CGi looks very realistic and it never takes you out of what's going on. I'd also say that the performances are good from the entire cast with both Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto fitting their roles nicely and making them their own. The biggest problem I had with the film is that the running time was about twenty-minutes too long. Another problem is that the story itself is so full of clichés and predictable moments that it really starts to get boring and makes the running time seem even longer.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What happens when a superb dish is served with a delay,"Following the amazing start the second chapter took its time to appear before our eyes. Four years is quite a gap that needs to be justified by something very good or was it just a masterful plan to make us forget how great was the first movie?Such a long break might imply the change of the cast, however, we are lucky to have every familiar face back with some pleasant additions on top of that. I say 'pleasant' because somehow I cannot figure out my feelings towards Benedict Cumberbatch. No doubt he is a fascinating actor, although there is a subtle repetitiveness in his behavior each and every time he takes a role.Anyhow, the plot is not letting us down. The scale grows, more and more undiscovered locations, species and dangers come up on the radar. Bulldozing through extremes the team leave you no choice but gasp at new trick they have stored up their sleeves.It is fascinating how close you begin to follow every member of U.S.S. enterprise. The levels of empathy are just hitting the ceiling. A slightest worry on the screen doubles at your side. Same happens to the team that became as close as friends can get.I can say that the sequel did good comparing to the first part, but four years of waiting might have built a bit of expectations. Together with a bunch of stupid moments it slightly damages the impression still leaving cool memories.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Creating characters fit to tell the tale of our times.,"Although before there was a war the journey had already begun, the first true conflict began in the wake of 1977; and two camps were created.They had very different totems: pretending to swing a stick in the air and humming metallically, and equally incompressible to the uninitiated - attempting a hand gesture with raised palm with middle and ring finger parted in a half representation of the Hebrew letter ""Shin"".One had visions of totalitarian empires, the other a united federation.For many years I had a foot in both camps, leaning slightly towards the clashing of red and blue lights and the mixture of asthma attack and artificial lung.For now at least, the battle has been won. Most importantly to me, a decisive victory for story narrative and the journey of the hero/heroine has been achieved. Here at last are characters that suffer and face adversary for values beyond jingoism, truism and unquestioning patriotism.""Star Trek, Into Darkness"" is nothing short of a work of wondrous fiction, thick with meaning and an unabashed examination of our current times.Please, do yourself a favour and see this spectacular film. If you are a pathetic wimp like me, you might consider not seeing it in 3D. I found the violence a bit too confrontational, as it appeared to be happening right in front of my eyes. But that's just me. No doubt most of you out there are far braver and are able to separate reality form fantasy a bit more convincingly than I can. :P Considering George Lucas dwelt in the company of Joseph Campbell of Hero with a Thousand Faces fame, the last three movies he penned himself revealed very little about either the human condition, or the journey of the hero. Ironically, J. J. Abrams, in wanting to drag Star Trek into the Star Trek mould has effectively created something far more meaningful.Considering the weight of recent political events that the movie casts us into, I feel very comfortable to join the crew again, as they journey out and go boldly where we have seldom seen recent movies go before.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Star Trek: But Not As You Know It,"Coming in at over 2 hours, Star Trek: Into Darkness is a hell of a ride. Rattling along at a quickfire pace, you find yourself being bombarded by one spectacular action set piece to the next. The tempo never drops from the breathtaking opening on a distant planet(inside a volcano), to the jaw dropping conclusion. Twists abound, with many self referential nods to the Star Trek canon. Some might complain that on any occasion they are far too conspicuous (I'm looking at you Spock) but on the whole, they are only fan service; and that is what the purpose of this film is. This is made for fans of the franchise, it has been made in the assumption that you will have seen the previous entry in the series. Like most films (although few rarely make the effort that is on display here) the aim of this film is to be an enjoyable movie going experience for the audience. An aim that Star Trek: Into Darkness succeeds in fulfilling. A 4 year mission in the making to build upon and improve on the previous entry has finally completed.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wecome to a new Star Trek Universe!!!,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a sequel to the first installment directed by Director JJ Abrams.I was impressed with the first film of 2009,it really gave the Star Trek franchise a new look and reintroduced the cast of the original Star Trek series. Many people are trashing Into Darkness because many of them believed that the film was a copy of the great Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan. The 2009 film was made so stories could be remade or reintroduced into a new generation.It was interesting to see a reintroduction of Khan Noonien Singh, the dictator of late 20th Century portrayed by another actor and in a new set of situations. WARNING SPOILERS!The space battles the action scenes and the relationship between Kirk and Spock were great,and it was a surprise to see the Death of Spock scene filmed backwards with Kirk being killed by the radiation instead. The FX and the score by Michael Giachinno were great the film managed to have me at the edge of my seat. People please enjoy the film for what it is,don't be too hard with the cast and the producers.....Into Darkness was a great ride for me,Abrams made a great effort,and I am looking forward to Star Trek 3....The movie plays in a alternate reality,please don't expect it to be like the Classic Trek.It is a new Star Trek Universe that is expanding.May you all live long and prosper!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun but too much Flash,"just saw it. Lotsa fun. It's all action. Kinda like John Woo meets Gene Roddenberry.Plenty of imaginative little tie-ins to the original series.I have to say though. After now seeing these 1st two new star treks. I don't like what JJ Abrams has done with it. He has the flash and fights etc etc. But there was much more contemplative type sci-fi and real science that appealed and appeals so much to people that are considered nerds by the overall world. It was like we finally had a cool world all our own.I feel absolutely none of that in these new films. These are 100% bing/bang/boom with no feeling at all that this was our special nerd nirvana. He does do the tie ins to the old series but that's all it really is: a factual tie in.So, Fun but, for me, way way way too much Flash.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Live Long and Prosper J.J.,"J. J. Abrams must go to a lot of Star Trek conventions; either that or he has a library full of the original series and films. He really hit it out of the park (or out of this world) with this installation of the franchise. I see a lot more of this series in his future and the possibilities are endless. I like this film because it has a lot of action and the story is told very well; but more than that I also like the fact that this film was also about the relationships between the crew. Also, after the first film I was asking myself where the heck are the Klingons? Well, lo and behold they finally make an appearance in this film. There has always been that tension between the Federation and the Klingons so I am glad that they got that storyline started. Chris Pines (James Kirk) is evolving more and more into the William Shatner Kirk of the 60s. He is even starting to look like him a little (although Shatner was not as emotional as this upgraded version). Zachary Quinto (Spock) is as logical as ever, but in this film he even manages to rationalize how he processes his emotion (which I found quite interesting and profound). Zoe Saldana (Uhura) gets to display a more sensitive side and reacts to situations the way that most of us (women) would with our significant other. Once again (as in the 1st film) my favorite portrayal was done by Simon Pegg (Scotty). He was most definitely the comic relief that kept this film balanced. As for Benedict Cumberbatch (Khan), you really didn't know if he was a good guy or bad guy until Spock Prime shows up and gives the crew the down low. Of course being a Trekkie, I knew he was bad, but new comers will not know. The addition of Alice Eve (Carol) to the crew will no doubt create some interesting story lines going forward. I saw this film in 3D and there were a few things that jumped out at you, but all in all I think you should save the extra dollars. I think that you will be just as impressed without the 3D effects. This film was pretty long, but I did not notice because it was so well paced. This film is definitely one that you have to see on the big screen. Live long and prosper!!! I give this film a glaring green light.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun and entertaining but not exceptional,"This is a well executed movie with an engaging plot, great effects and performances good enough to keep your (happy) eyes and attention glued to the screen for 2+hrs. There are more or less no dull moments but as a side effect the initial part of the movie didn't feel seamless.There are lots of joyrides in terms of the run-chase and action sequences but nonetheless the plot and characters still bag a modest amount of depth. There is nothing truly unique in the plot line, you might guess what is going to happen next if you've seen lots of sci-fi cum action movies, in that sense it is more a great mix of stereotypical sub-plots. Some dialogues are witty and sharp, some not so much. There is generally not much melodrama, or perhaps just the right amount of it except the repetitive doses of classical altruistic heroism.Not much in terms of new cool gizmos or weapons but the usual fare. On the whole don't expect something that will blow your imagination away but rather a rich entertainment for a couple of hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"JJ Abrams Returns With An Epic Character Driven Dive ""Into Darkness""","The Short: Featuring a strong and incredibly dynamic cast that is both well acted and written, a grandeur of delicious special effects and an incredible sense of pacing to match the first, JJ Abrams returns with ""Into Darkness"" only to (nearly) out-do himself. 9.25/10Ah, the summer movie season. The time when we are blown away by grand demonstrations of digital artists, loud and booming explosions, and silly excuses for characters and story thrown into the mix. It's a summer movie cliché; one that is fun, yet unfulfilling. You could be easily skeptical of the sequel to one of 2009's best films, Star Trek, but have no fear...JJ Abrams is back in action.Into Darkness has come early in the summer movie season, but I'm sure it is going to be a favorite pick for most movie goers and also Trek fans. For me, it's definitely going to be one of the 2013 summer blockbusters to judge all others, simply because it does nearly everything right.Returning with a phenomenal cast, Into Darkness goes for a more character driven piece this time, which succeeds in almost every way. The whole cast, from Kirk to Spock (Pine and Quinto), Scotty to Chekov (Pegg and Yelchin), I could go on and on...the whole cast rocks. Dashes of great humor and stupendous writing are the strong points here, with each and every character having their shining ""moment."" Cumberbatch, our villain this time around, is also fantastic, featuring an intense and believable performance that doesn't feel cliché or silly. Above all else one of my favorites, Scotty, gets plenty of screen time and steals the show in nearly every scene. It's only some of the newer faces on the Enterprise are simply ""there"", but it's cool to see so many different characters get a chance in the limelight. The character driven story could've fallen apart, but gladly the characters are written even better this time around and are heroes you'll want to root for.The story of Into Darkness is nothing ""new"", but it's far from boring and dull. Featuring some interesting twists and incredible action set pieces, the story told is one that could've easily been rudimentary but is instead smart and exciting. While the plot of the original is a little ""thrown in there"", the plot here is more essential to the experience, it's just a little less original. There are a couple of plot holes, mainly when getting closer to the ending, but it doesn't distract...it simply (and sadly) mars an incredible experience.The visual effects wizards that Abrams commands are also back, with some incredibly delicious results. Ships look gorgeous, phasers and guns look vibrant and cool, and the action sequences are FANTASTIC. Abrams trademark style shines here too, with some sequences that are pretty simple but are shot in such fantastically cool ways that it's impossible not to be glued to your seat. There are also some simply gorgeous shots, from great use of rack focusing and quick zooms to create a sense of realism in even the most CGI enhanced scenes.The soundtrack (composed by the wonderful Michael Giacchino) is perfect. The theme is incredible, Khan's theme is excellent, and the booming percussion will get your blood pumping. The sound effects are loud and in your face, but you also never lose the intimacy of an important dialogue moment. It's edited to perfection (in theaters).It's only a couple of plot holes and the lack of ""freshness"" that made the original so incredible that keeps Into Darkness just shy of greatness. It's the characters and thrilling story that keeps you glued to your chair, which arguably is more important and thus makes Into Darkness the superior entry in the series.As for now, Into Darkness is a truly spectacular 2nd act for the Enterprise and crew, one that takes their relationships to the breaking point and truly tests both the cast and Abrams once again to return and try top themselves once again. Into Darkness doesn't boldly go where no film has gone before, but it is surely one of the most solid sequels that Hollywood has dished out in recent memory.But I'll stand by this: What a fantastic way to begin the summer movie season.9.25/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fun and action packed sequel, though not quite trek 09","t's been a 4 year mission to wait for a sequel to J.J. Abrams' awesome Star Trek reboot but, finally Star Trek Into Darkness has arrived. And while it's not quite up to the 2009 blockbuster, it is still a really entertaining 2 hours at the movies. The film opens with Kirk (Chris Pine) disobeying Starfleet's Prime Directive to save a primitive alien race and his Vulcan first officer, Spock (Zachary Quinto). When the Enterprise reaches Earth, instead of being handed the much coveted 5 year mission, Kirk is handed a demotion and Pike resumes command of the good ole NCC 1701. But, this speed-bump in Kirk's career doesn't last as a mysterious rogue Starfleet agent by the name of John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) launches deadly terroristic attacks against Starfleet and it's personnel. His actions put Kirk once again in the captain's chair with orders to hunt this dangerous fugitive down, on the Klingon home world of Kronos to where he's fled, and eliminate him. But, Kirk is not comfortable being an assassin and he and his and crew find that once they enter Klingon space and retrieve their quarry, that ""John Harrison"" is not who they think he is and they may be pawns in a greater conspiracy involving a Starfleet Admiral (Peter Weller) with a monstrous warship and his own agenda. Star Trek Into Darkness is a fun and fast paced action adventure that's only real problem is that it moves a little too fast and we'd like a little more time to allow the emotions of the events witnessed to resonate. Kirk's demotion is a good example as he is back in command in about 10 minutes of screen time and we really don't get a chance to appreciate this blow to the character's career and ego. Once the plot starts to unfold, the film is all too eager to get to the explosions and fisticuffs then to give us a few minutes to properly absorb the dramatic effects of what occurs. But, I would be lying if I said that what action Abrams delivers is not exciting and fun because, it is. This is especially true during an exhilarating last act which made up for some of the lack of real emotional depth earlier on. The script from Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof has it weaknesses but, ultimately I did like their twist on a familiar Trek character and how the new time line effected his involvement in Trek history. The cast is once again top notch and it is the involvement between characters that really helps keep this movie on target during some of the weaker bits. The combination of Abrams' direction, the script's character interaction and the cast, really give this film it's strength despite all the awesome action and eye popping SPFX. All the crew return from Trek 09 and are all really good, once again, at making these classic characters their own yet, still familiar. Trek's bad guy is played with relish by Benedict Cumberbatch, giving a strong performance as the main villain, though I just wish his character had a bit more screen time to be developed a bit more, to really appreciate and give the character more weight. And it's great to see Peter Wellar back on the big screen as Admiral Marcus, the Starfleet officer whose visions of war with the Klingon Empire have caused him to act against the very things he seeks to defend. And pretty Alice Eve is fine as Carol Marcus, the admiral's daughter and future Kirk love interest. The character has little to do for the most part but, Eve does well when Miss Marcus does become important to the plot. So in conclusion, I had a fun time watching this Trek sequel and while I wish it had a little more emotional depth in the first two acts and a little more development of some of the new characters, their is plenty of warp speed action to entertain and the film really delivers in the final act where it counts.

Bold and Brilliant,"Very rarely do I give such a high ranking score to a film (the last being The Dark Knight in 2008)because there are usually certain aspects that are missing, don't work, or the film just wasn't good at all. I'm happy to report that this film was fantastic, like anything else there are people who would disagree with me and say i'm delusional, but everyone has their tastes.While i'm not a true Trekkie in the sense that I haven't watched the original series and films (i'm doing it now), I consider my self a Trekkie at heart, and fell in love with the 2009 Star Trek reboot. A known fact in films is a sequel usually doesn't live up to the original and while the 2009 film was great, Into Darkness was sublime.The pros: the fact that JJ Abrams took his time making this film (3 years) truly shows the attention to detail and passion he has when making his films.The acting was great, and the new additions into the cast helped make the film that much better, but most noticeably Benedict Cumberbatches character John Harrison, his character is in the same league as Heath Ledgers Joker. And while slightly cheesy at times, the script was great, despite what some say, I feel the essence of the original series seep into the script with it's witty one liners and cute linesThe costumes and sets had to be even more exquisite than in the original, and they very much were;they were exciting and realistic and made the film a great ride.The cons: The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that I have to wait another 3 years for the next film :)Go watch it, that is all I can say it literally has everything a moviegoer wants(except horror): romance, suspense, action, comedy, and drama, a perfect blend that gives you a fantastic, action packed film.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Fantastic performances all around. Great direction from JJ Abrams. And Great cinematography, the beginning scene is one of the most beautifully shot scenes I've seen all year.I was a fan of the film but it is not necessarily a film I will be left thinking about much after I have left the theater or a film that I will highly recommend.

Pass the Popcorn review,"Four years after the successful J.J. Abrams' Star Trek reboot came out, we finally have a sequel – Star Trek Into Darkness. To be honest, I was never big on the whole Star Trek franchise, but I was rather entertained by the 2009 reboot. Combine that with the superb trailers and promotional material for the sequel, and it's safe to say my expectations for this movie were pretty high. Overall, I wasn't disappointed. Of course, the sequel had some problems here and there but, ultimately, it's on par with the 2009 movie. The only noticeable difference between these two movie is that, in the latter, J.J. Abrams significantly decreased the use of lens flares. That doesn't mean that there are none, mind you.Set some time after the events of the first movie, this one opens with Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and his Enterprise crew, who save a planet inhabited with a somewhat primitive species from imminent destruction. This sort of interfering with life on other planets is against the Federation's regulations and Kirk must face consequences because of that. This opening isn't that vital to the whole story, but it serves as a device to further develop the already complicated relationship between Kirk and Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto). However, what is vital to the story is that a man named John Harrison – played by Benedict Cumberbatch – decides to destroy the Federation from the inside by performing acts of terrorism. Kirk takes on a dangerous mission to go and capture Khan so they can bring him to justice.The story isn't overly complicated nor very original, but the story in this modern take on the Star Trek franchise was never the most important movie aspect. The characters were always in the first place in these two movies, and their relationships, interactions and back stories were what made my viewing experiences so enjoyable. Like I said in the previous paragraph, Stark Trek Into Darkness takes a further step in developing its characters, analyzing their complicated relationships. And that really works – the characters are likable and developed enough for the audience to care about them when they face danger. The character Khan, who is a new character, stands out the most in the movie. Benedict Cumberbatch's cold portrayal of a mad man seeking revenge is top notch. It's important to say that Khan is a much better villain than the Romulan guy Nero in the first movie. Unfortunately, some of the plot points regarding characters didn't really lead anywhere and felt useless – especially the ones with Alice Eve's character Dr. Carol Marcus, whose famous underwear scene was nothing more than pathetic fan service. Also, towards the third act, there was something we may call – a sudden new villain introduction. That's another thing that didn't serve any real purpose, but, due to its short length, it didn't particularly affect my opinion of the movie.Besides the story, which is fairly simple but strong enough, and the characters, most of which are well written and excellently portrayed, there isn't much more in Star Trek Into Darkness. Of course, there are the visuals, which are – just like in every modern Sci-Fi movie – amazing. This time you'll even see some scenes on the Klingon homeworld of Kronos, that was visually interesting. There aren't any other popular alien races shown in the movie. There is the primitive alien race shown at the very beginning, and there are numerous 'cameos' of alien races on the Enterprise. I liked these cameos since they don't take much of the movie's screen time and still effectively illustrate the Federation and the Enterprise as a futuristic multiracial society. As far as modern Sci-Fi movies go, Star Trek Into Darkness will surely leave you thoroughly entertained. Considering what J.J. Abrams has done with this franchise so far, I think the future Star Wars movies and the possible Star Trek sequels are in good hands.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The film is full excitement and great performances from the get go.

"""Out-numbered, out-gunned"", a starship crew decide ""to boldly go"" and ""choose the danger""!","Generations of earthlings have been brought up following the exploits of the crew of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701). Star Trek (2009) was set in the early days of the Starfleet Kobayashi Maru training exercise. That J J Abrams film was set in an alternate reality and this new film is too, as it follows on from the earlier film. Thus this is different from the original TV series. Much is familiar but it is also slightly different. J J Abrams said that he wanted to make a film that appealed to old fans as well as those new to the story. Therefore this reviewer would advise older viewers to set aside the older reality and throw themselves into this new one. As the good Doctor would say ""It's life Jim, but not as we know it!"".For some older viewers, the new actors fitted in well to the 2009 film. The single exception being Chris Pine. Growing up with William Shatner as ""the overgrown schoolboy charging around the universe"", Pine did not seem to fit. The Shatner incarnation of Captain James T Kirk really seemed to be like an overgrown schoolboy. He had charm, wit and a twinkle in his eye. The Pine reincarnation was a sullen bruiser with no charm. This reviewer was of that position after seeing the 2009 film. However this new film suggests that view was too harsh. Here Pine is starting to become charming. What must be remembered is that these are the early days of Kirk. It takes time for the rebellious, surly and nervous cadet to mature into the Captain at ease with his command. The young man is already a bit of a ladies-man and can comfortably handle rough-house, the rest will come with time. That is only logical.So Pine is good, as are the rest of the crew of the Enterprise. British actor Simon Pegg plays a Scottish engineer, and Benedict Cumberbatch, another Brit., also has a big part. The crew-members all had little scenes that developed their characters. There are interesting relationships between them. All, but one, were very human. Even the one, showed a human side.The Bridge of the Enterprise is very modern-looking. The Engine-room is breathtakingly different from the previous incarnations of an older time. Uniforms tend to stick to the traditional colour-code, however there is a much different look to the uniforms, at first surprising, then interesting.The film title is obscure and thankfully the cinema trailer is misleading and doesn't give away the plot.The film is a fast action SF story. There are chases and shootouts between spaceships as well as humans. There is also some exciting hand-to-hand combat and humour. All the usual ingredients of a Star Trek movie are in this film. However although there are some interesting plot-twists, as a whole, the plot is poor. Thus the film will probably be found more interesting by new viewers of Star Trek, however older viewers may enjoy the tweaks.Having said that, for all those cinema-goers looking for an action movie, for SF fans, and for Star Trek fans, all are recommended ""to boldly go"". However do not go too boldly at the end of the film, as the last film shots and the music, at the end credits, are both well worth waiting for.Warp factor: 9.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A great start but still left wanting for more,"OK, so this review comes from a guy who has not watched an ST movie prior to the one in 2009. So, hopefully, my views would be taken as unbiased coming from a genuine movie lover and cinema goer.The movie starts off brilliantly with Chris Pine being at his best as a rebel with a good heart and bravery. He shows his deduction skills very well, ironically in a movie that has Benedict Cumberbatch (in my view the best Sherlock that has ever been played). Benedict continues his good work as an actor in this movie as well. 30 minutes into the movie and you know this is going to be one hell of a movie.But then it starts to drag a little bit. The ending seemed very predictable with a few questions that may linger on in your mind once it ends.ST has got the right mix of twists, humor, drama, emotions and of course the special effects.

Enterprise NCC-1701 continues its spacial adventure at warp speed.,"Star Trek 2 springs into action straightaway with two completely different personalities--yet most compatible--in the thick of it. Kirk-Spock once again create magic with their unmatched chemistry; and helm the Enterprise throughout the film. They are well by supported by Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, Pike, and newly added Admiral and Khan. The strongest aspects of film, that will impact the Trekkies most, are:Kirk's undying love for his family--The Crew of Enterprise, andSpock's unbreakable bond with his captain—severance of which is one of the few things that induces an explicit emotion in the inherently uptight Vulcan.*********Perhaps a minor spoiler but by the time film ends, it won't remain a spoiler for you*********************Kirk's desperation/sacrifice to save his crew; andSpock venting his anger at Kirk's demise showcases both these aspects beautifully. Scotty and Bones are also there to lighten up the atmosphere every now and then with decent comic touches.*********************************************************Only slight disappointment is under-utilizing, under-developing the character of superhuman 'Kahn Noonien Singh' (like it happened with Nero in previous installation)—Benedict Cumberbatch certainly showed he could match up to the 'Khan' of Ricardo Montalbán, if not better him.When J.J. Abrams revived Star Trek, it definitely seemed like beginning of next big Hollywood venture that will be deemed an epic in years to come, and Trekkies should be happy to see a steady sequel following up a super successful re-launch of 2009. Of course, the film isn't as magnificent as the first one, but it keeps the old fans engaged and opens the doors of Starfleet for a new crop of younger fans. Without a doubt, the new generation of Trekkies will enjoy the company of Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, Pike, along with Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock in upcoming films, all the while; BGM of Star Trek rushing their adrenaline.Film is technically sound too, especially the post-production 3D job is quite commendable.What more, the tone has been set for the next film. At the end, Khan is put into a cryogenic-sleep and Enterprise embarks on a never-before-like 5 year-long exploration mission.Keep your eyes and ears open for a cryptic signal from/to deep space!7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A Milestone In Cinematography – For Old-Time Fans, Children & Something For Everyone","Being a long-time Star Trek fan, I set a very high bar for this movie to reach, and they not only attained that height, they far exceeded it. This movie is a ground-breaker! I remember how much I and the audience were affected, when I was a teenager, watching the original Star Wars, then later in life by Jurassic Park. This movie affected me in the same way, with exceptional effects, set designs, stunts, CGI and did it all with surprisingly great writing and acting. When Kirk (Chris Pine) witnessed the death of a friend, his acting was better than I have seen in a dramatic production. J.J. Abrams did a job worthy of an Oscar for his direction on this production and for ensuring that everything worked together cohesively. They tied into the future (original Star Trek series) and the 2009 movie production, that introduced us to this great cast, magnificently. They took some minor gaps from the original, and closed them brilliantly, but I do not want to spoil anything discussing them. I have not read any other reviews; this was written without any preconceived notions from other fans/critics. I am merely stating the impact that this movie had on me and my son, and actually, all of the audience in attendance with me, who all stood and gave a loud, round of applause for jobs well done! Afterward, even though none of us knew each-other, it felt like we were a community, as we discussed how this movie happily surprised us and struck us as a historical milestone. Keep up the great work! We want more, more, more!One note: I hope it was just the time that we viewed it, but my eight year old son was the only one in the theater under 30, with most of us closer to 50. This seemed very odd to me, as my son thoroughly enjoyed it, and I am certain any boy into action, adventure or science-fiction—as most are—would find it delightful. There was a simultaneous movie playing in the theater that was labeled as being furious and fast, that the younger crowd was interested in seeing. We saw that movie also, and though it was very good, it paled in comparison to what this movie offered. This movie had it all! I am surprised they were able to produce it for under 200 million.

Star Trek: Into the Sewer,"Chase, explosion, chase, explosion, wink, nod, chase, explosion. The characters are two-dimensional cut-outs. The writing is daft. For hardcore Trek fans, the film tramples on series canon. Suddenly Kirk doesn't discover Khan in deep space on his ship, the Botany Bay. Suddenly Christopher Pike was never horrifically disfigured in a freak training accident, and he never returns to Talos. If you are doing a film in a hallowed series, you have a responsibility to research that series, honor what has come before, and extend its tradition of excellence. This film utterly fails to do any of that.J.J. Abrams is not a director, he's an event planner--for five year old birthday parties. I shudder to think what he will do to Star Wars and only hope Kathleen Kennedy wrangles him in a more sophisticated direction.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good start,This was a good movie but... It did not have the originality of the first. I was expecting a bit more of the overall action build ups the first had but this movie seems a bit disjointed at times. All sci-fi steals from previous shows and this did it a lot. I think to many ideas were taken from too many other sci-fi topics especially past sequences in Star Trek and not enough new ideas were introduced. Overall it was a good show .. I went with high expectations so that is why I felt a bit empty at the end of it. If I had low expectations like I do for most movies I would have liked it more. I saw the 3D version and wished I didn't. I rarely get the benefit from 3D anymore and find it a bit distracting in some movies it stops me enjoying the details in the storyline. I think Avatar 2 will be the only 3D for me in the future. The Enterprise does not fire a single shot in this movie which is my final criticism.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A great sci-fi action adventure that shouldn't be missed!!,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a blast to watch that's filled with spectacular visuals, fast-paced action sequences, plot twists and emotional moments. There's one particular scene between Spock and Kirk, actually brought me to tears. It's fun to watch the occasionally humorous character interactions that eventually further develops the relationships between the crew members in the film.(especially the 'logic VS impulsiveness' arguments between Spock & Kirk and Scotty as well) However, many Trekkie fans might be disappointed and possibly say it's another alternate retelling of Wrath of Khan. (the best film of the old Star Trek series) But for most casual moviegoers, it is one of the best films this year has to offer, possibly the best sci-fi action adventure of the year. Once again, it is proved that with a smart script, great actors, solid plot and good direction will certainly produce great films that exceed expectations.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great watch,"I was a little sceptical about the new Star Trek installments as I hadn't seen much of the TV series. However I was pleasantly surprised after watching the two latest installments. The story lines weren't difficult to follow but were gripping at the same time. There was humour and jokes in certain places that were well timed and kept pace with the action. The visual effects were spectacular. The role of Spock was portrayed brilliantly. Bennedict Cumberbach also added an element of mystery to the film. My only criticism is that it had to end! I would definitely recommend watching this film. Overall, great film, great action, a brilliant watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great movie, One of the best 3D experience.. better than Iron Man.","Watch it even if you are a Star Trek fan or not. The story and screenplay is completely engaging with cutting edge 3D and animation. There are some catchy one liners between Kirk, Spock and Nyota. Benedict Cumberbatch does a cool job as a super human villain.Script- Completely Engaging. no dull moment even for 2hr 10min long movie.Acting- Everyone does a good job.3D Effects: Edgy, I would say best one after Avatar.Background Score: NormalGo have fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining and fun but doesn't rise above its predecessor.,"Star Trek (J.J. Abrams, 2009) serves as a prime example of a reboot done right. With a younger cast full with both rising and established stars, Abrams et. al managed to bring Star Trek to a wider audience, encouraging both old and new fans along for the ride. It was fun and it was smart and it opened up a wide door of possibilities for this rejuvenated franchise. So now that the sequel has been released, did the momentum carry over? The answer is yes, for the most part.Star Trek Into Darkness opens up on some of our favorite Enterprise crew members running for their lives on a beautiful, exotic world. Already our attention is firmly grasped. One thing I appreciate about this series thus far is its humor is often established before or shortly after the action. It pleases to entertain and not just in the Michael Bay sense. These films have the pleasure of such rich characters and the talent of the actors who portray them that really allow the viewer to becomes lost in their world. And that's really something to admire.In this film, the Enterprise are chasing after one man named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who is labeled a terrorist who wishes to incite war. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) signs up to catch him after not only losing his status as Captain, but gaining it back quickly in a short period of time. He and his crew, such as Spock (Zachary Quinto), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Bones (Karl Urban) and Chekhov (Anton Yelchin) team up once again for this adventure that we know will not go uncomplicated. And although he opts out of the crew early on, we all know that a film won't have somebody as pleasing as Simon Pegg and not do anything with him.The action doesn't fail to please and the film hasn't lost the series' humor, which are good things I suppose. But one thing Star Trek Into Darkess does not do is it does not attempt to me any more ambitious than its predecessor, nor does it attempt to break any new ground. It recycles a major plot line we have seen before (the villain purposefully gets caught and tries to destroy the good guys from inside) and in the end, appears a little less epic than the first film. And while it may seem comfortable for the writers to go this route, it can also go unappreciated by the viewer.Cumberbatch steals the show and commands the screen as Harrison. He transcends any sort of cliché' because he's just so badass and that's hard to deny. As unoriginal as the film is (and unfortunately that's the case) Cumberbatch still makes for a compelling villain and he brings his cards to the table. Chris Pine steps up his leading man game and delivers even better work this time around, bringing charisma and charm and effective comedic timing to James Kirk.So while the film contains a lot of good elements, such as a talented cast and a large and creative fictional universe, it fails to attempt to rise above the viewer's expectations and delivers a merely serviceable, albeit entertaining ride. Perhaps next time around the writers should raise the stakes a little bit. And not only that, they should provide their female characters with more depth and action. Alice Eve is easy on the eyes, but why include a full view of her body in her underwear for the sake of pleasing the film's male audience? The crew behind this film are smarter than that, and hopefully they learn from this.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A scintillating blockbuster.,"Kicking off with a frenetic opening scene where Kirk (Chris Pine), now Captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise, breaks regulations to save the life of best pal Spock (Zachary Quinto - again a standout), Into Darkness sets a fast pace from the get go and seldom lets up. The two hour plus runtime flies by with action sequence after action sequence - each one somehow topping the last, all the way to the utterly mind-blowing crashing-spaceship climax - that boasts expert choreography and a sense of real danger paired with flawless CGI and sensational use of the third dimension.The characters and story aren't given short shrift mind you. The testy friendship between polar opposites Kirk and Spock is given ample time to grow; the narrative is intelligent, unpredictable and bold in its choices; and, in this film's biggest improvement on its predecessor, the villain is granted an intriguing backstory and is subsequently explored in great depth. That the mysterious terrorist and one man army John Harrison is so compelling boils down to the phenomenal performance from Benedict Cumberbatch; his vengeful antagonist is physically powerful, dramatically commanding and simply electric, all but stealing the show in the process.It's the merging of all these elements, along with Michael Giacchino's unsurprisingly regal score and the spot-on humour impeccably placed throughout, that ensures this a spellbinding journey from start to finish. The standard of sequel Iron Man 3 was aiming for but couldn't reach, J.J. Abrams' follow up to his 2009 smash hit is the most scintillating blockbuster of the year so far.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A good action movie, but not Star Trek","It's a good action movie, it has good drama, acting, special effects and is very watchable. But it's not true to Star Trek - take that as you will. Despite this I think that would be pretty much fine and forgiven for the most part *if* they weren't also rebooting the original and recasting characters. If it was just a telling of some kind of Starfleet crew where they could actually use the creativity, writing and budget to craft truly unique characters, relationships and situations I would be far more open to it. I felt that all of the actors were cast well as their respective characters, so I don't know why they couldn't have just used this to generate a new set of circumstances involving a Starfleet crew, which could have existed as an action movie while not offending the original vision of Star Trek as a true science fiction.I'm hoping for something very much different for the new TV show but I would be lying if I said this didn't have me worried. In my opinion, Star Trek *should* be considered ""boring"" to the average viewer who is not interested in sci-fi.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best Star Trek Ever,"Not being particularly a fan of alternate time lines, I must say this movie is a top shot! The cross-over from one time line to the other is flawless with even paying attention to particularly good books that were not part of the TV series or the movies. The actors are fantastic. Each adding ones own touch to a character base set some 50 years earlier, and last but not least I admire the camera takes which actually make in the 3D the distance to persons and obstacles such as if viewing it as some third party in the scene.This, and the last movie were incredibly fast in scene changes but adding to it some present time or future feeling, ST Classics lacked because of its limited budget and old acting techniques. The same applies to character traits and personal history which make them even easier - and more realistic - to grasp. Great special effects as well. A complete and sound all inclusive package. Thus, in my opinion, a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Magic Has Faded,"What was an exciting twist with the revived Star Trek a few years ago has turned formulaic. The director has played around too much with the key protagonists' characteristics. And it doesn't work out well.The story is plebeian and the writing weak. This shows throughout the movie. The sidelining of some excellent characters such as the Doctor has already been mentioned in other reviews. I agree as well. And melodrama seems to have become a substitute for a good story and acting.Overall, the movie was enjoyable while it lasted. But it hasn't left me filled with excitement and anticipation for the next one.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Arguably the best Star Trek movie yet,"There were concerns over having Abrams at the helm of this much awaited sequel to the last movie instalment. Then there was the script. We've seen the mixed bag of new generation sequels that followed the first series of original cast movies. They ranged from okay to bland and forgettable. The bar was finally raised with the last movie but with the vast fan base and hordes of Roddenberry faithful, yet another prequel presented a bigger challenge than arguably any other movie franchise, sci-fi or drama. I'd be lying if I said I didn't attend the screening with some concerns. Curiosity had, as always had got the better of me. At best, it would entertain without detracting and at worst, it would be at least a reasonable feast of CG on a big screen. As the tale unfolded however, my concerns evaporated. If you've never seen Trek movie before, you will enjoy this movie. Rich in plot, well-paced, good script and superb action. If you seen a few Trek movies, you will soon realise that this one surpasses those that came before. If you are a fan and have seen the previous movies and TV series, you will appreciate the way the plot intertwines with known story lines and characters, both past and present. The added twists are a bonus. In a nutshell, I thoroughly enjoyed this Star Trek movie. No spoilers, just go see it, then wait awhile and see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great fun with a great ""bad"" guy, something for all to enjoy","STID was much better than I expected. It is nonstop action with a ton of special effects, but what enchanted me was the humor and game-playing between and among the usual gang and the new ""baddie."" I loved that John Harrison is a master chess player, always several steps ahead of anyone else, and even after the end of the film, I'm left thinking that we haven't seen all his moves yet.Since some of the previews/trailers had dialogue that sounded cheesy, I thought the movie might be fun but corny or campy. On the whole, though, even lines like ""I will walk over your cold corpses"" make perfect sense when you hear the context of what the character is saying. Anyone can enjoy this film, even if they haven't seen all or most of the other Star Trek pieces on TV or film. Check it out and have fun!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awesome,"I am now entering my 50th year. I have been a fan since I was 7 years old and watching it from behind a chair because I was usually sent to bed before Star trek started. I have enjoyed the other parts of the franchise but it will always be Kirk and company who have my heart, so when they announced the remake I was mortified. My fear was laid to rest with the first film. I left with a renewed interest in my old friend which had been worn down over time with DS9 and Voyger, both of which just about destroyed my love of all things Trek. But here we are with Into Darkness and I have once again been blown away with not just the effects but the acting, writing and the amazing way the story I had come to expect had been turned on it's head. I welcome seeing Chris Pine taking Kirk to a place he belonged. Zachery Quinto has brought a wonderful innocence to Spock, Karl Urban has made McCoy attractive in so many ways. And thank you Simon Pegg for adding a little extra to Scotty. The rest of the crew are just as stunning. I have no doubt Gene would have been proud of this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

2,"I didn't hate the first movie in this reboot, when the Abrams franchise had fewer ambitions. The first film literally never left the solar system. This time around, we get to meet the new old CGI rendition of the Klingons, who seem like the enemies from a first-person shooter on PS3. Out of the melee emerges Khan, the abandoned genetically-engineered superman with a Shelley-esque vendetta against starfleet. Anyone involved in the writing, casting, direction, and final cut of this film was complicit in the cardinal sin of adaptations or remakes, taking something that people originally loved and changing it into something radically inferior. This Khan is not the charismatic Ricardo Montalban, transported from Fantasy Island with his worldly, narcissistic charm, but the phlegmatic Benedict Cumberbatch of Sherlock Holmes fame, rendering Khan as a humorless and notably boring villain bent on vengeance without the verve, sexuality, and nihilistic laughter at death that made Montalban's Khan such an interesting antagonist. The writing is comic-book franchise quality, which seems to be what the producers of the pre-branded 'reboot' are going for. Sans comic. I imagine that real Trekkies are as chagrined as true comic book purists when a studio favors the vague cultural familiarity and approval among the uninitiated masses. Here is my beer. Bubbly. Bitter. There is an impending catastrophe! I don't care! Benedict Cumberbatch could not have accomplished this. A Benedict Cumberbatch is only capable of quiet evil on the level of, say, a Juian Assange. This review has me planning to revisit the old franchise before I take aim at the next installment in the reboot. JJ Abrams won't make a dime, but the Trekkies can thank him for a piece of flashy advertising.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"OK film, bad science fiction","Star Trek Into Darkness, judging from the host of reviews at this site, is turning out to be a very controversial work. As a summer blockbuster, it was fun. The script was more intelligent than, say, Wrath of the Titans and the visuals were great. For those who grew up on the Star Trek franchise, the homages to the 8 or 9 previous movies and the first original series--were enjoyable and since we ""know"" McCoy, Scotty, Spock and company, we don't need a lot of characterization. (Actually, Zoe Saldana's portrayal of Uhura has more depth and interest than most of Nichelle Nichols' portrayal...not because Ms. Nichols is not a fine actor but because the original writers didn't give Uhura a lot of business in the 60s series). Without mentioning any spoilers, complaints that part of the last half hour is strongly influenced by the action and dialog of an earlier film are just silly; the 2013 film is supposed to depict an alternate time line where things are somewhat--but not exactly--like the original Star Trek universe. The more serious problem that keeps this from being a really good film is that Into Darkness is very bad science fiction. What made the original series successful, despite cheesy sets and occasionally preachy or inept story lines, is the same thing that created the Star Wars franchise and makes the depressing Blade Runner into a classic: their depiction of a detailed and plausible future and its attendant problems. This is where Into Darkness fails. The first half-hour depicts a future that makes sense, more or less; but then rationality is repeatedly sacrificed so that the film can move from one visually stunning cliff-hanging sequence to the next. For example, the visualization of the Enterprise's main engine workings as a cavernous vault similar to the boiler room of the Titanic helps a nice action sequence but seems like a really unlikely outcome of 23rd century technology. The result is that Into Darkness is closer in spirit to comic book blockbusters than to science fiction or, at best, is a dilithium-powered version of Rocky Jones, Space Ranger. If Mr. Abrams wants the relaunched Star Trek to provide employment during his 50s, perhaps he might consider an entirely new approach that focuses on a future that we can believe in rather than one that's basically the background to a cinematic thrill ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"mindless fun, but should have been much better","While I enjoyed the original Star Trek series, I never had the enthusiasm for it required to really hate this movie. I don't have a problem with anything in the movie based on how it differs from the series, but I do have problems with this movie as a big dumb action flick.First off, this is very much a blow-stuff-up movie. There is very little story and a bare minimum of character development. This is not a movie of ideas. The series took on various issues and explored mankind's place in the world, the movie hasn't a thought in its head.As a dumb action picture, Darkness succeeds pretty well. It's got some exciting action. It also has moments of humor, along with failed moments of pathos.But the movie can't be satisfied with being dumb, but instead insists on being aggressively stupid. For example, Kirk is repeatedly told he is too impetuous, trying crazy, dangerous things. All evidence is that this is true, yet the movie justifies every decision he makes, holding up impetuous recklessness as a higher calling. This is not untrue to the series - Kirk was always ludicrously perfect - but it's dumb.The really dumb stuff turns up at the end. There's a scene that's supposed to be touching (and is apparently a replay of a scene from an older ST movie I barely remember), but it fails, both because the nature of the movie excludes true tragedy and because the character work needed to make the scene work is never done. This is soon followed up by a plot hole so huge and obvious that one has to conclude the writers and director knew it was there and just decided to ignore it, because, HEY LOOK OVER THERE! WE'RE BLOWING STUFF UP!While not as bad as Abrams' Mission Impossible 3, a similarly dumb and explosive film, Darkness is still too CGI-obsessed to be really good. It's a disappointing follow-up to his first, better attempt at Star Trek, but considering its success, I expect Abrams will prove content to blow stuff up and let the money roll in.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
