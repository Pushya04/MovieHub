"Strange, touching and beautiful","Personally, I've never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical fairytale. What a surreal idea for a movie! It's hard to find an adequate description (because I also don't want to spoil this in the slightest way) but this film has a sense of ""otherness"" to it - for lack of a better word - like none I've ever seen. And the strange, mythical nature of this film - apart from the amazing artwork - is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me.Maybe the themes of the story don't feel quite as strange to an eastern audience because they fit to a certain degree with some eastern/Asian mythologies - to me, this beautiful piece of wonder was something new. And a profoundly moving experience.Outstanding animation; funny, weird, scary and touching at the same time, this unique work of art is one I can't recommend enough. 10 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"A stunning, intoxicating, magical masterpiece","There is simply no denying that Miyazaki is the Godfather of Japanese Animation, time and time again delivering works of such incredible beauty, such stunning visual and sensory delights, such mastery of storytelling, that one can only be left speechless. Overwhelmed. Intoxicated with wonder. Such is the magic of Spirited Away.Much like Miyazaki's previous feature Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is an epic fantasy that deserves no better medium than the stunning animation work of Studio Ghibli. This multiple award-winning masterpiece has grown to become the largest grossing film in Japanese history, and rightly so. From the moment our child heroine Chihiro enters the bath houses we are literally bombarded with an overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colours rarely - if ever - seen in Western animation. Scenes such as Chihiro running through the field of flowers, the marvellous landscapes seen from the train, Haku and Chihiro soaring the skies above, and Chihiro running across the pipe to climb the walls of the bath house are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtably some of the most lavish animation ever to hit the screen.The world of Spirited Away is bustling with life; unique, quirky, instantly lovable creatures jostling about their daily activities and tasks in the bath houses, dancing across the screen like leaves caught in a playful summer breeze. The inventiveness of Miyazaki's character designs is wonderful to behold, in fact not since classic tales like Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland and The Neverending Story have we been able to fall hopelessly in love with such original, quirky, magical, and fantastical characters. The viewer is plunged headfirst into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely and utterly captivated.The music and original score is stunningly beautiful, the original Japanese language track of such high quality that one wonders why someone could insult the work by producing a dub track at all. With a plot differing in its complexity on so many levels, from the basic storyline to the omnipresent universal themes, to the riddling of Japanese history and fable throughout, children and adults alike will be mesmerised from start to end. A magical, awe-inspiring, tearful, laughter-filled, heartfelt journey through a land of sweeping fantasy and dreams. Prepare to be Spirited Away......",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Dub or sub?,"Last year I saw Spirited Away on it's UK release. I've never been a particular fan of anime, and it didn't really occur to me that I was watching a foreign language film dubbed into English (or 'American'). I can't imagine seeing a live action foreign language film dubbed into another language, but hey, this is a kids cartoon, what does it matter? Up to a point it didn't, because I loved the film. I enjoyed it so much I set about digging up the Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki back catalogue, in the process Sprited Away was filed away as one of the lesser Ghibli's - still great, but compared to Laputa, Grave of the Fireflies and a few others, it seemed a little weak.BUT... I recently re-watched it on DVD with the subtitles and found the difference unbelievable. The film came alive like the other Miyazaki's I've seen. It seemed infinitely more layered, detailed, intelligent and witty than I remembered. Could it be that retaining the intended performances (even if the words are unintelligible) can make that much difference? Maybe the dub was just poorly done? Or was it just because I was now versed in the language of Ghibli? As a little experiment I decided to re-watch some of the film with both the English subtitles and English language dub in order to compare, I ended watching the whole thing out of morbid fascination. It's simply amazing what a difference there is. Entire scenes change. It's not just that subtle emphasis is shifted or the same points are made in a different manner - in the dub, the subject of whole conversations and scenes are changed, and often to some flat and uninteresting hokum. Relationships between characters are changed, their motivations and personalities are changed, the difference is shocking.I appreciate western, and particularly American audiences can be put off by subtitles. And cinemas are less likely to show the film anyway. It's pointless to be all righteous when, fundamentally, you just want people to see the film. Unless they do, this treasure trove will remain undiscovered, and maybe finding it will encourage people to conquer the 'subtitle demon' (as Miyazaki might call him). But the problem is the quality of these dubs, and the liberties taken with the source material. Of course, without speaking Japanese, who can say it's not the subtitles that are way off? They're probably written by westerners too. But the dub just stinks of Disneyfication. Saturday morning generic nonsense. The challenging, uncompromising and emotionally ambitious nature of the film is severely watered down.A fair question might be, 'if it's so bad why was it so successful?' The success is evidence of the films staggering quality. Even so, it hardly challenged whatever Jerry Bruckheimer movie was showing at the time. In Japan it's the biggest grossing film in history. 'Go figure,' as Chihiro wouldn't say.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
An Amazing Achievement in Animation.,"'Spirited Away' is the first Miyazaki I have seen, but from this stupendous film I can tell he is a master storyteller. A hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character. Miyazaki does this brilliantly in 'Spirited Away'. During the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on. Neither does the main character Chihiro. We discover the world as Chihiro does and it's truly amazing to watch. But Miyazaki doesn't seem to treat this world as something amazing. The world is filmed just like our workaday world would. The inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks. Places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music. The fact that this place is amazing doesn't seem to concern Miyazaki.What do however, are the characters. Miyazaki lingers upon the characters as if they were actors. He infixes his animated actors with such subtleties that I have never seen, even from animation giants Pixar. Twenty minutes into this film and I completely forgot these were animated characters; I started to care for them like they were living and breathing. Miyazaki treats the modest achievements of Chihiro with unashamed bombast. The uplifting scene where she cleanses the River God is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight. Of course, by giving the audience developed characters to care about, the action and conflicts will always be more exciting, terrifying and uplifting than normal, generic action scenes.Through Chihiro, Miyazaki is clearly (but non-patronisingly) talking to youth of Japan. There's a certain sense of revile about the youth of Japan at the moment. Many people consider them to be ill-mannered and baring no respect for their elders or their forefathers. They are simply bi-products of their material world and consumerism. 'Spirited Away' taps into this. At the start Chihiro is a selfish, spoiled, whiny brat. But as she plunges deeper into the spirit world, she becomes more independent, more assured, more respectful and learns some manners. No Face, a black figure with a white mask, is the catalyst behind Chihiro's transformation. Once he is let into the bathhouse, we are no longer tourists  the story propels forth. Watching No Face prey on the greed of the workers is a terrifying delight. The three main characters in Miyazaki's youth allegory are Chihiro, No Face and Bô. All of these characters are disconnected with their world. They are lonely, misunderstood and largely ignored. But when they go on their journey together, they united and become stronger individuals.Miyazaki also talks about the ecology of Japan. What was once a beautiful; grassland has now turned into the Asian New York. That The Last Samurai had to be filmed in New Zealand to get a turn of the century Japanese look speaks volumes. The River God sequence is an unsubtle but unpretentious commentary on pollution. While these two themes are very much current in Japan, they are also universal themes  which makes 'Spirited Away' a universal story that most of us can connect with. I'm willing to bet everyone reading this has at some time seen bicycles lying on a lake bed or have had a child talk to them disrespectfully. Sure these themes aren't advanced philosophy. They are everyday issues told in an inventive, fun way.The animation is wonderful, if not as smooth as Disney's works  but there's something superior to that. 'Spirited Away's imperfect, but detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of Disney's latest offerings. The animators successfully balanced the tight-rope between not-enough animation on characters and too much animation on characters. No Ralph Balski ADD antics here! The film is full of vivid images  both beautiful and horrifying. The line between those two extremes is crossed over seamlessly. From Chihiro and Haku running through an opening flower field to Haku's dragon snarling with a bloody mouth, both extremes seem to belong in the film. It's also excellently done with the characters. Kamaji can be seen as a scary, daunting figure at the beginning, but soon he seamlessly changes into a humble, wise figure. Yubaba also seems to be able to turn from kind to witch with the snap of a finger.The sound on the film was expertly done. The sounds perfectly match the on screen actions and objects. My sub woofer got a wonderful workout when Haku swoops Chihiro past the bridge at the beginning. And while I don't speak Japanese, I think the voice actors did a wonderful job of conveying their personality and emotions true their voice. Joe Hisaishi's music is sublime, definitely one of my favourite scores. His main piano theme is simple and evocative. His thunderous action music hits the viewers on the chest like a hammer. Like all great scores it heightens the greatness of a scene about three times. The score, unlike many American composers', is unobtrusive. It plays excellently with the scenes, but never overbears them. A lot of the time the it is barely noticeable, a sole piano plays softly in the background evoking a dreamlike/lullaby quality.'Spirited Away' is a simply a modern masterpiece, easily one of the Top 10 films of the new millennium. It works on a multitude of levels; a social commentary on Japan, a homage to ancient Japanese/Russian mythology, a moral film for both children and adults. But most importantly, it is a simple story brilliantly told by a great filmmaker who appears to be at the top of his game. 'Spirited Away' works much like a relaxing journey. Pop in the DVD; leave this world for two hours and when you will be almost certainly enriched and ready to take the trip again.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Best animated film I have seen!,"This is a wonderfully imaginative and fantastical children's fantasy. It is easy to see why it was perhaps the critical hit of 2002. The film is glorious to look at. It is a testament to old fashioned animation techniques that seem to be resigned to foreign animations. Of course there is some use of computer imagery for certain shots but they blend seamlessly and the overall artistry involved is superlative.This is the first Hayao Miyazaki film I have seen and I will certainly watch his others. The story plays on many elements successful with kids films, that transport you back to your own childhood and also allows the young audience to connect with the themes in the movie too. The story centres around Chihiro, a young girl about to move into a new place and who feels insecure about the new environment she will be living in. These fears become a part of her encounter with a strange abandoned amusement park that she and her parents find when they reach a dead end in their car. At the park they find that their is a stall that is seemingly open, with glorious displays of mouth watering food. There are no people about but Chihiros parents decide to gorge themselves on this bounty and pay later. As Chihioro explores she comes across a strange boy who warns her to get out before dark. It is too late however, because as night falls, ghosts are awakened, and then by the time she gets back to her parents they are turned into pigs. She then finds that the route she came from is gone and she is now trapped in this place, her only allie being the boy she met earlier. She is told to get a job at the centre piece of the park, a bath house run by Yubaba, an evil power mad witch. This is a bath house for the spirits and Chihiro has to find a job there before she is found and turned into an animal herself, then unable to save her parents.The story is imaginative and the characters and animations endlessly unique and strange. This is just so much more creative than Hollywood. The characters are likeable and we become engrossed with Chihiros adventures inside this bathhouse, and the characters she comes into contact with as she tries to get her parents back as humans and whilst trying to get back to the human world. What I also loved in this film is that the animation gives it a real sense of cinematography, the drawing makes the film stand out in a way that American animations rarely do. Another film I think of that looked really good was Bellville Rendezvous. Another great point in fact the best part of it, is the fantastic score. It really is uplifting and very original. This is just great film making. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
I disagree with Gazzer-2,"Actually I dislike his or her comments badly. If you didn't get it watch it again. This is not a piece to just entertain, the creator has put his own feeling and I believe life experience and the fear always buried in children's mind into it. It is a comely tale that express the creator's thoughts in some way, whilst shining as a attractive animation piece with so many details that you might have ignore if you were careless. It is a rich story and I can see the efforts creators put into it in many spots and frames.e.g. While Chihiro was walking towards the garden where Haku told her to meet him, she passed some stairs where she can see an island, there are some house on it, she stopped for it for a little while, that, represents her longing to human world, her own world, this kind of details can be ignored by many people but they don't mind putting it in to make the whole story richer, more truthful, full of power of humanity.Apart from that, did you ever notice that some ""camera language"" was used very well to tell the story in a more entertaining and better pace.e.g. When Kamaji was telling Chihiro how Haku turned up to this world before just like what she did, the ""camera"" panned to where the little rat(changed from the fat baby)was showing off to soots by putting his foot into the spell melted print while Kamaji's introduction about Haku's background is also getting across to the audience. This is just one of the details that shows how much story telling skills and rhythm control of plots.There're many other things like this, shouldn't be ignored if you want to make a nice comment, even though as an American viewer you might miss a lot of the story by lack of the culture background, but that's not the reason that you can comment it as anyway you want without even really READ the film.I am a visual effects person and film maker but I can't tell where the jerking of the footage and the stopping of character's movement are in the film. could Gazzer please enlighten us? As also a fan of Pixar I hope I don't have bias on either American animations or Japanese ones, but as a Chinese who might have some resistance towards Japanese products for national esteem or historic reason, I still admires Ghibli Studio's work. ""Spirited Away"" is a masterpiece of elegant picture and touching story, if Gazzer-2 knows what that means.""Ice Age"" was a pretty cute one of Fox productions, but not good enough to compete with ""Spirited Away"" I'm afraid. And I'd laugh at the opinion that the story of ""Ice Age"" is much simpler hence Oscar committee didn't recognise it, actually I believe ""Spirited Away"" was beautifully hand-painted frame by frame while ""Ice Age"" had a giant crew in 3d animation and visual effects. I'm afraid Ice Age was the much more complicated one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Advice,"I have some advice to anyone that hasn't seen this movie or did not like it but is attempting to watch it again: do not look at this movie the same way you look at western movies. This movie is meant to be a fable, and thus is chock full of metaphor. In fact, since it is set in the spirit world, EVERYthing is a metaphor. I don't want to impose my own views as to what those metaphors may mean, but it is important to accept, in a sense, that this movie doesn't have a plot. At least, not in the conventional sense. It would be better viewed as an exploration. Of what, I'll let you decide. Watch the movie, try to figure out what all the characters mean, why some are portrayed in a more favorable light and others not. It is also important to remember that, unlike western art in general, many of this movie's metaphors and messages have more than one meaning. I get the sense from reading the posts of other people, as well as some reviews, that many people have trouble realizing/accepting this. But, in my opinion, it is essential to move past this to truly enjoy and understand the movie and its message. The implication of this is also that it is impossible to fully understand the movie in just one viewing (or two, or many more). Like a painting, we are meant to look at this movie from different perspectives; close up and from far away and in different lights. All this is why I consider Spirited Away my favorite movie, and I hope that my advice will help some people see it in a different light. I don't claim to have all the necessary information to understand this movie, but rather I think I can help some people people who have trouble with this sort of movie and art enjoy it a bit more. So... have fun!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Exceptional, but perhaps not so much for the casual viewer","I have seen many international films over the years and quite a few of these were Japanese. In addition, unlike many parents, I have seen a lot of anime that my kids have watched so at least I have some familiarity with the medium. Yet, with my background I still felt pretty confused and baffled by the strangeness of this movie. Now this isn't to say I didn't like it, but so many times I just couldn't understand exactly what was happening. Interestingly, when I saw the film again, I understood it much better and appreciated it much more. And this may be exactly how you might want to approach the film unless you already are a die-hard anime fan. See it, but be willing to see it without trying to think out the odd plot too much or even try seeing it several times. I know that each time I did, the film became more and more enjoyable and I began to notice so many cultural references. Now, several years after I first saw it in the theater, I have seen a lot more Japanese anime and films and it's practically second-nature to follow the film. So, for adults and those unfamiliar with the medium, this movie might take a bit of effort to fully enjoy, though with more and more children being familiar with and loving anime, it's very likely your kids will love it and will then be able to explain it to you!! As for the film, the animation is the best I have seen in any Miyazaki film, the story deep and fascinating and it's full of cute and endearing little touches that make the movie magical. See this with an open mind, please.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Childhood Favorite,One of the best movies I've ever watched and is still stuck with me til this day.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Over-Appreciated,"Spirited Away contains a great cluster of creativity. The characters and ideas are mostly original and the core design which is the main character's (Chihiro) coming of age tale, completes with satisfaction. Yet the film feels familiar. It shares the same magic that Disney's older pieces contain and it is executed with a Japanese approach which does make it different but it has the same purpose. Which is to simply encourage younger audiences into being brave and so on.That cluster of creativity also becomes a bit mindless when random things keep happening, there is absolutely no consistency with anything. Details are introduced and have next to no meaning, other than expanding the lore. The mysteries that are wrapped up in the opening scenes unwrap cluttered and without defining details. Im not completely in the directors head and i feel as if some things just happened for the fun of it. I was expecting a layered story with the exceptionally high rating, with every detail having depth and meaning. Without spoiling the film, greed is frowned upon and im sure that capitalism is questioned, with the abandoned old themepark reflecting the loss of the old era. Little things such as Bo having to become small to become a bigger and better being, with him able to stand as a result are things to take away from the film.I do however, simply believe that the West has blown this movie above its true level. Yes it is original, yes it has qualities but apart from its unique characters 'Spirited Away' is not a special film for me. Perhaps i am being too critical or perhaps i am just disregarding the 2001 release date which may bring some exceptional credit to it, of which i am not aware. I have seen cartoon films before and i have seen anime's, yes this is a perfect combination of the 2 for children. I really enjoyed some of the characters but felt the story came short but perhaps i have set the bar too high in a film made for children. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
I don't really know what to say.,"I enjoyed this movie but more towards the end. The first half of the movie was very odd, which is one of the main reasons I kept watching as I wanted to understand it but that didn't really happen. Not enough was explained and it felt like a mix of random events yet there was an actual story. Im struggling to come up with a reason of why no-face was even in the movie, he was just there. This movie isn't bad by any means, it's just lacking somethings in my opinion. I also didn't. Really feel in touch with any of the characters as no room was left for them to develop. The wired and wacky characters made the film very unique and interesting, the film is visually beautiful as well, I would personally want more depth.It is a good movie with a lot of potential. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One of the Greatest Movies Of All Time,"This movie is an outstanding piece of artwork. I hadn't heard much about it when it was first released. Being a huge Oscar fan, I was surprised when it took home the award for best animated film. At that point, knew nothing about it.After reading a little more and seeing some commercials, I still wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to see this film. It looked so surreal in an ""Alice in Wonderland"" sort of way. I had never been a big fan of that film and didn't really want to relive such an idea. Mindbending films have never been my absolute favorites.I went to see ""Spirited Away"" with a friend who was into anime. He hadn't heard much about it either, but was interested in seeing it in the theater. Since it had won the Academy Award, I decided it was a good idea to give it a shot.I am so glad I did. Only a very few times in my life have a I seen a movie as brilliant as this. It stands alone with such masterpieces like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""The Godfather"" and any other classic piece of cinema in history.I won't go into too much detail, but I was spellbound from the opening credits until the closing ones. The story starts out so rough and scary, but becomes a work of happiness and beauty. To think that this movie almost didn't get made is a travesty.

Better in the Original Japanese Soundtrack,"The art work alone is worthy of the engulfment one experiences when watching the big screen, making me wish I had seen it on the big screen.  That is, unless the major release in the US was the English language version.We ended up renting the DVD and watching it in English.  The sound, the voice of Chihiro in particular, grated our ears like nails on a chalk board. After watching it, we played around with the DVD and found the original Japanese soundtrack with English subtitles. Far more subtle and simply put, an AMAZING difference.So, I would suggest watching it in both languages.  English so that you can concentrate on the scenery (with the sound turned down low.  Really, the screeching and shouting in English is annoying). Then watch it in Japanese for the color and mood the dialog provides.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Can Easily Beat Disney In Their Own Game,"As the rest of the Western world was amazed by the throngs of CGI animation, and the inside Disney jokes, Japanese audiences were given a chance to see what real animation was like. This movie was the first foreign film which grossed over 200 million dollars before it came over the US shores. It had beaten Pixar's Ice Age and Disney's Lilo and Stitch to get Best Animated Feature. Yet with all these facts and figures shown to us, does this movie live up to its hype. In a one word answer, YES!However there is no point of handing out the superlatives to a movie, without explaining what the movie is all about. In a nutshell, the movie is about a ten year old girl who is travels to a strange yet enchanting world, after her parents were morphed into pigs. This change of shape was produced by the evil witch, Yubaba, an nasty sorceress who rules over this paralell universe. To avoid detection, the ten year old girl, Chihiro has to work for Yubaba in her bath house. This is where she meets all kind of strange and wonderful characters, like the half man half spider Kamaiji, the mysterious little boy, Haku and many other characters. Though Chihiro had met all these people, her only wish is to go home and turn her parents back to their normal human selves.Watching this movie, has made me wonder why is this feature shown in very small arthouse cinemas and it is on pirate DVDs, when it should be easily shown on the multiplex cinemas. This is a truly amazing movie, whereby the whole story, transports oneself to their earlier childhood. I know that happened to me. Also the movie's animation was totally amazing, in ways that Pixar and Dreamworks would just die for. A good example of this is the flower scene.In conclusion, everyone should watch this movie, whether young or old, japanese or any other nationality, because at the end of the day, this will show you emotions that any other animations will not give you the chance to show.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The best animated film I have ever seen,"Spirited Away is my favourite Hayao Miyazi movie. It's a departure from his previous films (all of them wonderful), in the sense that this film lacks the themes so common in his other work: humans vs nature, large scale battles being the prime examples. All for the better I say, as it allows him to create something truly unique and stunning. The story revolves around Chihiro, a young girl who, on the way to her new house, stumbles into an abandoned amusement park and is soon transported into a magical world of spirits, gods and human-frog hybrids.The animation is stunning. Miyazaki truly sees animation as an artform. Many stand out scenes contain no dialogue at all, and are merely animated images creating surreal effects: Chihiro in the lift with the Radish spirit, Chihiro running through the flowers, and the final train ride, where our young protagonist takes a mysterious train journey across a sea, with her spirit friend, No Face. Nothing much happens, it's just simple, colourful, oddly unsettling, and lingers long after the film ends.The characters are also perfect, and add to strange storyline. There's Kamaji, the multi limbed boiler room operator, Yubaba, the evil witch, and her massive baby child. No Face is a peculiar spirit who turns feral when Chihiro is not around, and finally, Haku, a boy spirit, who shares an emotional scene with Chihiro towards the end of the film.Colourful, imaginative, interesting, and emotional. Spirited Away is a film you'll want to see time and time again. Buy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Prepare to be enchanted!,"I love Studio Ghibli, and Spirited Away is one of my favourite films from the studio. This is coming from someone who was delighted by Howl's Moving Castle, blown away by Princess Mononoke, emotionally devastated by Grave of the Fireflies and touched by the simplicity of The Cat Returns all but to name a few. Spirited Away is a mystical, charming and truly enchanting animated fantasy, even with the long length and some slow moments. The animation is absolutely stunning, both the hand drawn visuals and the CGI graphics give an ethereal charm to the film. The characters move more than convincingly and the colours are beautiful. The music is also outstanding, I loved the simplicity of the piano and the drama of the more dramatic parts. The story is a pleasure, I know people have complained of some loose ends, but it is an original, touching and charming one I feel. I also loved the characters. Chihiro, voiced with real enthusiasm by Daveigh Chase, is sulky to begin with, but she is also brave and resourceful, traits I like in young heroines. Lin is kind and sympathetic, and Susan Egan who was also in Porco Rosso was unusually sensitive as the character. Jason Marsden is charming as Haku, and Suzanne Pleshette is perfect as the grotesque Yubaba and as her sister Zeniba. Overall, I loved Spirited Away, it is really charming. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Fantastique...,"I never thought I liked anime until recently. Prior to this, the only titles I had enjoyed were the Animatrix, and Ghost in the Shell. They play a lot of anime shows on cartoon network, and I've tried to get into them, but usually watch a minute or so, find them irritating, and easily turn to something else.I tuned into a showing of this film however, and was instantly captivated. Its so very unique and wonderful I simply could not turn it off. I couldn't even partake of my usual channel surfing for fear of missing a minute of its goodness when it came back from commercial! Although I think it loses some of its magic when Chihiro/Sen starts to get used to her new surroundings, it stays genuinely entertaining to the end.

"The word ""masterpiece"" is over-used","The word masterpiece is being thrown around a little bit too much on this one.While I found myself stunned by the visuals in Spirited Away (particularly a magnificently realized train ride across the sea), its lackluster story - little more than a rip-off of (or homage to) Alice In Wonderland - keeps this film from being a classic masterpiece.Some of the ideas were extraordinarily imaginative (the spirit bathhouse, Haku's transformation into a dragon, Yubaba's transformation into a bird, the boiler-room operator), others were just downright ridiculous (No-Face's regurgitation, the bouncing disembodied heads, the baby, an evil twin sister - what is this Days Of Our Lives?).This is not to say that I was expecting literal-minded filmmaking.  I was thoroughly impressed by the director's previous film, Princess Mononoke, but I felt its story was integral to its success (i.e. a hero's journey; the forces of human industrialization vs. nature and the need to co-exist peacefully).  The ""story"" in Spirited Away is much more simplistic (girl overcomes her fears) and, as a result, leaves little in the way of narrative thrust or suspense (especially for a 2 hour movie).  Princess Mononoke's story was epic and its running time and pace justified.  Spirited Away is merely serviceable in every way except its visual palette.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
I have no strong opinion about this movie either way,"I've been hearing good things about this movie for years and finally decided to watch it, but I didn't quite understood it. There are things that I liked, like the expressive way the main character was drawn, the overall color palette and backgrounds, maybe some points for the original setting, but with that, I can't think of what else good to say. From all the things I've heard I expected the movie to be very emotional, yet I failed to notice such thing. I had seen the black character with the mask used in memes on the internet so much, that I expected he would play a really important part in the story, but in the end he was nothing special. The story really confused me, some elements didn't make much sense to me, and the ending was pretty rushed, like they ran out of money and had to complete the movie fast. I don't know, maybe I have to study Japanese philosophy and symbolism to understand what is happening. Don't get me wrong, I kinda enjoyed the movie, I just wish it made more sense. It sort of reminded me of the movie ""labyrinth"", but that movie has a very good structure and story, and you always know what is going on and why. In conclusion, I think the movie would be appreciated more by children.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
better than Disney by a long shot,"I really enjoyed this film-everything about it glows and shines in a gentle luminosity. This film, if you have seen some of Miyazaki's other work, is quite light. The characters are beautifully and lovingly created and the colouring and setting of this film is absolutely superb. This is a beautiful little film and I can't wait for the next feature from Hayao Miyazaki-he is better than Walt Disney.Miyazaki blends the characters and the environment very well together, and I can see that this would be enjoyed for people at many different levels. Miyazaki enjoys creating female heroines and I was pleased that Chihiro lived up to the expression and beauty of her predecessors-like Nausicaa from the Valley of the Wind. This is beautiful and I would advise anyone to take a look at it's scope and serenity, along with it's fast paced plot and of course, the dreamlike settings that make it truly wonderful.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A Movie Where Many Childhood Dreams Are Reborn...,"It is so ironically tragic that many great movies such as Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away are often overlooked by the public, suggesting that commercialism is the way of reflecting the possibility of achieving blockbuster status in the box-office, even as if most of these recycled products receive poor reviews (remember Shark Tale? It's horribly cliché but millions of viewers still watch it). Is it because of technology that drives its influence to the public without providing any necessity that is its substance? Or is it because Spirited Away is considered another ordinary 2D cartoon that should be suitable for little children and not the rest of us? Sadly, this is reality and we all see as it is right now (providing that we live in a topsy-turvy world with unfair paradoxes) but it doesn't mean that Miyazaki's masterpiece has a chance to change our reflections on life. In fact, there are doses of good reasons on why this movie is so special to us, aside from its family-friendly context.Hayao Miyazaki, who has directed many of the most acclaimed animated movies in animation history (under the banner of Studio Ghibli), has stated that Spirited Away is 'for the people who used to be ten years old and the people who are going to be ten years old'. Perhaps, he really knows how children see things in their own eyes, as he might use to face during his childhood times (that's why most of his movies feature flying ships/creatures, tons of imaginative elements derived from Asian/Western cultures, some preferences from classic fairy tales, etc.) Most importantly, Mr. Miyazaki uses this tagline as an essential plot device to show the innocence, the bizarre, the horror and the wondrous revelation that the main protagonist (Chihiro) sees, feels and experiences throughout her spiritual journey, a path that we all had crossed as children before the madness of the world overwhelms our innocence. Fortunately, movies like Spirited Away succeeds in regaining our former consciousness, pulling us into his imaginative world where our childhood memories have never died; they are merely hidden inside our hearts and Mr. Miyazaki is enable to reshape them with everything this movie has to offer.Instead of the cliché-ridden plots that mar state-of-the-art-animated films of today, Mr. Miyazaki refers to his personal experience in Japan as another plot device while maintaining the classic storytelling technique to create an entirely refreshing concept based on real-life situations. If you think Spirited Away features some of the most incomprehensibly bizarre characters you've never seen, fear not! Like all good movies, despite their oddity, they all are no different from us in terms of how they adapt to life and their functions to keep the company going. That also leads to the fact that Spirited Away is really not a good vs. evil show (like Star Wars); despite its scary images, powerful spells and evil-looking monsters, they are all surprisingly ordinary with mere characteristics of maids, bosses and customers. So don't expect a Darth Vader-like antagonist to cover the whole world with darkness while unleashing a large army of robotic troopers to destroy everything in their sights.The overall animation is simply breathtaking. Even as they are all hand-drawn, the characters' expressions and body postures are all wonderfully done in a very natural way, the same applies to these beautiful background settings painted painstakingly by some of Ghibli's most talented artists in Japan. Speaking of animation, when watching it up close and personal, it does bear some resemblance to Disney's Snow White as well as his classic movies (unlike the new, recycled Disney movies of the early 2000s) in terms of its cel-shaded look and the way most characters move and interact (strangely, though, Mr. Miyazaki is not a big fan of Disney. Ironically, Disney is the only company that understands his movies' significance to moviegoers around the world, so it serves as a distributor to Ghibli's animated movies in North America.). Unlike most current anime that requires CGI to excite the audience, Mr. Miyazaki fortunately decides not to rely much on fancy digital applications (there are some subtle CGI effects, which are cleverly implemented on certain parts of the movie).Disney, in its other matter, has done a good job in translating the movie's original Japanese context to its English counterpart without radically changing the flow and theme of its entire story, thanks to Pixar animator and executive producer John Lasseter (however, Disney's marketing power fails to attract more moviegoers). Despite the audience's varied reactions on English and Japanese tracks, in my opinion, I find both of them outstanding and seem to have a natural pattern to influence the mood of the movie. Once again, Joe Hisashi, the composer of many of Miyazaki's movies, has provided some of the finest and most memorable cues ever to bring grace to the screens (one of my personal favorite is a cue in which Haku finally remembers his original name, shedding its scales in the sky). Without these important audio elements, Spirited Away could have been another uninspiring, lifeless show.It is no doubt that Spirited Away has indeed changed the way we look at animated movies, similar to the way the original Star Wars trilogy, the first two Godfather movies and films by Steven Spielberg did. It is also true that whatever I write in this review, a single picture tells a thousand words; you still need to watch it with your own eyes, feel it as you are still a child and you will understand a thousand reasons why this movie should receive an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. However, like many artistic filmmakers, Mr. Miyazaki is not interested in such glamorous spotlights and moneymaking propaganda, as he continues to inspire newer generations with his latest waves of masterpieces, starting with Howl's Moving Castle.Thank you, Mr. Miyazaki for proving once again that childhood memories will forever endure within our hearts and souls until the end of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Unscorable,"I have given movies 10 out 10 stars before, but this just crosses a completely new line into something even above 100% greatness; perfection. This may be the only film I have ever seen that is completely perfect, I would change absolutely nothing about it. The only other film that I would put over the top is, coincedentally, My Neighbor Totoro. The fact that the are made by the same company has nothing to do with it.Whenever I watch this movie, not only do I find things that I didn't notice the time before, but I feel a sense of having already seen certain things in it before, somewhere else. But I haven't - it is just the originality, and the new ideas that other movies will build on from this one. Everything is perfect. The illustrations are detailed, flowing, and mesmerizing. The musical score is dead-on, and sneaks along in the background for most of the running. And the story takes on a form that I am attempting to do in my first work - complete layers. Two people could watch this, and come away with different ideas and plot lines. This is exactly what a movie should do, keep everyone that sees it thinking about it afterwards. There is no definite ending or beginning, it is left purely to the imagination.The entire film seems like just a slice of someone's imagination, and when I watch it, I consider it mine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
An astonishing film. I was blown away...,"I rented this film from Blockbuster after hearing about it from a friend. I was slightly reluctant, never seeing an anime film before, but I watched it six times before giving it back two days later, then bought it the next day. My daughter watched it with me every time and loved it as much as I did. It was an astonishing film, though scary at times, but wonderful the whole way through. It had some laugh out loud funny moments and the next minute you were on the edge of your seat and it all seemed so real. It really got me into anime. Since then I have also watched Howl's moving castle, which is fabulous. My daughter went one step further and learnt to draw manga. I must say she is quite good! She also is learning to play the opening theme on the piano. It's 4 pages long. Rather her than me! I would recommend this film to anybody. But be warned.

Unique!,"Personally, this is the best anime movie I've ever seen! The story is unreal! Spirited Away is a film that pulls you into a world unlike any other. From the moment Chihiro stumbles into the mysterious spirit realm, you're hooked by the incredible visuals and unique characters. Miyazaki creates a world that feels alive, where every detail-from the bustling bathhouse to the hauntingly quiet train ride-is packed with meaning and emotion.What makes Spirited Away so special is its heart. Beneath all the strange creatures and magical settings, it's really a story about growth, resilience, and finding strength in unexpected places. Chihiro's journey from a scared little girl to a brave, determined heroine feels real and inspiring.While the movie's pacing might feel slow at times, it gives you time to absorb the depth and beauty of this magical world. The quiet moments are just as powerful as the big ones, letting you reflect on the story's deeper themes about identity, responsibility, and the connections we share.The music, too, deserves a mention. Joe Hisaishi's score is breathtaking, perfectly capturing the film's mix of wonder, fear, and hope. It adds so much to the overall experience, making every scene even more memorable.Spirited Away is a must-watch for anyone who loves animation, fantasy, or just a good story with heart. It's a film that doesn't just entertain-it stays with you, making you think and feel long after the credits roll. An 10/10 for me, and absolutely worth your time.

Incredible. Absolutely Incredible.,"I cannot express how beautiful and just incredible this movie is. I haven't seen this masterpiece in anything but the dubbed English, even though many say it is incredible with subtitles or even just in Japenese. I can guarantee you that you will fall in love with this movie. Maybe not after the first time you see it, but maybe after the 2nd 3rd or 4th. Chihiro is a little girl who is moving. She is a drama queen in the car as her parents are driving her to her new home. Then her father gets lost and Chihiro and her parents wind up at a building in the woods.. they walk through the structure and enter a world of wonder with spirits and magical creatures. She overcomes many obstacles in this odd world and changes her attitude and perspective on things. I do have to admit that the first time I saw this movie, I had no idea what was going on. After a while I just stopped paying attention to the plot and just focused on the brilliant art of the movie. But after the second time watching it, I totally got the movie. It made me feel good about myself. And now every time I watch the movie, I see so many things I haven't seen before.

"It's okay, but not as mind-blowing as I expected","With all the rapturous reviews I've read about Spirited Away - written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, animated by Studio Ghibli, a box-office giant not only in Japan but worldwide - I prepared to have my mind blown by it. And that's probably one of the problems I had going into it. Too high expectations ruined it for me. It's good, but I wasn't blown away.No doubt the animation is great, though I'm not a big fan of that humongous blob of waste walking around the hotel, it actually turned my stomach. I guess it's just not my type of story and characters. I didn't enjoy Alice in Wonderland that much either, which this story of a young girl who comes across a ghost town reminds me of.

Simply Ingenious,"As a child, i have distinct memories of watching ""My Neighbor Totoro"", at the local movie theatre. I must say, that this movie is reminiscint of that feeling. It might just be the dazzling collaboration of computer animation, and the classic anime animation, but this movie is eye candy. That isn't the only great thing about it though. It has a very compelling story line, that goes up there with some other great films, that will forever hold a place in our hearts. Another dazzling feature in this movie, is the music. It perfectly mixes, classical, European music, and Japanese music, it its glory. I must say, that when i first saw this movie, i had no idea that it existed. That isn't in any way a problem though, considering that most originally Japanese movies aren't very well known in America. Overall, this movie is simply brilliant, and actually made me feel like a better person. It also includes many different, deep ideas, that actually caught my attention, and my heart strings, much more than anything that could come out of ""The Matrix"" or something. So, indeed, this movie is one of the greatest, which i have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I would completely recommend seeing it, and i am giving it a perfect 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Wonderful coming-of-age story, beautifully pictured","Seldom have I seen a movie full of such boundless fantasy, incredible beauty and opulent pictures. Miyazaki presents the story of Chihiro who has to rescue her parents from the spell of a witch in fantasy world with such extravagant richness that stuns the spectator.Granted the story about this fantasy world with all kinds of exceptionally weird creatures and situations takes needs getting used to at first. But very soon the spectator is totally engrossed by the magical story and overwhelming pictures.In view of the diversity of bizarre creatures, the filmmaker's creativity seems almost unlimited. The beautiful pictures have a very soothing and at the same time enthusiastic effect onto the spectator.But the brilliance of the movie doesn't only result from the beauty of the pictures, the story itself is very subtle and profound. In short, it is a story about growing-up. Chihiro and her parents are on their way to their new home in the suburbs when they accidentally step into a magical world, where Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs. From now on, Chihiro has to manage everything by herself. She has to attempt to turn her parents back into humans and is confronted with situations and characters that don't coincidentally seem like metaphors of our world. Now, Chihiro learns how to solve problems herself and how to deal with the characters of the people she meets. At the end, Chihiro has turned into a almost mature person.Although occidental spectator won't be able to understand all symbolisms that are conveyed by the characters, but there's is actually no need of it. The fantastic world and its creatures perfectly work as a scenery for a wonderful coming-of-age story.The wonderful, as customary for composer Joe Hisaishi, music adds even more magical beauty to the scenery.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"An extraordinary achievement of animation, perhaps the best ever made","Upon hearing that this became Japan's highest grossing film ever, I went out of my way to look for a theater that had this movie here in the states. I traveled some, paid top dollar for the ticket, and, after seeing it, was totally blown away by the experience I had. I had no doubt in my mind that I have seen the best movie of the year, and quite possibly the best animated movie I have EVER seen.The story starts with a young girl named Chihiro, and her family, moving to a new place. When they wander into what seems like an abandoned theme park and her parents start to eat prepared food (but with no one around to attend them), they turn into pigs. Chihiro runs and encounters a bathhouse for the gods and spirits. With the help of a young boy named Haku, Chihiro learns that in order to reverse the effects of her parents dilemma, she must work in the bathhouse. Life isn't easy, not even for the gods. She'll come across bizarre creatures & places. She will learn hard work, the sense of loss, greed, & the importance of friendship and love.It's dreamy-like quality, it gorgeous scenes, and it's incredible list of characters (frogs that talk, a dragon, a baby that is 12 feet tall, a multi-armed boiler-room man) will keep you glued to the story.Children will love this film, yet it is sophisticated enough for adults to enjoy and relish in it's beauty. It does have it's scary bits and images, however, so very young children may be frightened. But this is still the type of movie that you go out and buy, even if you don't have children. So imaginative is the world that Chihiro falls in, thoughts of 'Alice in Wonderland' & 'The Wizard of Oz' may come to mind. But 'Spirited Away' ends up with it's own originality. It's a timeless piece, and will eventually be a classic that will no doubt be shown to generations.In the DVD, Disney made sure that the voice acting for the English version is top-notch, but, even if you don't liked dubbing, you have the option to switch to Japanese with subtitles.How could 'Spirited Away' become the first anime film to be nominated for, AND WIN an Academy Award? How did it gross $200 million before it even came to the states? The answer lies in mastermind creator Hayao Miyazaki. So well known in Japan, he is now getting the recognition he deserves internationally. With past hits like Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki and his studio, Ghibli, have created outstanding features that very few animation studios can even match. Their movies are hand-drawn, without all the CGI that many studios are using. Amid the fact that Disney has distributed these treasures, I would say that there isn't much in the Disney vaults that can even come close to matching what Miyazaki and his studio have produced.Do not hesitate to watch this magical, enchanting, and rare gem that we have the privilege to see. And if you have seen it, go out of your way to view the rest of Miyazaki's films, like 'Nausicaa', 'Castle in the Sky', & 'Kiki's Delivery Service'.Undeniably a perfect 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"RUNNING TIME - 125 minutes STARRING - Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden, Suzanne Pleshette CERTIFICATE - PG","Chihiro and her parents are driving to their new house. She's upset to leave her old friends and school. When her father gets them lost in the woods, they stumble across what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. Chihiro wanders off and is sucked into a bath-house in a new world, a world of spirits. Chihiro is guided by Haku, henchman of the witch who controls the bath-house. The two of them work hard together to help Chihiro escape and rescue her parents. The youngster proves herself to be as independent as any spirit and fights through many distractions and inconveniences to return to her own world. Even though she's scared and upset, she makes some close friends among the eccentric characters she meets.I've loved Miyazaki's work as long as I have known it but nothing compares to the experience of Spirited Away. I had not heard of the movie and had seen no trailers, so the unexpected animation was almost perfect. The characters were quite unique and no sane viewer would refuse the offer to follow the child in her enchanting adventure.For years, I've always thought that one of the most important factors of a good movie is the way the title is presented at the beginning and there is no better example to prove my point than in this film. The music is completely overwhelming, especially the attractive sequence displayed at the beginning and repeated throughout.There is very little criticism available, only that it's possible that the unique imagination of Hayou Miyazaki is not appreciated to the extent it should be by the viewers.I've read other reviews and think it's unfair to compare the work with Disney's as the last thing I would call this feature is a 'children's' movie.

Wow.,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is perfected into the smallest detail. This is definitely the best animated movie I have ever seen.When I looked at the cover of this movie I thought it looked kinda boring. But that was exactly the opposite of what it was. It is full of creatures you've never heard of, and even though it's not said it is a comedy, it is completely full-stuffed of totally hilarious moments.To name some of the great stuff in this movie: The characters are very worked-through and totally original, I have never seen such an example of imagination. There is no flat characters either, that means there are no such boring things as an all-the-way-through evil or good character.The story is also very original. If you just read the story here on IMDb it might not seem very special or interesting (I didn't have very high expectations on the movie after reading the backside of the DVD), but trust me, when things start happening, you'll find yourself completely stuck.This movie is a great example (and proof) that you don't need 3d or cool explosion effects to make a really great movie!

A Fantastic Film (most literally),"Good morning. Last night I was able to catch the Disney US Release of Spirited Away ( originally The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro). This is another  Disney purchase of a Japanese hit. For those that don't know, Disney has a nasty habit of importing titles from Japan and then changing the story when dubbing films or creatively editing the endings or plot to ""suit American audiences"". Personally I think that's a travesty. So  whenever you go see the Disney release of a foreign film, realize the film you are watching may not be the 'same film' the rest of the world sees.OK, that aside, was it a good film? I deliberately did no research before seeing this film as I prefer to go into films with little or no expectations. All I knew was that the film was directed and written by Hayao Miyazaki, the same man responsible for Princess Mononoke ( a film released a few years back that I also enjoyed). In the case of Spirited away, I'm glad I did not know what I was getting myself into, otherwise I might not have come (and surprisingly, not for the reasons you likely assume).The film concerns a young girl and her parents who find an odd tunnel in the side of a hill while moving to their new home. Upon investigating the tunnel, they find a strange ""theme park"" on the other side devoid of inhabitants. Upon investigating the theme park, things are obviously very ""wrong"" (at least to the little girl- her parents seem woefully oblivious) and as it gets closer to sunset, things just get worse. Unfortunately, this is all the plot I am able to reveal without spoiling the uniqueness of this film.This is an 'adult-oriented' movie. It has some rather disturbing images and ranks among the weirdest films I have seen in my life. It's a bizarre amalgam of Wizard of Oz,The Neverending Story, Alice in Wonderland, My Friend Totoro, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and The City of Lost Children (just to name a few). This film is interesting from beginning to end even though the plot advances rather slowly. There is always some new thing to see or some truly bizarre thing to witness. The animation is above average but not as impressive as Mononoke (and even features several gratuitous CGI sequences).There is a great story and some great humor. I laughed more in this film than I have at any Hollywood 'comedy' in the last 5 years (and Spirited Away is not a comedy, it just has several good comedic breaks). No nudity. No Profanity. No 'gratuitous' violence. Some rather disturbing scenes of characters getting eaten alive (and some threats thereof) but even the eaten characters return unharmed later in the film.This is not really a 'family film' (and definitely NOT a ""kiddee film"") but it is something you can take the whole family to. Smaller children will not understand the story, but they'll like the visuals and enjoy the humor. Mid-teens might be a bit ""weirded out"" by the subject matter and the visuals and older teens and adults may be too jaded by American cinema to enjoy the film for what it is- a lavish fairytale from a foreign country. This film runs about 2 hours so leave the ""kidney-buster"" sodas at the snack bar. If you have to take a bathroom break, you WILL miss something and I assure you no friend nor helpful audience member will likely be able to adequately convey what it is you DID just miss.If you enjoy Anime or the bizarre, make an effort to see this film. Even if you don't normally like ""cartoon movies"", you might give this one a chance. It is not a 'casual moviegoer' film by any means and does rely on some thought from the audience to enjoy it. It will also likely be the oddest film you'll see this decade and you'll be sure to remember this film long after all the other 'disposable movies' have faded from your recollection. This film is receiving almost no advertising. I didn't even know it existed until I saw the poster tucked away in a corner at the theatre earlier this week. I hope Disney puts a little more effort into advertising this film's release because it is truly an original film and worthy of a large audience. Hopefully positive word-of-mouth will get this film the attendance it deserves.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

There is so much neo-mythology and Post Alice Traumatic Stress Syndrome in this movie that I was tickled, honestly. There is a lot of imagination and colorful ideas and I wish that there can be many more animated pictures of this quality to come in the future - the movie resembled a lot of the wacky weirdness that were around in the old Betty Boop or Silly Symphonies cartoons, the animators really touched a chord in me and I thank them full heartedly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A haunting beautiful tale,"Was on the old Atari forums one day and searching through the movie section of the forum and I saw a thread on a Spirited Away movie.

So once it came out on DVD I rented it and I must say, one of the best animation movies I've ever seen. The passion in the movie is extravagant, the animation is beautiful and the voice acting is astonishing.The story is about a little girl named Chihiro and her family, they are moving to a brand new house. On there way to there house there dim-witted father takes a short cut which leads them to what seems to be a abandoned old style Japanese amusement park where traveling through they find some food. Even though Chihiro's objection the Parents stuff there faces, which strangely enough turns them into pigs. Things get worst, she loses her way she came back and there are ghost like spirits around her. Her only way to get her parents back is help out by a boy naked Haku.

Not All That,"This animated film is pretty to look at, but IMO it was endless and rather meaningless, at least to this western viewer.Perhaps this film holds meaning to those cognizant of Japanese mythology, but although the protagonist is changed by her strange adventure here, there seems to be no moral lesson to be learned other, perhaps, than ""act with kindness toward others."" John Lasseter admires this film and its maker, but then he brought us the three ""Cars"" films, so what does he know? At least the first Cars film had a discernible message..",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Overrated,"This is not a bad movie at all, but its really not that great either. I don't really understand what all the endless praise is over. The animation is amazing for sure but the story feels really convoluted. I don't really understand what the ghost character with the gold was. I didn't understand what he was or what we wanted exactly. Maybe i'm missing something.Also their is a character that apparently is a human but also a dragon and then later turns out to be a river spirit? The f*#k?!?!There is no real deep meaning in the movie as far as I can tell. The main character is fairly static throughout the whole movie and doesn't really grow or learn anything (she is also quite annoying at times)Also I'm not totally sure what the target audience is supposed to be here. At times it feels like a family movie sometimes it feels like a creepy horror movie with scary looking characters. I don't really know who this movie is for.As I said not a bad movie, but the story feels all over the place and feels pretty pointless when all is said and done.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Mystical and enchanting. A key to another world.,"Mystical. Enchanting. A key to another world. There are so many ways to describe this movie. The movie focuses on a young girl who is trapped in a sort of ""spirit world"". When her mother and father are turned into pigs, young Chihiro has to save her parents before they're cooked and eaten. It may sound silly, but this tale has more to it than farm animals. When Chihiro is frightened, she runs off. When a boy finds her, he tells her that she must get a job at ""The Bath House"". A sort of retreat for spirits. But to do this, she must speak with Yubaba. The witch who rules The Bathhouse. After Yubaba agrees to give Chihiro some work. She takes her name away from her. And she is then called ""Sen"". While shes at the bath house, she is put under very hard work. I could say more, but that would be foolish of me. This is a great movie that I think people of all ages should see for themselves. Its an enchanting and heartwarming story that I've watched over and over again and have never gotten sick of it. It has been another inspiring movie from Haiyo Miazaki that is above all his best yet. A 10 out of 10 for this wonderful movie.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Miyazaki's Call : Please Protect the Environment,"Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away is a surreal, entertaining, and refreshing film for adults (not for kids who may find it weird). It portrays a very colorful cast with a simple plot line. It transports viewers to a dreamy land of super-natural, makes it a little frightening, yet because of the main character's innate innocence (she being a child), adult viewers are reminded how to be kids again...in another light. In the end, Miyazaki's constant message (it appears to be an ongoing call) prevails: protect our environment. :)Like all of Miyazaki's films, it is an expected hit, not only for its intricate plot line, but also for the name of the director himself. Attach Miyazaki's name, and Japan comes lining up. Too bad for America though, since they have yet to line up for a film that actually conveys a worthwhile message. Animations films in America are still equated for the kids' market, and it's a pity that it is still being marketed for them without considering animation as a distinct genre for all market groups.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Solving problems without violence,"Spirited Away is the latest in a string of incredible animated films by Hayao Miyazaki, the most renowned animator in Japanese history and most say in the best in world.  He takes a couple steps close to the best in the world title with this film.It's the story of Chihiro as she is caught in a world where humans are not allowed: a world of magic, gods and a Japanese bathhouse.  As we meet Chihiro we realize that she is a bit spoiled and has never done anything for herself.  As her adventures progress, she matures in ways that she doesn't even realize.  This is a journey of self-discovery and a study in forced independence.Many have compared it to Alice In Wonderland, but where Alice, I thought, was a two-dimensional character going from adventure to adventure, Chihiro is well rounded.  She figures out how to be adaptable to an ever-changing world and discovers how to solve her problems instead of running away from them.  She is a `real' girl shoved into a world of Japanese mythology where she is ignorant of the rules.And her problem solving is the best part of the film and the reason I liked this one better then Princess Mononoke.  Chihiro uses her kindness, courage and courtesy as her weapons.  Even when violence erupts all around her, she relies on her wit and intelligence instead of magic, swords or arrows. These are lessons that children should be exposed to instead of explosions and gore that make up a lot of cinema. If I had kids, you bet I'd be taking them to see this one.But don't get me wrong; this film is able to thrill adults, too.  It is so full of imagination the film seems barely able to contain itself.  While it is not as lush as Mononoke (it may have been the print I saw), Spirited Away is gorgeously animated and the dubbing work is almost perfectly synched.  In fact, after Chihiro is whisked away I didn't even notice anything out of place.There were; however, about three scenes that I remember thinking that the score seemed out of place and became distracting, but that's my only complaint.  I can easily see why this is Japan's biggest moneymaking film of all time.  It's a story well told with visuals beautiful to behold.  It's simply timeless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A Surprisingly excellent and well-crafted film. transcends genre,"Miyazaki once again demonstrates his clear perception of the child psyche in this excellent, beautiful, and almost haunting masterpiece of the animated form.I first saw ""Spirited Away"" in Japanese, and then in English, dubbed by pixar, and i must say, both versions are excellent indeed.The film begins with the journey of a small child, dragged along by her parents, waiting and watching and being what small children are. Then, as her excitable (and foolish) father is attracted by a ""theme park"" in the middle of a mysterious wood, the entire world changes in more ways than the viewer would have easily imagined.The juxtaposition of expectation and result, fear and wonderment, awe and love... create an atmosphere, and a FEELING, that truly transcends any genre, stereotype, or precedent to the film. If you go into it expecting anime, expect the unexpected. If you go into it expecting horror, prepare to be swept away with the amazement of the ""revelations"" --if i may use the word tenuously-- which are at the center of this film's sweeping grandiosity. It is a wower indeed.As for a more specific definition, This is a film based mainly upon the legends of the ""gods"" and ""spirits"" of Japanese legend and lore. It takes place mainly in a ""bathhouse of the gods"" a place where the spirits of the world (in this movie) come to relax, cleanse themselves of dirt and grime, and fraternize with other inhuman beings.The entire experience is truly magical and not to be missed, so please, open your eyes, open your minds (at least a little), sit back, and enjoy the (marvelous) show.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"Even if anime isn't your thing, this is a very rewarding movie.","I'd class myself as a casual viewer, someone who's trying to broaden my horizon of movies, anime is perhaps not kryptonite, I can appreciate them, I don't often enjoy them.Spirited Away however, is one of the best animations I've ever seen, there's an incredible imagination behind this, a deep and complex story, mixed in with some tremendous visuals.I did have to read a few articles regarding the plot about forty minutes in, as I had a fair idea, vhr couldn't quite work out all that was going on, however as it developed it certainly opened up, the latter stages definitely seemed to make more sense, but if you struggle with the first twenty minutes or so, my advice is to stick with it.Best of all for me, the visuals, I thought this film even after two decades, looks absolutely incredible, it's a beautiful film. I thought the music was terrific too, totally in keeping with the spirit and vibe of the film.I watched this with English subbing, and the voiceover actors did a fine job. I was advised to watch it in its original format, but I was missing too much of the wonderful animation.Every time I watch an anime I seem to enjoy, this one was up a notch however, this is a film I've tried to encourage others to watch.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Japanese Spirit,"The beautiful looking work of Spirited Away will catch you breathless from the get go, but sadly the story will neither entice nor enthrall you enough to stay focused on what's happening. The films story feels rather surreal and incoherent, giving no indication to what and why characters do certain actions. It also fails at being anything near original, muddling up previously used stories and creating one big jumbled mess.Whilst the story of Spirited Away may be hard for some to understand, one cannot leave the film without praising the artwork. It almost makes up for a lack of a coherent storyline, but for the most part the story does leave you wanting to know more; but to know more about what's happening, not about what's going to happen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Weird and massively over rated,"I apologise to the seemingly massive fanbase for these Miyazaki films but I find them totally over praised.I cannot see what people find so amazing about them. The scripts are totally banal and unnatural with nothing that makes me feel any emotion or humour. I find the dialogue boring and idiotic to be honest.Yes the animation is what must attract people mainly I guess but is it just me or is it no better than the weird cartoons I used to watch on kids TV in the 80s like Ulysees, City of Gold or Thundercats? I just would accept it as a kid in the 80s and it is not terrible but while quirky it is neither clever nor realistic nor beautiful. I am not impressed.The stories are mostly weird. In this case it is weird and unengaging for me. I cannot see why people rate it so highly. The characters are drab and cold or sullen and the script is nothing to get me interested at all. The kookiness is all that I can see to attract people. I feel it appeals to the kind of computer game playing, does not leave their bedroom type of geek who has not grown up.

I'm so confused...,What did I just watch. Maybe it wasn't targeted for people like me but I watched it cuz this anime was highly praised and is considered a masterpiece so I decided to give it a shot.So enough with my rant let's into how I rated it. Music and visuals were absolutely amazing for this anime. I really enjoyed especially the character art and movement of the characters. The music had this aesthetic and calm feeling to it which I enjoyed.The problem occurs with the story and the characters. The story or the plot was hella confusing there is one thing and then pops another thing and then another just to get the water flowing and with no reason whats so ever. And the plot made like literally no sense whatsoever. The characters were alright but there were some confusing moments and decisions the characters made. The themes aren't exactly well shown and I didnt seem to find any or understand it well.But for all the problems I sort of enjoyed it I don't know why but it had this calm feeling as if you are dreaming.

May be it's a time to change your mind?,"I never understood the art of anime, manga or whatever. Always thought it's something... just not for me.

But when a friend of mine suggested me to see this one, saying her kids liked it much, I thought to myself: ""Anyway, why not?""...Well, may be I will never see anime again. Just because it's hard to imagine some other movie can be as good as this one. Screamingly-amazing, and no less. The characters, the music, the backgrounds are truly wonderful. A definitely must-see for everyone interested in animation regardless of it's time. Even people who dislike anime for some reason got to see this one.

A Succinct Summary of Childhood Alienation,"This movie is all about alienation and moving to a different world (or suburb, as you will). It captures the feeling of being trapped in this alien world full of new places, new people, and strange legends and myths that you grow accustomed to overtime. Each character that the protagonist meets is in someway an archetype of a personality you confront as a child without knowing you're confronting them at first and draws upon those archetypes to craft a journey through what seems like a pit of despair at first until you begin to take more control of the situation, essentially ""growing up"". There are a few Japanese cultural quirks that drag down an other-wise stellar animated film, but it still shines as an exemplary childhood tale.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

'Spirited Away' is an exceptionally good animation.,"'Spirited Away' is a Japanese film, and is available in the UK in dubbed & subtitled versions. I saw the subtitled film and (with the exception of occasional gaps & pauses in the subtitling) I judge it to be the best animation since Akira, or possibly even Pinnoccio. The storyline is (in outline) no more incredible than most anime, but the film excels because it is bursting with unusual ideas. The imaginative imagery is wedded with fine, detailed animation and evocative music. Some parts of the film (chases/drives through foliage/flowers/within the bath-house) are exceptionally detailed and visually striking. There are (thankfully few) portions of the film soundtrack that suffer an outbreak of a Richard Clayderman-esque piano composition (IMO), but generally the sound supports the animation well and the animation was continually stimulating and moving. I give this (original film with subtitles)  9 OUT OF 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Sensational,"Leave any preconceptions about this being a kids film at home, this is breathtaking. A simple enough story, told with such charm and imagination that it is hard not to love. In every moment there are elements that western cinema might spin into a whole film, but here they are just passing ideas. Every location is so full of life and spirit (pun intended) that a totally immersive atmosphere envelops the viewer at every stage.The film is gentle, yet does not shy away from death and emotion. It's not over-sentimental in it's approach either, just perfectly balanced. It made me genuinely laugh out loud, and cry too - a film hasn't provoked this reaction in me for five years.I have never seen such a brilliant animation, it surpasses the Bellvue Rendezvous and any other you care to think of.

"""Spirited Away"" is another good film proclaimed to be a masterpiece","Chihiro, a little girl, is sitting in a car driven by her parents.

It does have poetry ( a magical scene in which Chihiro is falling from the sky, making her tears fall up ) and some analysts claim that the story is actually a symbol of child prostitution or child slavery in Asia, but as a whole the overlong movie doesn't always work perfectly and it seems as if the critics are finding more meanings which they want to find than the ones that are really there. If Miyazaki's earlier films were less ambitious ( with which I strongly disagree - i. e. ""Kiki's delivery service"" was a wonderful tale about growing up ), then his new ones are less fun and coherent.

This movie made me want to spirit myself as far away as possible. . .,"All I can say about this film is. . . I cannot see why this film is such a masterpiece to some people.  Answer me this.  They take so much time to do detailed back grounds, which are beautiful, but are hidden by the grotesque characters that seem to all look the same to me, no matter what kind of anime.  I found myself being lost in the plot several times, with very poor character development, and apparently hyperactive dubbing.  What I mean by that is, how come everything they say, not matter what it is, comes out all in one rushed, messy breath.  Though, I did find this movie rather a comedy. My brother and I had a few good laughs, especially when Sen runs down the stairs and smacks into the wall.  That was pretty funny, I must say.  The only reason why we went to the movie in the first place was because my brother recieved credit extra credit for his college class for watching it. What a waste of over 2 hours of my life!  I could have been sharpening pencils, or making paper airplanes! Also, I found that there were characters that seemed to play no part at all.  Example:No face.  Ok, so he is the bad guy for about, 5 minutes, but then has no real purpose for being in the movie.  What is with that guy anyway.  Eeesh!  I have nightmares about that one. . . In conclusion, I just want to say, that through out this on going movie, I was ended up multipul times getting lost and confused.  My eyes also started to hurt after watching the choppy animation move across the screen.  I give this movie, on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being the worst, 5 being the best, I gets a big, fat 1, or maybe a zero.  No, one.

Miyazaki masterpiece,"I will admit hesitation in viewing the latest Miyazaki film, simply because of my own close-minded first impression of it.  Historically, I can appreciate the beauty and artistry in all of his films, but I find that I prefer the films that center more on characters (Kiki's Delivery Service, Whispers of the Heart) as opposed to animals and nature (Mononoke Hime, Porco Rosso).  Therefore, after seeing that this film was more fantasy than reality, I was not in a hurry to see it.Unfortunately, this meant that I missed out on having seen a masterpiece for several months.  Spirited Away, the story of a little girl who must somehow escape from a world inhabited by fantastical characters is as much about her own evolution and strength in character as it is about the incredible creatures that surround her in her new environment.  While Spirited Away is a fairy tale, it is also a lesson in accountability, strength and responsibility. 	 Miyazaki is known for creating strong young female characters that are also completely adorable, but Spirited Away contains some of the most interesting co-stars I have seen in recent memory.  A lamp that not only provides a guiding light, but also happens to hop along on one foot, a giant baby and a bird with the head of an elderly lady are just three of the many eccentric characters we experience.  Not only are the characters and story line rich, but the artistry is absolutely beautiful as well.  The colors and character design are flawless and awe-inspiring.  Even I, the cynical and technical viewer found myself saying `Aww' and smiling at the little soot monsters and the `mouse'.The hype was worth it and the Oscar was well-deserved.  Spirited Away is a beautiful film that really and truly should be experienced, and has the potential of being enjoyed by most, because it has so many layers and imaginative aspects that there will be points of appeal for just about anyone.--Shelly",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
So American yet so Japanese at the same time,"Remniscient of his fellow Japanese animator Satoshi Kon, Hayao Miyazaki offers us a good bath of Japanese folklore, suited in a well edited, fast paced, americanized form of animation. Miyazaki is more than a director, he's a writer. He's that kind of director that never leaves any kind of detail behind in quest to make a movie look over the top. This one was magnificent. Despite being billed as a child movie, well it ain't one, it's one of the most colorful audacious and creative anime ever made.The setting of the plot, from the start, makes room for creativity. Trapped in a spirit world, Chihiro has to grow as a person to fight the dangers on her way back to normality and back to her parents. In an avalanche of obstacles that rivals any literary epic, Chihiro grows a willpower that will go beyond of what she every imagined. Spirited Away is the epitome of true cinema. It exploits the possibilities and the variables that cinema has to offer. Every choice Miyazaki makes for his movie is the good one.

In this film it doesn't seem to have much of the nature mixed in with the plot, though when Chihiro meets the River Spirit he has tons of trash inside of his body, which is what Miyazaki saw in a river my his city while he was walking.

Great characters and story.,"What makes this movie so powerful and great are mainly its characters. The characters are well constructed and are mainly the reason why this movie is so unforgettable. Some of the characters are quite odd looking, even by anime standards but they are so wonderfully constructed that they all become believable.The story is just totally brilliant. It's odd but oh so beautiful. The imaginary world gives the movie a totally unique and beautiful look and feeling. It all helps to make ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" an unique and unforgettable viewing experience. The beauty in the movie is in its unpredictability. Because its so unique and original, you never know what to expect next and everything comes as a pleasant surprise. My only complaint about the story is its love-story, if there even was meant to be one, wasn't really believable and felt underdeveloped and like a missed opportunity.It all is beautiful animated and with lots of eye for detail and I'm talking about both the characters and the imaginary world. It helps to make you believe in the totally imaginary world and the story.The musical score by Joe Hisaishi is just fantastic and fits the movie very well.This is once more another Hayao Miyazaki masterpiece. Once more he has succeeded in creating a unique, original and totally believable world, story and characters.

shallow and unimpressive,"a morbid curiosity usually compels me to finish watching movies that are dull and pointless, but PRINCESS MONONOKE's lack of interestingness had me reaching for the 'eject' button halfway thru. after hearing some of the accolades heaped on SPIRITED AWAY, i thought i'd give miyazaki another spin, and, boy, was i sorry.the movie's moral lessons veer toward the obvious--nothing groundbreakingly profound here--and are presented in an overly drawn-out fashion. here's an incomplete listing of SPIRITED AWAY's nice sentiments:a) don't be a glutton. b) care about your friends. c) look after your parents. d) do not value money above human (or inhuman) relationships. e) work hard, despite the drudgery of it all.now, the story is supposed to impart these valuable lessons by putting the protagonist in a dreamworld setting, where other, more twisted lessons are inextricably (and inexplicably) presented. whether intentional or not, the movie also implies:a) one should trust strangers who lounge about, even if they eat people and later regurgitate them. jeffrey dahmer, anyone? b) one should make pacts with evil persons to get what one wants. c) parents are pigs, and children must will be their salvation. d) people who try to do good things for you now might have done good things for you in the past (perhaps even a past life?), so go ahead and trust them--your instincts will guide you.well, so much for the beautifully inspiring movie everyone seems to be gushing about. . . .speaking of beauty, i never found the animation that impressive: the same jerky, low-frame-rate presentation that plagues japanese anime is found here. (i did enjoy, though, the transformation of the witch into her airborne self--that was the movie's funkiest moment.)and the nonsensical array of creatures inhabiting the world of SPIRITED AWAY reminds me of george lucas at his inane worst.i don't think i'll ever have the itch to watch another miyazaki film again; the dullness and vapidity are just excruciating.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The best animated film in years,"This is probably the best animated film ever, it is powerful an unique and very fun. You definitely should see it, in the movie a little girl is transported to a magical world where her family has been turned into pigs by an evil witch who runs a spirit bath. The little girl must work for the witch and plot ways to get her parents back with the help of some friends she makes. The world she enters is the most incredible world ever conceived and i mean that, If you have not seen other movies the director of this film has made you should they are very very good, some include, Castle in the Sky, Princess Mononoke, Kiki's Delivery service and most recently Howl's Moving castle which is now in theaters any way this is a very good film that you should rent when you get around to it which you probably won't",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Amazing,"About ten minutes into 'Spirited Away' you realise that this movie is going to be totally unlike anything you've ever seen before - even the director's previous movies. Half an hour into the the thing, you feel like you're witnessing some sort of collision between Walt Disney and David Lynch. Put simply, 'Spirited Away' is damn weird - sometimes charmingly weird, sometimes excitingly weird, but sometimes just plain old what the hell is a 'stink spirit', and why does it have a bicycle stuck in its side type weird.If you think that is supposed to be criticism, think again. 'Spirited Away' is every bit as incredible as the most incredible things written about it would have you believe. It simply transports you to a meticulously realised universe of spirits and mythology; a world utterly brimming over with fantastical sights and characters. The realisation of this whole mise-en-scene is a monumental cinematic achievement. You come out of the movie really feeling like you've just spent two hours in some incredible parallel universe.The attention to detail is staggering, the surprises endless (and I just mean every damn camera shot has something in it that will make your jaw drop to one extent or another), and somehow through this barrage of unheralded ideas the central character comes through rock solid, as do all of the supporting ones.That isn't to say that characterisation is the movie's long suite. Perhaps it's just a cultural thing, but it seems to me that even the best Japanimation doesn't _quite_ have the Disney capacity to make you fall in love with the characters. Or perhaps you could argue that Disney is just overly sentimental. In any event this is really the only very slight fault I could find with 'Spirited Away' - and it is slight, because there are scenes, particularly in the latter part of the film, which will bring a lump to your throat.One quibble: people keep saying how much better the animation is in this film than in Disney (well, Disney aren't even doing hand-drawn animation anymore, but you know what I mean.) I think they mean that the backgrounds and drawings are better. The animation - literally the movement from frame to frame of the characters - is not up to top notch Disney standards. Watch a car drive along the road in the early part of the film: it is conspicuously jerky, unlike the smooth panoramic, sweeping animation of Disney in the past decade.However, except in those very early scenes, it isn't very noticeable, and even if you did notice it, you would be so gobsmacked by the amazing, almost poetic backdrops in so many of the scenes that you'd soon forget about it.I guess I've picked a few holes in 'Spirited Away', haven't I?  That's why I'm only giving it a meagre 9.5 out of 10.0.It's a masterpiece. See it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Fun to watch and a fresh look,"Spirited Away is an amazing movie.  I've been getting so used to animation getting increasingly graphically detailed with computer-aided animation (Beauty and the Beast) or computer animation (Pixar stuff) that I forgot how good simple animation can be.  Like much Japanese artwork, a lot can be said with simple strokes of a brush.  Details here are applied to the areas they are required and not where they are unneeded.  This helps focus the eye and alleviates the nonstop detail that tends to numb you after an hour of a Pixar flick (although I love them all too).I loved the creativity of it.  Since I'm a Westerner, it probably seems even more creative and new to me since I'm not used to dragons and spirits. Accordingly, the color palette seemed unique as well which made the movie seem fresh.I'll agree with what others said about the movie being more of an uncontrolled wild ride rather than a plot, but that was OK for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

enchanting,"A wonderful, wonderful movie! You don't often see movies that fill you with warmth and happiness. This is one of them though. I had not too high (but not low) expectations of an animated Japanese movie, but I was soon charmed by the brave little girl Chihiro and fascinated and swept away by her adventures. The characters are complex and there are mysteries that don't get explained in the movie, which is nice for a change. In most children's movies we get to see these days, every thing is laid out bite-sized, and nothing is left unexplained. Spirited away is much more daring in that respect. And with right: children do not need to see everything explained, they can enjoy a story just as much if it is mysterious.I give this movie a 10 because it managed to transport me to a fairy tale world and bring me back happy and content. I still think of it at times, even though it was a while back I saw it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Respectable but very confusing,"First of all I am American and I haven't watched anime in the past. I wanted to see this movie because of its great reviews and resilience over the years. All together it was a very interesting film. I loved the score, the visual effects were stunning. There were scenes where I felt I was watching a Claude Monet painting. Stunning and very very creative. Even the characters developed beautifully. My biggest problem with the film was the randomness of the story. Granted I know nearly nothing about Japanese folk lore. The story was all over the place with random ""side missions"" that some how ended up helping the girl reach her goals. A lot of things that happened seemed to fall into place too perfectly. But we are talking about a film where a girl enters a magical spirit world so maybe it's not that hard to believe. Overall I think it deserves the recognition that it gets. It's fun to watch a movie that isn't made for my type of person that is still enjoyable to experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

A film Disney should learn lessons from,"My previous experience with Studio Ghibli began and ended with 'My Neighbour Totoro' but upon seeing the fantastic 'Spirited Away', I feel as if a whole new world of anime and Hayao Miyazaki has just opened up to me. Until now, apart from the odd Disney flick and, of course, 'My Neighbour Totoro', I had long consigned animation to childhood but this film is a perfect example of how how rich and diverse even an animated film can be.'Spirited Away' centres on ten-year-old Chihiro, a little Japanese girl who accidentally stumbles upon the Spirit World while exploring a mysterious passageway with her parents. When her parents are turned into pigs for stealing food, it falls to young Chirhiro and Haku, her guide in this strange new world, to save them before they become bacon. Not only are the characters well-depicted and engaging (with a few adorable little creatures added in to gush over!) but the story is very involving. During Chihiro's quest, not only do we see she and Haku grew as characters but we learn much about Japanese mythology and the moral of how not everything is as it seems. The atmospheric and other-worldly quality of the film leaves the audience feeling as if they too have joined the young heroine in this strange new land where the impossible seems possible.Although this film will no doubt appeal to young children who will easily identify with Chihiro, there is a dark air to 'Spirited Away' that will draw in teenagers and adults. Certainly, older viewers will be left awe-struck by the intelligence and strength of the plot and the characters. Highly recommended to anime fans and those who are just looking for a film that is unique and interesting.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Great one,"Rightfully named the greatest Japanese animation director, Miyazaki delivers again. This movie is definitely his masterpiece. Every single aspect (at least the good ones!) that you could possibly imagine is present and accounted for.After seeing Princess Mononoke, I sincerely believe Miyazaki to be gifted. Be careful in making wrong judgments just because it's an animation (hence a ""kid's movie"" according with the stereotypes); trust me, this movie will puzzle you beyond reason and it's much more effective in doing so than 99% of the so called ""real"" movies. Real life has never been so well depicted.. the story is pure fantasy, but the feelings, speeches, reactions are genuinely human.Perhaps most of you don't know (or just don't care), but every great hero/leader had his doubts, disbelieves and moments of weakness. What made them great, was not the absence of such feelings, but the will power to move forward when every single bone in their body told them to run for cover...And that, my friends, is exactly what this movie is all about.See it. I promise you it's time well spent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

The characters were given an abundance of individuality which colored the story with further brilliance. Over all, a classic animation for all ages, which deserves every ounce of praise that is given to it. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to set their imaginations free into the limitless world of fantasy, where there is always a sense of blissful escape from the rough reality around us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Simply Excellent,"Spirited Away is one of those movies that leaves you with a lingering sense of wonder and happiness as the credits roll. It is one of a handful of movies that after the first viewing, I'm ready and willing to watch it again immediately. I am not an anime fan; I watched this simply due to the rave reviews, and I'm so happy that I did. The only problem now is getting others to watch it (""I HATE anime!"" they usually reply.)This is not the anime I thought it would be... ie., no exclamation marks flying from characters' heads, or giant eyes or overly-dramatic reactions. It's much different from the Cartoon Network anime you might catch as you flip channels. It's a real art form. There were moments of beauty that I can't describe, like the camera soaring over the water-covered railroad tracks with the setting sun reflecting off the water.I don't recommend movies on a whim; showing a person a movie is like giving them a gift, so I'm always careful about what movies I show to certain people; I can't think of a single person to whom I wouldn't want to show Spirited Away.If you let yourself get caught up in the magic, it is a magical experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Spirited in So Many Ways...,"Hayao Miyazaki does it again, but much better then his previous Princess Mononoke. Spirited Away is a highly imaginative movie that does things that you can only find in the best children's fantasy books, but don't let that stop you if your an adult. At over 2 hours, it's epic-like, and requires a bit of attention.(And besides, there's a chunk or two of some scary parts that would give a 7 year old nightmares)It follows the adventures of a young girl, Chihiro, in a spirit world, where she must fight to save her parents. Consequently, she must then look for work, as it is the only way she could survive in this other world. But the type of job that she will handle isn't going to be easy, and she will have to prove herself more then once. The characters she meets are so full of life, so amusing and colorful, it's hard to peel your eyes from the screen because you might miss something pretty amazing. It reminded me of Never Ending Story, Alice in Wonderland, and perhaps Time Bandits, and yet, it's completely original.It's gorgeous to look at. Just as you think you will see the same thing on the next scene, it gets more dramatic, and the colors are handled beautifully. The dubbing is outstanding. And the movie stayed with me long after I saw it. It's a shame that Disney, who's distributing this in the US over from Japan, doesn't push this movie more. As of this writing, it's open in very few theaters, even though it's made millions outside BEFORE it came to the US. Regardless, this is a movie that you should hunt for and travel to go see.

An absolute must-see. Amazingly fabulous!!,"I have seen many anime movies made by Hayao Miyazaki, such as PRINCESS MONONOKE, NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF WIND, LAPUTA: CASTLE IN THE SKY, etc. He's movies are all very meaningful and there's no word to describe how I feel watching these movies! He's just that good. While FEW PEOPLE may think it's not a good movie, it's only because they don't understand it. They have no clue about Japanese culture and they aren't very open-minded about it either. After seening all these anime movies, my desire to know everything about Japanese only increases.All Miyazaki's films are wonderful and special, and each of them have deep meanings which only those who try to see it will understand the point of the movies.Spirited Away has colorful, and extremely detailed arts in it, and the characters and their actions made them seem so real! It is a movie about how an immature, ten-year-old girl who, by accident, got into the spirit world with her parents, whom are turned into pigs because of greed. In order to save them, she must become a worker in the bathhouse for Gods. Throughout the movie, you meet interesting and fun characters, such as the tiny dust balls, they're just so cute! Chihiro, the little girl, must learn to be strong in order to survive and rescue her parents with the help of a dragon boy, Haku. The movie is really wonderful and I have seen it many times.I'm really sad to hear from some people that he's not going to produce any of his own anime films any longer. (They are so good!)

You'll leave the theater feeling eight years old.Yet giggling at mystical creatures' cuteness doesn't begin to fully define this movie's depth.

Great,"I normally dislike anime as an animation style (one of the only animation styles is don't like actually). However, this movie is great.

Amazingly sensitive and imaginative,"I only recently saw Spirited Away and I was extremely pleased with it. I searched out some of the negative comments out of curiosity to see what possibly could some people NOT like about this movie. Most reasons pointed to the lack of character development and the lack of a real story that made sense. In other words they expected something that fits perfectly together as often happens in all Disney movies. Not to say that Disney movies are bad, they're just different, they're very simplistic and offer nothing more than an hour's worth of entertainment. Spirited Away blew me away, all the motifs were portrayed so carefully and subtly and with such amazing animation visuals. It combined elements of many classical popular stories that I myself was familiar with and thus able to enjoy. It is probable that individuals exposed only to the Disney ""culture"" which comes very very close to no culture at all is negatively surprised by this movie. For everybody else who is familiar with coming of age stories, and other stories rich with fables and with lessons will see the lessons and motifs portrayed in Spirited Away and will not JUST look for a plot line and character development, but will see beyond that to discover that the plot was fantastic and there was also plenty of character development.

Miyazaki's Latest Masterpiece,"Well, what a surprise; ""Miyazaki"" and ""masterpiece"" together in an affirmative sentence.  Spirited Away marks Miyazaki's first work as a semi-retired director, though the movie doesn't suffer from it in the least. Spirited Away is about a young girl gets lost in a world of ghosts and spirits and is forced to work at the bath house for specters.  Any fan of Miyazaki will instantly fall in love with this movie.  Don't be fooled by Disney's involvement or the fact that it's animated.  It's still very much anime, but not anime for anyone.  This is a good movie for young children and those who have a timeless love for movies.  If you're the kind of person who still loves Toy Story, for example, then this will become another one of your favorites.  People who are only into anime like Ninja Scroll and Cowboy Beebop, this may not be the movie for you.  This is a movie for those who love anime of all kinds, like myself.

This is the world of children coming into their own in the world -- the real world is equally an environment where they must discover rules, discover who holds power, discover their own virtue and honor.Spirited Away simply gives us a fantasy setting for the reality of a child.This is a visually lovely, imaginative, intelligent film that will please people of all ages (perhaps above six or so -- some of the kami may be too odd and scary for small children).It is a favorite for me, and for my 9 year old son Joseph.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Best animated film-ever.,"Up until the time I viewed this film, I equated the phrase ""Japanese animation"" with phrases like ""Pokemon,"" ""Digimon,"" and other ""mon's,"" that made me want to vomit. Hayao Miyazaki has really opened my eyes and made me realize just how wrong I really was.The story opens with our hero, Chihiro, an apathetic, whiny little brat voiced brilliantly by Daveigh Chase, as she's moving to a new house. Her parents (Lauren Holly, Michael Chiklis) make a classic, horror-movie boo-boo by taking an alternate path. This lands them an abandoned amusement park. Chihiro wanders off. She then finds that what seems to be an amusement park is, in actuality, a bathhouse for the gods, and her parents, having helped themselves to the local buffet, have been turned into pigs. Left to her own devices, she has to give herself a personality overhaul in order to survive. Along the way, she meets colorful characters, such as Yubaba (voiced by Suzanne Pleschette,) her good-natured lackey Haku (James Marsden)and one of the cleaning girls (Susan Egan.) Miyazaki, who gave us films like Princess Mononoke and Porco Rosso, has given us what could very possibly be the greatest animated film, ever. Complete with rich, well-rounded characters and breath-taking animation, this could aptly be described as a modern day Alice in Wonderland.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
It really was good!,"The tale of the Chihiro, the small girl who finds her self in a strange and daunting spirit world working to save her parents and return them all to the world from which they have come. Not knowingly seen or heard of Miyazaki's work before ( although it takes a few times for a name to penetrate my consciousness), I was without preconceptions about the film apart from my friend's ""It's really good!"" as she handed the DVD to me as a birthday present. I have to agree with her. This film rocked. Appealing, I should say to many age groups, (I saw it with my mum and some 30 something year old friends), it in turn scared, startled, moved me, made me smile and laugh and warmed the deepest cockless of my heart. This has everything from adventure and mythology(Japanese of course) to friendship and love. I was with the little girl and her friends every step of the way. It is a bizzare film but very watchable and completely enchanting. The animation is much softer than the usual Japanese Manga style of cartoon, and the tale certainly not as bloody. (Barely bloody at all) I saw the American dubbed version and the Japanese, subtitled version one after the other, and I prefered the latter. A good film, when well subtitled, leaves you with the feeling of actually having heard the characters say the words in English, and this was the case with this film. The translation in the 2 versions were not the same and to me some of the subtleties in the Japanese version were lost in the American version were there was the added pressure of having to syncronise the words to(cartoon)lip movement. There were also some cultural adaptions from the Japanese version to better suit an American audience, which I prefered without.  Having said that, the American(English) version stands successfully in it's own right. My friends(& mum)who only watched the American version thoroughly enjoyed it. The DVD extras such as interviews with Miyazaki and the American director/producer? and the lead up to the Japanese release made fun watching too. Some of it just to get a little peek into the life/hard work/mad stresses behind making the film. I gave it a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Nonsensical average childish movie.,"Sorry but I don't see the reason of the enthusiasm for this movie. The history line has no head or feet, the escatological scenes get tiresome, the ending is facile and predictable and even hurried. In general it reminds one of the countless drivel that Manga aficionados are so fond of, one more of the apparently unending carbon-copy characters that we have got used to.The movie has a hint of pretentiousness that never really catches on, at the end is more of the same weird idiomatics that every single manga caricature has used to the point of exhaustion: the perfect girl with no fault on her character, the absent parents, the hero that saves her (and that in a convoluted turn of events has saved her before) and the loads of wackos that look mostly repulsive.It is an OK movie for children with strong stomachs (I wonder if their attention could be fixed for this long) but as a cinematographic experience it lacks all the ingredients of a respectable movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Beautifully animated story with good characters and fantastic story of love and friendship,"While on their way to their new house in a new town, Chihiro and her parents take a short cut down a side road and come to a dead end with a dark passage way in a wall.  Despite her fears, Chihiro goes with her parents to see where it leads.  They come out in open space where they find what looks like an abandoned theme park.  Chihiro's parents find a stall with lots of food prepared and start to eat while Chihiro refuses and goes to investigate a working bath house.  As it suddenly gets dark she goes back to her parents to find they have been turned into pigs and suddenly shadows draw over the stalls.  Chihiro hides with the help of a boy called Haku.  He helps her to stay in the bathhouse by getting her a job (as dictated by Yubaba) and she settles into the resort for Japan's gods and spirits.  However she still must work out a way of getting her parents back before they grow fat and are eaten.The first I had heard of this film was when it won the Oscar (sadly this was the one part of my combination bet that I had got wrong and hence won nothing).  Since then the film has had world-wide promotion and arrived in the UK several years after it had first been shown.  Despite the worrying `Walt Disney' legend at the front of the credits, this is very much a Miyazaki film and the mouse has not turned it into something else.  My second worry was that the American team involved in the version I saw would bring out sarcasm in the same way as they (Lasseter) does in things like Monsters Inc etc.  I enjoy that style of humour but `Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi' was much better than just that.The plot involves the quest to recover Chihiro's parents from a spell that made them pigs, but the world in which the film is set is what makes it so enjoyable.  The world is imaginative and filled with all sorts of characters. Chihiro's journey explores themes of understanding, trust and friendship  all around the central quest, and in this way it is good that some parents I know have been taking their kids to see this film even if it isn't tied into a Happy Meal marketing campaign.  The characters are all pretty well developed and are interesting.  Chihiro is afraid but brings bravery from inside herself, Haku is a mystery but appears trustworthy, the mysterious noface could be a friend or foe.  What the film doesn't have is characters who do nothing  they all drive the story forward or provide the comic relief in some way.The American cast do good jobs dubbing the characters.  Usually dubbed films are so poor that I always seek out subtitles, however here the job was as it were meant.  Chase is very good in one of her two Oscar nominated films that year and Mardsen has much more to do than in the X-Men films!  Support voices are all good and involve plenty of recognisable voices such as Chiklis, Holly, Ratzenberger and Stiers.The film is a lot more accessible than much anime  sure there are still monsters and spirits but there are no major battles and way out visuals to deal with, kids can watch this (and should).  In fact I did quite like the simplicity of the tale.  Whereas kids movies recently tend towards the more sarcastic, cruel humour as much for adults, here the film is more about spirit (no pun) and moral courage.  It is also worth noting that, although there is magic, this is not some spectacle film like Harry Potter  Chihiro uses her brain and her heart to deal with things, not spells.The animation is fantastic  while CGI has been used, it never feels as totally computerised as Monster Inc etc does.  This isn't BETTER because it was hand drawn but it does fell a lot warmer and a lot more recognisable in terms of style.  The use of both techniques gives much to the look of the film.  As always the world and the characters come to life on the screen and are fantastic, creepy and beautiful all at once.I don't mean to gush but I did enjoy this film for all it's simplistic plotting.  The quest is a straightforward plot device and would be a problem if that's all this film had to offer.  Happily the central story is supported by characters who are wonderfully drawn (both animated and developed) and set in a world that is visually impressive and imaginative.

I can't help but feel there has been a blatantly mishandled distribution strategy for this film in the US of A.Despite its near 100% critical praises and its massive US$200 million box office take even before its American release, Spirited Away is still playing in less than 100 theatres nation wide, which caused it to undeservedly languish in the lower reaches of the American movie charts even as we speak.There has been much speculative criticism over Disney conspiratorial mishandling of Mayazaki's last film, the classic Princess Mononoke. It has since been disproved as an urban legend and the benefit of the doubt was given to Disney. How could it be possible that a company like Disney would willingly sacrifice profits for a greater aim of secretly smothering Mayazaki films for fear of adversely affecting its own vault of animated films?Sadly, the present state for ""Spirited Away"" will definitely be re-surrecting this previously dispelled conspiracy theory. Unless the marketing/ distribution strategy for Spirited Away is revamped completely (i.e. a massive `Toy Story like' promotional campaign followed by a well deserved wide release relaunch), this lingering tainted image for the mouse company and Hollywood at large will likely remain.You heard it here first. Expose Hollywood for what it is, a sinister oligopolistic business enterprise with hidden agendas of buying up distribution and remake rights of worthy Asian films, so as to smother them and minimise their chances of American success, thereby safeguarding their own selfish financial and market interest.Its so disgustingly evil it makes me sick.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One of the best anime's i have ever seen.,"This movie is wonderful, and it really made me respect Hayao Miyazaki as a person and as a director.I love his movies, but i think this is his best work for the reason that this is a spectacular anime, that i love to watch.I always try to figure out what his best movie is or what my favorite Hayao Miyazaki movie is, but i am gonna say spirited away is his best work and really blew me away.It has great animation and it is one of the most original anime films out there, so i think he just showed how good he is with this movie.If you are a anime fan, then i think you should like this movie a lot and once you see one of Hayao Miyazaki's movies.It is like you have to see them all, this is a excellent anime that is done perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Strange, yet satisfying","Spirited away is a movie which can only truly be described a Wack! Yes I know this is not a word and I understand it is not even proper English however it is the only term which can thoroughly describe the movie. It is a film which is immensely entertaining and full of scenes which are just playing fun to watch. However, you must be warned. In between the incredibly detailed animations, there is an almost never ending mythological plot (this lack of realism irked some of my friends). There are creatures and monsters, heroes and villains, none of which are as they first appear. It has everything a movie should have however there is no guarantee you will like it. If Spirited away has one fault it is its length. At 2 hours it is a killer for those with short attention spans (I did however make it through and in the end was glad I did). When going into the movie if you can go in with an open mind purely with the desire to be entertained then spirited away is a movie well worth seeing; however, if you are one to find fantasy and cartoons dull and nonsensical then find another movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

I can't stop watching this movie,"I don't tell you this particularly to sell the movie, but maybe to come to grips with how utterly HAUNTING this movie is to me, and I'm still trying to figure out why.  I bought the DVD before I'd ever seen it (and didn't even watch it for a few days), but once I hit ""Play"" I've been hooked ever since. I have trouble going three days without watching it, and I'm enlisting my friends to watch the movie, but secretly so that I can have an excuse to watch it again.  I'll watch it dubbed or subtitled, it doesn't matter. I'm sick, and I don't want to get well.Story?  Great.  Animation?  Stellar.  But that shouldn't be enough to enslave me to Miyazaki's vision.  What then keeps me coming back?  Well, I have one theory...There's something about Chihiro that is utterly real, moreso than an in-the-flesh actress, even.  The way she runs, or cries, or sulks, or clings to her mother, I don't know how Miyazaki captured it all, but as Chihiro grows, I feel like I'm growing with her.  To me, that's why it's cheap to compare SA to Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland; Dorothy and Alice are flat characters, while Chihiro is in my eyes a genuine 10-year-old child. My heart roots for Chihiro.Yeah, maybe I'm lame, but I'll tell you this.  When I think about Hollywood's cookie-cutter punchline movies these days, I barely even feel temptation to attend.

...this movie will take you places that you'll find hard to leave...,"I loved this movie. It allowed me to relive the wonder and edge-of-your-seat-excitement I experienced in my childhood when I watched another similar movie, The Neverending Story (Die Unendliche Geschichte). Watching Spirited Away awakened in my an almost insatiable appetite to see Neverending Story again. Although, unlike Miyazaki wondrous creation, it's German and older, although it's not animated and the special fx are a bit ""dated"", although it's about the coming of age of a little boy and not a little girl, the two movies are so much alike that when I watched it I had the feeling that Miyazaki's masterpiece is in fact the actualized Japanese version  of this movie... The escapist premise is essentially identical: 2 children find an exit door from the mundane, from the rollerink, one through a hallway in an crying citadel, the other through a book. Both have parents too absorbed by themselves and their problems who don't have enough time for their kids' problems. In both movies self-sacrifice is a condition for survival and return to the real world. And let us not forget the friendly flying dragon which appears in both movies and is in essence a spermatozoid with the head of a labrador golden retriever... ;^) Still, I have to admit that while the Neverending Story's symbols are quite accessible, Miyazaki's symbols are much more vague. German clarity permeates through Neverending Story, while the Japanese coexistence of sharp contrasts is prevalent in Spirited Away. Still, both are colossal monuments dedicated to imagination and creativity, and if that's what you like, you shouldn't skip watching this movie!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
a excellent masterpiece!!!,This movie was touching when I saw it.. I believe this film has taken a lot of breath out of Miyazaki and well it certainly took mine.

Entertaining Enough To Get Away With The Length,"How many people can sit through a 120-minute animated film? That's normally just too long for that genre. However, this one could meet that challenge.

It also had some wild characters and a bit of humor here and there, which helped. Overall, a good mix of good and evil and a different kind of story.Being it's Japanese, you are going to get some different theology than you are accustomed to in the West (""the spirits of the wind and water have healed you,"" etc.) but it's not presented in a heavy-handed manner.I was concerned early on as the young girl - the main character in the film - had a shrill voice that was not pleasant but she calmed down after the first part of the film.Overall, entertaining and worth several looks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Spirited Away review: Sending Mixed Signals,"In Spirited Away, Hayao Miyazaki creates a color-saturated world filled with interesting characters, magical creatures. The colors in the movie are stunning in their variety. The movie's animator has an interesting way of showing light and shadow, making it seem more cinematic than cartoonish, and Miyasaki shows a great attention to detail in every image he creates. The movie centers on Chihiro, who is a whiny, sullen girl whose family is moving. Chihiro does not want to move, and she makes her opinions well-known. Her whining does not stop when her father decides to take a shortcut to their new home and encounters what he believes to be an abandoned theme park, which is really a bathhouse for spirits to get away to. Chihiro is essentially orphaned in the spirit world when her parents partake of some food that's been left out in preparation for the ghostly guests, and the parents' greed turns them, quite literally, into pigs. It is interesting that Chihiro is the one who warns her family to not go into this seemingly abandoned place and to not eat the food because the viewer believes that Chihiro is just being surly and childish, when really it appears that she has had some special insight (another image of the child as seer). She has not been turned into a pig, and it is her quick thinking and the help of a stranger that just might help her family get out of the mess they have fallen into. Chihiro must then grow up quickly, start becoming more courageous, showing strength and determination. The movie seems to be imparting some very specific lessons to its viewers. Indeed, there is a big focus on manners, ""Aren't' you even going to knock? You're the most pathetic girl I've ever seen"" is one of the lines uttered, and ""Anyone can see you are a lazy, spoiled brat with no manners,"" is another telling piece of dialogue. Chihiro is constantly being reminded to say ""yes, ma'am"" and ""no, ma'am."" Additionally, Chihiro's gluttonous parents get turned into pigs for their mistakes. Also, greedy people get eaten by the dark spirit that crashes the bath house. The movie, however, does seem to send somewhat of a mixed message because Chihiro appears to be bratty when she complains that her parents shouldn't stop when they do, and yet she is right that they shouldn't have trespassed and that they should have stayed away from food that wasn't meant for them. On the other hand, through her experiences in the spirit world, she matures, becoming more self-sufficient, empathetic, and responsible. She is only able to achieve these great human characteristics because her parents have failed to follow the very codes the movie seems to be promoting, like respect and restraint.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"dazzling, mysterious, and touching","Some movies you just have to see to believe.  Spirited Away is one of them. Now I'm something of an anime/manga fan, but my wife is definitely not, and she LOVED this movie.  My young son also has become something of a Miyazaki fan, thanks to the DVDs of his movies.  (We now give a rousing ""Studio Ghibli"" cheer at the beginning of this and other Miyazaki films.)My wife and I saw Spirited Away in a theatre, and unlike some japanimation I've seen, this does belong on a large screen.  However, it might be too intense for younger viewers.  It translates quite well to DVD, so no complaints there, but the amazing color pallete and generally high artistic quality deserve a vivid presentation.I've heard and read complaints that some of the themes were too culturally-specific, that it would be impossible for an American unversed in Japanese mythology to understand the film.  Well, that suits me just fine; I rather like the sense of strangeness that comes with not quite knowing how all the themes tie together.  Perhaps it helped me identify with the main character, Chihiro, who as a young girl used to a technological society certainly isn't in a position to know the details of bathhouses for spirits.I really enjoyed the notion that if one goes just a little off the beaten track of modern Japan, one finds beautifully anachronistic spirit worlds. Fortunately, we didn't have to go too far afield to find Miyazaki's beautiful flight of fancy.  This film succeeds as a morality play on the pitfalls of carelessness and greed, as a comment on the persistence of deep cultural roots despite technological homogenization, and as an inspirational fairy tale of a girl who has to accept her extremely peculiar lot for the sake of her family.Impressive. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

It's a little bit dramatic, but you won't get down of it. It's some fantasy. There are creatures in it, like ghost. You won't see the difference between good and evil, 'cause the line between that is really vague. Some things look bad, but are good. It's a film who's loved by young and old. Even adults can enjoy the deep lying thoughts in it. I really recommit this. If you have watched this and liked it, but want some more action, you can try Princess Mononoke.

Spirited away is certainly one of the most surreal and beautiful films I've seen,"Spirited Away - Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi - 2001 Every year there's a handful of films that manage to take flight and cross international boundaries with massive success and translate to a truly international audience. In 2003 Hayao Miyazaki's Animated Masterpiece, Spirited Away, washed up on British shores to an audience who took it in and loved it as the beautiful ghost world tale it was meant to be. This is an 'Alice in Wonderland' like tale, of a young girl who's parents are turned in to pigs while exploring and enjoying the cuisine of a seemingly abandoned theme park. Chihiro remains trapped in this theme park, that after darkness, becomes a surreal world belonging to a collection of ghost and beasts. Chihiro settles down as best she can in this parallel word, as she befriends many characters, and searches for her parents. While the story line may be a little disjointed, the visual imagery of this film makes up for any faults. From the eccentric and eclectic characters, to the serene and stunning landscapes through which Chihiro journeys. This is thanks mainly to the fact that Miyazaki has combined hand drawn and computerised animation, to good effect. It successfully presents a film in a medium usually reserved for kids, but makes it encapsulating for both adult and child alike. Spirited away is certainly one of the most surreal and beautiful films I've seen. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

One of the best movies in the galaxy,"Wow. Just wow. I'm completely blown away by how amazing this film was. For a while now I've had an urge to watch it even though I had no clear idea of what it was. I was under the impression that it was a present-day Anime version of Alice in Wonderland. Lucky me it turned out to be completely different considering I can't stand Alice in Wonderland.I think the most prominent reason why this movie hits you so deeply is because its real. If I wasn't constantly thinking ""Oh my gosh, the animation is so beautiful..."" I probably would have forgotten its cartoon-status completely. Little things like the way Chihiro's hair moved when she walked, the expressions and body language put forth from everyone. I can hardly believe that the artists were able to capture that.Then there's the story, which is just magical beyond all belief. I started watching this movie at midnight and sat quietly on my bed, spell-bound, for the next two hours as the movie played out. I've never watched a movie that could hold me so avidly the entire time.Of course you have to comment on the whole spiritual journey Chihiro goes through while she is on her physical journey. Essentially, she starts out as an annoying brat and ends up as a less annoying not-really-a-brat. That sounds pretty negative, but Chihiro was a little annoying sometimes. Then again, kids her age do tend to annoy me in real life so she was obviously portrayed realistically. Oh well, you have to love her anyway.This was a magnificent movie.

So when a friend threw a copy of Spirited Away in my hands and said, ""You've gotta watch this!"" I was less than thrilled, but decided to give it a try.I'm glad I did.The little girl in the movie is made to seem very real. She has all the mannerisms and quirks of a normal, bratty little girl. She is suddenly cast into a surreal world of spirits in which she must be brave and take care of herself.The unique characters and fascinating artwork make this fun to watch. These aren't your stereotypical cutesy anime characters either. The film really branches out and has diverse characters that keep you guessing.If I can think of anything negative about this movie, it might have run on a few minutes too long, but that's a small point, and can easily be overlooked.So, I'm still not going to rush out and watch all the anime films I can, but for those of you who (like me) have decided that you don't care for anime, allow this to be the rare exception.9 of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
I rarely feel like watching a movie again straight after.,"I either post a review when i loathe a film, or feel a film has been unfairly dissed.. but in this case it's because i completely adored it.I think Miyazaki is a genius, i really do, people compare the story to Wizard Of Oz or Alice In Wonderland, and they are very similar in content, a fantastic new world, and a young girl who must learn more about herself and others to leave, and just like those 2 stories this one if FULL of imagination, every single minute is filled with something new and fresh, borrowing from Japanese mythology as well as Miyazaki's previous creations (i.e. the adorable soot creatures), it ranges from the surreal to the sublime. The story can be written on a post it note, yet my biggest flaw with the film is that is a good half hour too short! i simply didn't want the film to stop.. but i suppose that was the whole point of being spirited away...I think there are people who might find things a bit too wierd and tripped out, but they can't deny the overall message of the film, it isn't some huge life changing event that the hype makes it feel to be, it is just one of the most amazing films ever made, there is a beautiful subtlely to it all.. it doesn't have some mad epic grandouise adventure plot, there are no mega set pieces, no songs or big numbers, the film is mostly set in one building, there are times when you don't know where the story is going, or if there is any.. but this is a common feeling in Miyazaki films, they aren't about getting those pre-set highs or step by step film structure.. they are more about escaping to another world and being a part of it.. which is in my mind the greatest single thing a film or book can do... and this film achieves it, by the end you will be moved, maybe not to streaming tears, but you will feel something..this film will mean something to everyone! a genuine masterpiece :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Spirited Away is the crowning jewel in Japanese animation legend's career,"JAPANESE anime, with its stylish combination of post-apocalyptic visions, babes, violence and gore, has broken from cult status to mainstream outside of Japan in recent years.But viewers expecting the usual dose of babes and bombs will get a surprise in Spirited Away. This animated movie, the highest-grossing in Japanese film history, is written and directed by the best-kept secret of Japanese animation - the legendary Hayao Miyazaki.His unique blend of restrained pastoral scenes, lushly rendered in traditional hand-drawn animation style, and stories flavoured with a strong social conscience, presents a more lyrical side of Japanese animation.Four years in the making, Spirited Away is destined for classic status.The heroine of the story is 10-year-old Chihiro. When the movie opens, she is sulking in the back of her family car as they are on their way to a new home. Things take a strange turn, however, when her father drives into an overgrown lane that takes the family to what seems to be a deserted theme park.Chihiro's parents help themselves to some food, and are turned into pigs. And she finds herself trapped in an alternate world ruled by the evil sorceress Yubaba.Forced to be independent, Chihiro survives by working in Yubaba's exotic bath house, patronised by Japanese gods. She is aided in her quest to cure her parents by Haku, a human boy who is Yubaba's magical apprentice.The story follows the usual template of children's stories where a young protagonist learns resourcefulness in a crisis and matures into a better person.Chihiro's plight is familiar to those who have read Alice In Wonderland and The Wizard Of Oz. The sorceress Yubaba bears a distinct resemblance to the Russian folk witch Baba Yaga.But told in true Miyazaki style, Spirited Away unfolds like a magical carpet ride through the man's generous imagination.The first lure is, quite simply, tactile. Miyazaki's hand-drawn style is lusciously detailed, providing a dizzying treat for the eyes.The theme park boasts authentic architecture from various periods of Japanese history. The bath house brims with gorgeous interiors. And the lovingly-created, entirely charming gods and monsters who totter around this magical world put Pokemon's assembly-line crude scratchings to shame.But above and beyond the visual splendour, Miyazaki is a storyteller non-pareil.Chihiro's emotional journey is told with sensitivity and her character develops with an authentic ring of heartfelt truthfulness that would be admirable in a live action movie, and doubly amazing an accomplishment in an animated movie.Miyazaki is often compared to Walt Disney by a Western press looking for a convenient soundbite introduction.Although there are truly hilarious comedic bits in this movie as well as sidekicks aplenty, there is nary a singing teapot in shouting distance. The only music is a poetic folk song - just a voice with a samisen accompaniment worth sitting through the end credits for.What has earned Miyazaki a loyal adult following is also the fact that his movies are thinly-disguised allegories. His last movie, Princess Mononoke, was a fable with an ecological message.Spirited Away comments on everything from a forgotten Japan - the old world filled with gods, manners and more gracious customs - to the new materialism - represented by the No Face monster, plagued by insecurity and loneliness, who buys friendship with gold.But these metaphors are handled with subtle delicacy, so that they can either be ignored at no expense to the story, or read for enrichment to the tale's already strong emotional core.Miyazaki's movies are anchored in Japanese animist beliefs, flavoured by the culture and history of the country and steeped in its minimalist aesthetic.This last aspect has perhaps denied Miyazaki the mass appeal he so richly deserves. In a world brought up on the frenetic pacing and exploding shades of a Technicolored, Dolby-surround sound musical Disney world, Miyazaki's muted lyricism and gentle pacing takes getting used to.But allow yourself to be spirited away, and there are great rewards in store. You will not regret this trip.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
I didn't get it at first but then I saw it again.,"While Nausicaa is better this movie is a vast monument in animation. Therefor I find it an insult when people say something like Ice Age is better. sure Ice Age has pretty visuals but it does not have the depth and spirituality of Spirited Away.However I cannot really blame most comments since most people don't really know Japanese culture other than Sushi, hightech gadgets,  Dragonball Z and Pokemon.The thing with Spirited Away is that it delves deep into the spiritual side of Japanese culture. To Japanese people all things contain spirits. Hence all the gods and spirits in this movie. there's a lot of symbolism in this movie as well. And a lot of life lessons.And what I find really important: it doesn't try to be a kiddy movie but more a family movie. Western people often seem to view animation as something only for kids. In Japan this is simply not true. Animation is for everyone. It provides an escape and a way to create outragious stories that would not have been able to be created through normal film.i love it. I found it hard at first but after seeing it again all the puzzle pieces fell into place.Still I do have some isues with the film. Actually only 1. the ending was too swift. It should have been worked out a little bit more.Other than that wonderful wonderful movie.oh and btw (comment to one reviewer) watch the original japanese language version with subtitles.

The Best Movie I've Ever Seen,"I give this movie a ten for a lot of reasons. First of, Spirited Away is about a girl named Chihiro who goes thru a tunnel and finds herself in a world full of spirits, witches, and people who can transmit themselves into different creatures. It's also about the love between two kids who save each other's life in different times and places.I have seen this movie when it first came out on DVD, and even now I'll say it's the best movie I've ever seen in my whole life. I still have the DVD packed right in my room in a place I'll remember where it is so I can watch it over and over again.Spirited Away is kind of one of those movies that at the end you have this gulp in your throat and how many times you watch it, you'll want to cry. Well in my opinion, I say this movie is better than the Titanic.I really recommend this movie for everyone to see, no matter what age you are (take me as an example) because this is definitely a good movie by Miyazaki.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
magic and wonder,"Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino is a spoiled unhappy girl moving with her parents to the countryside.

She's too late and the dry riverbed becomes a vast river. The park becomes inhabited by spirits. Haku sends her to boiler-man Kamaji and tells her to beg for a job with the ruthless witch Yubaba who runs the magical bathhouse.This is possibly the first Hayao Miyazaki I saw and in my opinion still his best.

Needs a better story,"SPIRITED AWAY is a well-regarded Studio Ghibli animation about a young girl's adventures in a fantastic netherworld filled with all manner of strange and terrifying creations. While it packs more imagination into one movie than ten Disney cartoons, it feels a little aimless and meandering, in search of a decent storyline to go along with the madcap creations.In terms of visual spectacle, at times this is as good as it gets for an anime: every scene features all kind of kooky, uniquely-crafted monsters and creatures. My favourite has to be the three bouncing heads. Unfortunately, the protagonist - a sullen little girl - turns out to be rather irritating and her journey to greater understanding is slow and over obvious.I'm inclined to like these Ghibli movies, but SPIRITED AWAY is no classic; it starts well and tails off, with a stodgy middle and better ending. So far, my favourites are those that take place in the 'real' world - like GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES and PONYO - rather than those that exist in a fantasy landscape, like this and the overrated PRINCESS MONONOKE.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Over-hyped, over-rated","Why?  Why do so many people hold this very average film on such a high pedestal?  Being quite a big fan of Anime I'm not new to the genre.  This was a serious head f***.  I will say the production design, use of color and music score were amazing.  However, in terms of plot, story structure, catharsis, plant and pay off...it's all over the place.  I felt the world had no rules to it and therefore lacked any real tension.  I felt the story lacked any logic to it and therefore had no reason behind the motivation for characters.  Why did she do that? What is that supposed to be?  What was that all about? When will this end or start making sense?  With so many positive reviews and awards I'm confused.  Perhaps I just didn't get what others got from it...  All I have to back me up is the crowd of friends with whom I went to see the film with.  And I'm the one who had the most positive words to say about it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Early candidate for best film of the decade, Miyazaki's masterpiece","I, like most people, came to know Miyazaki's films by Princess Mononoke. When I heard of this film's release, I was beyond excited. I didn't expect it to beat Mononoke, but I expected it to be really good. I was mistaken. It is better than Mononoke. It isn't really good, it's an animation masterpiece. I was in tears, not because the movie was moving, or happy, but because I had never had such fun in a movie theater.Spirited Away is brilliant and vibrant, filled with the characters that nightmares and dreams are formed from. The animation is eye-popping to say the least...not just in color, sophistication or texture, but in MOVEMENT. The film flows like water, not like the stiff stone-like characters seen in most anime films, such as Ghost in the Shell or Jin-Roh. The film itself is so magnificently well-played...nobody in the film is really evil, but every step of the way is exciting.As for the dubbing, it was excellent...while ALL other anime films looked so silly in their dubbed forms, I think this film is nearly perfect...there were maybe one or two moments in the film when I was reminded that I was watching it in a different language than its original form.As a lover of fine cinema, animation plays a small, but vital, role in my passion. Spirited Away is amongst the best films in the medium...Miyazaki has proven himself to be a film-maker of diverse talent, and has launched himself into the first decade of a new millenium with a movie that is nothing less than timeless.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The Best Animated Film Ever,"I was amazed by this film. The stunning animation that Hayao Miyazaki put together, the characters made me smile, the storyline was well put together & the film has the right to all of the praise that it has got. Chihiro is my favourite character in the film, her attitude that progresses over the course of the film is great, from being scared & worried to a courageous & brave girl. The creatures freaked me out a little bit, but that's what you'd expect in a Miyazaki film. It's the best animated film ever made in the history of modern cinema, no animated film will beat it, if one ever does it will probably be made by Miyazaki himself. If you think this film is good, I advise watching Miyazaki's other work, his films combines fantasy with feelings, & easily sweeps Disney under the rug. Spirited Away is simply amazing, lovers of great animation. This is the perfect film for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The greatest anime film of all time,"Let's get a few things out of the way. Studio Ghibli is the greatest anime studio of all time and Hayao Miyazaki is the greatest anime filmmaker of all time.

I hope we do, as it would be a good thing for all of us, more great films to behold. But as it stands, this is Miyazaki's masterpiece. A master's finest work. And this is enough. It is unspeakably good, my words cannot even begin to do it justice. The only way for you to understand what I mean is to go and watch this beautiful film for yourself, see it with your own two eyes.

Absolutely Stunning,"Ten-year-old Chihiro is not happy that she and her parents are moving from the big city to a small country town.... and a new school.As they are driving to their new home, Chihiro's Dad makes a wrong turn and drives down a creepy unpaved one-lane road that dead-ends right in front of a tunnel. They walk through the tunnel and there is a old abandoned amusement park and there is a small town, but no people. They see a restaurant and lots of food. Chihiro wants to go back to the car and begs her parents to leave. Her parents eat anyway.They unknowingly have entered into the secret world of kami. A world full of witches and spirits. A world were humans turn into beast.A boy, Haku, tells Chihiro that they can not be here and her parents are in danger.""You shouldn't be here! Get out of here now. Leave before it gets dark."" - HakuBut it is to late, Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs and the river has flooded the way back.Now suddenly the park comes to life and the town becomes full of demons, spirits, and gods. Everyone seams to be going to the bathhouse. This bathhouse is were the spirits come to replenish themselves. It belongs to the witch Yubaba and she runs this world and keeps all trespassers and makes them work for her.... And now Chihiro too.Now it is all up to Chihiro to rescue her parents and somehow change them back to human and return to their world.""I'm sorry my sister turned your parents into pigs, but there's nothing I can do. You'll have to help them by yourself."" - ZenibaBut Chihiro is not alone, with the help of Haku, a mouse, and the spirit, No-Face, she plans to escape and free her parents.I have seen the original Japanese version many times and it is absolutely brilliant. So I decided to watch the English-dubbed version and I must say it is just as good. It has not lost any of the beauty of the original. The story is captivating, the animation is absolutely stunning, and the characters are endearing and sincere. This is the type of movies that Disney used to make and should be making now.Spirit Away is a wonderful magical movie adventure.

I waited so that I would be free from distractions and devote 100% attention to the film.... I fell asleep with 30 minutes to go and had to finish it the next day.The story had so much potential but the film didn't have the usual depth of emotion and captivation you expect from anime films.I think for me there was too much focus on sub characters not enough development on the main characters relationship and it just felt like it wanted to achieve too much so ended up being a compendium of smaller themes pulled together to make a film.

Captivating,"I want to be as objective as possible. Captivating I think is a great descriptor for this film. Incredibly artistic and someone that finds the deepest of value in a story, I find that this is far too random to have a story that is consistently applicable. After all, stories have values that are applicable and the deepest ones make the greatest stories. This one is so incredibly artistic but there is no greatness in the story. Visuals and experience is very neat, it elicits odd feelings and certainly makes you question. It's similar to some modern art you may see where someone may throw paint at something which is certainly interesting what becomes of it, but it gives no deeper value. Subjectively you can make up any thought for any experience, which then begs the question why do you need to throw the paint then if it's essentially just randomness. I don't think randomness is what humans find beautiful, in fact I know that humans enjoy order and are mesmerized by it, largely because it is predictable and safer. You can chart why that is meaningful evolutionarily speaking. I digress, I think this deserved such a critical evaluation because of the absolute extreme positive opinion, when there is no objective way possible this is better than numerous films even with 8s. What makes a animated film a 10 or exceptionally high film, is an incredible story and narrative along with visuals and a soundtrack that is perfect in tying it all together. This does not do that. This does one of those things very well which is the visuals. VERY limited narrative with almost an impossible deeper value to obtain from it. One can speculate at best but I believe the author writes like this purposely. An author that is very creative and artistic but not necessarily top tier story teller. They express themselves and people enjoy that. That doesn't make it Great. That makes it good. There will be a type of people that will go crazy for this, those types will tend to be rather naive and have limited analytical capability. Largely female, it doesn't need to make sense it just needs to be ""expressive"". It's not an 8.6 and certainly not a 10. It's probably realistically a 7.2-7.8 area.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Excuse me???,"I still can't figure out if this movie is a troll on the internet and everyone is pretending to think it's the best animated movie ever or if I'm missing something big. Because I just wasted 2 hours of my life since I was baited into believing that a movie with an 8.6 on IMDB may actually be accurate. Coming from an anime fan, I really wanted to enjoy this movie, I practically forced my family to watch it with me saying that it is the highest rated animated movie of all time. My whole family wanted to quit halfway through but I told them that there had to be something at the end that carried this movie, but no, there was nothing. No emotion, no plot twist, just a ""and everyone lived happily ever after"". I can tell from the some hundred of thousands of reviews that hardly anyone will agree with me. The only points I can give this movie is that the animation is somewhat decent and that there were some funny parts, but that is it. I also get that this movie age range is mainly for kids, but even my 7 year old brother hated it. I just don't understand what people get from watching this movie, I just came out wanting to forget everything I just suffered through.

Alice in Wonderland is great - this movie isn't.,"I don't get it.The animation - pretty good (but there is much better out there - obvious example ""Kill Bill vol "")The Story - Muddled, pointless, totally hurried and, because of this, two dimensional.This film is totally episodic and lacks any cohesion. None of the fantasy elements/ characters seem to have any link to one another or the story nor can they be seen to act as a metaphor for anything - either taken as a whole or on their own. Characters motives are completely at random and lack credibility - they start off afraid/dismissive of this ignorant insignificant little girl then all rely on her to solve their problems - what?Utter gibberish executed well is occasionally very entertaining (Alice/Terry Gilliam films for example) - not in this case.A bad episode of pokemon",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

The cinematographic scenes and background is so realistic that it doesn't seem to be just a still and 'Dead' animated movie. it's just brilliant that it's very very complicated to make, so real, the lighting and shadows.but that's all!! and what i dont like? i dont like the human characters, just say like chihiro and her parents. Chihiro is not cute at all to move me in the movie, and is not cute at all to make me really interested to the movie, or even not cute at all to say this is the best animated movie ever made. it's just so unperfect and old fashioned. and the story is so alice In Wonderland. maybe it's the japanese version of it, but it just seems to be not really creative. most of u say this is the best animated movie ever, but for me and most of my friends where i live at, this is not. so i wanna put it this way: if a movie had so much attention and compliments, it should have been most of the time, most of the place, and most people , right?

Erie and sublime,"I enjoyed Spirited Away from the start to the end. I remember watching it for the first time in 2015, when I was five. It frightened me rather much, to the point where I actually hid the movie from my parents so that I would not have to watch it. The world building is what was rather striking to me. What draws my attention to the movie is its erie beauty and ability, which make me feel a sense of escapism and reverie.

"Second to none, Spirited Away mesmerizes","I first saw Spirited Away somewhat 'in media res'; it was on HBO, and the first 10 minutes or so had already passed by. I had not seen any Miyazaki films previous to that, and didn't no quite what to expect as I saw a young Japanese girl wandering through a seeming ghost town. Now, most of the time I start viewing a film like this - missing, in this case, the initial exposition of Chihiro's journey with her parents from Japan to the spirit world - it takes a bit of time to reorient myself into the film's world, especially in a fantasy film.It is to Spirited Away's credit that there was, in fact, no alienating feel - the environment, while somewhat abstract (little of the spirit world as a whole, or spirit world/real world relation is ever explained), is somehow familiar. Chihiro's journey is not complicated, nor overly sentimental, but endearingly earnest. Like Dorothy, she's just trying to get home, save her parents. The stakes are surprisingly small, yet for a girl of Chihiro's innocence, more compelling than contemporary Disney cartoons like Mulan and Hercules. Sure, the nation or universe isn't hanging on Chihiro's utterly personal quest, but to her - and I credit Miyazaki's subtle, uncomplicated animation of her character for this effect - it is everything.Of course, Miyazaki's visual imagination knows no bounds, and Spirited Away is one of his most effective manifestation of encapsulating wonder. But it is not only the pleasingly sculpted yet somehow threatening spirits, or the way the character float through, not walk on, their world that give Spirited Away its texture; Other films, indeed, have more effectively conveyed a world in pictures, but Spirited Away has a pace that exposes the viewer incrementally to the festival, the baths, the spirits and the enduring myth more memorable than anything Disney has yet produced.I am 21 years old, yet I felt like I was 6 when watching this film, as if the story was being read to me by my parents before bed. I was carried away by the pace of Chihiro as she travels along, and as she becomes ever more involved with this world - as the concerns of the parallel universe take over from Chihiro's single-minded objective - so did I. Why did this film have such an effect? Many reasons - the animation and the pacing, as I mentioned, as well as the strength of the voice acting (I unapolagetically recommend the dubbed version for an initial viewing; it is very compelling, and subtitles will distract you from the soft beauty of Miyazaki's vision), well-conceived non-human characters (Many of whom say nothing or almost nothing, but express themselves through incredibly well-directed mime) and a mythic realm worthy of novels.Of course, the magic is probably only maintained because this is not a novel-like TV series, where every last corner of a universe is explored. Instead, Miyazaki gives us a bit of the world, just whetting our appetites enough without bombarding us with too much nonsense. But the effect isn't an oft-cited ""leaves you begging for more"", but a sense of fullness, completeness, in that this story neatly brings itself from beginning to middle to end, into then back out of again a world that is more peaceful, adventurous, entrancing, and lovely than the one in which we live - but, of course, ultimately where we do not belong.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Great world for a subpar plot,"Above all Studio Ghibli films, ""Spirited Away"" is probably the most widely recognized across the world thanks to its exotic, hauntingly beautiful art direction. The Japanese tradition-infused world of spirits that he managed to create here has such a unique atmosphere and some of the most memorable creatures to ever appear in an animation film.Stunning visuals aside, the same issues that tend to affect most Studio Ghibli films are still there to some extent. Hayao Miyazaki is a master at creating worlds, populating them with captivating characters, and setting a magical atmosphere, but the storytelling always feels kind of lackluster and unfulfilling. ""Spirited Away"" actually begins on the right foot and holds pretty well until Chihiro leaves the bathhouse to return the seal to Zeniba. That's when things were supposed to get even more interesting, but basically nothing happens. The ending and final resolution also felt rushed and low-key. Overall it's still a good fairytale for both children and grownups, but I am not sure we are talking about the best animation film of all times as everyone keeps saying.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One of the most breathtaking animated films I've ever seen.,Spirited away Review :D One of the most beautiful and interesting movies I have ever seen in animated form. Of course Miyazaki just has a knack for doing such things with Naussica and Princess Mononoke. But this film just really set the bar far above the rest with its beautiful animation and well though-out unforgettable characters.And all those who have been giving the English dub a hard time I really wouldn't listen to those people there most likely dub haters and think every thing thats done in its Japanese original is superior.I would recommend watching both sub and dub to see that even some voices may not sound the same they both equally have there own faults but each one is an experience you can directly dive into and lose your self into the magic which you may end up sitting for half the night.Easily Disney did an excellent job of dubbing Spirited away with of the most accurate scripts ever pretaining to the original. And coming up with a nice set of actors to do the job though Daveigh Chase can be annoying at times ( I think Miyazaki meant her to be annoying at some times) she still plays the part of Chihiro well and the rest of the cast is great as well.Either Way I would recommend you see this movie if you haven't already because it'll take you on one hell of Miyazaki's beautiful ride.Overall 10 out of 10 stars.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"A beautiful work of art and symbolic film, but especially the third act doesn't provide satisfying answers","Spirited Away is both a beautiful to watch animated movie and gives the viewer plenty of ideas and symbols to ponder, but the story itself and particularly its conclusions left me ready to move on. I have the utmost respect for animation studios and Studio Ghibli after watching Spirited Away. Miyazaki puts in so many small visual details that immerse you in the spirit world and make it so much more realistic. In terms of the story itself, I found it inconsistent. There are plenty of great themes and ideas to consider, the two that stood out most to me being greed vs kindness in the characters, and the older, more naturalistic mindset clashing with the materialistic, capitalistic modern mindset. Chihiro is a fun protagonist who avoids one-dimensionality, having both a multifaceted personality and an arc that significantly shows her character develop throughout.
Where the story broke down for me was in several of the plot events and details of the world. Simply put, I found the ending to be deus ex machina and an overly simplistic and easy way to solve what had seemed like big, complex challenges. I didn't buy her sudden love with Haku and the way their relationship transitioned from a caring friendship to quite committed love. I also didn't find the addition of Yubaba's twin to make any sense, she felt like a superfluous character added in as a weird twist. The way she got her parents back felt completely absurd and was when I accepted that it just isn't a great movie. In addition to these and other plot frustrations, maybe it was an intentional choice to make the spirit world feel whimsical and ambiguous, but the lack of clarity in how the world functions limited my enjoyment. Are all of them spirits? How many of them are being held there against their will (like Haku)? What is the true motivation of all the spirits? How do the spirits interact with the physical world, and how do their transformations and magical powers work? I found many underlying workings of the spirit world to be unclear in addition to plot points that were either contrived or superfluous. I definitely enjoyed watching it and I do like the consistent, immersive feel of the movie from a young girl discovering this wild world perspective, but the exposition and later plot events didn't completely satisfy me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

A must see!,"It doesn't matter whether you are a fan of anime or not - this film is a must see. It tells the story of a little girl who becomes lost in what appears to be an abandoned theme park when her parent stop for a break en-route to their new home.

Chihiro and her parents are the only humans in a world of strange spirits and animals. Dragons and gods abound! Particularly spectacular scenes are those of the train crossing the never-ending lake, and the first view of Yubaba's oriental apartment, with her strange offspring entombed inside! One very important point - this film absolutely must be watched with the original Japanese soundtrack and subtitles, not only to preserve the atmosphere of the original presentation, but because the American dub insults the audience by giving away plot spoilers.

the best film ever !!!,"This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. The drawing was outstanding and the whole story was magical. It is a shame that hardly any young children will want to watch this film because it's from Japan, it beats Disney. I liked this film a lot more than Princess Mononoke, personally I thought it was better drawn. Anyway, Spirited away has become my favorite film ever and I give it 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Its childlike wonders will spirit you away.,"I enjoyed this movie very much. I can still recall when I was watching it the first time round, I could not take my eyes off the spell binding visuals and ended up missing some of the subtitles. Its that good!In Spirited Away, a little girl was marooned in a spiritual world and subsequently enslaved by an 'Enterprising' Witch to work in a bath house for gods and demons. Literally signing her name away in this strange new world, we join the little girl in her fascinating journey to regain her freedom(name) and save her parents( who were unceremoniously turned into pigs by the evil witch prior) along the way.Spirited Away's awesome sights and sound elevates it into a classic amongst animated films. The film can be enjoyed solely on the level of a family entertainment/ kid flick. Which is why I admired the director(Japanese Master animator Hayao Miyazaki) even more as he has also  crafted a fabled story with shaded hues, where nothing presented is clearcut black or white. I particularly liked the way they treat gods and spirits in a manner befitting its heritage. Infact, this unpretentious film can also be viewed as an allegorical meditation on innocence, Asian values, spirituality and existentialism - deep issues worth pondering for folks out there.Anyone from 6yrs to 106yrs old will enjoy Spirited Away as it brings out a child like wonder within you, while simultaneously offering a wealth of wisdom and insights. However cynical you are of 'cartoons',  you will be charmed. This should be one reason why this CARTOON has become the All time Biggest Box Office Hit in Japanese History, grossing more than US$200million in Japan alone!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Is there anything that Disney can't ruin?,"I got Spirited Away on DVD and have watched it twice now.  I am absolutely disgusted by what the English voice actors and Disney have done to this beautiful and creative animation by coming up with their own screenplay (as if the people chosen to do the English voice acting weren't bad enough). Wile watching the Japanese version I accidentally, and fortunately, found out that there are two different subtitles: one is what Disney has come up with, and the other is the original (Miyazaki's) screenplay.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that Disney has changed about %90 of the lines that Miyazaki had come up with for the characters.  It seems that it has become a trademark for Disney to add a certain level of stupidity to anything that that they are involved with, including master story teller and animator, Hayao Miyazaki's projects.  Give yourself a big favor and watch the Japanese version with English subtitles (make sure you choose the ORIGINAL translated subtitles. My DVD player has a ""English sub. 1"" and ""English sub 2"", yours might be different). I liked Spirited Away even though it was a bit different than other Miyazaki's projects.English version 5/10, Original Version 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
I must be stupid...,"I just saw this film and I have no idea what is so special about this film. Maybe I just don't get it, but Japanese animation never has impressed me. It looks shoddy, no better than a Transformers or Thundercats cartoon from the 80's. The main point for me is that the characters in these films just aren't believable in their actions. The story was ok, but nothing groundbreaking. I didn't feel a sense of adventure or a message that was any more special than the next Disney Summer flick. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Beautiful but overrated,"I've been recommended Spirited Away by many friends and decided to watch it after reading so many glowing reviews. It's fine, but definitely overrated. Nearly all of the stars given with this review come from the amazing visuals. Several of the shots in this movie are easily the most creative, beautiful, and straight up stunning pieces of art I've seen. But beyond that, there's not much else positive to say. A lot of the movie feels like an uncomfortable fever dream. There's no logic to any aspect of the story or characters. I guess some people found that appealing but it wasn't for me. I still recommend watching it purely for the visuals, but I'm personally disappointed in the rest.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
This is a wonderful film for adults and children.,"This movie is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I was impressed with not only the creativity it must have taken to make this film, but also the strength of the female protagonist. The little girl Chihiro is the hero of the story (a modern fairy tale), and she must rescue her parents, who have been magically transformed into pigs due to their gluttony. Interestingly, and in contrast to many traditional fairy tales, none of the ""evil"" characters is completely evil - each character has at least one redeemable quality (even Yubaba, the ""evil"" sorceress, is nurturing toward her baby), making the film seem more believable and natural. The overall themes of the movie appear to be ecological awareness, identity (remaining true to oneself), kindness, moderation (avoidance of excess consumption), nourishing one's spirit, and resilience (persistence in the face of adversity). I came away from this film feeling inspired and refreshed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Bizarre, beautiful, unique","It's a wonderful feeling when a film that you were expecting to be pretty good turns out to be absolutely fantastic. This feature was a surreal, magical journey for all ages (although the kids may be frightened in a few spots) that carries as many messages as you could care to search for. A nice touch is the amount of homages they have chosen to pay to other such fantasy films (Snow White, Alice in Wonderland, Wizard of Oz, Neverending Story). Overall, a thrilling ride for the senses and a fresh breeze for anyone who is a little tired of the run of the mill fantasy crap that is being churned out by major American studios today. Spirited Away gives them all a good run for their money. Brilliant!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A Confusing Movie -- Watch It Twice!,"The first thing I did after I first finished watching this movie was to go on the IMDb website to check if it was, in fact, 124 minutes long. I wanted to ensure that my DVD wasn't messed up, and that I had watched the entire movie, because I was afraid I'd missed a few of its scenes. That's how confusing it had been the first time. I had to watch the movie again before I could understand it and make sense of the events. It might be confusing, but it is a great watch for the entire family, for both parents and children alike. No matter how old you are, you'll be able to connect to this movie and you will love it. I've often heard that this anime film is best-known for it's animation, but to me, the story's execution was most fascinating. A MUST-WATCH (and I'd recommend using subtitles no matter what language you're watching it in).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Disney Ought to Be Ashamed...,"Ya gotta wonder - Disney is the US distributor, Disney knows how to market animated features - why has this breathtaking animated feature not been promoted at all in this country?It's a great movie, but really not for small children and it really doesn't have the toy/gadget possibilities of Disney flicks as most of the characters are not at all cute (except for Chihiro, of course).  And, perhaps, since animated features are now eligible for an Oscar, perhaps Disney decided to dump this movie, keep it forgotten in America, so they can promote the amusing (but hardly great) Lilo and Stitch come Oscar time.This movie has some of the most breathtaking backgrounds and animation I've ever seen.  True, here and there it has the kind of stilted animation of '60s TV animation.  But once Chihiro starts her adventures in the bathhouse, the animation practically leaps off the screen.  The level of detail in the backgrounds, particularly in the ""witch's lair"" is unlike anything I've ever seen (even better than Beauty and the Beast, which set the bar pretty high for outstanding detail).I don't know much about Japanese myth/legend, and I suspect that the Japanese moviegoers got much more out of this movie than I did.   Still, it was great fun to watch.  Chihiro is a genuinely annoying kid early in the film, and showed more character development during the course of the movie than some live actors I could mention.  Early in the movie, her parents are enchanted by a witch, and the rest of the movie is about little Chihiro almost going through hell to bring them back.This is probably not a good movie for sensitive children, but most kids much above six or seven should have a ball with it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A Creative Masterpiece,"I think what the director has successfully done here for the first time since Lewis Carrol is that he created a true dream world. As friend pointed out to me, when you're having a dream, everything makes sense in the moment. Of course soot balls would come to life and bounce around, of course ten foot babies would turn into mice and witches into birds... Its only when you wake up that you realize the dream world's disruption of logic. And when you've waken up, your memory is shaken. While you feel the full effects of the fantasy, the sequence of events disappear as rapidly as you wake.In Spirited Away, we can finally remember those dreams.This film is full of vibrant colors and is rich in Japan's mythical history (all of the 'spirits' in the movie exist in Japanese storytelling). The score further takes you away from the real world, back to your childhood, into your most delightful and disturbing of dreams. The love story is underdeveloped in a tasteful but mysterious way.From the beginning we identify with the heroine, Chihiro. From her grumpy moods and stubborn demeanor, to the smallest details in her movement and expressions remind us of our awkward childhood years. She is lonely, she is brave, she is loving and kind- the picture of innocent youth.When the movie ends, you want there to be more, you don't want the dream to end. This director has captured something very precious on film, and it truly is a work of art to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One of the best MOVIES I've seen !,"I distinctly remember that, on the way out of the theatre, I realized I had totally forgotten about the film being an animation!I couldn't remember, and still can't, when I was that drawn into a movie and into the world of an author. Certainly very subjective, but I felt that this work speaks to the child AND to the grown-up in me, and I didn't experience that so often...The incredibly intense moods, particularly some very calm moments where nothing happens, almost no sound... beyond words at its best moments (which, to me, is: most of the time!), though I admit - to give it the honesty it certainly deserves - having being a bit lost in the overwhelming diversity of caracters and events some times...But that's really nothing compared to what this film gave to me (I didn't even say ""film"" on purpose...).Not the one to watch if you want to get violently distracted... (Mission impossible 1 & 2, Terminator 1 - 3, and so on).Definitely worth watching, I'd put it in my top ten of the past ten years.How do you describe emotions? This movie shows what pictures and sound can do when a master is using them to let his soul speak...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Not terrible,"*May be some spoilers ahead*This was supposed to be the anime I could appreciate. Yet, once the DVD's turned off, it is still... just anime.You've heard it before, and you'll hear it again: Why does all anime look the same? As lush and imaginative as the world of Spirited Away is, Chihiro et al still look like they could have come from any other Japanese animated movie. I'm starting to think it is a good thing Disney has the American market monopolized. At least Disney strives for variety from year to year. You may not like the consistently happy endings, or the ultra-family-friendly nature of the films, but visually, at least, the Mouse innovates. Compare the differences between Beauty and the Beast and Lilo and Stitch with those between... well, any two anime titles. Notice something? The difference between ""good anime"" and ""bad anime"" does not constitute stylistic variety.Yes there are positive themes in the movie. Chihiro grows up. It's great that she learns a lot of good things: respect, discipline, true friendship, etc. But the character development is spotty at best. Whereas we get a good understanding of Chihiro, we learn very little about Haku, the boy she learns to love (in a semi-platonic way).Two more gripes: Why do the main characters have to explain the plot as it unfolds via monologue? e.g. ""He flew into that window up there. Maybe I can climb up and help him."" (when no one else is present) And, even in a fantasy setting, shouldn't the characters struggle a little before accepting some things? e.g. ""Oh he's a dragon."" and ""Call me Granny."" ""O.K., Granny.""Again, it's not a terrible movie. But it is still anime, little mouths, little noses, cute fuzzies and all. I give it a 6/10.--------------------------Edit: I'd say it's grown on me by about an extra star over the years, but still isn't one I'd recommend to someone who wanted to watch anime. Even for Miyazaki, you're better off watching Howl's Moving Castle or some number of his older stuff.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
What am I missing?,"So as of this review Spirited Away is ranked as #28 on the imdb's top 250 movies of all time. This means it out ranks Vertigo, Taxi Driver, Casablanca, Back to the Future, Apocalypse Now, Memento, Paths of Glory, Das Boot, Citizen Kane, Reservoir Dogs, A Clockwork Orange.... and countless other highly prestigious films. Also as of this writing I've now watched a dozen youtube analysis of the film, read a few article, read a dozen professional critical review, and read a fair number of the 10 star ratings on imdb.I'm gonna say right off, I don't get how this is ranked so high. The story, even accounting for the idiosyncrasies of Japanese culture which I admittedly do not understand, was still an absolute mess of flitting from one oddball situation to the next with sometimes little or no connection to what seems to have gone before. The human characters at the beginning act in ways which never make sense and then were off into a magical world where whatever needs to happen next happens.Many of the people who don't like this movie will fall back on how good the animation is..... to me it's no more or less than other animation that came way before it. In addition, to describe the animation as beautiful is kind of disingenuous or at least not quite accurate as many of the things being animated are quite repulsive. Instead it would be more accurate to say that the animation is a series of lovingly detailed grotesqueries. The Yubaba character is quite unpleasant to look at throughout the film.So, on and on this goes. After half an hour in I thought I'd been punk'd or something. But as the movie plods through one bit of nonsense or the next.... nothing seems to add up. The plot so to speak follows the formula of a video game where a character must accomplish this to recieve this prize which must in turn be used to accomplish the next thing which unlocks the next mission. It was tiresome.For years I've said that 12 Angry Men is the most highly overrated film on the imdb top 250. This movie may give it a run for it's money. If beyond all the reviews and analysis I've read there's something I'm not seeing, I invite anyone to explain what is there. I could be wrong, or this could be an ugly senseless bit of mass delusion. If there was a zero stars available, I would give it that.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Best anime movie, ever!","Out of all the Hayao Miyazaki films, this has to be the best one of all time. Sure, Nausicaa may be his masterpiece, but Spirited Away is much better. For starters, we have your spooled 10 year old girl moving to a new town and after her parents turn into pigs, she has to rescue them. Yeah sounds like a contrived plot, but its the way she goes about doing things, as well as splendid animation and music that make this worthwhile. She has to work for a living, and no kid will do that willingly, but she manages and makes friends who help her out along the way. The dub work by Pixar is excellent, it makes sense in Japanese or in English.

"not Ghibli's best, but close enough","I'm a huge Ghibli fan and admit this was a great movie and deserved every single prize it won. Had some cute ""Ghibli treats"" like the Susuwataris (Totoros Dust Bunnies) but overall, and maybe for the first time, I didn't felt the originality Ghibli has everyone used to: Whole concept of being trapped inside a new world and trying to save it before returning to their own reminded me a lot of Neverending Story. Could be coincidence in there, but then you see that Chihiro must protect her identity and name before she forgets it. Exactly the same happened to Bastian. Haku can turn into a flying dragon (although his hair reminds me of Atreyu), Neverending story has Falcor the luck dragon. I read the book and watched the movies as a kid, I see a heavy influence here. Spirited away is a great film, I just didn't saw anything new. Not Ghiblis best.

Animated Poetry,"Once again, Studio Ghibli has not failed to please --winner of countless merits from New York to Tokyo, Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, or Spirited Away, is a visual joyride, breathtaking in its imagination, and enchanting in its story.Not unlike Alice in Wonderland or the Wizard of Oz in its own ways, Spirited Away is something of a fairy-tale about a young girl called Sen who is mysteriously transported into the world of the Gods.  In fact, the translation of the original Japanese title means 'Sen and the Mysterious Dissaperance of Chihiro'.  Sen's journey is what Americans would refer to as an unconventional look at a classic fairytale, and what the Japanese refer to as a spectacular view at history and religion.  It is, indeed, both simultaneously.I enjoyed the movie for its innovation, its humor, and the sheer brilliance and color of its art.  As an artist, I certainly appreciate the ornate animation --from pants zippers to antique vases, no detail is neglected, no scene overlooked.  The music, composed by Jo Hisaishi, is heartfelt and expressive.  If I watched it for one detail in the entire movie alone, it would still be just as entertaining.Spirited Away cannot be overlooked as 'just another anime'.  It is animated poetry, history, religion, comedy and magic in an hour and twenty-five minutes.Take your kids, take your parents, take your dog for God's sake!  It's an amazing film that has lived on in my heart and will continue to do so for years to come.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"A Simple Premise, Expressed Through Gorgeous Art","The first time I watched Spirited Away, I didn't get it. I mean, I didn't understand why it was so popular. It wasn't until the film had some time to circulate in my head that I realized the artistic appeal the film had. It wasn't until a recent rewatch when I realized just how perfect this truly is. It's a masterpiece, and will forever be one of my all time favorite movies.As I said, the first time I watched Spirited Away, I didn't really understand all the hype around it. I liked it, but the story is very simple. Which is fine, but it didn't make sense to me why it was considered the greatest animated movie of all time. But now I understand it. The story is very basic, but it's not about the story. The film is about exploring a unique, and strange world. Discovering the rules of this world, the creatures that inhabit it, and the correct way to interact with said inhabitants. That's not all though. The film is also about growing up and maturing. We see this with our main character, Chihiro, who goes from a child scared to try new things, to a child who is brave enough to try new things. The film also provides social commentary on how greedy humans are, how they litter, and how they take everything for granted. All of this is expressed through a literal canvas that comes to life. Each individual frame is hand drawn and painted. As a result, every frame in the film is like a gorgeous painting with bright, vibrant, and lively colors. Similarly to something found in an art museum.All in all, words can't describe the masterpiece that is Spirited Away. It really needs to be seen to be understood. I would highly recommend this to anyone, even if they don't like anime. I myself wasn't a person who liked anime, but this movie has changed my view upon the art style. It's an absolute masterpiece and a must see for anyone who appreciates animation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One of the best films. Period.,"First off, I don't watch much anime (or at least I used too) but spirited away blew me away. It's the film that got me into anime movie (mainly Ghibli's).(MINOR spoilers) A girl and her family (mom,dad) are moving to a new city, when they get lost trying to find their new house, they find what seems to (to the father at least) to be an abandoned carnival. The parents find food laying out in the open at one of the shops; they eat it vowing to pay later. It turns out the food is ghosts/spirits food and they get turned into pigs. The daughter, Chichiro, is casts into a new world filled with spirits, monsters, ghosts, witches and more! She must learn how to escape and save her parents.The pacing of this film is very well done, it doesn't go fast nor slow but rather naturally progresses. The animation style seems sort of westernized, so it might be easier to watch if you're used to western animation. The two things that really stood out for me though where the soundtrack and the characters. The soundtrack sets the tone for each scene amazingly. The music for the scenes with no face really get you into it, the song Kaonashi ( or no face) has a sort of mystery and ambiance in it that fully engage you in the film. Second, all of the characters are so full of life and personality; from the simple soot balls to chichiro, even no face who can't even talk has a big personality! Overall I loved this film to death, No face, was an amazing character that intrigued me. Go watch spirited away if you haven't! even if you hate anime!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The Richard Wagner of the animation business,"Hayao Miyazaki has an ambition that is seldom met these days in popular art. He uses every element of his films to bear a meaning that is part of the film's vision of society.Spirited Away is about the working world. The English translation does castrate him here and there - in the original there's no talk of ""a deal"" between Haku and Yubaba, which, in effect, changes Yubaba's character from benevolent to malicious and also removes an important lesson that Chihiro has learned - but the entangledness of relations, the almost mystical whole, a world whose true meaning lies in the places that its inhabitants owe it, overwhelms the viewer even so.A world that might be endangered by those, who subscribe to ideas forgetting about themselves. This single thing, used in the film in a twofold way, as both the beginning and the end of this world, on one end Yubaba and her lock on names and individuality and on the other No-Face and his seduction by something that looks more valuable than it really is, is already reason enough to consider Hayao Miyazaki a t r u e artist.It makes no sense to rate other great films worse only because there is one Hayao Miyazaki, so I'm not doing that. But what I do, and I can only encourage anybody to do alike, is to look at his films with the same respect that I look at a Picasso or listen to a Wagner opera.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Throughout the English version, the girl's voice sounds nothing but an innocent little kid, while the Japanese version gains certain strength as the story progresses clearly reflecting the subtle change within the main character.After all I am very disappointed with the English version, and as Studio Ghibli could had have a say to it, I'd like to reflect it in my evaluation.

"Childhood memories, very good Japanese animation film","The director wants to tell the audience the girl's adventure, but in fact, from a deep perspective, is about the alienation of people in modern society.

One of the best movies ever made.,"OK! this movie was so brilliant, it was full of sympathy. In this category it is the best, what is ever made.I don't usually watch Anime etc. movies. but I have watch some Anime/manga movies like ""Akira"", ""Ghost In The Shell"", but their weren't even close with this one. I like pretty much animation movies like ""Shrek"" , ""Toy Story 1 & 2"" , ""Ice Age""... anyway, after I watch this ""Spirited Away"" , I felt so good, i recommend this movie to everybody who likes animation movies..

Incredible escapism,"I love Miyazaki's work, simply because of the sheer escapism involved in watching it. His films take you away from the cinema to somewhere completely different, which is something I love films to do to me. Spirited Away was no exception, and although I didn't find it as incredibly moving or as enchanting as Mononoke Hime, it's still easily one of the best films I've seen in cinemas this year.Anyone can enjoy this film, no matter what background they're from or what genres of film they favour, it's a brilliant story and beautiful artwork. I'd love to see Spirited Away again, and can't wait until it's released on Region 2 DVD. You must see this film, whether you're a fan of anime, fantasy or not.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Completely Blown Away,"Almost one year ago, the father of my best friend passed away after an excruciatingly painful and horrid battle against pancreatic cancer. The misery within their family during and after this tragedy was astounding. I tried with all my might to bring some light into the darkness there, and by showing them this movie I actually managed to do that. Watching this movie made them laugh, made them gasp in awe and cry out in joy and appreciation, something I hadn't seen them doing in a long, long time. It actually managed to lift some of their misery. Any movie capable of achieving something like this is worth a 10 in my book.As for myself, as the title says, I was deeply moved by the film and it's soundtrack when I saw it for the first time. It was recommended to me by a friend and I had no idea what to expect. Needless to say this movie has firmly pointed me towards the spectacular work of Studio Ghibli and their master animator, Hayao Myazaki.Much has been said about this movie, and I'll say it again. I find it one of the most spectacular pieces of animation and sound ever created, equaling and surpassing the finest work of Walt Disney himself and Pixar studios. The characters are round and charming, the storyline is complex and involving, and the imagery is from the highest echelon of what current Japanese animation has to offer. Furthermore, the movie has brilliant sound editing and a masterful soundtrack, which by itself is almost compulsory to listen to for any serious movie music lover.If you love animation movies, you simply cannot let this movie pass you by. If you're a movie lover in general, you also cannot let it go by. Go see or buy this movie. You will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"There is no other word to describe this movie, but to Experience it.","I have always been a lover of animated films all my life. I got a DVD of this movie from my friend Hillol when I was doing my grad. He said, ""Don't ask question, watch it."" and the same I did. I was not concentrating too much at the start. I will not lie, I thought how much good can a Japanese movie can be?By the end, I was sitting still with my eyes open all the time. Phenomenal story, Magical music direction from Mr. Joe Hisaishi and the effort in designing the world, what studio Ghibli have put, can not be overstated. From the starting to the end the story went on like a river leaving me blind to everything else. The attention to detail in every scene is so well managed, in which our little Chihiro runs, cries, laughs.I became so fond of Japanese animated movies, I bought all the movies made by Mr. Miyazaki. I have seen Spirited Away about 10 times and each time I watch this, I become happy every time forgetting everything else.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Fantastic,"I have to say that this is one of my favorite Anime movies of all time.First off I have to admit that I watched the subtitled version, so I have no idea what was done with the dubbed version and how well that was handled. Still, the movie itself (plot, characters, design, animation, etc) I found to be incredible.The most obvious comparison is to Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, although Spirited Away is quite unique in its own right. I personally did not find Spirited Away to be significantly darker than Alice in Wonderland. After all, Alice in Wonderland had drug references, an insane murderous queen, a creepy disappearing cat, the monstrous Jabberwocky, and other surreal characters. While the characters of Spirited Away are probably a lot more surreal it's not any harder to deal with than your typical fantasy.It does indeed seem like child's nightmare, which works quite well. It is about Chihiro's journey from a sullen child with a child's reaction to hardship (which in her life is moving to a new town) to becoming a young woman, able to handle difficult situations with much more grace and independence.Not to say that it's not weird, because it is. Then again, most fantasies are. I found the characters intriguing and imaginative, and many of them lovable. The art was amazing and the overall story was enjoyable and intelligent (if rather bizarre). The pacing was well done. All in all, a good execution of a cool concept. I'd definitely recommend it. Of course, if you're the type of person who prefers movies more grounded in reality this might not be your cup of tea. If you like a bit of fantasy, however, it's more likely you'll love this movie.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Good, but very overrated","this movie was dripping with lush background art and imaginative creatures. However, the story is difficult to fallow, goes off on uncalled for directions and such. But the thing I was the least impressed, with was the character animation. For a movie that is rated the #2 greatest animated movie I expected it to have lush and fluid animation, sure some of the creatures and liquid elements were well animated, but the characters ended up looking flat and choppy moments. When it boils down to it, it was just another anime film. Nothing new really. The day I see anime animation with smooth shading as a posed to that awful over-used sharp shading, is the day they gain my respect. Until that time, I will look to American and others for the great animation in an animated movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One of my all time favorites,Hayao Miyazaki at his best. I find new things about this movie every time I watch it. I can not say enough good things about this movie. The animation as always for Miyazaki is breath taking and his sparse use of computer animation only emphasizes the beauty of it's use. This is a very magical movie for me with a rich story and relatable characters in an unbelievable setting. Miyazaki's long carer of making wonderful stories is showcased in this movie. With hidden massages and wonderful surprises thru out the movie. You can see the craft and care Miyazaki takes with his movies in this particular film. Well I don't have enough lines for IMDb so I am now going to add this to make them happy. I really did not want to give away the plot or any spoilers so yeah.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Don't believe the hype,"I just saw `Spirited Away' (Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi), and have to tell you that this is no `Akira.' Although the animation is crisp, clear, and flawless for what it does it breaks no new ground and doesn't deliver what I would consider an Oscar-worthy performance. The plot, if one can call it that, is thin; amounting to very little. This is Japanese `Alice in Wonderland' on hallucinogens.I'm completely at odds with all the rave reviews: this doesn't deserve any of it. I suggest everyone take a deep breath, and step back from being an otaku for just one second and rethink their viewpoints. For the uninitiated, this is pure fantasy gibberish. I have no choice but to give this movie sub-par ratings because of the plot-which is practically nil. I gave it the rating I did only because it is wonderfully colored and next to Akira is as flawless as anime will ever get; but at the same time its non-existent plot breaks the whole thing apart, and what you're left with is  well  nothing. It's all style and no substance.I give this a `4' only because it shows how good Japanese anime can look. Pity it was hobbled by not having a story worth sitting through.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
This is a review of spirited away,"Spirited Away (""The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro"") is a 2001 Japanese animated fantasy- adventure film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli. Since the Japanese anime movie was translated in English, the actual stars that did the voices were different. The main character of the movie is Chihiro voice by Rumi Hiiragi (Japanese version) and Daveigh Chase (English version), Haku voice by Miyu Irino (Japanese version) and Jason Marsden (English version), Yubaba/ Zeniba voice by Mari Natsuki (Japanese version) and Suzanne Pleshett (English Version) and other minor characters like Lin (worker in the bathhouse), Kamajii (boiler man), Chihiro's mom and Chihiro's dad. The setting of Spirited away is during the 1990's in a traditional Japanese bathhouse. This movie is full of Adventure/Fantasy.The movie starts when Chihiro,a 10 year old girl is in the car with her parents and they are on their way to their new house in the suburbs when her father takes a shortcut and they end up in a abandoned theme park. Chihiro's father wants to explore it so Chihiro's mother goes along with him but, Chihiro doesn't think it's a good idea so she tries to stop them but they don't listen to her and they end up going anyways and she follows them since she doesn't want to stay alone in the car. While exploring it they find a deserted stall piled with food and they start eating. They insists Chihiro to eat with them but she has a bad feeling about it so she refuses and she wanders away by herself and finds a grand bathhouse, a boy warns her to leave before its nightfall. When she runs back to her parents, they have been turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba, Chihiro now takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and escape back to the human world.One thing I loved about the movie was the animation. Miyazaki and his staff had been experimenting with the process of computer animation. They started learning more about the computer and its programs like soft image but each character was largely animated by hand. During the process of editing the movie they had difficulty cutting down the length of the movie. Miyazaki learned that if he made the movie according to his plot it would be 3 hours long so he had to delete many different scenes so that the movie was simple. I love how he made the characters,the characters were very unique. In most of the movies the main character is usually very ""pretty"" but i liked how Miyazaki made her very plain and simple because it shows even plain and simple can be ""charming"".I loved the background Music that was used in the movie because it also helps the movie be successful. The music helps the audience convey the feelings of fear,joy, and relief. One example is when Haku tells Chihiro to leave before its nightfall and she is running to her parents and she finds out her parents have been turned into pigs and she is alone and she doesn't know what is going on. The music conveys the fear from Chihiro into the audience. Another example is when she was walking down the stairs and she was so scared because she thought she was going to fall so she was going down the stairs very slowly and one of the stairs broke and she ran down the stairs very fast. For this the music also coveys the fear of chihiro into the audience.In my opinion I think Spirited away was a Fantastic movie. I really love everything about the movie I don't have any complains about this movie. I strongly recommend it to anyone who hasn't watched it. It one of my favorite movies and I have watched it more than 1000 times. It's such a beautiful movie and the story line is just perfect. I think Hayao Miyazaki is genius because I have seen most of the movies he wrote and I have fallen in love with each and every one of them. To be honest I used to hate adventure movies, I was like obsessed about romantic movies but after I saw his movie I fell in love with it. I highly highly recommend this movie and hope people watch it because there is NOTHING bad about this movie and you will love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
One the most beautiful and imaginative films ever.,"Every once in a while, someone with a great talent, and a beautiful vision gets the tools and funding they need to realize their vision, Spirited Away was one of those few, times.Hayao Miyazaki needs no introduction, he is the main director and co-founder of the best animation studio in the world, studio Ghibli. He made 10 films at studio Ghibli, nearly all of them masterpieces, Spirited Away was his 7th film, and his best. Spirited Away is one of the most original and creative films, scene after scene, there is nothing but new strand creatures, locations, and adventures, each scene is completely unforgettable and would be the high point in almost any other film.Spirited Away is about a 10 year old girl, Chihiro, who, after moving to a new town, finds herself lost in the spirit world, and has to find her way out. Chihiro is one of the most likable protagonists of any film ever, and she has one of the most well done character arcs ever. As the film goes on ever about slowly changes, from her attitude, speech, and even little things like her stance and facial expressions. She goes from being a weak willed child, to a strong, intelligent, hero.The animation in Spirited Away is probably some of, if not they best in any movie ever, with some of the best creature designs, and locations ever, not to mention the vivid background animation, and character movement, that flows so naturally during the more exciting scenes. Also apparently Hayao Miyazaki animated the film without a finished script and sort of made it up as he went along.Spirited Away was insanely well received every where around the world, it became the highest grossing film in Japan, beating movies like titanic, and in America it became the first non American film to ever win the Academy Award best animated feature, made it onto Roger Ebert's ""great movies."" And is often listed as one of the best animated films of all time, rightfully so.In my opinion the Best scenes in Spirited Away are the quiet ones where Chihiro just sits and takes in the amazing surroundings, like when she rides the train, and when she sits on the balcony of the bath-house during the night, these scenes have such a subtle beauty that can never be described in words.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

One of the best movies that the world of animation has to offer.,"""Now go, and don't look back.""Some movies diminish with time and repeated viewings. When you find one that doesn't, you know you have a true classic on your hands. That's exactly what Spirited Away is.The animation and art are as impressive as any other animated movie that I've seen - including stop-motion movies, computer animation, and other traditional animation. The character designs are so imaginative that it makes me thoroughly jealous that I don't have the talent that these talented artists do. Every background and frame of animation is beautiful, and that's no exaggeration.The story is simple, engaging, and charming. There no grand story arc, just a spoiled girl who matures a bit as she seeks a way back to her world for herself and her parents, and the trials that Chihiro and the various denizens she meets at the spirit bathhouse face. There are light morals about pollution, discrimination, and greed, but they're never presented in a way that's heavy-handed or blatant.All that praise, and I haven't even mentioned the score (one of the best in any animated movie that I've heard) and the voice work (very good in both English and Japanese) Spirited Away was a labor of love, and it shows. It's a masterpiece for Studio Ghibli, and a movie that anyone with heart can love, be they young or old.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

it may look unrealistic at first sight look closely you'll catch the difference!,"I should start this comment by saying: You need some time to ponder over that anime! First of all I am not Japanase so it's not easy to affiliate yourself with Japanese culture(for example if you know nothing about Shinto religion it's really difficult to put pieces together)When I first finished watching that movie I thought ""Hey it's really fun but it's just a conglomeration of imaginary fantasies but when I really pondered upon it and when I did some reading on it I realized that there are more to Spirited Away that eyes can see at surface. For example there is no clear-cut distinction between good and evil just like in real life right. Even Haku and No-Face who seem good at first look have their share of bad and good within their souls. Words have such a power in the movie. For instance Chihiro has to keep her real name in her mind if she doesn't want to be entrapped in the spirit world. This is actually what we do in real life. We attach such an importance to words that our emotions like anger,love,hatred,passion are channeled through the power of words. Greed makes spirits and people oblivious to what really matters in the movie. Spirits and people's greed (even Chihiro is greedy when it comes to grasping her parents attention)is self-destructive mostly. In short Spirited Away shows us the consequences of actions that alter the natural order of things in destructive ways just look around you you'll see how we humans are self-destructive by creating a figment of our imagination that we are not hurting ourselves but others to gain a place.Spirited is the story of transformation of a whining weak greedy little girl into a capable altruist brave girl.I say don't miss it!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Spirited Enough,"This movie was not the ""end all and be all"" of Anime movies thatall the hype (and the Oscar win) has boosted it to be, but goodnone-the-less.  It's an imaginative story and a nice change of pacefrom the largely Disney-style narratives and animation that themajority of North American audiences have become so familiarwith.I have never been a fan of Anime, based solely on what I considerto be sub-standard animation and over-stylization (dime-sizedmouths & saucer-sized eyes?!?!), and again those factors did playa part in my rating SPIRITED AWAY lower than I could have.  Onone hand, there is a wealth of interesting looking characters,absolutely fantastic backgrounds, and incredible attention payed toanimating the 'spirit world' in the movie (including somebreathtaking CGI combinations), but then the actual characteranimation itself is rendered in obvious 12-frame rather than 24- frame motion.  That just makes no sense to me.  It's comparableto setting a sumptuous table for a regal dinner party, then crackingopen a can of pork and beans and slopping it out onto the goodchina.The shining achievements in SPIRITED AWAY are the characterizations and, above all, the story.  The young heroineChihiro/Sen is played with exceptional realism in attitudes andabilities to a ten or eleven year girl; in the way she talks, feels,moves and reacts one gets the feeling that she is indeed thedaughter, grand-daughter, young sister, neighbour, school chumthat they might know and love.  And the film is littered with aplethora of memorable characters that fascinate and help carry thestory along.  Where the movie really shows its MAGIC is in thewonderful and incredibly imaginative story though.  Strangecreatures and magical beings, living in a world so removed fromthe typical Hollywood/Disney attempts at ""wacky & weird"".  Themakers of SPIRITED AWAY didn't try to dumb-it-down or pander todelicacies of the PC crowd (as evidenced by the sight of blood andvomit and a ""Stink-Monster"" that was quite obviously a giant,walking mound of feces!).  Nor did you have to sit through acookie-cutter love-story cemented together with 10 songs by EltonJohn or Celine Dion that ends with a horrible but justifiable villain- death and everyone else living ""happily ever after"" together forever,etc....I laughed a few times, marveled at some of the creativity, andnoticed that it held the attention of both younger and older viewersalike throughout its unfolding on the screen.  I wouldn't knock it, butI didn't fall in love with it either.  It was just ""good"".7/10.  A nice effort and a good change of animated fare.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

A Philosophical Masterpiece !!!,"This film requires viewers with philosophical mindsets, those who are true to understanding artistic nature of a piece of motion art.I first saw Spirited Away on TV 8 years ago, and at that time i didn't even know anything about anime.. the moment i saw this, i was transfixed, because this was really different from anything i saw.... i am not saying it has only added new concepts, or new layers of animation technology, or a very original story.... I am saying this movie is more special than any other movie because it has no ancestors and no descendants... (imagine visiting mars, and watching any film that those martians see, just saying, and then importing them to earth)And of course, this is a complete movie, with no recognizable flaws seen whatsoever... it is full of philosophy and magical undertones... by magic, i don't mean it is a literary fictional piece... in fact, for most of the viewers, this film can get more personal than ever, because it transports them to a place that has been unimagined and then lures them to believe such a philosophical setting exists in reality... i mean, this film is that much absorbing.... at the end, you cannot discard it being just a fictional story, rather it exists on your list of miracles that has now become a favorite part of your memory.Art exists everywhere, you just need to experience it, feel it, and then understand it... things like production values, use of neat dialogues, or fine use of music really don't matter after all... they all just come naturally with the movie, but they are not main factors.. just like understanding another person, when you watch a movie, what you really appreciate is the heart at the core of the film, what the story and the characters and the settings really mean to you and your heart.... and i believe, Hayao Miyazaki has really developed the heart of this film to its full entity...... No wonder this film gets all the praise that it deserves.....It is a visionary masterpiece, with philosophical greatness, and a really really wonderful film to enjoy, chill and cherish about.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Unlike anything Disney has ever done before,"Spirited Away, or as it's called in Japan, Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, is a remarkable animated feature. Sure, rarely any anime films get released in theaters (except for the other kiddie anime films which shall not be named), and one of the most popular animated features in Japan will eventually make it over here, courtousy of the brilliant minds at Disney and Pixar.The film, in ways,shares a similar storyline with Alice in Wonderland, but it is much more Japanese in almost everything involved. The color, as with almost every other anime film, is very vivid and detailed. But, don't start thinking it's a music-filled Disney trademark film.Contradictory to most Disney films, it's a darker animated feature, both in the script and the on-screen graphics. It didn't get rated PG for just anything. There are some parts in this movie that will scare younger kids, but there are also some other parts in the film that have the right fantasy elements to them, and kids will appreciate that.Concluding, both the young kids and the hardcore anime fans should check this one out for not only it's subject matter but for it's vividness and superbity.

Great.. I think!,"I wouldn't go so far as to say I ""followed"" this but I certainly enjoyed it.

Going to see the dubbed version soon and will follow up with a comparison.Masterpiece?  Well, I'm not sure the plot was *all that* but the visual spectacle and the raw creativity that went into the world and characters were top notch and very refreshing.  You just better pray your 10-year-old doesn't ask you questions about the film afterwards because you won't be able to come up with satisfactory answers!There are many great messages in the film but nothing is driven home with the customary lump-hammer the American movies often use to make points on childhood, growing up, responsibility, confronting your fears, care for the environment, honour, hard work...

Fantasy is at its best when it touches the real world.,"When the heroines parents turn into pigs as punishment for their greed, leaving a young girl to solve the problems of the fantasy world she has entered, the viewer is immediately sucked in too.This animated feature is both vivid and entertaining, and while there is no attempt to be in original in the overall plot, the fantasy world depicted is certainly novel. The story is told in detail, from beginning to end, with charm and wit. While there is no doubt that this is Japanese, the film is on the whole Westerner friendly - the myths and fears pervading the story are ones most people are familiar with.This is a very good time for animation - with the array of styles available to producers (the Animatrix displays many of these) writers can get on with their job and let the animators do their job. The result is films like Spirited Away. I think a lot more writers who previously would not have considered animation must now be taking a second look.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Spirited Away..Lifted Up My Spirit..,"Yes..I would have to say Spirited Away was one of Miyazaki's best movie so far. It's that type of fantasy movie that the feeling you get while watching it is so mind - blowing. Like you actually feel like your in the movie, like the movie it's self is so wonderful. Yes also i would have to say the first time i had watched this film was on television and in fact I had cried three times while watching it. It's an movie with that feeling you get {as I say again} that just actually lifts your own spirit, cause it's sad, it makes you happy, and it's quit funny.The movie is just filled with astonishing animation, high detailed creation, and it's just an masterpiece. Most people may agree, with this statement, but it's really an movie i will never forget.With the little sweet girl Chihiro, I just adore that girl, because hes's brave, courageous, and gold - hearted. Also you got to love Haku, some what mysterious, but also intense and very wonderful boy.So over-all, Spirited Away, really can in a way, change your perspective in movies, and in real life. I feel as if the movie it's self real did change my ways. For an girl who actually fought her fears and did something know one else could ever do, is quit interesting. It's something i wish i could do. So Spirited Away, basically like the best Japanese movie ever for me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Spirited Away didn't spirit me away.,"Spirited Away is an important movie for lots of important and unimportant people.

Hand drawn,"Sometimes I really wished that you could reply to other reviewers rather than have to write a full review yourself.Being married to a Japanese person means that Miyazaki has God-like status in our household. I remember the first time I ever saw Princess Mononoke on TV in Japan and I was blown away by it... the detail in the animation was unbelievable and I just watched it and watched it again and again... I could not believe that anything would ever come close to beating that film as the greatest piece of animation ever created. I was wrong... Spirited Away blew it out of the water.The first thing I want to address though... if like my family, you buy every Miyazaki film ever released from Japan with all the extras then you will know that Spirited Away may have been animated using computers but every scene was hand drawn first. The second disc in the full DVD package includes the entire film with soundtrack but using the hand drawn pages for the animation. This film is NOT some computer generated excuse for animation like one Tom and Jerry fan suggested. This was all hand drawn and to suggest otherwise is an insult to the animation genius that is Miyazaki.SPOILER ALERT:Secondly, story line. The overall plot might have similarities to Alice in Wonderland but it is nowhere near a direct copy of the book. To suggest that it is an Alice in Wonderland rip off is like me suggesting you pulled that reference straight off of Wikipedia. So she goes through a tunnel into another world... big wow... Alice is not the only adventure that goes through a tunnel into another world. If we are going to draw very loose references to stories then it is a rip off of Homer's Odyssey when the crew get turned into pigs for eating forbidden food on the island. I don't remember Alice's parents ever entering Wonderland or the plot of the story centering about Alice trying to restore her family to humans. Alice is essentially about the play of language... and the only similarity other than entering a tunnel to Spirited Away is the power of names.The plot of Spirited Away is complex... there are several subplots surrounding a main plot. The main story is about Chihiro trying to rescue her parents while trying to survive in a hostile world full of prejudice. The main message of the film, however, is about the evils of greed. Each subplot in the film demonstrates the evil of greed. Just like Mononoke was about the environment. In Spirited Away there is an environmental message included as there is in almost all Miyazaki films - the river God being cleaned... but the main message is that greed leads to bad things happening. However, for me the most outstanding piece was the power of names. My only regret was that Miyazaki didn't take this further.END OF SPOILERSo overall, the film is quite possibly the greatest piece of animation ever created. It has a story and it has a message if you bother to look for them beyond the bedazzlement of the art work and soundtrack. With Mononoke I watched the film several times and then started getting bored with it as the magic waned... I have yet to get bored of Spirited Away and have watched it almost twice as much as Mononoke.It is scary for a child but no more so than a Disney film. My 4 year old will leave the room when Maleficent comes on screen in Sleeping Beauty, and she will cover her eyes when the evil Queen appears in Snow White. She covers her eyes at parts of Spirited Away too... but she watches the film to the end. It is definitely a film to be watched with adults though... it is not a film to put your child down and leave them with the TV as a babysitter... but who is to say that all animation is designed solely for children?",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Miyazaki's Spirited Away,"As you can see from my rating, I do not have any problems with Hayao Miyazaki's animated film ""Spirited Away"". Nor do I have a problem with the original Japanese; ""Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi"". My problem is with IMDb's choice to use the Japanese title without reference to the title ""Spirited Away"" in the headlines, on ratings lists, on ""best of"" polls, etc. Disney negotiated for a long time, and spent an enormous amount of money, to be able to take Miyazaki's films and properly translate them (any fan of anime knows how important a proper, professional translation is). They then hired some of the best voice actors in the business, along with some Hollywood stars. The voices are fantastic, and absolutely fit the characters. The soundtrack is wonderful. Disney has taken one of the ""Gods"" of the animation world, and made his art available to people who normally would not be exposed to his work. Someone at IMDb decided to disregard the English title for the Japanese title, most likely to be ""politically correct"". Yet all that they have done has caused confusion. You can go on any auction site and find ""Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi"" with English subtitles, and believe me, watching it is a different experience. If that was your goal is one thing, but if you thought you were getting the Disney version, you will feel disappointed (or worse). People rely on IMDb for information, and in my opinion IMDb missed the boat on this one - and many other of Miyazaki's films. MY advise would be to LOOK to make sure you are getting the Disney version of his films. LOOK for the English titles. If you take these precautions, You will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
good old fashioned kids movie,"I just got the HK DVD (japanese with english subtitles) of this and compared to all of the Miyazaki films, this is a small departure but excellent in all new ways.Usually Miyazaki has strong lead female characters, but Chihiro (Sen) is quite shy and weak, but transforms which is exactly the point of the movie.  It's a great teaching film for kids and never gets heavy moralistic or filled with tacked-on adult issues.  Its about being pushed and accepting the challenge and dealing with hardship in a noble way.Its also got a good amount of scary stuff thrown in, which I recall, made my childhood stories all that more better (Slovenly Peter and Beatrix Potter and Roald Dahl scared the bejeezus out of me as a kid).  Scary yes, but once adjusted, the frightening spirit world which the small girl Sen is suddenly trapped in contains very human-esque monsters, and cute critters as well for laughs. I like the concept in the story that the sprit world inhabitants are repulsed by humans and are more scared of Sen than Sen is of these monsters.We know that Miyazaki aint pulling any punches when dealing with kids stories.  No sappy Disney crap here.  People bleed, die and suffer in Miyazaki's films, but like any good epic adventure, suffering builds character and creates strong-willed and sophisticated people out of mere children.Sen is an amazing fantasy. You are sucked in almost immediately and really identify with the protagonist, who must figure out how to survive and eventually escape back to her own world.  Its surrealism to the highest level in the definition of being dreamlike. Its a vivid dream you'll remember for days if not a lifetime.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

There is so much magical stuf in this movie and the movie is never: this is a blank and it does blank. It uses show don't tell perfectly. Sen is also a realy good protagonist.

A Masterclass in Animation,"There are some movies that, no matter how old they might be, just stick with you and you keep revisiting them over time and the rewatches only makes them better. One such movie is Spirited Away directed by the Legendary Hayao Miyazaki.As with Miyazaki's previous films like Princess Mononoke, the story is fantastical, imaginative, and well written. It blends elements from Japanese Folklore with the coming-of-age set up that is just a delight to watch. The characters are charming and likeable.The world building is absolutely brilliant. The lavish colors, the gorgeous backdrops and the unique and creative designs of the creatures, swepts away the audience into a fantastical world full of magic and wonder reminiscent of Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland. The music is beautiful and is just the cherry on top.Overall, Spirited Away is a Masterclass in Animation.

How the plot has been spirited away...,"I watched this movie at the recommendation of a trusted friend, but I am afraid I have to confess that this is one of the worst films I have yet come across. The animation technique is technically well executed, but the plot got spirited away in the process. At every instant new, completely unmotivated themes come up -- certainly ""imaginative"", but not ""creative"", as another friend put it very succinctly. The beginning is intriguing and raises high expectations, but I cannot help but think that the writer and director increasingly lost any sense of what the film should be about. Throughout most the second half, so-called evil 'stink spirits' run around vomiting non-stop (mildly amusing to watch), and towards the very end the film deteriorates into a sentimental, unoriginal story of true love and a misunderstood, wrongly resented witch. Oh my god, what a complete waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Best film ever, bar none.","I don't know what to say about the grandeur of this masterpiece that hasn't already been said, except that you haven't truly lived until you've seen Spirited Away. Hayao Miyazaki is renowned as a filmmaker. He's never make a film that was anything short of fantastic...until this. This film is beyond fantastic. This film is quintessential. Okay, enough with the gushing. What's good about this movie? Let's see... The animation is the best I've ever seen, without exception. You all talk about the attention to detail that is paid by films such as Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. Screw you. You can do anything with a computer with very little skill involved. It takes true passion and devotion to hand-draw something this good. Every scene, every camera shot has at least five things going on at any given time. That's a minimum. Even when they're just showing a place with no people in it. Take, for example, the shot of the food stand at the beginning of the film, just as Chihiro's mother and father are about to enter and gorge themselves. There is steam rising from the food and that steam distorts the imagery directly behind it. In the back of the stand, a fan can be seen turning clumsily. This is just one example of the phenomenal animation that is, as I said, the best I've ever seen. The story is genuinely unique. A young girl is moving to a new home with her mother and father. Due to a navigational error, they end up in what the father says is an abandoned theme park. The girl, Chihiro, realizes there's something wrong, but her parents don't pay attention. Soon, they have both undergone a mysterious enchantment, and Chihiro, trapped in a world of spirits, must call upon the inner strength she never knew she had. This is the story in a nutshell, but there's so much more than that. You can see Chihiro grow from a scared little girl into a confident young woman. You can see the love that Chihiro develops for this new place and its inhabitants, particularly an enigmatic boy called Haku. You can see her struggles, her pain, her joy. That brings me into the next category: voice acting. The voice acting is superb. Particularly notable are Daveigh Chase as Chihiro and Susan Egan as Rin, but everyone shines, right down to the bit parts. One of the most magical aspects of this film is the score, which can move me to tears if I'm in the right mood. Listen in particular to the score at the very beginning of the film, as Chihiro and her parents are driving, and DEFINITELY listen to the score as she, the baby mouse, the little bird, and No-Face are riding on the train. Not much happens in that scene, but it is, in my opinion, the most beautiful five minutes in the history of cinema. Finally, the score at the very, very end of the film is what makes me cry. I won't give away the ending, but the music accentuates the mood. It's strangely tragic, and one of only three films that has ever made me cry. The others, in case you're interested, were an obscure anime film called Battle Angel...and the other was Rent. In conclusion, I would recommend this film to anyone. Young, old, male, female, anime fan or not. You will like this film. I have yet to meet someone who doesn't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Absolutely amazing,"As someone relatively new to the world of Japanese style anime it seemed a little odd to me. However, this did nothing to detract to the excellent quality of the story it is well written and I really found myself feeling for the characters involved. It manages to be funny, tender, exciting and a little frightening all at the same time which is no small feat for any film and it manages to come across even when watching it in the original Japanese with subtitles again something I've rarely experienced.The soundtrack is excellent and gives a little something extra to the movie although it could work just as well with no music. The quality of the artwork is superb. A little disjointed at times and yes it does last maybe a little longer than strictly necessary. However, it's kept me riveted every time I've watched it and got me doing stupid things like seeing if I could hold my breath when Chihiro is crossing the bridge and I'm 17. The simplicity of the story is such that it can be enjoyed by children whilst it is also complex enough to keep their parents entertained. All in all a real family film and well deserving of the Oscar it won and, in my opinion, many more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A Magical Adventure That Stays with You Forever!,"Spirited Away"" is an absolute gem that feels like stepping into a dream you never want to leave! The animation is breathtaking, every scene packed with so much detail and magic that it feels alive. Chihiro's journey from a scared little girl to a brave and compassionate hero is so inspiring, and the spirit world she explores is full of the most unique and lovable (or sometimes spooky!) characters you'll ever meet. There's humor, heart, and so much imagination-this movie really has it all. Whether you're 10 or 100, it's impossible not to get swept away by the adventure and the beautiful message about courage, kindness, and growing up.

The perfect mix between weird and stunning,"Spirited Away is a film that will take your breath away. It is so well made and so well thought.

Quite Excellent...,"I went to one of the first showings of Spirited Away today, and was completely blown away. The animation quality blew even artistic gems like Mononoke Hime far out of the water, with quite a few scenes that left me completely without breath in their complete awe-inspiring detail and beauty. The story is complex, well-developed, and easy to understand due to the pacing that brought the film to a whopping two hours and twenty minutes of running time.The music was by the always-amazing Joe Hisaishi, who has been with Ghibli for all 13 of their films, and there was even some VERY well placed CG by America's own Studio, Dreamworks. The Dreamworks guys loved working with Miyazaki, they said, but they also noted that another partnership is not likely.So here's my lowdown:Music: 10/10. Freakin' incredibly done. Japan's 'New Philharmonic' was conducted by Joe Hisaishi, along with a few solo piano moments by Hisaishi himself to mix in an Audio masterpiece alone.Animation: 10/10. Again. Perfect in every single minute detail. Miyazaki is one of the few Animators in the world who has never used a repeat frame, never had a lack of continuity, and never used a still cel. He continues this tradition and accents upon his true talent by HAND DRAWING many frames that excelled even the very few computer generated scenes in detail, depth, and beauty.Story: 9/10: Fiercely original with a few twists of The Time Bandits crossed with Alice In Wonderland. The story is complex and amazing, but there are small bits where it may be a bit hard to follow. Sound: 7/10: The foley was done quite perfectly, making sure that every single movement, even the silly ones, was obviously coming how, where, and when it was supposed to. (another thing Disney can take a hint on.) The dubbing was quite good, but it was not great. It didn't get annoying though, so I only took off a few marks for it ^__^Characterization: 10/10: It takes a true master to create a story without a villain. Enough said.Overall: 46/50- This movie was nearly perfect. So perfect, as a matter of fact, that is was as good, in my opinion, as THIS film can get while being THIS film. See it now, or forever know that you missed seeing a masterpiece such as this on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

I was expecting big things seeing as the reviews from critics and viewers are so good, utterly stunned that it gets 8.7 on here and was voted number 4 for the 21st century? Maybe I'm missing something.For me it was one of the worst films I've ever seen.

A perfect follow up to Princess Mononoke.,"After Miyazaki created the more maturely minded Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is an excellent return to some of his earlier themes, such as childhood innocence and how love and friendship can save the day, all without the typical shmaltz that infects Hollywood childrens' films. The film is a blast for older audiences, whether they watch the film with children or others their own age.Die hard Miyazaki fans will recognize the soot balls from the director's 1988 film My Neighbor Totoro, which also strongly focused on childhood. Though, where Totoro was a lighthearted romp, Spirited Away is definitely darker, much in the sense of Alice in Wonderland, though it has nothing to do with Lewis Carrol's work. The atmosphere is entirely Miyazaki's own, and after watching it, it's easy to see how the film set a box office record, becoming the highest grossing domestic film in Japanese history, right ahead of Princess Mononoke.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

I think most people will fall in love with Studio Ghibli at first watch.I will never know how it will feel to watch Spirited Away as a child, unfortunately, but as an adult it still encapsulates feelings of wonder, adventure, scariness and awe.

"Visually-stunning, Highly-imaginative, Heartwarming Animated Movie","I remember watching bits and pieces of this movie as a kid on Cartoon Network. Only recently was I able to sit down and watch it in its entirety. While it is indeed a very beautiful film, I was a little disappointed. It fell just short of the expectations I had reserved for it since my childhood. I will admit it is an interesting social commentary, a la George Orwell's Animal Farm. The fictional creatures and settings imagined by Miyazaki are as equally creative as they are fascinating and are what make the film stand the test of time.The story revolves around a young girl who has entered a spirit realm where her parents have been transformed into pigs. The girl must work scrubbing clients down at a gigantic, luxurious bath house to convince its owner to turn her parents back into humans and let them all return to the physical world. Along the way she makes many interesting friends, from both the spirit world and the physical world.I absolutely love the world building implemented here. The general atmosphere is like a Disney movie mixed with a Salvador Dalí painting. This, as opposed to the storytelling, is where the movie really shines. The characters are very entertaining and interesting as well. The character No Face, a spirit that looks like a black blob with a mask on, is particularly fascinating.While I did enjoy the story, the journey almost seemed too easy for the hero. I enjoyed the first half of the movie much more than the second half. The main villain, an old woman who can turn into a bird (and the owner of the bathhouse) makes for an interesting, yet not quite ""bad"" enough, antagonist. As far as villains go, while she may be interesting and memorable, she just doesn't seem very evil. Toward the end of the movie some plot twists are introduced which are slightly confusing and could have been more creative.This is a great movie. I am not so sure I would go as far as calling it a masterpiece, but it is close. It is certainly one of the treasures of the vast world of Japanese animation. I would recommend this movie to anyone, whether you're a fan of animé or not, child or adult. It's a movie about facing your fears and fighting for the ones you love. I will surely be watching it many more times in my life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Watch this one January 5th on Miyazaki's Birthday!,"For me, anime is an experience that always took me to a place far away from where I am now. To a place on the other side of the planet. To a place totally different to what I am used to back here in the states. Getting the ability to see the underlying culture of the land of the rising sun, is what makes Japanese animation so enjoyably different, interesting and insightful.And, that is what Hayao Miyazaki has always been able to do well, was to tap into those wonderful aspects of anime and the fact that they do highlight the cultural connection to the honorable nation of Japan. But, Miyazaki is able to take it one step further, by attracting a world audience and making his films enjoyable. He also made them about everyone, for everyone and not just Japan. He makes you feel at home in a place totally foreign to you.It is the surface visuals and the story that his creations take you to those places that explore mystical, magical or other-worldly ideas. The animation aspect and the drawings are the extra sugar on top. The beautiful choice of colors, which have a Monet feeling to them, set a great backdrop to Miyazaki's classic animation style.The man, who gave us the legendary Lupin III, back in the 70s and 80s, brings another one of his amazing creations to the screen. His career after Lupin and Castle of Cagliostro (1979), took him to another level of motion picture achievement. The technology changed and he grew with it. The rough edges seen in the early decades of anime was becoming smoother, more clean and colorful. Like the evolution of film, anime has become an art from as well and Hayao Miyazaki influenced its growth immensely.He also has a very interesting imagination. Case in point; this film. Some of the images, situations and characters are really out of this world. He comes up with things I could never even think of. Each turn of the film seemed like a surprise or even slightly shocking. It is a world and a setting much like Alice in Wonderland. It revolves around a young girl, who gets caught alone, on an island (that appeared out of nowhere), after her parents were turned into pigs? Sen, our young heroine's, first thought is..... I need a job.I don't want to give away too much of the plot. Sen's situation is a complicated one, which requires the audience to take it all in. She also has to deal with being discriminated against by the other beings she encounters. They really don't like humans in the Spirited Away world. She also finds comfort with a dragon who can transform into her more human-looking friend Haku. This all eventually comes back to how she needs to save her parents, by breaking their pig-curse and get back to her world. Time is running out.Sen does ignore and accept a lot of the things that she encounters or experiences rather easily, compared to what a normal girl might. She doesn't seem surprised by anything too much. Maybe that is her naïve, young age, that helps her along the way? I'm not sure. But, she is accepting of her situation pretty quick. I'm not sure if that was a good move on Miyazaki's part, unless he just wanted to get the particulars out of the way quickly, so he could move on with the meatier parts of the story. Either way, you forget about that blemish quickly, because the images and situations that Sen gets into, takes you along the way.The impact that Spirited Away (2001), had on the animation world was big. John Lasseter, the legendary Pixar creator, who gave us Toy Story (1995), picked up the USA rights for Disney, dubbed the film into English and helped carry the film to win Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards in 2003.8.1 (B Mygrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

A Very Moving Film,"After all of the hype that this movie generated, I was expecting it to be overrated. However, after watching it I was pleasantly surprised. I won't deny that it's strange-- after all, it does take place in the spirit world, so how ""normal"" could it be? But this film has a lot to say about greed and perserverence, about friendships and hardships. Chihiro loses her parents to the spirit world because they mass-consume a feast meant for ""sprit guests"" like a bunch of gluttons, and are turned into pigs. Chihiro, who declined the meal, is left wandering around the spirit world, aided from time to time by a mysterious young boy named Haku who is sometimes a wolfish-looking dragon-serpent thing. She becomes a worker for this creepy old lady witch named Yubaba, and from there proves over and over that kindness and hard work will be her saviors. The animation is delicate, the colors muted and not as garish. Most anime is bizarre, and this is no exception, but it isn't hard to follow. Really it's a very moving story, great for young or old audiences. (I always prefer watching foreign films with the subtitles instead of the dubbing, and I would suggest this to anyone else wanting to watch the film, as sometimes the translations vary.)",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
This is the Godfather of Animated Features,"Up and till now I've never been much of an 'anime' fan. I didn't even know the name Hayao Miyazaki. But after reading the compliments given to his movie Spirited Away I had to check it out. And I have to say I was really surprised in how much I enjoyed this film. I can understand why it was such a big hit at the 2002 Oscars. This has got to be one the greatest animated films ever made. It's wonderfully imaginative and visual dazzling. It's a masterpiece in animation that is destined to be called a classic.I found myself taken in by the adorably helpless little girl Chihiro who must obtain the courage that she thought she never had in order to survive the strange but fabulous world of spirits and gods. In her time in the alternate reality she comes across unique delectable characters, faces many challenges, and uncovers things about her past that she had forgotten. It's a fantastically enchanting story and if that's not good enough it's packed full of themes that can attract even the most small-mined of people, like for example the coming of age plot line. Chihiro was a spoiled and somewhat selfish little girl when we first met her, as a lot of kids are now a days. Then she stumbles into another world where she makes her transformation from childhood to adulthood. She learned courage in which she learnt independence, respect and assurance. That's just one of the many things themes that Hayao talked about and one of the many reasons why I loved this movie. Hayao also concerns the ecology of modern Japan. When we first enter the next world it's a vast and beautiful landscape, it seemed to me like a depiction of the traditional Japan that had been forgotten and replaced with something like New York City or Tokyo, that's what it felt like when darkness came. There was also an indication of pollution in the scene with the River God and the bathhouse. And I loved that because not only is this happening in Japan but it's also happening around the world, and the fact that Hayao expressed in such a creative and fun way makes it even more appealing. He also sets a very good example for the future generations of kids, maybe this movie will be the encouragement that cleans up this world.One thing that has been specifically noted about this movie apart from it's themes is it's unique animation techniques and artistic style. Truthfully I rather enjoyed the animation in this movie much more than I have in any other animated feature. At times I found the images to be a bit scary and disturbing, but they're just minor distractions from it's true, unique beauty that is so wonderful to watch. The fascinating thing was how Miyazaki incorporated those two very different lines so well. In one scene you can have Chirhiro and Haku falling through a timeless, star-filled sky, and then in another scene you can have Haku spiting up blood and Chihiro trying to restrain him. It's as if these two opposites exist in perfect harmony, creating not only something to look at, but to think about and that's something that's not easy to pull off.Hayao Miyazaki has touched me in so many ways with his brilliantly thematic, charmingly beautiful, and visually stunning movie, Spirited Away. It's a one in a million movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Carried Away,"OK, let's get into this one. I really like ""Spirited Away"", really, I do. Like all Miyazaki films, it has absolutely beautiful animation. It has great music, atmosphere and voice acting. The reason why this review is going to seem so negative is the fact that I feel this movie gets all the praise it deserves and more. I don't love this movie as much as most animation fans, Miyazaki fans and movie fans in general.Thankfully, fans of ""Spirited Away"" are a lot like fans of ""Fantasia"". They really loved the movie, but they totally understand if it isn't for everyone. They are cool levelheaded individuals that will not hate someone just for disagreeing with them.Typically, the only explanation that I need is that I don't like ""Alice in Wonderland"" either. ""Spirited Away"" is cut from the same cloth of Lewis Carol's classic. It is an Isekai that is light on story but thick on surreal visuals and setting. When it boils down to it, I just don't care for the story. The story loses focus as it goes along, and just wanders from one beautiful location to another. For most, it has enough of a plot to compel the action forward, but for me it is lacking.In perspective, I still like this movie. I just don't think it is the (10/10), top 33 films all time, God's greatest gift to animation that the world deems it to be. I still recommend it, just don't get carried away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Hated it,"There are a handful of movies that many people seemed to like, but I hated. This is near the top of the list of movies I hated. I found it to be nothing more than a long episode of Pokémon, with fabricated characters, fabricated scenarios, and no sense of logic, morals, or plot.The animation is pretty good, and some of the creature/characters are visually interesting, but I found the plot, or lack thereof, to be just a progression through disjointed scenes with no story integrity.I purchased it on DVD and watched it with my children who were 5 and 8 at the time. At that age they would watch videos they liked over and over again. But they never wanted to watch spirited away for a second time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

It's great to watch with family and kids or friends, all age group people can watch it.Full of adventures and suspense, indeed no one will get bored while watching the movie.Spirited away movie is great for its imaginative storytelling, beautiful animation, and themes that resonate with both children and adults. The look and feel of Spirited Away are based on the Japanese Shinto religion, an East Asian religion based on animism and polytheism. In this religion, there are many kami spirits that inhabit everything in the world.

"The most beautiful, deep, and tender cartoon.","I was 7 when the movie came and I was pretty surprised this picture could impress me so, most probably due to not being a well-known studio and genre for me then. Being now a 27-years old man, I have watched an enormous number of cartoon movies including anime, I still believe that ""Spirited Away"" is the most impressive and touching cartoon movie.I came from a cinema recently watching the cartoon again and being very thankful for an IMAX event so this picture could have been seen on the biggest screen.Many beautiful cartoons are being the best in some parts of mankind-described senses that touch different emotions, however, this one is the best talking overall.Additionally to the aforementioned review, I would like to applause the picture's score and soundtracks as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Excellent,"A uniquely classic, modern fairy tale. This is my favorite film of all time. I never get bored of watching it. The artwork and animation is absolutely incredible. The soundtrack is so stirring and beautiful. It blows my mind to think of the amount of work that has gone into making this magical work of art. This film is, in my opinion, Hayao Miyazaki's best work to date.

JAPAN ANIMATION/ FAMILY/ FANTASYA drive with her parents with a very young girl after entering through a somewhat an abandoned carnival, becomes taken in by an area inhabited by spirits or where spirits are nurtured! To describe this film is like a Japanese equivalent of ""Alice in Wonderland"", written, directed and drawn page by page by maestro Hayao Miyazaki, which starts conventional but after the first 30 or 40 minutes, is when things start to pick up when the little girl start to adapt to the environment by instincts without the crave for great tasty food or wealth. Viewers should also be marveled at the many creatures or inhabitants of spirits one have never seen before who were originally drawn up by kids and then enhanced by Miyazaki himself. Deservedly won the Oscar for ""Best Animation"" since Disney normally dominates that category most of the time as well as broke box office records in Japanese history!

The Great Masterpiece,"If I were to watch one movie as I lay dieing, it would definitely be Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away (2001). I would like to die right at the moment when Chihiro and No Face are the last ones on the train. But in all honesty, any moment in this movie would be a great final sight. It has some of the most impressive animation in the history of the art, but it also tells one of the greatest stories in movie history. It's a basic coming of age story, but with such imagination, emotion and well made characters that it is one that will be watched and enjoyed a hundred years from now, that I have no doubt.The story follows a ten year old girl named Chihiro and her quest to save her parents from a bathhouse running witch named Yubaba. If that does not hook you, I don't know what will. Add some beautifully drawn river spirits and bizarre creatures that would shock even Lewis Carroll, and you've got the makings of a great movie.Besides the fantastic story and characters, the thing that makes this a masterpiece is that it's a tremendous labor of love that is. Not that it was difficult to make, considering the fact that Miyazaki is animated gold, but that there are hundreds of unnecessary little details that cement the movies beauty. The way water moves and reflects, for example. It is so realistic that we became totally engrossed in the story. Or look in the windows of the bathhouse. You will find whole stories that have no connection to the central one, but they give such a feeling of busyness and movement that I couldn't imagine the movie without them. Most backgrounds in animated movies are very still, they can't distract from the story. But the ones in Spirited Away demand your attention. It's a good thing that the story is so compelling.The story is a basic coming of age type deal. But most of us take a long time to make the progress that that Chihiro makes of the course of the movie. Sometimes we wish there was an event like this one that would inspire us to take action. But usually a single event that causes maturity is a tragic or traumatic one, where as Chihiro's is one of spectacular adventure. Scary, yes, but she faces it with great bravery so that the trauma questions that usually pop up in the back of my head in movies like this never come up in Spirited Away.I mentioned fantastic creatures, and this movie delivers them, I think more than any other movie. They are powerful creatures of few words, who let their very existence be their power. My personal favorite is the Radish Spirit. He looks vaguely like Meat Loaf in Fight Club (1999) and does little except for ride in an elevator with Chihiro and do a happy dance. But the tantalizing possibility of the existence of such an incredible creature has elevated him to one of my favorite movie characters. The most affecting is Stink God. I remember a tremendous feeling of sadness hit me when he slimed in the rain towards the bath house. He was so alone and hated, you can't help but feel sympathy for him (plus, he inspires a great reaction from Chihiro). But the most memorable is No Face. He is one one of the great misunderstood monsters of the screen. When Chihiro shows him a little kindness, he tries to repay her in any way he can, which involves hurting some people on accident. With minimal noise, he inspires great sympathy and awe. He is also a wonder of animation, disappearing from scene to scene, rapidly changing in size and seemingly texture.As the story draws to it's conclusion, it's an interesting to note that we want Chihiro to return to the human world. This is a snag that many children's movies hit. Why would you want human friends if you have Totoro or why would you go back to Kansas if you have Oz? But there is enough peril in the bathhouse and Chihiro is human enough that she needs to return to the human world; she has no place with the spirits.Consider the title. Nobody ever says that in the movie, in fact Chihiro takes her entry into this fantastic world very rationally. But the title is directed to us, the audience. We are spirited away to a place beyond the imagining of mere mortals. Miyazaki lets us in on his mad dreams, and we couldn't care less.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Spirited Away,"There are plenty of strengths from movies being animated. They have free reign to show whatever they want to. Meaning, nothing is out of the limits, they can create any monster, person, or item they wish. One limitation would be the creditability of the film. Most critics will often over look animated films simply because they are animated. If Spirited Away was live action, almost all of the magic in the movie would be removed. Most of the characters shown in the movie would not be possible to use without animation. One of the key elements to Spirited Away is its strange storyline and overall theme of the movie. The uniqueness of the film is by far the main engine driving this movie. I for one have not seen a story like this before, especially not in any Pixar or Disney films. I was not expecting the story to play out in the way it did. I thought she would casually discover these monsters as she was adjusting to the new school. I did not expect her to be trapped with all of these monsters and would not be allowed to escape. I also did not expect the film to take place in a bath house. This is by far one of the reasons as to why this film separates itself from Disney and Pixar. At times the movie was pretty graphic and blood was shown. Blood is rarely shown in animated movies directed towards a younger audience. As far as approaches to animation, I could see a difference in the way the movies are made. Pixar animation seems brighter, bolder, more defined. It has been a while since I have seen an animated Disney film. I cannot find a clear cut political or environmental message in the movie. The only theme that really stood out to me was when her parents got transformed in to pigs because they were eating too much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Lost in translation?,"After seeing 'Mononoke-hime' the bar of my expectations was pretty high. 'Mononoke-hime' is absolutely one of the best all-around films I've ever seen. I did so want 'Spirited Away' to take me to that same place...and it almost did....almost. I watched the English translated version and occasionally got the distinct impression that what was being said and what was going on didn't quite jive. I don't believe in giving out 'spoilers' unless I am discussing directly with someone who doesn't care and I won't start here. All I will say is that I wasn't satisfied with the revelations/resolutions/explanations. Like most films of this genre it is allegory and metaphor. Usually I am able to bridge to a successful interpretation as I did in 'Mononoke...'. I viewed this twice to see if I was missing something. No. It is what it is. I was not compelled nor was I satisfied with the central characterizations. They didn't seem rooted. Maybe that was part of the problem here - that being reality merging into and becoming part of a so-called alternate reality. The reality wasn't established very well. No lessons were learned. Explanations for the metaphors kind of fell to the wayside. Then it ended. Groan. However, it is an entertaining film and I do recommend it!

Best anime I ever watched,"I loved it. Great animations to a great story. Recommended 10/10.The characters have great deep and nothing in the story is there for no reason. The whole movie has a feel of ""everything is thought of"", every detail has a purpose.I was struck by a quality between generosity and love.Again, animation is a painstaking process, and there is a tendency to simplify its visual elements. Miyazaki, in contrast, offers complexity. His backgrounds are rich in detail, his canvas embraces space liberally, and it is all drawn with meticulous attention.Viewers, too, will escape the boredom of predictable animated fare. Director Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke) treats his audience as imaginative and intelligent human beings, rather than catering to kids with rote displays of silliness, stunts and scares.SPIRITED AWAY Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki; United States director, Kirk Wise; English language adaptation by Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H.

Absolutely Beautiful.,"This movie is amazing. Miyazaki is one of the most talented animation directors and one of the best directors in general of all time. This movie may not make sense to a lot of people, but is beautiful to me. This movie is not just about some girl who is transported to a magical land. No! This movie is about a girl facing her fears to help the ones she loves, and helping even the ones she doesn't. Romance, adventure, suspense, and comedy are perfectly fused together in an intoxicating mix. There were even scenes when I was on the verge of tears, and I usually do not cry during movies. In fact, this was the first one I ever even felt sad about! While the movie was a bit confusing at times, it was great. The voice acting in English was perfectly executed, and even though I've never seen it in Japanese, I'm sure it's just as good or better.

"A meticulously crafted, charming masterpiece!","Before seeing this movie, my experience of anime mostly consisted of cute women, giant robots and dudes with guns. Entertaining, but sometimes clichéd and lacking in the visuals. After buying the DVD of 'Castle in the Sky' (which i remember vividly as a child) I was interested in Miyazaki's latest, Oscar winning movie.Firstly, if you're the type of anime fan who's looking for fast-paced action, look elsewhere. If, however, you are prepared to watch this, you will be treated to some of the most imaginative storytelling and the most astonishing visuals ever to put to cel (or screen for that matter).The plot is simple enough, following the adventures of a strong-willed and (it has to be said) bratty ten-year-old girl who becomes separated from her parents in a spirit world while moving house. As the story progresses, she gradually grows emotionally into a better person. Although it sounds far-fetched, the way the story is told is in a class of its own. The animators' attention to detail in backgrounds, character design and the animation itself are breath-taking, and the merging of CGI and traditional drawing styles is remarkably well-done. It is this attention to detail which gives more and more to see on repeated viewings, and prevents the viewer noticing the leasurely pace of the story. To say this is merely a kid's film is selling it short. I'm 22 and I LOVE this movie! Hiyao Miyazaki and the rest of the staff at Studio Ghibli have created yet another unforgettable experience. This is how animated movies should be done.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
average animation,"I felt there was little that was original in this movie. It was a weird mix of Stephen King, Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland. A staple romance was also thrown in.

It uses a lot more CG that previous Miyazaki films, and there are some quite impressive scenes because of it. I don't mean the obnoxious CG that stands out from everything else, but the kind that blends in perfectly. Graphic-wise, it's a very beautiful film. Story-wise, well, I wouldn't call it Miyazaki's best work, but it is still very entertaining. There are many ""interesting"" creatures in this movie, along with a few that you might recognize from previous Miyazaki movies. All in all, entertaining, but nothing spectacular. The thing that bugged the the most were some of the voices. In particular, the black guy that kind of looks like the villain from the ""Scream"" movies. That had to be one of the worst casting jobs I've ever seen.

But, I'm terribly disappointed to admit I'm more than likely never going to watch it again.The artwork was visually appealing, and I could see how people could compare it to Alice in Wonderland.

Ice age is meant to be a family fun, almost comic animation with the use of cgi whilst spirited away is more serious and a darker form of animation so its not good to compare against each other.compared to other films done by the same director.... i found this to be his best... ie. the baby being changed to a rat,girls angst at her parents being pig, and the evil black ghost(?)thing which keeps on swallowing people in the bath house.although howls castle (dubbed version) is extremely good visually with funny characters such as calcifer (fire demon) although has a slightly weaker story than spirited away and princess monokee is a very clever film and almost rivals that of spirited away in the sense of it talking about mans destruction of animal habitats and the conflicts that ensure..in all spirited away may not suit everyone as yes it lacks the Americans use of cgi and yes it can confuse those don't watch it more than once... bit very entertaining still... but if not to your cup of tea try some of his other works or just stick to American animation",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Entertained visually and had a fun watching it. However, a very random story.Like, can you at least elaborate more on the relationship between the witch sisters? Chihiro's love relationship with Haku? The importance of No face.. he loved Chihiro but left her so fast to the Witch Sister? What's up with yabuba (more insight)?Very random things happening throughout the movie until the end.Enjoyed the animation and the visuals and music.

"The true definition of ""style over substance"".","I had to watch this movie twice before: Once in college in fifth year, and once in Media class in sixth year. I'm pretty sure I was already aware of how the large critical success before even seeing the movie, and through watching it, I've seen how highly overrated it is.First off, I should go off the pros and cons of the movie.The pros: The animation looks great, especially for 2001, and its locations look amazing for its plot. In addition, the soundtrack is pretty good, and most of it shows off some genuine emotion.The cons: literally everything else.Throughout the entirety of the story, I had no interest in any of the characters, as none of them got me invested in the plot. Chihiro was pretty generic, the villains were mostly generic, Noface didn't give me any emotion of fear, no matter how many people he eats, and I found it the story to be pretty bland overall.I'd say a movie that it's job better is Song of the Sea. It was honestly a great movie with its incredibly gorgeous animation and interesting use of Irish folklore, and an interesting twist regarding the main character's sister. I'd highly recommend watching it, because it is actually worth your time, rather than this one.And I'll just flat-out say it, Shrek, the movie that has spawned thousands of memes, is much better than Spirited Away. Despite how unappealing its animation might look, it still has a great plot and characters. Plus, despite coming out in the exact same year, it was the first movie to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. So yeah, Spirited Away just got Shrek'd.At the end of the day, there is one simple question I have about this movie: why is it good and why did it win so many awards? Sure, it might have been influential for movies like Turning Red (which I haven't seen yet, btw), but my point still stands. Spirited Away is easily the most overrated animated movie I've seen, and I wholeheartedly mean it. I wanted to be nice to the movie, but it's safe to say it disappointed me in spectacular fashion.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Really amazing fantasy.,"It's really interesting.  Princess Mononoke was so amazing that it forced me to seek out and see as many of Miyazaki's other films as I could get my hands on.  This wasn't as easy as it sounds, since even though Disney owns the American distribution rights to all his earlier Studio Gibli works, they keep not releasing most of them. However, after watching a number of his films, I really came to love and appreciate what Miyazaki does as a film maker, and to really be in awe of his talent and mastery of dramatic story telling. I awaited this film's release in the U.S. with much anticipation, and I got the chance to see it last night at an advance screening here in L.A.  I wasn't disappointed. There are many review on here, so I'm not going to go into plot details, but I'd like to say, in response to some other user comments that I didn't find the story structure episodic at all, but rather extremely tightly crafted, with not a wasted beat.  Everything was setup and paid off beautifully, and the story structure blossomed like a flower.  We were transported deeper and deeper into this beautiful universe out of Miyazaki's imagination, and allowed to see such amazing things. I was particularly moved by both the polluted river and the train transporting dead souls.  Both poetic anthropomorphisms were subtly expressed, and masterfully expressed. Ten out of ten.  One of the best films I've seen in awhile.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"The best Anime movie out there, also best Miyazaki film!","I have to say this first, I am a huge Hayao Miyazaki fan, and this film is his best. I also really like Kiki's Delivery Service, Howl's Moving Castle, and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, but Spirited Away beats them all. I fist watched this film in 2012 and I regret not watching it sooner in life, as I am a movie goer. I am 17 years old now and I still think that this is one of the most sophisticated film ever. Spirited Away does as the title intends to do with yours. I was lifted into the dazzling world full of complex thoughts and characters. The characters in this film are so well formed and developed. My favorites have to be Haku, Chihiro, Yubaba, and Lin. The animation in this film is spectacular, some of the best hand drawn animation ever.

I'm a little bias,Now let me just say that I love Spirited Away. It has been my favorite movie to watch from when it came out to now. I grew up watching it and the story is really interesting but a little hard to follow. This isn't something that any person would watch since the story is a little out there but if you are looking for something interesting to watch this is my top pick. I would honestly recommend this to anyone willing to watch it. I may be a little bias towards but thats because the story really got me into it and now i cant stop watch it.

I don't care about most of the people or events in this movie. Even after rewatching, it feels like a confused, half baked mess of a movie and I honestly felt like I had been tricked the first time watching. This was supposed to be the best movie in Ghibli's collection, the one that everyone loved. And it was just okay. It feels like it wanted to be whimsical, but it just ended up being headache inducing with characters that are obnoxious and make me roll my eyes.It wasn't all bad. I really liked Chihiro and cared about her struggle, as well as a lot of the stuff in the bathhouse. But once it moved away from that, it just didn't click for me.Maybe it's partially a cultural disconnect, since, as an American, I'll never truly get some aspects of the film.

"Spirited Away, a Miyazaki's dream?","In 2004, I had the opportunity to see Spirited Away by the first time a Saturday morning, though I did not pay much attention and I jumped it like a ""good movie"", nothing more.Nine years later, I came across this tape again by chance and to be older and more aware I observed carefully and tried to warn even the smallest item. It was impossible, of course, as I could see Spirited Away up to 10 times and each time I'd discover new details.To define this magnificent piece, of filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki who is perhaps the most consistent filmmaker I know, you don't need more than thinking of the strangest and surprising dream you've ever hat and there it is, it is essentially this film, a dream in its purest essence, a surreal dream world that never ceases to amaze.Beyond what has already been said about Spirited Away, I don't think my notes are a revelation, but I just share them: for me, Chihiro is to Hayao Miyazaki what Alice is to Lewis Carroll, both stories are fantasy and display of creativity at its finest expression.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

One of Animations greatest achievements,"Spirited Away is a film directed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, and animated by Studio Ghibli. It is also one of my favourite films. The animations are absolutely breath-taking, which is a staple from many Ghibli films. However, Spirited Away does something special, creating a world that will consistently amaze with its attention to detail, and the magical fantasy it brings to the table.The film is about a young girl, Chihiro, who is trapped in the spirit world, and has to save her parents from a calculating witch, Yubaba. She is helped by a colourful cast of characters who are all charming, but all morally ambiguous as well. This film is detailed to the extreme in the story and character department as well!As mentioned, this is one of my favourite films. It is an absolute work of art, and should be recognized as a classic. I would highly recommend this film to anyone, adult and (maybe more mature) children alike.

"Wonderful, even for those who don't like anime","You know the drill: Chihiro is a ten year old girl who gets trapped in the world of the spirits after her parents gorge themselves on spirit food and turn into pigs.My two cents worth: I've noticed a lot of people discussing in their comments that the movie ""doesn't feel whole"" or ""doesn't make sense"".  It has a dreamlike logic.  Things that seem perfectly ordinary at the time you watch it will make no sense when you try and explain it to somebody else. (Think ""Alice in Wonderland"")That having been said, this movie is completely involving and absolutely beautiful to look at.  The characters, as strange as many of them are, are completely believable.  It takes someone of great imagination to make a film like this, and make it work.  And this coming from someone who usually can't stand what most people term ""anime"".On a side note, I've noticed some parents complaining about this movie for various reasons.  The box for the movie says it is rated PG.  This is not a Disney PG where it's been rated for slapstick or the occasional bad word. This is a ""you're insane if you're letting any little kid who can't sit still for two hours/gets scared easily/under 7 years old watch this movie"" PG, kind of like Harry Potter was.Recommendations: If you like the story of Alice in Wonderland, you'll probably like this.  If you're into enthralling animated fantasy, I'd recommend ""The Last Unicorn"".  ""Flight of Dragons"" is also good, but doesn't hold up as well under repeat viewings.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
It's actually not over-rated.,"One of its writer's better movies if just for the onslaught of bizarre and vivid images that are thrown upon us. It really is quite spectacular and even terrifying at times.Although Chihiro is not a great character, instantly going from brat to scared little girl never to return in a matter of seconds, you really have a powerful sense of being trapped in a strange and exotic land that only grudgingly has a place for you.The plot is fairly engaging as we try to get home and struggle with a few episodes at the bathhouse.Worth a couple of viewings as we explore some interesting ideas on the nature of identity and culture being lost in industrial modernity, we get an ethnically rich and frequently grotesque hybrid of cultural flavour and the monstrosity of big business with only a modicum of the sanctimoniousness that is Hayao's signature.Sweet, funny and again with a score that will be your new guilty pleasure, this may not be Ghibli's (or even Hayao's) best movie, but it's place in those top 100 lists is more of less earned even if as usual it is as a feat of spectacle and imagination, not so much of story telling.On that note we are one climax away from a great movie. The thing just...stops. But it's the journey not the destination. I feel this could have made a very dignified movie for all ages but seems to have been intentionally ""kidified"".

Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs and Chihiro must get a job at a bath house for the gods to save them. She does get the job but she is renamed Sen.

Weird & Wonderful ...,"Looking at this film as an outsider, someone who knows very little about Miyazaki's films or ANY anime film for that matter, I've got to say that I found it to be a real breath of fresh air, and a welcome break from Disney films. It encourages me to go out and seek more anime films, but I also fear that I might be disappointed by those films if they aren't as great as this one.Most of the film is set in a hotel for spirits which is ruled over by an evil witch and is staffed by a variety of extremely weird, but certainly original, monsters. A young girl named Chihiro (or Sen) finds herself trapped here after her parents trespass on the property, and must work there until she can find a way to escape with them. With it's cultural sensibilities, the film at times has a harsher edge than you would expect to find in your average American cartoon, but in the end it is also extremely heart-warming.As I'm not really familiar with Anime, the closest Western parallel I can think of would be pixar's Monsters Inc., which was similarly interesting and original. Whether or not children will understand or enjoy this film I don't know, but adults will certainly find it interesting.

Analyzing Analysts and East Asian mythological spiritualology,"This animated film reminds me of the visual nature of East Asian people. This is captured on the front cover as the story theme seems to continue the notion that the Japanese spirit must strive and survive in its totality as a unique ethnic way.The front cover seems to capture the innocence of the Japanese youth in an over stressful atmosphere of proximity of Japan. Looking aside from the direct view that the world in front of her displays as opportunity given the ""time frame"". Moving forward never the less because of a sense of duty to Ryu the friendly dragon. But taking personal time to look aside to the attention of the curious viewer.The confrontation with the boiler maker seems negotiated as the small black spider like beings escort the youth home. The spirit of a tradesman, or craftsman, burns very earnestly in their own spirited way of life.Perhaps it is this mystery of faith that is the will to devoutly follow all that is pure like the white kami of Shinto religion, water clear sake, spirit of decisive action of Samurai Budo, and even the thoughts in any craftsman's mind that produces the way of human righteousness via their art.Its this same sense of duty that if followed blindly will bring you virtue and honor like the concept of a perfect society which a citizen calls government. Always fear the politician with this East Asian budo spirit because they seek to establish a virtuous government as a noble virtuous citizen by example of their deeds that they may sign their oaths of duty. It is their selfless spirit that brings unification of all government duty.I think this movie A Spirited Way brings many different characters under the same common theme of duty with spirit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"One of the best animated films, ever made","Being nominated for the 2003 Academy Award for best animated feature film and winning, Spirited Away stars a ten-year-old girl named Chihiro and her start of a new life and meeting mysterious creatures:Gods, witches, and spirits.This movie was created by the legendary movie maker Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli on the 20th of July, 2001. Chihiro and her parents have just moved to a small town; after trying to take a short cut, they become lost. They decide to explore an ""abandoned amusement park"". Chihiro's parents discover food and decide to eat and then pay later. Chihiro leaves to go exploring and finds a bath house. A boy named Haku finds Chihiro and tells her it isn't safe there and her and her parents must leave. Chihiro goes to find her parents and discovers that they have been turned into pigs and runs away in fear. Haku finds her and decides to help her into finding her parents. To do this, Chihiro must take up a job at a bath house.Chihiro goes to meet with the boss of the bath house, Yubaba. Yubaba wants Chihiro to work there forever so she tells Chihiro she owns her name now and her new name is Sen. While working at the bath house, Chihiro meets some interesting people and spirits such as a a woman named Lin, a radish spirit, a river spirit, and a spirit called No-face. The rest of the story revolves around Chihiro trying to rescue her parents, making new friends, and growing up.The music and animation are spot on in the movie. The animation team had to go far as getting a scene with a dragon and examining a dog's mouth in order to get every particular aspect right. Miyazaki had based Chihiro off of one of his friend's daughter and wanted girls to connect to Chihiro. The animation is beautiful and perfect. The music also adds to the movie by giving it a sense of whimsical and magical elements. The plot was amazing and would've been longer if Miyazaki hadn't decided that a movie over 2 hours wouldn't be that well.The overall theme of the movie is the theme of growing up and maturing. We see this as Chihiro takes on every challenge coming her way and transform from her childish self from the beginning, to the end of the movie.Spirited Away has such little details that seem unimportant at first, but only develop more to the story. Chihiro is a girl that girls around her age can easily relate because of her personality. The adventure revolves around growing up and trust. The characters all are very magical and both children and adults enjoy.The rating I give this movie is 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

I like how the animations are done in this movie its much clearer (for me that is)and is the background music is just awesome.

My Poor Spirit Saw That Movie...,"Spirited Away is an anime-adventure movie from Studio Ghibli directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It's about a girl (Chihiro), that end up in the spirit world, and tries to escape it, of course. It is a movie about having respect to others and friendship, but I didn't expect it to be so bad. I will tell you about the pros and cons about this movie. The movie offered us a great music soundtrack, that I enjoyed. Ok animation, but nothing extraordinary or unbelievable, also, I think the characters were well introduced, and the movie was an ok length. I have seen better animation from Studio Ghibli, for example in Laputa: Castle in The Sky from 1986, where the animation was absolutely amazing. Compared to that movie, here, this animation didn't impress. My favorite character was obviously Chihiro, she was the only character in the movie that I could really understand in some way, emotionally and how she felled about her disappearance in the spirit world. Good voice-actor to Chihiro, one of the best, alongside No-Face, a character that came from nowhere. The cons about it were first, bad storytelling. They showed us some random situations lapped in one movie, many unanswered questions and ended kind of empty. The big holes that made this movie like an incomplete picture. I haven't a favorite scene in particular, because no scene made such impression at me. They also included characters that wasn't necessary to include, what gave this movie unnecessary elements. Spirited away is a basic adventure movie, basic anime, but didn't impress so much, besides some character development and music soundtrack, this movie didn't offer something amazing or rememberable in any way, this movie wasn't rememberable, I think Studio Ghibli could do something way better for this movie, something new and fresh, and not only about secret worlds and big, long dragons.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"Strange, but fun trip through a spirit world bath house.","I saw the movie ""Re-Cycle"" not that long ago and people on boards for that film talked about two scenes that resembled each other so I wanted to see this one. I have seen another film made by this company ""Nausica"" and I could tell there were similarities in music and animation style. Well the bridge scene was a bit similar, but my girlfriend says there are a lot of tales in Asian culture of holding your breath so the spirits can not see you so it really was not to a like. Actually, I found this movie while a bit flawed here and there for my tastes more entertaining than that other film and much more whimsical. A girl and her parents are driving to their new home and get detoured along the way and end up at what appears to be the entrance to a long abandoned theme park. Well the daughter, named Chihiro has a bad feeling about this place, but her parents just have to explore. Suffice to say the daughter's bad premonition about this place turns out to be correct as the parents stumble upon a lot of food in one of the buildings in this place and proceed to eat the food like Goku eats in Dragonball Z. In the end the girl ends up trapped in what is the spirit world, and this theme park which is actually a bath house for the spirits. The girl ends up getting employed by the witch who runs the bath house and has her name basically stolen by her as she goes from Chihiro to Sen, a boy named Haku at times seems to want to help her and at others seems cold to her. Her parents are pigs, a strange creature seems to really like her and she gets to meet all sorts of interesting new chaps. The problems I found with the piece you ask? Well despite a rather lengthy runtime of 125 minutes it still feels like it needed more. Many interesting plot points wrapped up with not enough development, like No-Face.

What a joke,"I just can't believe how highly rated this movie is. Aside from the pretty aesthetic and animation this movie has very little upside. Sen has to be one of the most annoying characters of all time, thinking out-loud with poor and boring dialogue. The story is a shambles, confusing and just straight-up strange. It makes no sense and I wish I hadn't even watched this garbage. This belongs nowhere near the top 200 never mind the top top 20.

a charming and fantastical cult classic,"This very simply (argueably)is one of the finest movies ever made.!!!Because this film is a ""cartoon"" it is discarded by most cinema\movie goers and is a real travesty because it is a touching and memorable story that invlolves a little girl that stumbles into a world of magic and fantastical surroundings who has to find and free her parents that has been turned into pigs by an evil dictator(witch). Her adventure is helped by a boy that can turn into a dragon and various other strange and wonderful creatures. The story whips along at a great pace and everyone that i manage to persuade to watch this film always are confused by the fact that they have never heard of it or studio ghibli(the studio that produces this and many other great classics).Why are great classics like this not rewarded with the publicity they deserve and require here in the west? , i am quite sure that in its native country these films are greatly loved. I suggest to you that spirited away should be watched by everyone ,as a story as good as this one should NEVER be missed , this is a definite ten out of ten.

"No CGI, No Gimmick, No One-liners -- Just Pure Magic","Classical animation is alive and well in Miyazaki's latest anime masterpiece. There were no big explosions or extended CGI or 3-D figures, but it has plenty of rich imagery, a wacky yet poignant story and great animation. The dubbed version got Americanized a little with a few unnecessary jokes thrown in, but the original subtitled Japanese version is the best. Don't miss it on DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wow.  Just...wow,"I can't come up with sufficient superlatives for this movie.The animation was excellent, as you might expect from a Miyazki movie. But what put it over the top was the art direction. The screen is filled to bursting with little details, even in the painted backgrounds.It's funny in parts, and even cute at times, but it never detracts from the story. Again, the details do it. And the voice acting was excellent, better than it was on Miyazaki's Mononoke, IMO. The main characters are all well-drawn and interesting, each one animated with enough personality to make them all very different.While the story follows some of the elements of the Hero's Journey, it's a lot more about a young girl overcoming her fears and doing what she feels is right. The girl is no superhero, just a regular person who finds a lot more courage inside her than she would have ever guessed was there.It's superb filmmaking, and if it is playing in a theater within an hour's drive of you, I promise you that it is worth the trip. If you don't leave with a smile on your face, feeling a fair bit better than you did when you sat down, I'd be stunned.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"The Mystery of Spirited Away's River Spirit, Haku","Spirited Away is a great display of art in animation that has captured the feelings and imaginations of audiences around the world. From its stunning visuals to its engaging storyline, this film is a masterpiece that has become a classic in its own right. In my opinion the best part of the movie is a character named Haku, a mysterious figure who plays an important role in the story.Haku is a river spirit who has a complex and deeply emotional backstory. His interactions with the protagonist, Chihiro, draw you into the film immediately.Hakus backstory is one of the most emotionally resonant parts of the film. Without giving too much away, we learn that Haku has a tragic past that has left him deeply wounded and vulnerable.Overall, Spirited Away is a truly remarkable and timeless film. Its incredible animation and compelling storyline make it a true masterpiece of the genre. Whether you are a fan of anime or simply appreciate great storytelling, Spirited Away is a film that you won't want to miss.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A Wild Ride though the depths of Imagination,"I'm usually not that into anime/manga styled cartoons but this one blew me away. I found this title on IMDb's top 250 list, so I had to see what all the fuss was about.This movie is about a little girl Chihiro who wanders in to a mysterious world of wonders. Humans aren't welcome in this world, when discovered they get transformed into animals. Chihiro's parents have been transformed into sloppy pigs, and Chihiro is now on a mission to get her parents back and return to her home.This movie takes you on a wild ride through the depths of imagination. The thing that impressed me the most were the visual effects, the characters and wild imagination of the designers/animators. The characters are all lovable in each way and the mystery is remarkable. I did not expect to get such a good experience and I do not at all regret watching the movie. This is an must see classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The most overrated animated film ever,"First of all, this film is not for all ages. With so many frightening horror images and disgusting monster characters, it should be rated NC-17.Secondly, the plot lacks credibility. Haku, No-Face and Zeniba, especially Haku, are nice and helpful to Sen just for no reasons.Thirdly, there is no clear objective or aim throughout the film. Sen does not know how to return to the human world with her parents. It is not until the very end that Haku comes up with a solution.All in all, this is probably the most overrated film of all time, and Hayao Miyazaki is arguably the most undeserving director ever.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Amazing!,"I can't say that i'm a huge fan of animated movies. Sure i did enjoy Shrek immensely and also Pixars outings the last few years. But still i felt i was able to appreciate those movies despite the fact that they were animated, not because they were.""Spirited Away"" is one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time. I don't really know what it was that appealed so much to me here, it's something that might be hard to capture. But more than anything i would put it down to the amazing attention to detail. There are simply so many funny and peculiar creatures and figures in this movie. The whole movie just oozes with joy. Sometimes i get that feeling when watching a movie, like if the film-makers enjoyed themselves immensely while making the movie. I get that feeling here, there are just so many good ideas.The animation itself is strange in the same way that Japanese animation often is. It's quite far removed both from the regular Disney-style animation as well as from the computer-animation of Pixars movies. It's a style hard to describe since it seems like a mix between different styles as well. It looks nice though and works very well.I could write a lot more about this movie, but i won't.

An Original Courageous Inspiration,"Spirited Away unfolds as a mesmerizing journey of bravery and perseverance embodied by Chihiro. Her decision to follow her parents through the tunnel initiates an adventure that transcends the ordinary. By choosing not to dine with her parents, Chihiro avoids their porcine fate of turning into a pig and stumbles upon the enigmatic spirit town, ultimately discovering the bathhouse.Facing challenges, Chihiro navigates a watery obstacle to reach the bathhouse. The impending risk of transformation into an animal by Yubaba looms over her, yet her determination to save her parents propels her forward. Following Haku's guidance, she unravels the mysteries of the spirit world, including a coal mining factory and the endearing soot spirit.In a pivotal moment, Chihiro's defiance In perseverance to get a job at the bathhouse and ultimate goal to save her parents and go back to the human world which is all against what Yubaba wants, which is just to turn her into an animal and eat her parents, sets the stage for her transformation into Sen. Struggling to retain her human identity, she resolves to meet Haku at the bridge, reinforcing her commitment to her true self.After actually getting a job at the bath house with her persuasion skills, she gets assigned to the filthiest bath, Chihiro encounters the mysterious No Face, who gifts her bath salts with a hidden agenda. This leads to her resilience during the encounter with the stinky spirit and reveals a profound truth-it's a benevolent river spirit. Chihiro's selfless act earns her a gift from the spirit and the admiration of Yubaba.Later, her refusal to succumb to greed and her loyalty to Haku lead her to reject the gold offered by No Face. Instead, she discovers Haku injured and embarks on a perilous journey to save him while No Face starts eating more spirits. Overhearing Yubaba's sinister plans, Chihiro reveals Haku's blood on her hands to Yubaba's baby to escape, fostering an unexpected alliance with Yubaba's twin who appears to get her stolen seal back from Haku's controlled mind.Chihiro's journey symbolizes more than a mere quest-it's a testament to courage, compassion, and sacrifice. Even facing the malevolent No Face, she extends an invitation to join her on her quest, showcasing her unwavering kindness.Chihiro's final act of returning the stolen seal to Yubaba's twin exhibits her growth, from a timid girl to a courageous heroine. This earns her a very special gift from Yubaba's twin, a magical hairband. Her actions exemplify her commitment to aiding others, transcending personal gain.In the end, Chihiro, now Sen, and Haku reunite to rescue her parents from Yubaba, who tries to trick her into choosing the wrong pigs. But she chooses wisely regarding the pigs (her parents), saying that they were not there, reveals her newfound understanding, able to bring her parents home and the magical hairband becomes a key to recollecting her adventures when she exits the spirit realm.Chihiro stands as a remarkable example of resilience and empathy, offering profound lessons to the youth about facing challenges, embracing kindness, and navigating life's complexities with a compassionate heart. Spirited Away becomes a cinematic masterpiece not just for its fantastical narrative but for the enduring lessons embodied by its courageous protagonist.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

It's a Family Movie that you'll Actually Like. Trust Me.,"The best compliment I can give this film is to say that it deserves to stand next to classics such as ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Alice in Wonderland."" In fact it is similar to these two titles in many ways. The protagonist is clearly a young girl, not a teenager or adult, so that may have you thinking that the tone of the movie will be immature and that it will be an animated feature full of the sort of hyperactive barrage of goofiness that most modern ""family cartoons"" contain. However, like the two movies I mentioned above, the main character serves to bring a perspective of innocence and wonder but still has to overcome many real obstacles. Some of these obstacles threaten her safety and, indeed, her life. I will warn parents that some of the scenes do feature violence and/or the threat of death but let me assure you that it is not done mindlessly or even purely for excitement. It should also be noted as a positive that the main character does not ever resort to force or violence to solve her problems. She uses kindness or bravery to face down her challenges and I can't imagine any parent objecting to letting their (11-12+) children get a break from the villain-smashing fare that dominates the youth action-adventure market.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Half of a great film,"A truly bizarre film (whose English title, Spirited Away, perfectly sums up the film) about a little girls adventures in a bath house for gods and demons. There isn't much in the way of plot, but it sure makes for some interesting viewing.It really feels like stepping into someone's dreams (or rather, nightmares). The film had a kind of warped sense of humour that I really enjoyed. Sadly, it also has some elements that left me completely in the dark. If this is due to the fact that I'm not used to this kind of films and mythology, or if things just get lost in translation, I'm not sure. But the first hour is really good, while the second one drags on forever and loses much of the charm of the earlier bits.The animation takes a little time getting used to. At first, I thought it looked pretty crappy (growing up with Disney and 3D-animation will do that to you), but after a while I could thoroughly enjoy the movie. The animation on the film's heroine Chihrio is especially amazing. All in all, I wasn't blown away by it, but it was still much more entertaining than expected.

Cultural References Are Not All A Film Is About,"Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (Spirited Away) by Hayao Miyazaki is one of the better Anime out there. It's a tale of a girl named Chihiro and her parent's misguided ways and what happens to her as a result of it. Looking at this film at just its face value will make the message all but disappear. The first time I watched it, I didn't have much of the cultural background to understand all the references to Asian Culture nor did I think it had a real underlying message other than what was present in the actual story. After looking at the film from the viewpoint of conflicting modern and traditional values, with knowledge of the culture, everything that the film represents can begin to be deciphered.This message may be lost on some, its something needed to receive the full message and meaning of Miyazaki's films. For example in Miyazaki's Mononoke-Hime (Princess Mononoke) there is a more obvious conflict between tradition and modernity, because of the industrialization of the land. There are some obvious points in all of his films but without knowing what Miyazaki's point is the full message can be lost. His films can be seen as just interesting and entertaining Anime but there is a deeper meaning to them other than just purely entertainment.I'd recommend Spirited Away to anyone who has an open mind and is able to enjoy Anime or Cartoon films in general. There are a lot of messages that will be lost on most people but this shouldn't throw anyone off. The film has an underlying message to it but that's not the only thing the film deals with. Without knowing anything about the culture, or very little about it, people can still find what the message is. This is what is great about Miyazaki's films even without much knowledge of the cultural reference the meaning of the movie can still be seen. Modernity corrupts everything and that no matter what people do the younger generation is the only generation who can actually change the world for the better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Weird Japanese nightmare of epic proportions...not a charmer...,"I watched the English language version of this nightmarish film and I can't understand the lavish praise bestowed on this Japanese animated fantasy. Its colors have a muted, washed-out look as it tells at great length the murky story of a little girl (with a screechingly high-pitched voice that gets on the nerves) who gets separated from her parents and enters the dark world of an abandoned amusement park. None of it makes any sense--at least not to American minds--so there must be something either lost in the translation or lost in the vast differences between American and Japanese culture. If this is a picture kids can relate to, I can only suppose that more kids than I thought are living in a nightmarish world ruled by adults.The story goes on for two hours without presenting anything except turning the girl's world into a nightmare of dead spirits and mean-spirited elders against which she is supposed to eventually be reunited with parents who have been turned into pigs.It's all so weirdly incomprehensible to adults and let me say firmly that there is no enchantment here. Perhaps you have to have the imagination of a ten-year old to see what's fun about this strange and fearsome world. Instead of entertaining us in the manner Lewis Carroll did with ALICE IN WONDERLAND and his cast of weird characters, it is much too dark and intense to be called anything but a Japanese nightmare of epic proportions with elements of other famous fairy-tales working their way through the tale.The dubbing for the English version should have used a different voice than the grating one used for the little girl. Definitely not a charmer.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Great Story, Maybe Not the Finest Animation","In the middle of her family's move to the suburbs, a sullen 10-year-old girl wanders into a world ruled by gods, witches, and monsters; where humans are changed into animals; and a bathhouse for these creatures.This film regularly makes Top Ten lists, whether films for children, best animation, or even within IMDb's Top 250. And sure, it is a great story, with far more depth than the average children's cartoon. So if we are judging on writing, this cartoon is tops.But its overall presentation is somewhat different. This is not the greatest artwork, innovation or style out there. In many ways it is no improvement on many 1980s and 1990s cartoons. Why was this the Oscar-winning cartoon of its year, and why does it continue to be such a huge influence? At least the American version has John Ratzenberger.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Hayao Miyazaki is a genius and it really shines in this masterpiece,"When I first saw the movie, I didn't see what the big deal was. All right, so a girl gets whisked away to a fantasy world? We've heard that story before. And, unlike many other movies, there's no dramatic love story or epic battles and action scenes to keep you at the edge of your seat. Consequently, I didn't think of it as being very exciting.Still, I watched it again and, for some reason, I got it the second time around. Spirited Away isn't meant to be anything grand, with all the bells and whistles. It has a quiet, subdued way of telling a simple story about a simple girl in a very strange world. Instead of expecting something huge, just sit back, watch, and appreciate the world and story Miyazaki has finely crafted for us all to enjoy.To get to the technical aspects...The art is, of course, amazing. The colors are rich and the animation is fluid. When Chihiro and her family first walk into the spirit world, you can practically feel the breeze as you watch it whisk through the grass. The lights of the spirit world at night are breathtaking. And watching the train ride closer to the end of the movie, coupled with the amazing music score (the track is called ""The Sixth Station""), remains one of my most favorite animation sequences out of anything I've seen. Which brings me to another point: the music.I will get this out of the way first - Joe Hisaishi is one of my favorite composers. His music style is very simple, but he makes every note count. Most of his music is quite subdued in nature and takes a careful ear to notice when your eyes are being captivated by what's going on in the screen, but do take notice if you have the chance. Or search on YouTube for videos of his live performances. His music is a joy to listen to. Like with Spirited Away, Hisaishi's music lacks all the ""bells and whistles"" per se, but it's beauty lies in its simplicity. Hisaishi has not failed here in Spirited Away.I dearly loved the characters. One of the best parts of this movie, for me, was that it lacked any clear good or evil characters. Everyone has a bit of both, though perhaps some allow the evil sides of them to come out a bit more obviously than others. In this way, it's very realistic. Granted, the characters were all quite predictable and Chihiro grated on my nerves at times, but overall, I enjoyed each and every one of the characters Miyazaki has create here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Eerie and magical,"This was the first movie from Studio Ghibli that I ever watched and boy did it take me into a whole new world! I was about 14 at the time and I still remember my impression of the lost child and how it quickly turns into her worst nightmare. The intensity portrayed of the bond between new friends is something childlike, innocent, and transient.. I really appreciate the writing, the animation, and the story altogether.As I watched Chihiro's journey unfold, I found myself drawn deeper into the intricate world of Spirited Away. The way the story effortlessly balances moments of whimsy with genuine tension is a testament to the skillful storytelling of Studio Ghibli.One aspect that particularly stood out to me was the attention to detail in the animation. Each character and creature is brought to life with such vividness and personality that it's easy to forget they're not real. From the bustling bathhouse to the serene landscapes, every scene is a feast for the eyes.But beyond the visual spectacle, Spirited Away also resonates on a deeper emotional level. The themes of courage, friendship, and self-discovery are universal and timeless, making the film relatable to viewers of all ages.Overall, Spirited Away is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences around the world. Its blend of stunning animation, heartfelt storytelling, and unforgettable characters make it a truly unforgettable experience. If you haven't had the chance to watch it yet, I highly recommend adding it to your must-watch list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
unusual and surprising,"If you are not Japanese, definitely see this movie with the Japanese soundtrack and subtitles, not dubbed. The sound will then go with the gestures and facial expressions. The story is a great introduction to themes in Japanese culture. The words ""spirits"" and ""gods"" which are used interchangeably in the movie are translations of ""kami"" (you can see the term in the title in Japanese), which is a Shinto concept of a spirit being, not god as thought of by Jews, Christians, and Muslims (who might be offended by a ""stink god"") . Many things in nature are filled with this kind of spiritual power--rivers, winds, rocks, etc. (For example, kamikaze means ""divine wind"" and it referred originally to the two great typhoons that destroyed the Mongol fleets when they tried to invade Japan in the 1200s). As other reviewers have pointed out, the story is about Chihiro's transformation from a whiny brat to a self-reliant, courteous, compassionate and aware individual. The viewer may see a resemblance to Memoirs of a Geisha in the heroine's maturation from a frightened little girl traumatically separated from her parents to a servant who must start at the bottom of the hierarchy and finally to a self-reliant and successful person. Another theme that is similar is the character of the greedy, powerful, witch-like owner of the establishment. Yubaba is contrasted to Zeniba; the former's home is ""in bad taste"" with a lot of imported ornate stuff (from chinoiserie to western-style furnishings) whereas Zeniba's cottage is very wabi-sabi (rustic-archaic) and simple, hearkening back to traditional Japanese design. Another thing I liked about the movie was its complete acceptance of a girl-protagonist (whereas girls are often treated as ""second-best"" in American movies). Japanese gender hierarchy and women's ""submissiveness"" are not as simple as some folks think. In early Japanese history, women were very powerful and autonomous figures--politically powerful, writers, etc. Originally the society was matrilocal and women had considerable say in their personal lives. The emperor is the descendant of the sun-goddess. Women's status declined in the samurai period and the Meiji Restoration, but there are still traces of their originally higher status and importance. So Spirited Away is not only fun entertainment but also a little introduction to themes and values of Japanese culture.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
I defy you not to be enchanted,"I was surprised when ""Sprited Away"" turned out to be every bit as wonderful as everyone said it was  one of the world's rare ""worth queueing for"" films  because ""Princess Mononoke"" decidedly wasn't. Yet behold! And my partner, who's somewhat harsher than me in referring to Miyazaki's previous film as ""Princess Monotony"", was as enchanted as I was.I don't know how Miyazaki did it, exactly. He's created an altogether fresh fantasy world that doesn't come across merely as an all-too-laboured attempt to create an altogether fresh fantasy world. Describe it in words, and it sounds self-consciously quirky enough to put anyone off: it's a bath house for the spirits on the site of what appears to be a disused amusement park, presided over by an eccentric, mean-spirited old wizardess who's mother to a brat of an infant ten times larger than herself, the fires of which (the bath house, I mean) are stoked by a many-armed spider of a man who animates the soot particles to work for him ... and so on. It sounds like too much, too forced; but it unfolds on the screen naturally and magically, as though the world had simply been lying there, waiting to be discovered. And we discover it in exactly the right way (Miyazaki is a master story-teller, although I'd never thought so until now), through exactly the right protagonist: a girl who grows believably from a timid and clumsy outsider entirely reliant on the help and goodwill of others, to a confident (but still, no doubt, frightened) insider, able to help others in turn.Since this seems to be an issue, I should say that it was the dubbed version I saw. But I don't see why this should be an issue. I think that all the anime fans, in whose eyes Disney can do nothing right, who moan incessantly about how awful the dubbed version is, are having us all on. Don't get me wrong: I loathe dubbing. I think that, in general, subtitles are much to be preferred. But I also know that none of the arguments against dubbing, good though they are in general, happen to apply here. Dubbing is bad because it prevents the actors from really acting, from projecting their own words with their own bodies and vocal chords; but this can't happen in a cartoon in any case. Dubbing is bad because the match of mouth movements to words is never quite good enough; but this isn't live action, and it isn't even a Disney-style cartoon, with every sibilant, every quiver of the lip, lovingly captured by the animators in 24-drawings-per-second detail: Japanese animation is not and was never meant to be detailed in that kind of way, and I'll wager that the English soundtrack matches the lip movements about as well as the Japanese soundtrack ever did. Dubbing is sometimes bad because it's possible to dub something into a language that just doesn't fit, which MIGHT have happened here had it been an important part of the story that it take place in, say, Tokyo; but in fact it's set in an uncertainly located, almost surreal fantasy bath house; under the circumstances it doesn't matter in the least what language everyone is speaking. In short: just this once, you can go with the dubbed version (which, I might add, has been dubbed with both love and skill), and you needn't feel embarrassed about doing so.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Life beyond Pixar,"There's no doubt that Pixar Animation Studio is the greatest thing on animation in modern times. I use to love any effort by them, being Monsters, Inc. my all-time favorite so far. However, yesterday I rented this movie 'cause I've been hearing some great things about it, and after watching it, I just have to say that Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi it is not just a great movie, this adjective is almost insulting: it's awesome, it is spectacular, it is mind and sight challenging, and is a round film from wherever point you wanna see it. Said in a few words, it's a masterpiece of modern times, which spends most of his time in a parallel (and surreal) world of ancient Japan. Sen to Chihiro... has so many powerful stuff to stand out for. It has one of the strongest imagination I've seen in my entire life on animation, and also there's a lot of inventiveness, believable profiles on characters (and they're animated!), perfect on detail drawing (yes, hand made, traditional drawing), pulse accelerating action, humor, an outstanding and subtle soundtrack, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Even the closing song is not less than beautiful.As much as I love and respect Pixar, this one blew me away enough to place it on the same level as the films made by the most popular animation studio. I just couldn't believe my eyes as I was watching it. Is that simple. This experience is magical, involving, marvelous, and one more great thing about it is that you don't have to be a manga fan manga to truly enjoy the trip; just have to be an animation lover. Well done animation. And that doesn't happen much; it did to me with The iron giant, but that was some time ago.Mr. Miyazaki, I knew nothing about you or your work before Chihiro, but, from this point on, you have become my hero and I can't wait to have on my DVD player any other piece of animated heaven you've created.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"A visual masterpiece, but a failure at storytelling","Some call Hayao Miyazaki the Disney of Japan. In regards to this movie, I would like to offer my own analogy: he is the Don Bluth of Japan--he's an amazing animator, but a horrible storyteller.The story starts out with Chichiro and her parents. They stop off at what looks like an empty carnival and the parents begin eating. This show of gluttony and greed transforms the parents into pigs, and as night falls, the spirits that inhabit this place come out. Chichiro winds up trapped with the spirits and winds up being captured by a witch who steals her name and forces her to work in the witch's bath house. Now it's up to Chichiro to get free and save her parents.There are obviously more characters that I have not mentioned, but that in a nutshell is the plot. The problem is that Miyazaki doesn't want to develop it. Instead he opts for what seems like 1000 different sub-plots.One deals with a river spirit, one deals with the witch's sister, another deals with a spirit called No-face, and the list goes on. The main plot is essentially forgotten until the very end of the film, and is resolved in the most trite of ways.This is really the movie's big problem. It's as if Miyazaki and crew came up with a million ideas, and rather than pick one or two, they picked all of them. It doesn't only affect the plot, but also the look of the film. I understand that many of the creatures are traditional Japanese spirits (and I'll be the first to admit my lack of knowledge of Japanese culture), but there were simply too many weird creatures that serve no purpose. The witch for example has a baby that fills an entire room and three severed heads as assistants. Why? Because they could.I honestly hated this movie. When it was finished I felt flabbergasted. It was uninvolving, nonsensical, pretentious, and boring. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I honestly cannot understand why this movie is so well-loved. In my humble opinion, it is complete and utter drek.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

"An instant classic, truly heart-warming","Animation is not my favourite medium of film but I have always been fascinated by it. I cannot draw to save my life and so watching some of the greatest artwork ever created come to life before your eyes can be overwhelming. And that is what Spirited Away does, it brings animation to life.Unlike other animations that focus on action or special effects this is all about the story and characters, and these ore some of the greatest fictional characters I have ever seen. Whether it be the leads of Chihiro and No Face to the supports of Lin and Kimarji they are all fascinating to watch and you quickly get attached to them, willing them on to succeed in their given tasks.Tha animation itself is also some of the best I have ever seen, it is fluent and bursting with color and life. Every character is beautifully realised and there voices are perfect Talking about voices, this is where I get stumped. Most people agree that the original Japanese dialogue with subtitles is superior to the dubing. But I cannot make my mind up, apart from the witch i find all characters to be equal in their dubing and Japanese versions. The dubing is also easier to understand (although it can border on Disney-ification sometimes, a lot of work has gone into the dubing and it shows. Only the witch really sounds better in Japenese.Overall this is one of the greatest films I have ever seen and easily the best animation, whether 12 or 112 you will LOVE this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Total Rubbish,"This film is what happens when you get a bunch of creepy Japanese animators with too much time on their hands.  This film is utterly pointless.  A girl wanders around a compound full of ghosts looking for her parents avoiding alot of gruemsome muck.  The main charachter has no character.  She goes from one weird place to another hardly commenting or expressing anything, outside of the stereotypical eye thing japanamation likes to do. It's full of monsters and ghosts doing vague and unusual things trying to be scary. I'm not for being spoon fed meaning in nice bite sized packages but this makes ""Brazil"" seem focused and straightforward. The film, like many of the charachters, just wanders and lingers around like an alztimer's patient trying to find his way out of a run down funhouse.  Visually it is pleasing, but so is my blender.  If you want to see a bunch of well illustrated weird stuff with no point whatsoever then this is the film for you.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A deep moralistic tale created by an imagination the likes of which I have never seen...,"Its in English, excellent dubbing, one of the best I've seen.  It's a really magical movie, such as Field of Dreams (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0097351). It's about morality, good and evil, greed and love, loyalty and distrust.I'm not sure that I've seen any movie put so many deep moral issues into a single story so successfully.  For the videophiles, the animation is the best I have seen of any Anime.  If this is what they are putting out in Japan now, we are so behind the times now in the U.S.  It was more fluid than Princess Mononoke (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0119698).Don't read about the story behind the film, at all.

unbelievable masterpiece!!,"I ran and took the metro for about 45 minutes way across state lines. Living in Northern Virginia, this show was playing in only 2 theatres in the DC metro area (composed of DC, VA and MD). I had to head to the Mezza Galeria in Friendship Heights way out on the edge of NorthWest DC on the border with Maryland. Basically it is a trip that I will never forget and I will now always associate that area with the greatness of witnessing this masterpiece.. This film has already grossed over 200 million dollars and won major awards at film festivals, all without even being released in North America. Until now....Basically put here it is (not giving any info away that would be VERY wrong). Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (Spirited Away), is a trip about a 10 year old girl who enters a magical spirit land with her parents who end up imprisoned. It is up to 10 year old Chihiro to find the strength inside to survive and perhaps rescue her parents.But this film isn't about that plot, it is about the imagination of youth, the magic and characters who exist in this world, and about growing up and gaining courage.I'll say this. I am having a really REALLY hard time putting the emotions I felt after witnessing this masterpiece on the screen. The scenes are masterfull, the animation is incredible, the backgrounds are pieces of art, there are things that happen in great stillness, and in great motion that take your breath away. It is very funny, and charming. However what separates this film from say Miyazaki's last recent work Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) is that this film is more universal for all ages and more imaginative, incredibly so on the later. Where Mononoke was more political and intriguing and ingenious this film is something every person can relate to including 7 year olds. As one earlier minor review I read said, ""Kids will like it, parents will love it even more"". I can't begin to describe my jaw gaping mouth that stood there hanging almost every 5 minutes at what I was witnessing.. I could spend hours describing the myriad of characters in detail, but I would be writing to the end of time....There is a scene in this film that just highlights everything that is grand about this movie. Chihiro takes a train ride with 3 spirit characters all very different and unique in their looks and personality. The purpose of the ride is simply just to go from A to B. Its not important for the story, it does not advance the plot on the grand scale of things. It is just something that is simply there to look at.This scene had me in tears. Not because it looks sad, or the characters are tragic, or because the story at this point is so gut-wrenching (think of the opera music scene in Graveyard of The fireflies). It just pulls the emotion out of you because it is just so mesmerizing and beautiful to watch.This film which has just been released in North America, looks to be in limited release so far. I'll put it to you this way. I am not a major fan of Japanese anime, but I have seen a small handful of good ones. I was speaking with people after the show, and I ran into one guy who as he puts it, has seen SEVERAL anime movies. He said this is the best one he has EVER SEEN. Period.This film is going to be HUGE.. It just may get the North American public addicted to Japanese anime, an art form that has been nothing more in the eyes of America as an overly grotesque cartoonish immature art-form, that seems to be overtly sexualized, and overrun with violence and nonsensical stories. This film will not just break that barrier, it will be a tidal wave of movie history crashing through it with tsunami punch! If it DOES NOT... then anime does not even deserved to be shown in this country to be appreciated. I can't see this film not being a huge buzz within the next few days. The audience I was with which was very varied kids and adults of all ages, were entranced and applauded massively when this film was over in celebration.I can only think of one film I have seen that is of this level and would rank now as a tie after seeing this film for best film of the year (that would be Monsoon Wedding). A very different film obviously which can't be compared to this.This isn't just a great animated film. This isn't just a great Japanese film. This isn't just a great award winning film.

A sweet movie but that's about it,"I was expecting to be wowed by this movie but found it really disappointing. Please do not think I am ignorant in terms of film. I enjoy animation and watch plenty of subtitled film. The animation itself was superb, so crisp and bright, nostalgic in many ways. The score really complimented it also. I just did not really enjoy the story. It seemed to be very jumbled and trying to get too many themes and messages across. Greed, coming of age, friendship, even environmental harm. It was just too much. I found nearly all the characters somewhat annoying apart from Haku. The young girl who was the main hero grated on me after a while. The spirit world also was confusing. It was hard to figure out who was good and bad at times and I pondered whether all the spirits were actually being held prisoner. I also thought the ending was a bit lame. Without giving away too much they introduced a character towards the end and it somehow felt only to bring the movie to a conclusion and help the young girl. I would have liked to have seen a bit more of what happened after. A strange movie in many ways and I am baffled as to why I did not enjoy it and so many people rave about it and it lays claim to being one of the greatest movies of all time. Maybe I have missed something, I really don't know.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
There is one word that could be used to sum up this film: nice.,"This film is just a pleasure on the eyes to watch. The number of amusing characters like the soots (those little friendly comical squeaking black balls of ash). The art style used was brilliant as well, including great backgrounds. The music it self was the part that makes the film, I say. The tune that plays when they are in the train is the best. But mainly the music is so calm and can make you feel very relaxed, it could even bring a tear to your eye if you're that sensitive. First time seeing it, it is quite scary especially at the beginning when the sun sets and after they are off the train. The story is great as well and not so weird as to confuse you. Although saying these things the film is fantasy and if you don't like fantasy, you won't like the film which is a shame as it is so very good. The main plot (family moving to new home father wants to take a look around is turned into a pig along with his wife, young daughter has to save the day) feels as though you've seen it being used somewhere before. But that doesn't matter as the rest of the film makes up for it. Children Will love it as well as adults. The amount of clever ideas used never seems to end as a world where anything can happen (not to sound cheesy or anything) and unlike films you get here, the fact that the weird things are left unexplained as to what they are or how they came to be get rid of boring scenes of characters trying to explain these things and taking up good film time. Forget the nead to ask: why? and just sit back watch one the best films you will ever see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Pure spirit.,"To me, ""Spirited Away"" is about the ability of children to see the truth because their vision is not clouded by greed and prejudice and how adults ignore the observations of children at their peril. It is also about the redemptive power of hard work and how true satisfaction and happiness come from striving to do our best in difficult circumstances rather than from being fed and entertained. And it is about being true to oneself in the face of temptation and fear.""Spirited Away"" is a beautiful, inspiring movie with a pure heart.

When Chihiro and her parents were on their way to move to their new house, Chihiro's dad thought that he could take a shortcut but the shortcut led them to a strange place, a world of witches and monsters but a great paradise place. From the beginning the place had no people but there were loads of rich food that made Chihiro's parents eat them. Later they turned into pigs and Chihiro didn't because she never ate her dish but she gets help of a boy (Haku)who promises that he will save her parents.

Chiriro's parents stop and decide to take a look what is on the other end of that tunnel. They make it to the other end and Dad thinks it's a shut down amusement park. Chiriro is scared and wants to go. The parents want to continue to look around. Dad smells good food and tries to find where this food is. They find it at a store. The parents gulf down the food. Chiriro looks around and sees this small bridge which leads to a huge Japanese style castle. A boy named Master Haku tells her to get out before it hits dark. Chiriro runs and looks for her parents. Her parents are still eating the food, but Chiriro has found that they turned into pigs. Now Chiriro must get a job at a bathhouse for gods and spirits get her parents turned back into humans. However she gets into many other adventures along the way.Review:10/10 The Japanese always make excellent films like Seven Samurai, Hidden Fortress, Akira, and The Samurai trilogy. This is another excellent film. Japan is known for it's animated films. Now when Spirited Away hits wide release in the U.S, Japan will be known for this animated film, Spirited Away. This film is much better than any Disney film, which is saying a lot when you look at Disney's history. Ironically Disney has bought the U.S/European/Australian rights to this film, go figure.I must say how very imaginative this film is and how colorful it is.

Brilliant and Imaginative,"Animism is a belief that a soul or spirit exists in every object. Shinto, the native religion in Japan that goes back to 500 BC, has incorporated many of the ideas of animism, worshipping the spirits of mountains, rivers, rocks and trees and using rituals that connect people to nature's timeless flow. Many of the spirits and stories from the Shinto religion are depicted in Miyazaki's animè feature Spirited Away and the director has said that many images in the film came from his childhood memories of traditional Japanese culture. Spirited Away won the 2003 Oscar for Best Animated film and has been deservedly praised for its imaginative story, brilliant colors, and superior technical achievements.As an unhappy ten-year old girl, Chihiro, travels with her parents to her new home in the countryside, they take a wrong turn and end up in what they think as an abandoned theme park. Separated from her parents, who partake in a gluttonous meal, the little girl is drawn to a bathhouse for spirits and enters an alternate reality. Her parents have been transformed into pigs and she is trapped in a world she can barely understand. Chihiro does not change or grow up suddenly but calls upon her inner strength that she barely knew existed to help her out in dangerous situations. She is helped by young Haku, an assistant to Yubaba, the bathhouse manager who tells her that her only chance is to ask Kamajii for work in the boiler room (Miyazaki said that he was trying to show Japanese girls who never had to work the experience of hardship). Kamajii in turn sends her to Yubaba (yet another wicked witch stereotype) who steals her name, calling her ""Sen"" and gives her difficult tasks that she must undertake successfully in order to free her parents and return home.Along the way, Chihiro encounters physical and psychological dangers. There are no simple villains in the film but there are many repulsive creatures such as a boiler room boss with six tentacles, a giant grotesque baby, rolling heads, stink monsters, and the like. One wonders where these images come from since Japanese gods have no actual form and elementals in mythology are part of the simple beauty and magic of nature. Yet, unlike the Disneyfied view of the world with sharp lines separating good and evil, Miyazaki's film is ambiguous and shifting and Chihiro must adapt, figure out the world she is in, and learn whom to trust.When Chihiro begins to control her own destiny, she creates supportive friends to help her complete her tasks and, in the process, discovers abundant courage and a sense of responsibility. As she and Haku move toward freedom, they both realize that they cannot escape their enslavement until they remember who they really are, a metaphor for all of us groping toward our spiritual connection. The power they find does not consist of magic spells or objects to render opponents senseless but the energy that flows from love, forgiveness, and non-violence. Spirited Away is a remarkable achievement and a film that left me feeling uplifted and connected to a greater reality.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Better Than Average Cartoon Spirited Away,"This is Japanese animation and is done very well. Japanese animation is currently the state of the art in this genre and is very popular worldwide. This type of animation does not pay as much attention to detail as older Disney animation did, but makes up for their lack of detail with more action-oriented storylines and sequences. Disney films used to be sensitive to the psyches of young children, and in some cases, even older children. Japanese anime does not concern itself with these problems; they just draw it up as they imagine it, and look for audience response from their efforts; negative or positive. This, in my opinion, is a rather reckless approach to animation, however, it is undoubtedly entertaining. So, parents, be aware your child will be at risk while viewing some of these Japanese cartoons, but will most likely still be entertained by them. This particular one, Spirited Away, is a bit more sensitive to younger viewers than most other Japanese anime; so you can take your kid to see this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Spirited Away: 10/10,"Alice in Wonderland, eat your heart out, there's a new fantasy that surpasses you. Spirited Away is one great film with superb animation and characters you actually care about.Chihiro is voiced by Daveigh Chase, aka Lilo from Lilo and Stitch. She and her family are moving and are almost at their new house when a wrong turn leads them into a tunnel. It begins like a Scooby-Doo episode. Mysterious characters running around an abandoned theme park. But the rest of the movie unfolds like no other. A feast is layed out, and Chihiro's parents start pigging out and-of course-turn into pigs. Soon other characters come out and Chihiro flees for her life. Various, and odd, events ensue.I have got to say-if there was ever a movie for everyone in the family to enjoy, this is the one! Interesting characters, interesting events, and interesting visuals encourage a very interesting moviegoing experience. We have got to hand it to Miyazaki (the director), he's created another world that will stick with us for the rest of our sane lives.I'm not into animè at all, but the animation was-wow! It looked like two different settings-the very realistic background and the obvious characters. The emotions on the humans were very real (or as real as this movie could be). All of the various ""others"" from the opposite world were life-like and seemed real. However, there was one thing that I didn't fully understand-what was the purpose of No-Face? He could have been just in there for linking purposes, but it doesn't really bother me one iota.A lot of times, my heart was a'going th-thump. There were many tense moments, many funny moments, and many, many powerful, dramatic moments. You smile when Chihiro is happy; you're sad when she is sad. There are some movies that can make you do that, but not many. A very creepy moviegoing experience.The 124 minute runtime seemed to run by quick. It felt like awhile for the movie, but you hardly noticed it. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. When I walked out, I heard some other kid say, ""It was OK, I guess."" Spirited Away is not really a little kid's movie. They'll be too scared and will not be able to fully grasp the potential of the film. They also seemed upset because it was ""so long"". Don't go to many more movies, kiddos. This'll seem like a commercial.Miyazaki, if I could, I would shake your hand.

"Splendid soundtrack, average film.","After years of hearing how incredible this film is I decided to give it a go. I should say that I don't usually watch anime but I do love animated features such as Lion King, Toy Story and Ratatouille.I could understand what the film was trying to do by letting the viewer experience a fairytale world come to life. The animation was also vibrant and quite incredible from an artistic and technical point of view.However, I could not help but feel let down by the lack of substance in the story telling. I did not get most of the characters and didn't like many of the characters other than the protagonist who was okay. Her parents, who are meant to be the reason she goes through this difficult journey, seem like snobs and as such the little girl's trials ultimately feel pointless.Although I should add that the last 15 minutes are very touching and make the film seem worthwhile watching.Definitely watch it to see if it's your cup of tea but as I much as I like animated films, I will not be returning to this one as I have to countless other Pixar/Disney films.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

The Movie That Made My Childhood,"I remember watching this movie when I was around eight or nine years old for the first time and it was the first movie that both scared the living crap out of me and also stunned me with its vivid animations. As a kid this mix of feelings made me fall in love with this movie.The story was a bit beyond me at that age. Than one night I remembered this movie and how much I liked it as a kid so I made it my goal to find the movie, I rented it as soon as I could. Watching it now I am still just amazed at what a great movie it is and the story is wonderful! It's the kind of movie that really doesn't change with age, Hayao Miyazaki created a true masterpiece with this that can be enjoyed by children and grandparents alike. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
one of the great movies,"What can you say about this movie? It's one of the great movies. It's about discovery, love and adventure. What more can you really ask for? The movie really is simple yet is so inspiring and touches you to the core.Sen here used to be a self-absorbed girl yet this world that she finds herself in opens her eyes to so many things and finally giving her the strength to fight for what she wants and freeing her parents. She also finally does things for others. What an inspiring story. Good, really good. This is what a movie should be. it should inspire and touch people with the sincerity of the story. most movies now want to manipulate people's feelings but this one doesn't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
one of my favorite films of all time,"i just saw this film tonight, and i am totally blown away.  i was expecting to love this film, because i love all of the hayao miyazaki work that i've seen.  there was so much imagination and creativity and life in this film. i could watch it many, many times.  the breathtaking backgrounds, the intricate animation, the complex and original story, the intriguing characters:  they were all amazing to me.  one thing that i love so much about miyazaki's work are the little details, the moments when things pause, and something small but so beautiful happens.  or the little details, of how a child moves through a big, grown-up world, that so many other animators don't think about.  miyazaki pays attention to and honors so many incredible things, big and small, and weaves them into his very imaginative stories. he has a very talented team of artists and animators working with him.  i highly recommend the film.  i feel very lucky to be able to see this wonderful japanese film on the big screen in the united states, and to live in the same age as this great animator, hayao miyazaki.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Another excellent movie from Miyazaki.,"This film is not as overtly violent as was Princess Mononoke (Mononoke Hime) but violence does not make a movie worthwhile usually.  Instead the story and animation are both superb.  This is very reminiscent of the early 90's Disney works (Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, Aladdin).  But unlike Disney the characters don't break into song every other minute!  The most impressive aspect of this movie was that even though the movie may be freightening to young children it also conveys a message (yes a moral) to the audience on two different levels...for children it tells them to be brave in the face of adversity and for adults it tells them to be aware of your child's feelings about any changes that they or the family might be going through.  Miyazaki yet again has produced another masterpiece that the American public will not be aware of and those who might be aware of it will generally be biased because it is an animated film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Indisputably brilliant,"A film like ""Spirited Away"" is an incredibly rare gem. While works of absolute genius do appear most years (and 2001-2002 has certainly seen a lot of these movies reach our screens), they are so often the sort of films that can only be recommended to hard-core film buffs, generally because they would be dismissed as ""strange"". Films which are easy to watch, entertaining, and yet are absolute and indisputable works of artistic genius are few and far between.All this said, ""Spirited Away"" meets all of these requirements. With some of the most beautiful animation you will ever see, clever dialogue, brilliant characters and some fantastic social commentary, it works at so many levels and can, and should, be appreciated by everyone. Unfortunately, the majority of animations which come to western cinemas are only able to be truly enjoyed by school-age children, and a lot of children beyond a certain age are reluctant to either watch or enjoy them at risk of being ""childish"". As a result, truly original animations which appeal to an older demographic are rare - Richard Linklater did a brilliant job with ""Waking Life"", but unfortunately that could only really appeal to a small group of adults because of the high-brow intellectualism of the ideas explored in it. Films like ""Toy Story"" and (breaking the tradition of all sequels being pathetic) ""Toy Story 2"" are usually the only exceptions, managing to appeal to adults with a more sophisticated style of humour.BUT ""Spirited Away"" is, despite being technically a ""children's"" film, the sort of movie that almost no-one is too old or too young to enjoy. Very few movies like this exist, even though a lot of films are marketed as being ""all-ages"" films. The sheer imagination that has gone into making this film cannot fail to bewitch anyone who sees it, and it has so much which can appeal to older viewers, particularly the many satirical and poignant comments it makes about contemporary capitalist Japan (such as the faceless people on the train, lifeless, barely there). This film will probably never truly make sense, which is the beauty of it. There are no cop-outs - it truly embraces the surreal and the imaginative, without ever becoming conventional or at all unoriginal.I saw this film in the original Japanese version, and would suggest that people watch it in this version if they can. But really it should just be seen in whatever version is available, doing whatever it takes to see it. No really - it's worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Alice in (Japanese) Wonderland,"WATCH THIS NOW!!! This is a truly cracking film. It is the sort of film that I wish that I had seen as a child. It is weird and wonderful, but never feels forced. There is a whole world in this film which is so genuine that you cannot help but suspend your disbelief. Wonderful. See it. BUT BE WARNED!!! This isn't a 'kiddee Disney' film - but it is not a film exclusively for grown-ups, nor is it a film for Jap-cartoon purists who freak that the animators have sold out to Disney, and it definitely isn't a film for ART-SWINE scum, who watch the film subtitled and then talk about it over a glass of wine and a wedge of brie. NO!!! It is Alice in Wonderland!!! It is Bedknobs and Broomsticks!!! Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!!! A childrens story so good that it can be appreciated by grown ups too. Please, don't view it as an art film or a foreign film. It is foreign (to the majority of people who can read this) and has fine art. But you and your brie are embarrassing yourselves. Please leave the Brie at home, view it in your mother tongue, bring some children, or, at the very least, view it as the wonderful kids film that you were born 30 years too late for.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Spirited Away,"I quite liked the look of the new house that ""Chihiro"" and her parents were to move to, but she isn't so keen, and being ten had the weight of the world on her shoulders. En route to meet the removal men, her dad takes a wrong turning and soon, together with her mum, end up at the end of a tunnel. What would you do? Go in of course! Luckily it's quite a short walk before they find themselves in a small village that's full of shops all laid out for a banquet. Mum and dad tuck in but the young girl just wants to get going. Ignored, she explores a little as they gorge themselves and that's when she encounters the young ""Haku"" who suggests that she might like to leave. Snag is - her parents have quite literally now gone a bit porcine and she's going to have to rely on her new friend if she is to rescue them from an impending visit to the abattoir. A job is her first task, and for that she needs a contract with the wart-nosed witch ""Yubaba"" - and so off we go on a series of marvellously creative escapades discovering some coal spirits; that her friend has a secret identity; her boss an huge great baby and the entire place serves as a sort of bathhouse for the enigmatic ""No Face"" whose agenda isn't clear to anyone, though we do know he has a rapacious appetite and can make his own gold! The detail of the animation is astonishing and coupled with the mysticism of ancient Japanese folk lore works really well at creating a characterful and engaging story. I just love the lithe dragons of Oriental mythology as opposed to the scaly, stodgy, European ones. The concept of identity underpins much of the narrative here, with not just ""Chihiro"" but pretty much everyone else coming to terms with flaws and strengths in their personalities requiring a degree of human spirit, trust and forgiveness if ever anyone is to thrive and if ever she and her folks are to get to that new house on the hill. It's two hours really goes fly by and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
It's all good with Ghibli,"This was a really fun film to watch.  Miyazaki's imagination depicts a whole other world through the eyes of young Chihiro.  The colors  radiate life especially the garden scene which looked awesome on a digital projector. The story's so straightforward but it's the journey of telling it that fascinates and draws you in from beginning to end.  I remember talking to friends after seeing it and we all had interesting points.  I felt the film focuses on Chihiro's innocence as compared with the other characters she encounters, but her child like views are so carefree (and naive at times) and her youthful exuberance  really makes it endearing.  Another friend said it was a coming of age and how Chihiro herself progresses throughout the film.  I mean, if you can find so much insight in a film, you know you have a great film.Spirited Away is not too dark and there are plenty of laughs throughout.

Great Manga,"I have seen Mononoke, an excellent film, but overall I was not that entertained by it.  While there was a large amount of action, I felt that some areas tended to drag, the animation was of high quality, but not that imaginative.  Plus I saw the dubbed version and Claire Danes gets on my nerves.  Overall a 7-8 range movie, good, not great, a video rental but not a DVD purchase.Spirited Away took my breath away.  While less violent than the Princess, it is far more entertaining.  Mind you, I enjoy violence in Japanese Animation which makes my approval of this movie all the more suprising.  Ninja Scrolls, Ghost in the Shell, Akira, all violent and excellent animation features.Spirited Away is completely different.  Manga targeted towards a younger audience but still highly entertaining to adults.  Similar to the Simpson effect.  There were so many scenes that amazed me which were all sewn together in an excellent storyline.  A few examples, the dragon battling with paper dolls, the train on the water, Haku moving about at blinding speeds, the dust balls, the tiny crow and the rabbit renacting the freeingof Haku.  AWESOME.Everyone should see this in the theatre.  It is truly an event to behold. Particularly since Hollywood these days seems incapable of coming up with anything fresh or new.This movie is so completely different than any kind of American film its refreshing.Run, don't walk to a theatre near you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Beautiful and heartwarming,"Although I am in no way a fan of Japanese animation, this movie is nothing short of exceptional. I have watched it countless times, and it never gets old, only better. It is a children's fairy tale - however, there's depth to it that makes it more of a fairy tale for adults that want to remember what it was like to be a child. The message (a common one for Miyadzaki's movies) is simple and beautiful, and although he is not a religious fellow, entirely Christian in its essence: not physical strength, fame, money, or brute force will make a difference in this world - but love, hope, strength of heart and self-sacrifice. The hero of Miyadzaki's movies is not an all-powerful superhero, but a small, insignificant and frightened little girl, who nevertheless finds the courage and strength to do what her heart tells her is right. Just as in most of his movies (and another very Christian aspect), while there is evil present, no character is truly evil for evil's sake - the mean giant baby is just a spoiled fussy child, and even the ""wicked witch"", Yubaba, has a sense of justice and is capable of love. The characters are all memorable: the adorable coal spirits, the Faceless spirit, the dragon - just to name a few. The animation is brilliant and the music is mesmerizing. I have yet to see an animation film that is more magical. My favorite scene: when Tihiro rides the train through the water. Sends shivers down my spine every time!In summary, its a masterpiece and fully deserving to be in the Top 100 movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A wonderful film and a joy to watch,"The opening, with the 10 year old heroine and her parents driving to their new house, gently draws you in to a believable world of spirits, bravery, adventure, humour and love.

Our 12 year old daughter was reluctant to see the film and then was entirely captivated - as were we (and we are somewhat older than 12).  If you've not seen it - then do; you won't be disappointed.

Soon, Chihiro is ends up in a world of magic, evil witches and strange creatures. Spirited away keeps you gripped from the very beginning.

"A great movie, though not a ""masterpiece"" in my opinion.","I hadn't rewatched Spirited Away since it first came out and it was time to revisit it now that it is commonly referred to as the ""best Miyazaki movie"". And upon rewatch I have to say my opinion is the same: it's a great movie, but didn't blow me away like Princess Mononoke if we are comparing Miyazaki movies. The animation is of course fantastic, the story is original and well written, and the characters interesting. I do not mind the ""weirdness"" of it as other reviewers seem to have an issue with since it comes with the territory for this type of movie and I rather enjoy that. It's just that there are too many moments when it's not necessarily super engaging, as if some entire scenes are just fillers to make the movie longer and do not help the plot to move forward. Still, while not Miyazaki's best for me (which, again, goes to Princess Mononoke in my opinion) it is still a great work of animation I would recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Touching and entertaining anime thrill ride,"I had waited in massive anticipation for this movie. As much as I loved Princess Mononoke, I felt that Hayao Miyazaki could do better. And I was so very right. This movie was beautiful and amazingly done. The dubbing has been some of the best I've seen in his films, and the voices match the characters perfectly. Yet again, Miyazki takes us into a magical world where spirits rule and man is regarded as basically a common animal. It is up to the brave and endearing Chihiro to save her parents in this strange place.

The greatest movie of the modern era,"Spirited Away: 10/10Wow, WOW. I missed Spirited Away at the cinemas, because it was before my movie craze that has developed this year. It looked interesting from the commercials I saw, although I didn't really have any clue what it was about - Yubaba's giant head was scary. I picked up the limited edition DVD box, which is beautifully designed and includes an awesome special feature DVD. I watched the movie with English dubbing, which I'm always wary of, but it was superbly done this time. On the surface, this looks like a children's story, but in execution it's for everyone. Spirited Away was one of the most enchanting experiences I've ever had, Miyazaki produced one unbelievable masterpiece, deep in Japanese culture. It was a rollercoaster of emotions, and I never looked away from the TV screen. Everything, EVERYTHING was so perfect. The animation was beautiful, the music was beautiful, the story was beautiful, this was PERFECTION. If there is one DVD you get this year, make it this! It's an unforgettable experience, and is one of the greatest things I've ever seen. The special feature DVD is great as mentioned, and ""The Making of..."" makes you love the movie even more, and respect Hayao Miyazaki as a brilliant man and director.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A look at the best film of 2001 (and 2002!),"I originally saw this film back in March 2002 and had planned on leaving comments on it but for some reason I passed.  It's been many months since then and I've seen it 7 times total now and it's simply amazing every time. It truly is one of the finest coming of age stories of all-time and is a visual masterpiece.  Although not my favorite Miyazaki film (this ranks slightly behind Tonari no Totoro), it's certainly leagues beyond any other animated film in recent years.I decided to wait until I had seen the English language version (I've gone to it twice already since it opened on the 11th, 3 days ago) to comment on it here on the IMDb so I could take a look at the version most people would likely see.  I am a big fan of anime but I am not one of those obsessive sub-only purists, if it's dubbed well then I can enjoy it just as much as the original.  Surprisingly, I enjoyed the English language version even more than the Japanese and Cantonese versions I saw by a good bit.  The voices all seemed very appropriate and I enjoyed the few added lines that were included.  I was a little bummed about how when Haku says his full name they did not leave it in Japanese, I think it would have been better with saying how it sounded so royal, etc. but that was my only nitpick.  Disney did a wonderful job in the English language production, now only if they would market it some (I've not even seen a tv spot here and the ad in the newspaper was very small) and put it in more theatres they may find they have a fairly successful film on their hands to go along with its status of critical darling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wonderful Adevnture for whole family,"This film brought me in and didn't let go. I was enticed by its mystery, beauty, and weirdness. I am not usually an anime fan but this has now got me interested in trying anime and has also taught me the lesson to not judge a whole genre by what I've seen glimpses of aka ""don't judge a book by it's cover."" I thought this was a wonderful film that was different and well put together. The adventure that this girl goes on, was the farthest thing from normal, and all though childish at times, it made me want to be a kid again. I hated the evil villains and loved the heroes (heroins.) This is one of the best family films I have seen in a long time and I enjoyed it along with my entire family.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
A Masterpiece,"I just saw this movie in a theatre yesterday and I still cannot stop thinking about it.The story is in the vein of Through the Looking Glass, but I honestly feel that movies like Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland only wish they could have the depth of this film.  The world presented and the characters included have so much perspective to them that I could sit down and analyze for hours.The movie is a true fairy tale.  Love conquers all, hard work is rewarded, etc.  However, where it is a fairy tale is that Miyazaki is not afraid to be dark.  Many times in this movie the viewer is filled with the same dispair that we see in Chihiro.  The scene near the beginning where the spirit world opens up around her is both breathtaking and absolutely chilling.To sum it up, very few movies I have ever seen have completely whisked me away to a different world and I felt truly there.  A completely different reality.  Any movie that could have a label of fantasy attached them attempts this, but rarely do you completely feel enveloped in this foreign world. In the past year, two films have done that better than any other films I have ever seen, Lord of the Rings and Spirited Away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

A half-hour went by, then another half-hour, thenanother and eventually another.  Nope, can't be the story.  Thestory's nice, heroic, a little scary, a good morality tale for little kids.But on a school night there were no little kids in the theater.  Therewere some technically brilliant flashes of animation, especially inSen's facial expressions.  All told, maybe 5 seconds' worth.

Spirited Away,"Spirited Away is one of my best movie that I saw. It was made in 2001 in Japan. It is called Sen to chihiro no kamikakushi in Japanese.This movie was written by Hayao Miyazaki who is one of the famous writer in Japan, but recently he is known all over the world. His studio Ghibli warms people's heart very much.The main character in this movie is Chihiro. The story begins in the car. Chihiro is moving to the new house with her parents. On the way to the new house, there was a traffic jam so her father plan to shortcut between the forest. Then there was a tunnel. They get off the car and pass the tunnel, next there was a long path so they pass it again. After that, there were some opening-restaurants. Chihiro's parents were hungry so they start to eat, but she didn't eat. She roam around and noticed that something is strange in that place because faceless spirits are walking around as night falls. She suddenly go back to her parents place but it was late. Her parents changed to pigs. She run to the path and cried. Then a boy named Haku found her. Haku promise her to help her. He suggest to go to the strange big building to work. That building is a bathhouse for Japan's spirits and gods. Everything were strange there to Chihiro but she keeps searching the mysterious why her parents changed and how can she help them. Do you think she can find the way home....?This movie is a kind of family, fantasy and adventure story. It tells us how valuable is to help your important person. If you like a heart warming movie I really recommend you to watch it. Well...it's a little childish movie so maybe it sometimes make you boring. If you watched this in a different language instead of Japanese, I want you to watch it again in subtittled because you can feel more reality!

Outstanding vocal talent,"I actually admire Disney's moves to bring Miyazaki to the US. Purists will inevitably defend the authenticity of the original presentations but you can tell that Disney has invested significant effort into bringing great films such as ""Spirited Away"" to our neck of the woods. The vocal talent is amazing. I would probably like the subtitled versions just as much but I also have to give props to Disney for caring enough to pair this and other Miyazaki classics with distinguished vocal actors such as Gillian Anderson, Michael Chilkis, Phil Hartman, Suzanne Pleshette, and Christian Bale, just to name a few. I don't have a problem with subtitles and I would gladly watch the Miyazaki films as they were originally released but I beg to differ with anyone who has any qualms about Disney's dubbing. Whereas Disney's own animated films, sans Pixar, have been utterly mediocre (""Lilo and Stitch"" was probably its last best animated release), they seem to make up their failure through the incredibly successful importation of ""Spirited Away"" and its ilk.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Excellent. Miyazaki's best.,"Starting with the bad news (which there is hardly any of). The movie is 125 minutes long with credits but you will wish it were 187 minutes long. The film has one very noticeable (but fairly standard) continuity error.The good news, it is one of the best films you will ever see. It ties with Fellowship of the Ring as #1 movie of 2001. Unforgettable story and visuals will make you want to see it again and again.The story involves a girl who is accidentally in the spirit world when her parents (who later become pigs) take a wrong turn on their way moving to suburbia. Haku helps her through the maze of gods and spirits but he may be working for the Yu-Baaba (which literally in Japanese means Bath Crone). But enough story. Go see for yourself why this is such a good movie. When I saw this film I saw the English dubbed version. Like Mononoke it was a very good dub.Rated PG for frightening and violent images. Suggested for ages 9 and up.If anyone from Disney reads this please make Spirited Away a huge DVD with a DTS-ES track and loads of features from the Japanese DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

The amazing thing is that, unlike so many japanimation films that are confined by efforts to convey distant and unrealistic lands through the most realistic animation possible, this film is judicial in its' efforts by using realistic animation (or animation based on reality) when necessary, and utilizing creative images that allow an escape from reality.  This aspect, as well as the great storyline and memorable characters, made the movie completely engrossing.

Best Animated Movie Ever,"Without a doubt this movie is a huge journey of random encounter but with an entire symbolism in itself in Japanese mythology as well as just total anime randomness.

Th voice acting gives a great mood of the personalities of all the characters. The story even is a critical and somewhat at times confusing. This movie is definitely more for the less narrow minded.

The story and the art are in the detail,"There are numerous and inevitable comparisons of Spirited Away and Alice in Wonderland but I think they all miss the mark. The vision that Hayho Miyazaki conjures up is so unique and quirky that many critics seem to reach for a comparison just to attempt to get their minds around what they have just seen. My view is such comparisons do disservice to both works.Chihiro is something of a tiresome brat at the beginning of the story, an easy place to start that everyone can recognize. (Already we have diverged from the story of Alice) It seems that only her diminutive size renders her appealing. She needs rescuing, but not from the forced relocation she deplores as you might think, but from her own ennui and, possibly, the unintentional neglect of her own parents. This is a situation that most children can recognize or relate to, even ones who were children decades ago as well as those too young to recognize what is going on.This is where much of the true art comes in, and what makes so worth watching. Chihiro becomes more real in each frame. Her story of growth is pieced together meticulously but with nearly unbreakable mortar. She starts out passive and rightfully afraid of nearly everything that is happening to her, but with believable resilience, some luck, and some help from odd strangers she graduates from simply enduring to actively engaging her challenges in a way that is truly inspiring.One of the most important aspects to the story is that once Chihiro is in the spirit world, she is treated like an adult. She may not be cherished at first (actually actively despised due to no fault of her own), but she wins the chance to sign an employment contract, an act not common to 10 year olds. Once she does, she has made her own place and is accepted. She still must deal with derision from most of the creatures who populate the world (""not for a human"") and the unwelcome regard of her employer (sorceress Yu-Babba) but at least she finds a low rung on the social ladder. She must give up even her own name and take the name Sen, becoming someone else that must win Chihiro back, as well as the restoration of her parents.A key insight of the artwork lies in the fact that Kamajii, the spider-like boiler room attendant, Yu-Baaba and Zeniiba the twin sorceresses with way over-sized heads, and Bou, Yu-Baaba's gigantic baby, appear the way they do not because that is the the way an adult would see them, but the way a 10 year old girl might. Miyazaki-san has managed to reach back in his mind to see this, helped with his observations of a daughter of a friend who was about that age. An overbearing old woman's face would dominate the field of view of a girl as small as Chihiro, and the busy workman's arms would seem numerous and far reaching.One thread that I would have like to see played out more is the story of Lin, the hardworking and seemingly human girl who takes risks on Chihiro's behalf before she secures a contract, and then is delighted to take her as an apprentice, although she publicly hides it. (""Don't dump her on me!""). She is kind to Chihiro when she doesn't have to be, and looks after her. Rin has her own story that hasn't been told, in a respite moment she tells Chihiro that she wants to leave the bath-house where they work. Following Rin's lead most of the rest of the bath-house workers, who once despised all humans, are cheering for her to succeed. But Rin and Chihiro don't even get to say goodbye.Much has and will be written about the fantastic paintings come to life, and the incredible attention to detail that makes the movie more lifelike in many ways than a conventional reel would be. This is probably better experienced than discussed, but there is no flaw or fault in any frame that you can find. I am completely floored by critiques of this film that have anything bad to say about the animation  don't listen to them. You will only be cheating yourself; it does not get any better than this.Update: I got around to watching this again with the Japanese soundtrack, and as others have mentioned there are some fairly significant deviations between the Japanese and English versions of dialog. Further, the English subtitles to the Japanese track are not always perfect translations -- mostly pretty good. (When Chihiro says ""Hai!"" it can mean, ""Yes,"" ""Yes 'm,"" or ""right."") Unlike some other reviewers I think the English version is in many ways superior. In many cases dialog is not dependent on lip-sync, and the American writers took advantage of this to interject some things that would otherwise be unclear. I would recommend everyone watch both versions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
ok but unsatisfying,"I don't understand all the excessive praise of this film. I really love animation when it serves to free the imagination and spirit but this one just seemed forced and off the cuff, without any deep feeling and the animation was choppy and distracting. I did like the girl, Sen. She was very natural and believable. I also liked the use of water surrounding the spirit island very much, it was beautiful. I almost bought the dvd sight unseen, so sure was I that I'd love it. I'm really glad I didn't because I'd never watch it again.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Beautiful, well drawn, a near masterpiece","First off, if you are a typical American animated movie lover in the typical style of Walt Disney, this movie may not be your cup of tea.However, if you have seen and enjoyed movies such as Mononoke Hime, Totoro, or Graveyard of the Fireflies you will LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie.First off, the movie is far more accessible than Miyazaki's last few films. However, all of the elements that make the Studio Glibli movies top-notch are here - In spades; Great art, traditional Japanese themes, (such as ecology, spirit gods, honor, courage) unique off-beat characters, strong lead roles (both male and female) - they are all here.

Not A Great Film.,`Spirited Away' is well animated film but suffers from a poor story and uninteresting characters. You can add all the freaky dragons and netherworld spirits you like and marvel at their strangeness but what do they add to the story? There was no intrigue and no real character development. to me it felt like watching a anime version of the Nutcracker Suite except with over the top symbolism (things like the greedy parents turning into pigs).`Mulholland Drive' accomplishes much better the kind of storytelling through emotion `spirited away' attempts.4/10,4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
The most imaginative movie...ever?,"On a purely plot-oriented basis, Spirited Away could go down as a classic fable that charmed and touched millions of people world wide. That's on a PURELY PLOT-oriented basis. In actuality, Spirited away is so much more that it's almost indescribable. Trying to encapsulate in words what this movie is would be impossible for any reviewer, but many, including myself, will try.Spirited Away is a visual landmark, not only in animation, but in the entire realm of story-telling. Every scene is perfectly crafted. The imagination that oozes out of every cell of this hand drawn movie is mind boggling. Hayao Miyazaki, the creator of Spirited Away, is considered one of the greatest animators of all time and with good reason. His movies have charmed viewers in Japan and American anime fans, like myself, for years. Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke rank as the #1 and #3 grossing movies in Japan's history. Both were made by Miyazaki.However, while Mononoke was a nature oriented war epic, Spirited Away is like a child's fairy tale. It tells the story of a young girl named Chihiro who must escape from a fantasy world after her parents and her get lost in an abandoned Amusement park...to say more would ruin the film. Just know that every scene, plot twist and character from that point forward is perfectly crafted. The uniqueness and beauty of EVERYTHING you will see is unparalleled in modern film making...and it is all held up by beautiful hand animation and a marvelously touching story that does not draw lines between good and evil, but shows you every character as he/she is and allows you to be the judge.Believe me when I say that the best decision you could make this year regarding movies would be to see Spirited Away.

A classic children's film,"Like many of Hayao Miyazaki's films, Spirited Away is a fun movie that at the same time provides thoughtful themes and stunning visuals. The main character, Chihiro, is both easy to relate to as well as inspiring, and like many other characters in the movie, she is very distinct and memorable.The movie is extremely well paced, with both slow, thoughtful segments as well as quick action-packed sequences.Though it does not hurt to be familiar with Japanese culture and mythology (as it certainly adds a lot to the movie), it is not necessary to enjoy the film.

Like Belleville Rendevous, there's some scenes inthis film that simply leave you aghast at their strangeness, beautyor inventiveness.

An Anime Alice in Wonderland,"There are about a half dozen things I want to see over and over because I am sure there are gold nuggets buried here I haven't mined yet.This movie is so magical, so mystical, so beautiful it leaves me breathless. It leaves me with a huge list of questions I cannot answer. Is it a real experience? Is it a dream? Is it a magical spell? What really happened? Are the characters symbolic or allegorical? (Should I study Japanese mythology to learn more?) Chihiro is moving to a new home. A spoiled brat, unhappy in the back seat of her parents car, she is taken, unwilling, into a strange world when her father takes what he thinks is shortcut that becomes a dead end. Tired of driving, he wants to explore. Chihiro is afraid, but she is more afraid of being left behind.They find what seems to be an abandoned theme park, where her hungry parents come on a restaurant. They sit down and start to eat. Chihiro is too nervous to eat, so she wanders off. When she comes back, her parents have magically been turned into pigs. And so the magic begins.You don't need to write a master's thesis on this movie to enjoy it. You don't need to answer any of your questions to enjoy it. In fact, this movie stays with you. Its scenes will wake you at night with insights and beauty. The music will haunt you, though I challenge you to remember a single musical theme.I have experienced genius here.

Great animation; good movie,"This Japanese film, which I saw under the title ""Spirited Away,"" has glorious animation. However, I found it somewhat long and often repetitive.It probably makes better cultural sense in Japan, without dubbing, but the basic concepts of loyalty, truth, bravery, and sacrifice transcend cultural differences.The main character, Sen, is totally believable as a young girl in a bizarre setting, who learns to adapt to new people, new customs, and new emergencies.  When Sen sets her jaw and follows through on a plan, I felt like saying, ""Yes!  Go for it, Sen.""Warning:  I would hesitate to take young children to this film. It has many frightening scenes, and could be the source of nightmares or worse, even in today's kids who have ""seen it all.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
weird,"I describe this movie as a ""collision"" between Alice in Wonderland, Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, and a role-playing video adventure game.Alice because of the story.  Mononoke because of the look-and-feel and the tone of urgency.  Totoro because of the variety of walking wandering teddy-bears.  And video game because of the episodic way in which missions/quests are doled out to the main character.Overall, I think I would have enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't already watched other Miyazaki films.  But since I have, I consider Spirited Away to be merely a G-rated (more G than PG) version of Princess Mononoke.  Good for the kids, but not the best Miyazaki film for adults.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Japenese Alice in Wonderland,"It is hard to find a cartoon that can please both those who love both anime and animations; this movie is one that does, the craftiness of the script, the whole new world and fantasy is all well glued together all you need is the imagination to be able to access this Japanese Alice in wonderland.Spirited Away is a critical acclaimed film and it finds its way to the top of many notable lists of greatest animated films of all time. During its release it was the highest grossing Japanese film ever and in the 75th Academy Awards it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.This 2001 Japanese animated film is written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki who is a Japanese film director, animator, manga artist and screenwriter with a career that has spanned over fifty years, his films are often about humanity's relationship with nature or humanity and technology. The protagonists in his films are usually strong, independent girls or young women. His career in animation has led to many comparing him to Walt Disney.The movie plot starts with Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents who were traveling to their new home when her father decides to take a short cut which got them lost.While they kept moving they strolled into another world where Chihiro lost both her parents and she was being hunted and disliked as she was the only human in the world she was in.Chihiro's journey led her to meet the twin grandmas, a dragon, a no face spirit that can eat anything in sight and she also met a giant baby who is afraid of germs. Now Chihiro most always remember her name so she would not forget she is a human and be able to tell her parents apart from the pigs all this with her trying to find her way back to her world.Spirited away is based on Miyazaki friend's ten year old daughter, he decided to make a movie for her and her friends who come for vacation in his cabin with his family.With the characters mostly hand drawn and a budget of $19 million dollars, Miyazaki and his production crew decided to keep the graphics simple so that the focus of the movie will not be diverted from the story.The English adaptation of the film was done by Walt Disney Pictures under the supervision of Pixar animator John Lasseter; also on the production crew was Beauty and the Beast (1991) co-director Kirk Wise who acted as the director in this English adaptation and Aladdin (1992) producer Donald W. Ernst who was also the producer in this flick.I still stand to say this is one of the best animations out there, the fantasy level is high and the twist and turns that it brings makes the whole movie very interesting and a nice movie to see with the family.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
mind-blowing masterpiece,"In my opinion, ""Spirited Away"" is certainly the best animated movie ever. The quality of animation is obviously rousing and leaves no doubts who is the greatest master of contemporary animation. Hayao Miyazaki created fantastic, surrealistic world with great reverence. Every shot from this film can be regarded as a work of art as well as every single scene takes my breath away to such an extent that I can't even point out which one made the biggest impression on me. Nevertheless, the beautiful workmanship is not only virtue of this flick as ""Spirited Away"" provides also extremely coherent plot. It occurs that Miyazaki's imagination has no limits. The main heroine is entangled in a series of unexpected events having their roots probably in the mythology. The story develops through and extensively uses the main heroine. All characters are incredibly likable, which unceasingly attracts viewer's attention. ""Spirited Away"" is a very universal parable which works on many levels and offers, at the same time, a unique experience. Thus, I consider this film an absolute masterpiece and I highly recommend it regardless of age and any other factors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Pure Joy,"I've been a fan of anime for years.  Unlike many anime watchers, my first exposure wasn't to ""Akira"" or ""Macross.""  It was to a movie called ""Warriors of the Wind"", which I learned years later was actually a hack-job version of the poetic ""Nausicaa in the Valley of the Wind"" by Hayao Miyazaki, a man compared often to Akira Kurosawa, and who many call the most gifted anime director of all time.Miyazaki's film ""Princess Mononoke"", which was imported to the US and released by Disney in an English dub, was an ecological fantasy where humans and ancient gods dueled for the fate of nature.  It was a dark and dramatic epic of culture and tradition.  In comparison, Miyazaki's latest release, ""Spirited Away"", is unadulterated joy and innocence, a two-and-a-half hour fable of courage and perseverance.Young Chihiro is moving to the country with her parents.  On the way to their new home, her parents come upon a seemingly abandoned theme park and, despite the protests of their daughter, begin to gorge themselves on food they find.  When night falls, the theme park transforms into a land of shades and phantoms, and Chihiro's parents have been transformed into pigs. Chihiro receives aid from a strange young man named Haku, who tells her that to stay in the spirit world and rescue her family, she must get a job from the witch Yubaba, who cannot refuse her request.  During her stay in this strange world, Chihiro undergoes many trials that put her courage and her love for others to the test.The movie itself plays like ""Alice in Wonderland"" filtered through Japanese folklore.  I admit, I didn't understand many of the concepts of the movie because of its reliance on such things, and while at first the movie seems not to have a coherent plot, keep in mind that anime in general has never fully subscribed to the linear plots of American cinema.The colors and designs of the movie are fantastic, and there is no shortage of unusual beings.  Tiny soot monsters who work for an eight-armed man, a bulbous Radish Spirit, and a majestic river dragon are a few of the inhabitants.  The most poignant of the movie's characters may be No-Face, a lonely spirit that consumes all he can.  The tone of the movie is generally light, with moments of drama and darkness when appropriate, but always filled with a resonant innocence and wonder.The voice acting, while not as star-studded as that of ""Mononoke"", is quite good, with seasoned actors like Suzanne Pleshette (Yubaba) and the ever-popular and multi-talented Tara Strong providing solid dub skills. Daveigh Chase, wonderful as Lilo in Disney's ""Lilo and Stitch"", is Chihiro, and while some of her readings sound a bit shrill, she is a very believable and realistic voice for the plucky heroine.When all is said and done, the movie may lack the drama and desperation of many anime, but instead of offering this, the movie is content to transport you to another world filled with joy and mystery.  Few movies display as much pleasure as this one in displaying moments of awe and laughter. Never mind that the animation itself is beautiful and intricate as only a master could create.  If you are lucky enough to be in a city where this movie is showing, by all means, see it as soon as possible.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Beautiful and unpredictable,"Having two kids, I know all children-family movies by heart. I do like Disney movies. I've seen almost all of them, and had great time.Chihiro is different. The movie is digestible for the kids (mines are 8), it is funny sometimes, but has much more complex meaning than other ones, born from the Western civilization. It is full of mystery, excitement, color. The characters have real nature, they all have both good and bad characteristics, so you can never predict what happens next. This makes the film even more fascinating, you see the ""cruel"" witch being an adoring mom, or appreciating great performance. The actions are not overexplained, you have the room to build your own interpretation.The Eastern philosophy and culture would be enough to attract us, but it has more than that.

What a rich movie,"Before we left the theater, after watching the film with our mouths hanging open, we were making plans to see it again. What a rich movie. The story is of a 10 year old girl who reluctantly follows her parents down a short cut to their new home, and become trapped in the world of the spirits. The girl's strength, determination, judgment, trust, love and friendship are put to the test as she works and struggles to free her family. But of course, the film isn't only about that. Every moment is filled with symbolism and imagery on multiple levels. Themes of the sprits relation to the living, stewardship of our world, identity, greed, prejudice loyalty, love, journey, and the healing power of hard work - play throughout. Perhaps what I like most is that it shows us a story of how to be true to yourself and knowing who you are,  and how that enables you beyond fear. I am sure this story is based somewhere in mythology, but to call it a fantasy or fairytale would be selling short of the *perspective* firmly grounded in reality. This is not animated in the lush 24 frames we are used to seeing in big studio releases. But it much smoother than the expected Speed Racer style movements. They carefully worked the English dubbing to the mouth movements and it shows. Backgrounds are lush and beautiful and clearly display the artists hand. It is directed by Hayao Miyazaki who has also directed Princess Mononoke among others. What a master of the art. I don't think this is a film for young kids. The 10 year old is often in serious danger and left on her own. Her parents are disrespectful to her. The sprit world has necessary imagery that youngsters would find disturbing and confusing. I know it is not in general release, but keep your eye out for it. It would be a shame to miss this movie that is so pure in heart.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Stretching the second half into some relationships cliché is nothing as an explanation to the whole alternate reality setup. The implications are very explosive but the point looks malicious to me. Yes, the imagination is hyper here but relating it to the real life (if that is what it is called) doesn't seem right. The characters are carved aptly and in parallel to reality, but the climax kinda bamboozled me.All show & no sense is the statement I'd like to frame for the ending sequences. Highly exasperated with the outcome, I seriously doubt the intentions of the makers.

Miyazaki's Best Yet!!,"Here's an easy one: If you come across a shop with a sumptuous spread of food and the proprietor is not in sight, do you: (a.) Start eating the food with the intent of settling later, or (b.) abstain from eating--regardless of the temptation--because it was wrong. In the film, two out of three respondents answered (a.) and were transformed into what they behaved as: pigs. Such starts out Hayao Miyazaki's finest work to date, ""Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi."" (""Spirited Away"" in US theaters) This is the finest animated film I have ever seen and is near the top of my list of films of any genre.The main character of the story, a 10-year old girl named Chihiro Ogino, is a normal child thrust by her parents into a strange world and is immediately left to fend for herself--as she was the one out of three who chose the correct course of action by not eating the food. Throughout the remainder of this beautiful film, she is faced with numerous choices--each crafted by Miyazaki to emphasize the importance of living a virtuous life. While the specific cases use things from Japanese folklore, traditions, and culture (and Miyazaki's incredible imagination), the fundamental virtues apply Universally to all.One admonition: the English-dubbed version, though touted as being true to the original, actually changes the nature of the film slightly.The original Japanese language release, subtitled if necessary, is a truer rendition of Miyazaki's imagination.On a scale of ten, I'd give this one an 11.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Be Sprited Away,"People call Hiyao Miyazaki the Japanese Disney but his work puts him on a far higher plane and Spirited Away shows this. The film starts like a fairly typical take on Alice in Wonderland or Narnia. A modern day girl is bought into a fantasy world and has to find her way back. But Miyazaki takes it even further. His heroine, ten year old Chihiro is a typically modern girl, upset about moving house and afraid of her new life. But after her parents take a detour into a strange tunnel she finds herself trapped and worst of all, her parents have been turned into pigs.Miyazaki's fantasy world is quite simply jaw dropping. Strange creatures, some drawn from Japanese mythology others just from Miyazaki's mind populate this world and the bathhouse where Chihiro has to work. Just the images stay in your mind long after the end credits have rolled, an endless landscape of water, the cherry blossom fields.But it's not just the fantastic images that make this film one of the best. The characters are utterly compelling and it's easy to forget when watching them, particularly the evil witch Yubaba that they are just cartoons.Ignore any negative comments about this movie, an academy award, several million Japanese and countless film critics can't be wrong.

Chihiro's Sacrifice and Selflessness,"At first glance Spirited Away seems to be another knockoff kid's cartoon, but actually is an adult movie that shows the corrupt modern society and its weaknesses. Hayao Miyazaki directly related the story to the problems of modernity compared to a traditional sense. The main character Chihiro is depicted as a modern girl who throughout the story captures traditional aspects in her life. Through Chihiro, Miyazaki shows the audience how the younger generation can change from a corrupt way of life, but the older generation is incapable because of there greed.In the beginning of the movie, Chihiro is shown as a needy week little girl with arrogant parents that wouldn't even help her across a large creek. Crossing the creek changed the present day into the traditional world with a very Buddhist undertone and Daoist overview. Miyazaki represented everything in the traditional world as a symbol. The Bathhouse, were most of the action happened, symbolized purification because water meant cleansing. From the point she entered into the traditional world she had to overcome fear by herself. Overcoming fear by yourself is a very traditional idea, and throughout the movie she becomes more and more brave and self-reliant.Chihiro was able to overcome many obstacles throughout the movie because of her selflessness and her willing to do whatever it took to get her parents back. She risks her life twice during the movie through compassion. When she pulls all the garbage out of the muddy monster that represents sickness of modernity, Miyazaki is saying that you can cure the problems of society and that you can go out and clean it up. The second time she risked her life, she cured the monster No Face by sacrificing the pill that could have cured her parents. Miyazaki is telling the audience that you can solve the illness of society through compassion and sacrifice.I would recommend this movie to anyone that would like to see how the younger generations can save traditional ideas in the modern world. In order to understand the deeper meaning that Miyazaki was trying to portray, leave your idea of a good movie behind. Being able to see beyond the surface, and understand Miyazki's true meaning of the text will help you interpret the ending of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Unparalleled amination; for confirmed Miyazaki fans,"I've never seen animation art to compare with the art in ""Spirited Away."" The detail, the perspectives, and the colors - especially the colors - are extraordinary. Miyazaki has never done better.This movie, however, is not the one to use to attract new Miyazaki fans. It's for those of us who know and admire his work already. Those who are not familiar with anime will not find ""Spirited Away"" as accessible as Miyazaki's other works.  There are more surreal images, more symbolism, and more layers here.Gluttony seems to be a theme in this movie. Sen's parents are imprisoned in the form of pigs, punished for gluttony. Miyazaki seems to be making a connection between gluttony and misuse of the environment.A vast, stinking, filthy creature that seems made of pure corruption comes to the bath where Sen, stripped of her name, is forced to work; with Sen's aid he vomits up much of the debris of our world. A faceless spirit eats everything in sight until Sen stops him.Despite these images, the movie is visually stunning.  I've never seen colors so intense and vibrant, or such clear-line detail.Go see this movie while you can; it is in very limited release. But if you have friends who have never had the good luck to see Miyazaki's work before, do them a favor and show them ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Princess Mononoke"" first.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

The voice actors match the characters very well, embodying the personality flawlessly.This is an excellent movie, definitely rivaling current classics. Hopefully, the next generation will know and love this movie the way this one knows ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Alice in Wonderland"".Visionary, beautiful, poignant. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
What is wrong with you people?,"I rented this thing, based on movie critic recommendations and the comments on this site.  Is this a case of the emperor's new clothes?  I am not afraid to say that this is a complicated, unfocused mess!  I will agree that it is very imaginative.  Unfortunately, it is the over-active imagination of an 8 year old.  I know there is some symbolism behind the story and imagery, but the weirdly meandering plot distracts you from appreciating it.  I will also agree that it is very different from American animated fare.  That is a warning and not a compliment.  I now realize the stupid dialog and plot lines from the Japanese cartoons they show on Cartoon Network are par for the course.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

I have been spirited away.,"This movie reminds me why I love anime so much. Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (AKA Spirited Away) is everything an Anime should be and more.The animation was so beautiful (still not comparable to the 99.9% realistic animation in Final Fantasy, but that's an entirely different area). That environment was breathtaking.That's the beautiful thing about this movie. From now on, when I think about Great Anime, I will look at Spirited Away, and THEN Akira. This movie deserves the Oscar for best animated film. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Shocked!,"As I'm not a fan of Japanese animation I went it to see the film with some suspicion that I might not enjoy it, but as the story started to unfold I couldn't believe I was ever thinking about not watching this film. It has to be one of the best animated films I've seen for a long time in terms of thoughtfully constructed plot and dazzling effects.It is also a welcome change from the CGI animation that came with the Toy Storys and more recently Finding Nemo, although the animation isn't as believable as those created by Pixar they are still a work of art. Being the first time I'd seen a Hayao Miyazaki film I didn't know what to expect and now intend on watching a few of his older films like Princess Mononoke.Although partly produced by Walt Disney there is no sign of the usual sentimentality that they enjoy filling with films such as Pocahontas and Treasure Planet. I really do recommend this film to anybody no matter what age you are even if you're not a big fan of Japanese animation. Some smaller touches towards the end of the film which really make it worth while watching, is the interactions between the mouse and bird!Even though 'Spirited Away' can be just seen as an enjoyable film the underlying messages about love conquering all and the dangers of greed and sloth are examined within.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Amazing film,"Miazaki's Spirited Away is a masterpiece in every respect and is a milestone in animated film by its warmth, complexity and richness - the old Disney films feels very feeble in comparison.The basic story is not much different from many other animated stories, about a seemingly normal world that proves to be enchanted, where humans, occasionally, intermix with gods and ghosts, with unexpected results.Compared to Miazaki's earlier works, like My Friend Totoro, Porco Rosso and Princess Monoke, it presents an even more complex and fantastic world than any of these, and yet they are closely related. In My Friend Totoro there are a few supernatural creatures, in Porco Rosso there is a man who has been turned into a pig by a curse, in Princess Monoke the gods battle with humans, while in Spirited Away we have a multitude of gods, ghosts, a few humans, like the heroin's parents, that like Porco Rosso has been turned into pigs.Complex sagas about the battle of good and evil, and that the good can become evil and vice versa.Spirited away just does it to the n-th degree.a 10/10, without doubt!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
best animated film i've seen,"This has to be the best animated feature i've seen ever. i just love every aspects of it. The colour is so vibrant and lively and just seems to grab your attention for the whole duration of the movie. The plot is uncomplicated but very involving. you always feel for Chihiro all the time as she wanders along in that wonderful spirit world. i love the music and most of all the characters and their interactions in the film. Chihiro is just soooo cute!!! it probably helps as well that my first experience of this film is from a subtitled DVD. although i haven't heard the dubbed version apart from the trailer i saw on the net, i always feel that the subbed version always convey the story and feelings way better than the dubbed. all in all i sincerely hope that this film goes on to win the oscars. i've only seen Ice Age and Spirit:Stallion of the Cirmarron and i can assure you that Spirited Away is infinitely better than both of the above. Although Lilo and Stitch maybe good, i doubt that it'll be as good as Spirited Away. let's hope those academy people get it right on this one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
See it. Just go. 'Nuff said.,"If there's a reason Japanese animation is so popular in our American culture, I'd guess its something with the conventions. Anime doesn't have the same basic rules American animation has, and therefore it can show us things we've never dream of. For example: A witch with a head the size of a grocery cart that runs a day spa for demons and spirits.Trying to describe the rest of Hayao Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" is like trying to describe a dream you can barely remember. There are key images you can't forget, specific emotions that felt too real, and for the life of you, you can never accurately explain how they all connected.Now since this is an animated film from Japan, I feel I need to clarify one very specific thing. I am not a big fan of anime. There is only one anime movie on my shelf of movies, and its ""Princess Mononoke."" It's not a coincidence that this film was also directed by Miyazaki. He is the single best director of animated movies because his characters have depth, his stories tell about the most basic human emotions, and he draws or redraws a majority of the frames himself.""Spirited"" has been compared to Alice in Wonderland, and I can't think of a simpler way of explaining it. Chihiro, a wiry 10-year-old girl, is our Alice. The movie opens with her and her parents moving to a new town. A wrong turn brings them to an abandoned theme park. But when the sun sets, the exit disappears, and Chihiro finds her parents under a curse. She is alone in a world full of spirits, demons and really big headed old women.Chihiro's quest is not an easy one. She must save herself, she must save her parents, and she must find a way home. These quests are side-tracked as she meets employees and guests at the day spa. There's the boiler room operator, a man with six arms whose mood lightens when Chihiro visits. There's a river spirit that's so polluting no one can stand the smell of him, Chihiro stops at nothing to help him. She befriends the misunderstood No Face, a demon that won't stop eating anything, including the not-so-lucky day spa staff.What I find most amazing about the animation is how little computers were used throughout the production. There are a few backgrounds that are sparsely rendered, but they look more like moving oil paintings and are used as a contrast. All the onscreen action, all the character's faces and emotions, all the minute details of this Wonderland have been perfectly realized by the world's best animators and the great Miyazaki.Go see this movie. It is a feast of sensational visuals; it is an amazing story of meager people doing epic things, and as long as you're outside, go rent ""Princess Mononoke."" Films such as these can not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Great movie to watch with your whole family,"The animation is beautiful and the innovative creatures and beasts make the bath house feel like a different world. The bath house is also a great allegory for capitalism but it doesn't overshadow the entertaining and unpredictable plot. In other words, Miyazaki doesn't force his critique of capitalism down your throat. The characters are decent and their arcs are good but they're not anything special outside of the visual aspects.

The movie has been called the 'Alice In Wonderland' of anime... and it's true!,"When I saw that this gem of director Hayao Miyazaki was being released here, I was itching for the day I could see it.I am a lover of beautiful animation, story telling and I have to admit both in this movie were great.In the movie, Chihiro is the beautiful portrayal of the 10 year old girl, whose reluctance to moving to a new home has her worried... What is she to do in this foreign place, all her friends gone. The movie starts out with her parents taking a hilarious shortcut to their new home, and from there the fun begins.The hijinks that await Chihiro are both moving and hilarious. This film is rooted in Japanese mythology, and at times you can be awed by how Miyazaki portrays it. Often you will wonder if he is showing you reality, or just how Chihiro envisions it.Throughout the film you see the maturing of Chihiro, and it was a flawless depiction of how a 10 year old girl learns to adapt to her reality, wherever it might be.I definitely thought the movie was worth my admission fee, and more.My rating: 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

A massively overrated piece of work,"An over-mannered and terribly awkward movie - the plot struggles to cohere and the animation is by and large rigid and inexpressive (look at the faces of the witches, for instance). Worst of all, however, is the voice acting. The lead, especially, squawks in the most grating way imaginable; some of the more gifted members of the English-language cast do their best, but struggle with a very limited script and emotional range. There are a few flashes of style in the visuals, but this movie is a clumsy and unfortunate reminder of how far the animated genre still is from mature achievement even as long after 'Akira' - there are less acclaimed animations you would be better off renting instead.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Facsinating,"After claimed-to-be-the-last Princess Mononoke, here came Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi by Miyazaki. I suppose the whole world is crazy about it, and of course it's worth.The story starts with Chihiro and her family going on the way to their new house. They get lost and go through a gate to another world. When Chihiro's parents see the food in the market, they just sit down and eat but they turn out to turn into pigs. Chihiro is so scared but then when night falls, gods and spirits appear. Chihiro has no clue about anything happened but she keeps going. She gets a job in the bath house, finds out more and at last manages to leave this world after a series of events.You must find the whole film is quite interesting and all the spirits and gods look really funny. We seem to be with Chihiro throughout her whole journey in the world of gods and spirits. She has a very pure heart and works really hard even when she's in trouble and doesn't understand the whole situation. When the Witch tries to take away Chihiro's identity and fool her around, Chihiro's belief really stands and gives her the way home. She's also willing to accept and help others, be them evil, strange, nasty, or greedy. Maybe the personalities she possesses are something we need but have lost. Of course identity is more than our names, but what the names mean to others counts most. Otherwise we'll just like No-Face.Miyazaki's way to process the whole film may be a bit exaggerating compared with his previous works, but that makes it more enjoyable and more suitable for children. I've watched this film for five times, and every time I'll have some new thoughts. The inspiration brought by the film is of course subject to viewers, but I'm sure everyone will be fully satisfied with the film.This is surely one of the best imaginative animations I've ever seen.

However, I could I give less than 9 when the graphics are so beautiful and the creatures he creates are awesome and the characters are stunning? How could I ignore the metaphors he's always doing? Well, I couldn't, so I gave it a 9.For those who are wondering if this is worth it: just watch it. I mean, right now.

Swept Away,"I'm no expert on anime, but I know what I like.  And I liked ""Spirited Away,"" Hayao Miyazaki's elegantly surreal fable of a girl who finds herself by becoming lost in a strange world.  The plot has been compared to ""Alice in Wonderland,"" and I see no reason to dispute the analogy--like Lewis Carrol's story, ""Spirited"" creates a universe which is alien, yet echoes the truths of our own reality.Alice in this case is Chihiro, voiced here in the States by Daviegh Chase. Chase also provided the voice of Lilo in ""Lilo and Stich,"" and here again creates a child who is ultimately endearing despite (or perhaps because of) a tendency towards bratiness.  Chihiro is sulking because her family is moving, and she isn't embracing the change in her life.  Her parents aren't much help, waving off her fears instead of helping her cope with them.  But en route to the new home, the family comes across what seems to be an abandoned theme park, but is in truth a sort of Club Med for spirits presided over by Yubaba, who looks rather like something you'd find on a Mardi Gras float.  Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs for eating the spirits' food, and Chihiro has to install herself in Yubaba's domain--and do a lot of growing up--in order to get them back, while the various occupants of the bathhouse offer help and hinderance.Underlying the story are distinct yet nicely understated themes on the dangers of selfishness and materialism, and the power of compassion.  One visitor to the bathhouse is a creature so weighed down with commercial waste that it trails slime and stench in its wake.  The other employees give the beast a wide berth but Chihiro, in the manner of all fairytale heroines, goes where the rest fear to tread and is rewarded for her kindness.  In another instance, an initially kind spirit becomes poisoned with greed and transforms into a gluttonous beast.  Yubaba has a child in the form of a big baby (in more ways than one) who reflects Chihiro's own unwillingness to change back onto her.The film's pace is inconsistant, but the journey is a lovely one, filled with images charming and disturbing and an excellent visual style.  It's a great film to get lost in.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Making a dream,"If we say ""a dream come true,"" would understand one trite slogan to say it's a lovely film, without giving turn many details. While ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" itself is lovely, what It is in the ""bizarre"" Eastern view mode. And it is in this sense that it's like having a dream and turn it into a movie. It's like getting up in the morning thinking ""what a strange dream I had, but it was interesting.""That aura permeates the film, but most likely it was not the intention of the director, who explains with all the logic of the world, as the home of the world's illogical bathrooms works.The whole film is summed up in an elaborate metaphor operation of the workplace: The bathhouse (the company) Yu-Baba (the boss), Zeniba (head relaxed when it has reached its home), Chihiro (an employee who loses his name to be considered another number) ... not make it any less interesting to watch. Although suffering the characteristic ""bottleneck"" as I call it, it seems that is in every one of his movies and that is a decline in vueleve narrative and slightly ""boring"" action for a moments. Because of this may be overlooked hobby as a director tanning as undisciplined, who writes the script on the fly, Instead of starting to produce when it is finished. Failure pretty reprehensible, but now seems to have become his hallmark.Ultimately, the sum of all make a film of the mixture fascinatingly weird.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Excellent!  Nightmarishly surreal yet charming at the same time.,"This is a film that deserves a much wider release than it is currently getting.  Taking a cue from Alice in Wonderland and Wizard of Oz, Hayao Miyazaki takes the fairy tale conventions and gives us one of his finest works yet, beating the pants off everything he has done before.In a world where Japanese animation gets a bit of a bad rap for its adult-content (despite the fact that it's no worse than North American mainstream cinema), comes a film that both adults and children can enjoy.

It starts good in the first 5 minutes, but quickly becomes a disjointed fantasy world that doesn't really make much sense. Maybe this is just a movie made for children, but it's surprising it is ranked so high with so many adults rating the film.I would suppose from a technical animation standpoint, the art and visuals are great (I wouldn't know. In a way it didn't seem any better than Scooby Doo or the Flinstones I watched as a kid). The score is actually excellent, and that's the only reason I give it a generous 3. Oh, and the ending is decent, too- at least we finally discover what that overlong, boring, and disjointed adventure was all about.

A Master Piece,"This is probably one of the most wonderful Anime films ever made. It's worth every piece of praise it gets. The most wonderful thing is that not only children can fall in love with this story.The characters are wonderful too. The young Chihiro takes her role as the heroine and a very different one of that. This Chihiro is bratty and whines a lot too (This is shown a lot more in the English dub). Chihiro and her parents stumble not the 'Spirit World' and Chihiro finds herself on a most exciting adventure.Chihiro, to survive must work in the evil witch, Yubaba's bathhouse. Yubaba robs Chihiro of her name and re-names her 'Sen'. But thankfully Chihiro isn't alone in this strange world. Helping Chihiro on this adventure is the mysterious yet handsome young Haku. He, a kind and wonderful friend to Chihiro and tries to help her as much as he can. However, he also has had his name robbed of him.The wonderful story and plot is one we will never forget and characters which say more then an interesting character for a movie. That part of what I said is shown in the strange No-face, whom just wants to have friends.'There is a No-Face in all of us' I believe it's true.This film is worth 10/10 and five stars in any book.

"""Alice in Wonderland"" meets ""Brazil""","This is considered one of the best (If not the best) Anime' films ever made and its cinematic storytelling at its finest. Not since ""Akira"" has an animated film made the impact like this. This was created by the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki who is considered a god in terms of Anime' and its his wonderful stories and imagination that makes him so special. This is the story of a ten year old girl named Chihiro who is traveling with her parents to their new home and she is sad that they have to move. Her father takes what seems like a wrong turn and they come across a structure with a tunnel in the middle. They all get out and walk through to the other side and Chihiro's father recognizes it as an old park that has gone under over the years. They come across another structure with food set out and Chihiro's parents waste no time in helping themselves to as much food as they can eat. Chihiro discovers to her horror that her mother and father have turned into pigs and she runs off to try and find help. She encounters a boy named Haku that takes her into the strange world where spirits and witches habitat and he tells her to find someone named Kamaji and ask for a job. She is looked down on as a human but she manages to find Kamaji who has eight legs like a spider and he gets her a job. Chihiro works with Lin who is an older female and she shows her what to do and where to sleep. Chihiro helps out cleaning and delivering but at night she sneaks out to talk with Haku who is helping her get her parents back and to be able to go home.Miyazaki has such a broad sense of imagination and this is reflected in his other films like ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and this film is probably even greater than those two. This film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and it certainly deserved it. One of the joys of watching Miyazaki's films is that you have no idea what so ever has to what will happen next. The characters and events take the viewer on a strange and fantastic voyage that has never been seen before. Yubaba the witch has a giant baby named Boh, Haku turns into a flying dragon and Kamaji has these dustball/spider things carry lumps of coal to a furnace that heats everything. One of the big highlights of this film is the ""Stink Spirit"" that is this giant glob of river mud and Chihiro helps it get clean. While she does this she helps pull out all the junk (Bicycles, assorted metal, etc..) until we see what this spirit really looks like. This is the type of animated feature that children should view and this is not to knock American animated films but the Japanese concern themselves more with the stories. Children should view films that will enhance they're imagination but unfortunately most of the crap they are forced to watch is usually something that they can guess as to what will happen next. Miyazaki had no plans to make another film but happily he is working on another one! This is a great animated film and it should be recommended viewing for children although adults will love this also.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
More emotion than Mononoke.,"I went out of my way to catch this movie at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood and was blown away.  I'm a big fan of Miyazaki but have only seen Castle of Cagliostro, Princess Mononoke and now this. Where Princess Mononoke was high on action and environmental issues, Spirited Away is high on emotion and issues of love.When the movie begins, you are greeted with Miyazaki's astonishing art work and animation.  The bright colors and subtleness bring peace to your eyes. The story keeps you glued to your seat as it takes you to incredible places and introduces you to amazing characters.Miyazaki puts a 10yr old girl as it's protaganist. Her innocence, wits, and amazing courage make for a great heroin in this amazing adventure.  A la Alice in Wonderland.If anything, this movie made me feel young again.  As more and more incredible things unraveled before my eyes, I just sat there wide-eyed and full of wonder.The musical score by the legendary Jo Hisaishi (who composed scores for most if not all Miyazaki movies) is as usual astonishing.

I would have been satisfied if, at the end of the movie, Chihiro (Sen) had saved a train ticket and given it to Lin  for her support and friendship. It just left me thinking that Lin was a good character, but wasn't in the movie enough. That's just a thought, though. Just write back and tell me what you think. If you agree, tell me why.

My favourite ever film - is there a 20/10 option?,"An amazing piece of cinema. Disney made a big cock up, though, on advertising it in America and the United Kingdom. In Japan, one sixth of the population saw it, and I am furious at Disney's lame attempt to promote this film. Then again, it is so good that I think it would have beaten all the latest Disney releases by miles, so they probably kept the film in a low key... Chumps. The film is centred around a 10 year old girl named ""Chihiro"", who finds herself in a world full of spirits and creatures. She has to save her parents who have turned into pigs by the higher authority of the spirit world.I will not delve into the details, but this really is an amazing film, where the characters are unique and original, unlike todays Disney movies. This is a family movie, but not a child's movie. It has its funny moments, its sad moments and its heart-warming moments, and it all works! So throw away todays CGI Disney ""Cars"" and todays horrible ""family"" movies, to have a really good piece of cinematic history, I encourage you deeply to purchase this film.This is not a film destined for the rent, its destined for a place in your DVD rack.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Yet another timeless Masterpiece,"Yet another timeless masterpiece from Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.  Though it shares certain similarities with his other work, it is still a very much unique and new vision.  The substance, as usual, is quite profound, having to do with finding one's freedom through pure-heartedness.  Of course there is no preaching, things just happen like they do in life.Except the world is fantastical with all manner of strange creatures.  But the world never feels artificial or silly.  It has a marvelous technological consistency like the Castle Cagliostro in Miyazaki's Lupan film.  The creatures, though oftimes crazy or hilarious also have an uncanny realism to them.  Alltogether this creates a sort of spellbinding effect, as one is witnessing something very new and bizzare, yet so real at the same time.Unlike the epic/tragic tone of Mononoke Hime, this movie's tone is basically comic, though I might add it is comic in the Shakespearean sense e.g. intensely serious at the same time.  But it is not full of war and death like Mononoke Hime.I won't spoil anything by talking about the plot and I cannot think of anything else to compare it to.  It is unique.  Someone above mentioned Alice in Wonderland, and I suppose there are a few similarities, though overall I find it a superior work of art to Lewis Carroll's story.My only dissapointment was with the music. I thought Joe Hisaishi's music for Mononoke Hime was really tremendous.  It haunted you long after the film ended.  Indeed, I thought it one of the greatest film scores of all time. The music for Sen To Chiro is not bad at all and does not detract from the film in any way, but except for a few inspired moments (like the closing credit folk tune--wonderfully simple yet effective) it might as well not been there.  I noticed one of the main themes was a variation on the main Mononoke Hime theme.  I wonder if there is a central musical motif he variates for all the Miyazaki films?The audience at my showing had little children aged 4 to 5 years all the way to grandparents of the 80+ variety.  One and all they sat rapt and spellbound the entire 2hours and 20 minutes.  Rarely have I seen such focused wonder from a movie audience.  I think it is a testament to Miyazaki's master artistic status.  He delivers word, story and image so powerfully and directly that one just gapes in wonder.  To my mind, that exemplifies what cinema should be. How lucky Japan is to have such a great master and to so embrace him!  Sen to Chiro will likely break all the attendance records in Japanese Cinema, currently held by Mononoke Hime and Titanic.I really hope this film gets a good release in the US in Japanese with accurate English subtitles.  His films do not work well in English!! Especially the dumbed down and cliched translation Mononoke Hime got.  But even translation aside, Miyazaki's films have a Japanese soul that is all out of kilter with English.  Crouching Tiger was a huge hit in Mandarin. Let Sen To Chiro be heard in Japanese!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Stunning!,"There are already 532 reviews for this film.

"Not exactly easy to be ""Spirited Away"" by this film when it takes so long and has too many slow moments in between","Spirited Away is best-known for being the film that out of nowhere steals the Academy Award for best animated film from Lilo and Stitch and Ice Age, two very successful animated flicks that had come out at the same year. When I mean stole it, I do in fact mean stole it. Spirited Away is the kind of film that really points out what is wrong with animation today: not that much of a story, very inconsistent animation, lack of closure, and just too many slow moments. Clocking in at over two hours long, this is one of the longer animated movies to come out in recent years, and despite the few humorous moments, it isn't that great overall. Making an astonishing 200 million dollars overseas, it established Hayao Miyazaki as the ""Walt Disney of Japan.""This movie revolves around a clumsy yet courageous little girl named Chihiro who loses her parents because they ate food that belonged to spirits. As a result of this, she goes through a series of trials and adventures to get back to the regular world, or else be doomed to forever work in a bathhouse for spirits. Along the way, she meets up with Haku, a boy determined to take her back into the real world. Throughout the film, she meets an astonishingly large cast of characters, ranging from a greedy old lady that runs the bathhouse to some cute little spider-like critters. Along the way some of these critters help, some try to kill her, and others carry awful curses that plague their soul and also threatens to ruin the bathhouse.Miyazaki weaves an interestingly bizarre story, yet he stretches it way too long resulting in many dull and many, many slow moments. There are some scenes that way too prolonged and others that some may find utterly pointless. On the technical side though, there is a mixed bag. Unlike most translated animated films, this one stands out with very good voice work, and that is partly thanks to John Lasseter, otherwise known as one of the leading men of Pixar and director of the Toy Story movies.The animation on the other hand, is quite inconsistent. In several points of the film, there is an ugly mix of realistic animation with cartoony animation with an anime-style background. It doesn't mesh too well, seeing a realistically-drawn little girl with two goofy-looking animals and a very detailed old woman all together, sharing the spotlight for a minute or two. The mix of computer animation and regular animation doesn't work either. If you are going to work on a film, make it consistent, or at least make it look consistent. Beauty and the Beast contains some computer animation, but it is almost impossible to notice because it is done so well (The Beast dancing with Belle has the most computer animation in the film).As the climax rapidly approaches, it is hard to even find the mood. While on one hand there is suffering, in the corner of the screen there is some funny animation involving a hamster and a small bird trying so hard to keep up with the main character, Chihiro. It is hard to feel sorry and be saddened by the depressing cries of Chihiro, when we see the hamster trying to knit but to no avail. I found myself laughing during scenes in which there was supposed to be a gloomy mood, which is both frustrating and also embarrassing since I was watching it with some other people.Bottom Line: Best animated film of 2001? I don't think so, that title belongs to Ice Age. While it is an interesting and at times intriguing story, it is ruined by the conflicting animation, the amount of time it takes to tell the tale, and the failure to bring any drama when it is supposed to because of what is going on. The ending also arrives rather unexpectedly and comes up a bit short. While it sometimes looks pretty and sometimes is fun to watch, overall it is still lacking. At least it finally breaks the trend of Asian-made movies with bad dubbing by proving some excellent English-speaking voice talent. Spirited Away: won't blow you away, it will not totally frustrate you, but will not convince you to watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Beautiful film - comes highly recommended...,"From some of the reviews I was reading I was expecting something very trippy, but very well made. In many ways, that's exactly what I got, but if you bear in mind that this is a fantasy tale it's really not as weird as many people make it out to be. Some of the ideas and the imagery are bizarre - in fact most of them are, it must be said - but nothing feels like it was thrown in there purely to be different. It all feels like it has a place all of its own.It's sometimes hard for animated films to draw you in and make you feel involved with the characters, but Spirited Away does this brilliantly. Even some of the stranger ones - you find yourself becoming deeply involved in their little sub-stories. The end result of all this is that it becomes a joy to watch, from beginning to end.I would recommend this to virtually anybody who appreciates good movies, because it is so well crafted that if you approach it with an open mind and simply allow yourself to be swept along with it, you cannot help but enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Visually stunning, story line rambles like Mulholland Drive","A fine quality piece of Japanese animation! I have watched this movie twice. The animation, visual effects, colors, and voices are all outstanding. I'd be surprised if it had not won any awards for production quality. However, the story line leaves something to be desired. It's like watching Mulholland Drive...it's interesting, characters are fascinating, the events are dreamlike...you WANT something to happen, you WANT all the wierdness to make sense in the end, but when the end arrives, you see it was just a bunch of surreal adventures all strung together. It has a happy ending but it's still a bit of a letdown at the end. It held the attention of my 6-year old but it wouldn't for most. I would recommend it more for 7-12 year olds, if it's not important to them for the story to make any sense (which isn't for most kids). I rate it 6 out of 10.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Wonderful feel-good film,"Hailed as one of the best films ever made and winning several awards I must be honest I expected more. I fondly remember 'Grave of the Fireflies', which - in my opinion - is still one of the most awesome animated films ever made. I somehow expected this film to give me the same blissful sensation, but it didn't. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it; I did, and it is a wonderful film. I did feel, however, this film was aimed at a younger demographic.The film effectively portrays the naive and innocent nature of children, and how they would always see the good in everything and try to do good in return. No pretense. I must also admit to enjoying this style of animation, which Japan is so well-known for. In general, this was a feel-good movie with a great underlying theme.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Arousing story with stunning atmosphere,"I just watched this last night and I'm still pretty much in awe. This is a fairy tale for all ages, full of breathtaking visions and dreamlike characters.

It may require several viewings to understand this whole thing completely but after first viewing I am ready to give this..9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"No face, no service.","'Spirited Away (2001)' is a constant visual treat, its surrealist and often disturbing imagery taking dominance over its whimsical and rule-free narrative. Most of the picture is beguilingly beautiful, charming in an odd yet distinct way. It moves at a good pace and is always enjoyable, presenting a number of interesting set-pieces after it has established its fantastical story. Indeed, this is where most of its time is spent; its overarching plot isn't as important as you might expect it to be. It has a number of inconsistencies, particularly when it comes to a specific character, and it kind of loses its way in the third act, taking a rather strange detour before wrapping up extremely quickly. Still, the flick is entertaining even at its worst. It's almost always stunning to look at, too. It just has this almost unidentifiable charm to it. Its narrative isn't exactly complex, but it's a lot of fun. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Spirited Away ( A Film That Will Make You Cry),"Spirited Away has just been televised this year on Sky Movies (in the uk) but before like Princess Mononoke it was on Channel 4's (in the uk).

I watched the opening but I was rudely interrupted by my mate and I had to go out for an hour missing the parts but I'm glad I did but I tell you about it later but the next time it was televised I did get to watch and it was brilliant though the story is a little bit weak. If you like anime Spirited Away is no. 1. on your list. Music by Joe Hisaishi is wonderful.

Best animation movie,i have always been a big fan of Japanese animation i think they are always well made....i saw the movie spirited away recently but i have to admit i have been looking for it for quite sometime ...ever since he won the Oscar for best animated movie on 2002.. the movie idea is very original i have never seen a movie like it before... its not a kids movie.. u feel that u are in a dream many different characters.. u shouldn't pay much attention to understand what are the characters or where are the events takes place.. just sit back and enjoy. disturbing sometimes..engaging most of the time..2 hours of pure entertainment..i wasn't disappointed at all... i looked for the movie because the ratings were so high every movie site i have been to has given this movie 10/10 or 5/5 if u see u will understand why the ratings are so high... simply outstanding I'm recommending it to every one to see!,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
"Mystical, engaging, wonderful!","Spirited Away is one of the most perfect movies I have ever seen. The least I can say about it is that there was not a single moment during it that my attention wasn't completely focused. The plot was fantastic and full-bodied. Each character was given so much personality, even the little soot spiders weren't treated as two-dimensional.In a way the whole film felt like a dream, in that it is seamless. It flows, effortlessly, from scene to scene, from emotion to emotion - straight from terror and tragedy to comedy - without the subtle bump that wakes you up, that lets you know that the makers of the movie and the creator of the script had wanted you to be crying but now you really should be laughing. It was so LIFELIKE. Sometimes in real life the most grim moments contain honest elements of comedy that do not seem out-of-place. But trying to put that sort of convoluted emotion into a film creates a very thin line that too many have fallen off of.There was no part of the film that felt fake, or rushed, or shaky; the intensity of the story line and the determination of the lead character was obvious throughout. More than causing interest, this movie made me FEEL. I was sucked into the drama. I can rarely say that a movie made me laugh and cry without feeling like an idiot, but the caliber of this picture is so high that I don't even feel embarrassed. I laughed. I cried. And you will too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
An Utter Joy to Behold...,"Following the story of Chihiro, a young girl who mistakenly wanders into the spirit world with her parents, Spirited Away will be responsible, along with the CGI geniuses at Pixar, for the long-overdue downfall of Disney animation, both ideologically and visually. The story is neither simple nor predictable, and the weird and wonderful characters, locales and soundtrack are woven together with the hand of a genius director (Miyasaki) who really is at the top of his game.This is easily the most emotionally enchanting and visually brilliant animated film I have ever seen; every cell is crafted with such vibrant wonder that 'awe-inspiring' is a phrase which will need redefining. I hope that, in time, word of mouth (through sites such as this) will elevate this film to Shawshank godliness, no less than it deserves. As a foreign film, a feature animation and a children's film, this will satisfy lovers of all three genre and convert many more to all three causes, such as I.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
Beautyful masterpiece,"My first foray into the world of Studio Ghibli and the works of Animation Master Miyazaki San. This film sweeps you up with its use of cinematic language to transport you into a dreamlike world with a strong heroine and the amazing Characters she meets along the way.
A brilliant story with a nostalgic and heart-warming feeling, Spirited Away is a trip to a whole bunch of emotions with the help of Hayao Miyazaki. The story follows Chihiro who moves in a new place and ends up in a mysterious magical world. The story reminds of one of my favorite childhood movies, Alice in Wonderland, the whole concept of a little girl lost in an imaginary world and this movie was even better. Miyazaki made this story a magical trip through hardships and personal growth for the young protagonist to make us feel something never experienced before, hitting our souls with pure childhood feelings and despite being suitable for kids, I think grown-ups will enjoy even more this pretty fairy tale. I can't say I have any particular problem with the movie, it might get kinda confusing at times but it doesn't push you away from the emotional core so I can really stay entertained. This is a beautiful world designed waiting for everyone to experience it and everyone has to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

Good and surprising movie,"This is my first movie of this kind and I was a little skeptical at first, but it's been a nice surprise. I think the real strength of the movie is its cinematography and its screen play because they bring you in both magical and dreamy atmosphere, where everything is possible.

What happens when you do nothing but consume?,"Hayao Miyazaki's ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" (""Spirited Away"" in English) is one of the most mystifying movies that I've ever seen. This story of a girl's quest to rescue her parents from an ugly fate is not like any animated feature that you've ever seen. As beautiful as it is horrifying, this movie is a true sui generis.Miyazaki noted that consumerism's effects on Japan is a theme. After all, Japan adopted a western diet and started seeing new kinds of health problems. What happens to Chihiro's parents is just an example of this.Anyway, an outstanding piece of work. I'm sure that it makes more sense to Japanese viewers, but foreign viewers will find plenty to like about it. The movie won a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Animated Feature (Hayao Miyazaki declined to attend in protest of the US invasion of Iraq).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"

The storyline was kinda well-written and well-explained, even though there were some complicated parts during the movie. The characters were very interesting and kinda well-developed, but most of them were annoying. I have to admit, it's definitely one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen, however I still kinda liked it. The ending scene was kinda predictable, however there weren't any plot twists.

The best bildungsroman of all time,"I do not see how the story of maturity could be told any better than it is in Spirited Away. It is simply the story of a selfish girl who learns to work, told with perfectly executed emotion in the century-long tradition of Japanese film, and brilliant images that will stick in your mind for decades. Doesn't No-Face's monstrous devouring remind you of people, or events? The writhing of the dragon, the sludge of the polluted river spirit-- aren't these images you will come back to in real life? Miyazaki has gone beyond simply trying to tell a story. He understands the very medium of traditional animation and what it is best at doing, the things other media simply cannot pull off. It could not have possibly been executed in live action, or in computer-generated 3D animation. This film is a triumph for animation that sets a bar so high I wonder whether other media could possibly live up to it.Spirited Away appeals at once to Japanese and non-Japanese, those who have seen Miyazaki's movies and those who haven't, film buffs and casual movie watchers, those who enjoy symbolism and those who want a fun story, fantasy geeks and those who prefer normal characters, those who love exciting scenes and those who only want to get a closer look at the scenery. Miyazaki has firmly harnessed the microphone and nobody can miss his message.

A Masterpiece - in any medium,"Every external review I've read so far reads like and infomercial.  Well, so does this one.  It's amazing!Do you want to be just as dazzled as the kids in the audience?Do you want to share the experience - to commune with hundreds around you - like why you GO OUT to a movie in the first place?Do you want to access a foreign aesthetic in a congenial, vivid way, that you've never experienced before?Do you want to see state-of-the-animation art and sound and story AND English dubbing combined in one film?Do you want to see an animated feature that won the Berlin Film Festival against all other comers, including live action?Do you want to see not just moving pictures, but moving PAINTINGS?Then see this film!I was lucky enough to see it in a packed house at the Disney restored and operated El Capitan movie palace in Hollywood.  I have the feeling, that wherever Spirited Away is exhibited, Disney, who is the distributor, will only allow it to be shown on the best screens in town.  Anyway, don't wait for the video.  See it in the theater, then get the DVD when it's released.Now, does this sound like an infomercial?  You bet.  But the difference here is, that it's not hype.  It's all true.  The plot has been outlined elsewhere, so I won't repeat it.  Just a few things that appeal to me personally:Despite the Western trappings of a suburban family moving to a new house and the theme park setting, the central location of a bathhouse reminds me that this is a Japanese film, with Japanese sensibilities and Japanese aesthetic. I feel like I'm watching a synthesis of Zen and Shinto and Noh and maybe even a little Sumo (you'll recognize that reference when you see it).Many of the Japanese mythical allusions which many of the characters are making are lost on me, but the wonderful artistry of the depictions makes their obscurity that much more charming.  I really like ""No Face,"" especially in the beginning:  a real spook, and because of the dramatic mask it wears, one I'd imagine is a stock character which Japanese children are familiar with.The dragon, at once fierce, because I'm a Westerner, and sympathetic, because of its plight:  there is an amazing scene where it is being devoured, in flight, by birds - ORIGAMI birds!The inside of the bathhouse:  It's the most exciting, delicious, nightmarish thing I've seen since I was a little kid watching that house of naughty boys in Pinocchio's dream.This flick has pushed my buttons - the right buttons - so I could go on and on.

An adventure that will leave you spellbound,"""Spirited Away"" is a great film, but not great in the way that most Americans will think of movies. This film is an adventure unlike anything the western hemisphere has ever seen (unless of course you belong(ed) to your high school anime club). It's a story about simple, pure and true values, not a story about life's deepest questions and that's what separates it from the dominant form of ""Western"" films.The story is about a young girl named Chihiro who is moving with her parents to a new town when a stop along the way leads them to what appears to be an abandoned carnival. You get the feeling things aren't that simple and before Chihiro knows what hit her, she is in a spirit world and her parents have been transformed into pigs for gluttonously infringing on the spirit world. To return to her normal life and get her parents back, Chihiro must work at a spirit bathhouse led by a cruel witch named Yubaba.There is no explanation of what this world is in relation/comparison to the real world that the characters were in in the beginning, but once you get past that, it's all about the creatures, characters and bizarre events that happen. The world is unbelievably imaginative, combining both elements of conventional fantasy and ideas that are completely fresh. Whether it is the odd, but powerful creature named No Face, the multi-legged old boiler operator Kamajii or the bug-eyed, insane Yubaba, ""Spirited Away"" boasts an intriguing cast of characters.Most importantly, the film is about the values of love, friendship and helping others. We watch Chihiro, a sort of passive, ignorant girl learn (in some of the oddest ways) what it means to be selfless and giving and the film is her transformation into a better person. That's it. No deep criticism of humanity (other than don't be selfish), no questions about life, just a reinforcement of ideas that so often are either overlooked or expressed in uncreative, unoriginal ways. A children's film could have gotten the same ideas across, but ""Spirited Away"" shows that there are different ways to think about why those values are important.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation"
