"Final Destination 2 doesn't break too far from its predecessor, but it is a decent follow-up","College student Kimberly Corman (A. J. Cook) sets off on the road for Daytona Beach with her friends when she has a premonition of a multicar pileup on the freeway before exiting the on-ramp. Kimberly blocks the on-ramp with her car and tries to tell police officer Thomas Burke (Michael Landes) of the pileup but it happens anyway but not before Burke pulls her out of the way of a speeding car carrier that kills her friends. While other survivors of the pileup are dubious of Kimberly's premonition, Burke is more inclined to believe her as he was involved in the cleanup of Flight 180 one-year prior which experienced similar circumstances. As survivors of the pileup begin dying off, Kimberly seeks help of the voluntarily institutionalized Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) who has isolated herself from anything and everything since the death of Alex Browning. But Kimberly has visions that could lead to them escaping death's plan.Following the success of the first Final Destination, then New Line Cinema President Toby Emmerich approached Jeffrey Reddick to commission a sequel which Reddick agreed to do. Reddick stated his intent with this entry was to ""expand the mythology"" in order to avoid telling the same story over again. Previous film's director and writers James Wong and Glen Morgan were unavailable as they were busy with their respective projects of Jet Li's The One and the Willard remake respectively. The film instead was helmed by David R. Ellis whose prior directing credit was Homeward Bound II in 1996 and had more frequently worked as a second unit director and stunt coordinator with writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber coming on board as co-writers. Upon release, the movie had a respectable opening weekend of $16 million at number 2 opening behind The Recruit and eventually made back $90 million worldwide against its $26 million budget, a slight step down from the original's $110 million haul but still profitable. Critical reception while still mixed was somewhat improved from the first one with some like Roger Ebert who gave the original three stars only gave one and a half to the sequel. While Final Destination is fairly similar to the first movie in terms of setup with a formula pretty settled at this point, it is well made and delivers and what you expect and it does continue on from the first film.Unlike the first film whose cast of teen archetypes were very much molded by the late 90s framework of post-Screamsploitation that defined a number of horror films in terms of marketing and writing, the characters in Final Destination 2 are slightly more likable and less grating than they were in the first film, even ones who are supposed to be kind of abrasive have some redeeming moments. A. J. Cook is no surprise here a solid lead especially for anyone who's seen her work on Criminal Minds, and I also enjoyed Michael Landes as Burke and Ali Larter's reprise of the character Clear Rivers. Tony Todd also returns as the Mortician (credited as Mr. Bludworth) and much like the first film his creepy commanding presence is welcome and is probably the closest thing we have to the personification of an antagonist. The story is still pretty thin as it is mostly a lose chain of accidental deaths that follow some kind of path, but it does try to add new elements to avoid falling into a repeat such as the characters seeking a way to beat Death's plan by way of ""new life"" and while it's not 100% successful at avoiding sequel pitfalls it works well enough and the fact that the film has a relatively closed ending (albeit one with a very mean spirited joke) makes Final Destination 2 feel more like the closing half of a two parter rather than something overtly cynical as you've seen with some sequels.If you liked Final Destination, odds are you'll probably like Final Destination 2. It doesn't stretch too far from what was established and there is some sense of ""deja view"" as is the case with most sequels, but there are attempts at doing things differently from how they were done the last time and the ending that eschews sequel baiting was rather refreshing so take that for what it's worth.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Buckle up.,"Kimberly Corman has a terrifying vision that a highway pile up will claim her life and that of her friends. Blocking the entrance with her car, Kimberly watches in horror as the crash unfolds, thus saving her life and that of the people in the queue behind her. But the grim reaper is not impressed and he's coming to claim the deaths of all those who should have died in the crash.For a sequel to truly work well it has to come up with something fresh, otherwise why do a sequel eh? Well the makers of Final Destination 2 choose to use the basic same formula of the hugely enjoyable first film, only adding more black humour into the crazy death design broth. Opening with a quite horrific highway pile up, FD 2 then takes us on a journey that sees an assortment of folk offed in various and gruesome ways. The story remains the same as the first film, even though writers Bress and Gruber think they are being intricate by weaving this plot into the original story, but ultimately it's just a devilishly nonsense fun picture. Ali Larter returns for a second helping, and she in turn is joined by a bunch of no mark actors waiting for death, which is perfectly fine for the genre discerning fan.This is a riot, and as long as you don't look too deep into it (why would you really?) you may just find yourself having a real good time. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than original,"Final Destination 2 is creepy, enjoyable and importantly, better than the original. This movie had the iconic wood log truck scene and the way deaths happened, you may get frightened and think what if this happens in reality.The direction and acting was better than the original. Like original, you will be busy enjoying the thrill and drama and will give you mixed feeling of horror, drama and thrill.Overall, will recommend everyone to give it a try.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good sequel...,"As sequels tend to usually turn out, luckily ""Final Destination 2"" from 2003 didn't follow suit. Director David R. Ellis delivered a sequel to the 2000 movie ""Final Destination"" that was almost as enjoyable as the original predecessor, so that was quite an accomplishment.Writers J. Mackye Gruber, Eric Bress and Jeffrey Reddick put together a rather enjoyable and entertaining script and storyline, which was quite a good continuation in the spirit of the 2000 ""Final Destination"" movie, and at the same time managed to tie the first movie in with this sequel in a very good way. So thumbs up to the writers for that accomplishment.Something that always impress med in ""Final Destination 2"" is the impressive highway scene, it totally blows me away every time I sit down and watch the movie. It is like watching a well-orchestrated symphony of destruction and mayhem. Plus the way it is filmed and the effects really bring the scene to life (pardon the pun) in a very cool way.The cast ensemble in ""Final Destination 2"" is good, and it was nice to see Ali Larter and Tony Todd return to the screen to reprise their roles from the previous movie. And ""Final Destination 2"" brings to the franchise a bunch of great actors and actresses as well, which certainly helped to add to the overall enjoyment of the movie.Visually quite good, ""Final Destination 2"" delivers the destruction and mayhem to the audience in a very believable and realistic manner.My rating of director David R. Ellis's 2003 movie ""Final Destination 2"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Shock Value -- 7 (Good Flick),"You know that feeling you get when you're watching America's Funniest  Home Videos and the oblivious son hits his hapless father in the crotch  with an aluminum bat? It gets a quick reaction, like, ooh, I feel your  pain man.  FINAL DESTINATION 2 is a 90 minute or so string of those painful shots,  as each character one by one meets an unfortunate death by household  appliance. Bodies are slammed by trucks, heads are impaled, and limbs  fly through the air. When one of the characters dies when her car's  airbag explodes out of nowhere, I blurted ""Yeah! Wow, did they do  that??? Yeah, they DID do that. Right on!""  Although the film has a very serious atmosphere about it, what with the  creepy score and people sincerely freaking out and everything, it still  retains a campy humor about it buried beneath its high-budget exterior.  Many movies would shy away from smashing up plastic ketchup-filled  dummies, opting instead to avoid the gore. Not FINAL DESTINATION 2!  This movie is an honest approach to movie-making, hearkening back to  the day when you got together with friends and said, ""Okay, in this  scene we cut to the dummy falling off the building, it's run over by a  Mack truck, and it splatters chunks of blood all over that Oldsmobile  over there.""  As for the premise behind FINAL DESTINATION 2, how do I put it into  words? A.J. Cook has premonitions that people died in a nasty pileup on  the highway. Thing is, this never happened. And ... she continues to  have premonitions that those same people will die in due time. Those  people eventually die. Did I get that right? The universal law of  nature is that, well, Death sometimes misses its mark and has to fix  its mistakes (which usually involves electrical equipment getting wet  and other freak accidents of home improvement). If this all sounds  convoluted, watch the movie. You'll see what I mean.  The premise of FINAL DESTINATION 2, as much potential as it might have,  doesn't make much sense and is pretty hokey, but if you medicate your  inquisitive mind with heavy sedatives, you'll be able to look past the  flimsy premise and enjoy the movie. I'm definitely looking forward to a  Final Destination 3.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
THE BEST OF THE FRANCHISE. One of the Best Sequels of all-time.,"Final Destination 2 is the best film in the whole franchise in my opinion,i was lucky enough to see this at the cinema back in 2003!!!This gory as hell sequel is so much fun,it's smart & thrilling & exciting so much more than the first film. Yes i liked the first film it was great but part 2 is even better.FD2 packs more ferocious,spooky atmosphere into an exciting rollercoaster ride that is pure Horror-thriller entertainment with dark humour & awesome creative kills.Ali Larter gives a strong performance once again as survivor of death, Clear Rivers, from the first flick & the new bunch of death deserters are well casted characters that very cleverly are each connected by the impact of the deaths of all the characters from the first film. Final Destination 2 is a super smart sequel the truly ups the thrills & fear factor. This is one of those films i keep comic back to for shear fun entertainment even after all these years.This film also has the best & most terrifying scene in the franchise,the pile-up car crash on the motorway.That sequence is terrifying & probably the most iconic & memorable scene in the entire franchise.Final Destination 2 is basically just good gory-fun,a good night's entertainment especially if your a Horror genre fan like myself!!!Yes i have Nostalgia for it but i also saw the first film way back on video & then was excited for the sequel.Just sit back with a nice hot cup of Coffee one evening & stick on Final Destination 2. It's a real Gem from an otherwise messy franchise, it's a great supernatural thriller flick & one of the best franchise sequels ever.Tony Todd is a Horror genre gem.Great popcorn movie fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Creepier, gorier and better put together than the first","I was apprehensive when I didn't Devon Sawa in the credits or this movie, but then again, this film didn't really need him. This wasn't a sequel in the purest sense, but the film makers created methods to link all of the new characters to the old ones, creating a flow which wasn't too jarring. Unfortunately, the dialogue was the only real stinker in this film. The pretentiousness, the obviousness and the downright hokiness that came out of the mouths of the characters really detracted from the tension, turning their performances into a bunch of acting class rejects. But I digress. The only thing people are looking for is how Death will get the new set of escape artists. The sheer surprise and execution of the executions made me jump and crawl. In such a desensitized world we live in, being able to jump out of my seat means this film is a winner.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dying for more of the same?,"If you loved the original Final Destination, then you will almost certainly enjoy the sequel, a virtual carbon-copy of the first film, except that everything is bigger and much, much bloodier.This time around, a group of travellers narrowly avoid being involved in a spectacular freeway pile-up thanks to an eerie premonition experienced by driver Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) as she waits on the on-ramp. Feeling cheated once again, Death alters his grand design to try and claim the lives of those who escaped his clutches. As the survivors of the accident begin to die in the order witnessed in her vision, Kimberley realises what is happening, and tracks down the sole survivor of flight 180, Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), for help.Despite working with material that rarely explores new territory, director David R. Ellis directs with gusto: his freeway pile-up is an absolutely jaw-dropping piece of cinema—a brutal, bloody and disturbing set-piece—and the subsequent death scenes are masterfully orchestrated pieces of mayhem that tease the audience with several possible bloody conclusions, before delivering their always impressive pay-off (gory fatalities are caused by a falling ladder, a sheet of glass, a faulty elevator, an air-bag, a flying wire fence, and a barbecue!!!).In amongst the graphic bloodletting, Ellis also finds time to throw in some very nice visual touches (such as the tree shadows which resemble clutching skeletal hands) and lots of delightfully dark humour (gotta love that final shot!). A thoroughly entertaining piece of OTT popcorn horror, Final Destination 2 gets a very respectable 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Brian, I think you'd better go check that barbecue.","This was almost like a flashback to a few weeks ago when the exact same thing happened for real on Interstate 4. It wasn't a log truck, but fog and a controlled burn that caused an 80-car pileup and much burning of trucks and bodies. I could not help but think of that when I saw the incredible accident scene in this film. It could have been used as news footage.This is probably only the second film in which I have seen A.J. Cook (JJ from ""Criminal Minds"") and Ali Larter (""Heroes""), but they did a credible job in a film where the story was far more important than the individual characters, none of whom rose to any significance. In fact. most were probably former WB stars. The only one I remember with any interest was Odessa Munroe.But the story and the special effects and the gore and, certainly, the suspense, made this film worth watching and peaked my interest in the prequel and the sequel, although not having seen the first one does not take anything away from this one.Check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Second 'Destination',"As good a sequel as the filmmakers could have made, ""Final Destination 2"" still delivered the goods the original did.Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) and her friends go on a road trip, but Kimberly has a vision of a big pile-up involving not only her and her friends, but a lot of other people. She manages to save some of them after blocking the entrance to the freeway, but soon after the survivors start to die.Although not as scary as the original, it's still a lot of fun. Also, it makes you think about death itself. The ways the survivors die are still clever, but are a lot bloodier than the original's. If you don't have a strong stomach, then beware. There is also a revelation about the survivors which is clever as well.If you liked the first one, you should have no problem liking this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Incredibly silly, but once you accept that premise this movie is quite hilarious and good fun to watch.","Lots of these movies were made in a row, about a death curse from which no escape is possible and this premise is incredibly silly, but once you accept that, this is still a really fun watch.I do honestly think this sequel is one of the best in the series. It has got a high fun factor with lots of ingenious and funny ways of getting ""accidentally"" killed.It's almost camp, but it is executed in such an enjoyable Hollywood over the top fashion that is undeniably charming and witty to watch.Any bad?

Very entertaining and better than the original,"Final Destination 2 is a very entertaining sequel and while the story is weaker then the first, the deaths are better. Kimberly (A.J. Cook) is a normal teen who is taking a road trip to Daytona with her 3 friends. She has a vision of a horrific traffic accident and so she blocks some of the cars from entering the highway. Sure enough they vision comes true and they have all just escaped death. Kim visits Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the only survivor of Flight 180 who is convinced to help out the survivors of Route 23. Alex, who died between films, had been hit in the head with a falling brick. Kim, Clear and other strangers that are left must try to stick together and cheat Death again. The plot may sound stupid but its actually not all that bad. The story may not make sense at some scenes and the story is filled with holes. Its hard though to write a good story for something like this and I think they gave a good effort. The first film was very good and a lot of fun to watch. The sequel is even more fun to watch, even if it does get silly at times. Its better to watch the original before watching this so it would be easier to follow the story. Most horror films today are to silly to take serious and that's why you shouldn't really approach this one expecting an Oscar quality film. The acting was decent with the best being Ali Larter. She and Tony Todd are the only stars returning from the original film. A.J. Cook plays Kimberly and she does an okay job. The rest of the cast are mostly unknowns and aren't worth mentioning. David R. Ellis directs and he does really good job. He also directed the fast paced and exciting Cellular. The film is very gory and also very fun. Final Destination 2 was very creative when it came to killing off the characters. A couple of the death scenes do go over the top though the film delivers the goods for the most part. The film is only 90 minutes long so it's a quick film to watch. The movie also never gets boring as its always entertaining. I wouldn't say the film is to scary but there are some moments that may leave with fear. In the end, this is a very good sequel, that's better then the original and worth checking out. I just hope Final Destination 3 is just as good or even better then this film. Rating 7.8/10, check this film out as its very entertaining.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome follow up,"I remember when I saw the first Final Destination movie at the cinema, and I really enjoyed it, it was something fresh new original and exciting, and when I heard that they were making a 2nd one, well at first I was a bit sceptical, but when I saw the trailers, I was excited.Well the plot to this one, not all that different from the previous movie, only instead of an aeroplane, this time we get a traffic accident and the central character Kimberley (AJ Cook) has a vision much like Devon Sawa did in the first one. Only with a slight difference, this time the deaths work backwards.Sequels are often associated with disappointment, as many often only manage to be pale imitations of their predecessors. The second Final Destination is anything but, as it's bigger, slicker, and altogether more fun than the original. Overall this one has a different tone to the first one, this one's more blood and a lot more gore, which is always a bonus in my eyes, another aspect is that the deaths are way over the top, which is awesome and something that was missing from the first movie.The performances again doesn't fail to deliver, with yet again another group of interesting characters, AJ Cook is this time the main character and she hits all the right notes, she's resourceful and likable. Michael Landes plays it cool and low key but also comes across as likable and has great chemistry with AJ Cook. Ali Larter I enjoyed her in the first movie and I was glad they brought her back she gave a very credible performance and Jonathan Cherry plays the comic relief drug addict really well and came off as very natural.All in all a brilliant follow up and companion to the first movie and them both even each other out really well.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining sequel and again with horrifying killings,"This sequel of successful original by James Wong deals about beautiful girl(A.J.Cook)has a vision of car crash and aware which by avoiding it, she and others(Michael Lastres, Lynda Boyd, James Kirk,Sarah Carter,Jonathan Cherry, Kevin Connor, among them) around her have saved but soon begin dying in bizarre accidents. Being the sole character repeating from Ali Larter who now finds herself locked into sanatorium.This sequel displays suspense, tension, thrills, and creepy death. The chief excitement lies in seeing what new and astonishing victim can be dreamt by the believable FX technicians. Movie exist for only aim of murdering its protagonists and all around in terrifying realistic detail . Death seem to dispatch new weird killing every few minutes of movie, throughout car crashing, beheading, blowing up, glass crushing, fire, etc. It's frightening entertaining though predictable but we have seen the original with similar and interesting premise. Although its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting of protagonists and all around. The motion picture is well directed by David R Ellis. He has a long career as stunts coordinator, assistant director and finally filmmaker, directing Box office success such as ¨Cellular and Snakes on plane¨. Followed by a second sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Superior film to the original,"This really surprised me. Initially when I first saw it I thought there was no way they'd be able to do a sequel. This one in my opinion is the best of the bunch. It all starts off with the most insane scene ever. A giant accident on the highway that's let's the audience know all the different ways you can die. Like the first someone has a vision but this time around it's a young woman who ends up stopping traffic and saves a group of strangers who of course begin to die in the spectacularly gruesome ways. The death setpieces are ridiculously impressive a combination of practical and digital effects. My favorite has to be the glass kill but all of them are remarkable and hella shocking. The movie unlike the original doesn't take itself seriously and neither should you but it also impressively lays out a complex twist that brings it all together. A superior film to the first with solid performances all around.Budget: $26M

More of the same creatively put together.,"In this case, more of the same, is not a bad thing. Basically the movie its plot is just the same as in ""Final Destination"", only with different characters and settings this time. I however feel that the Final Destination franchise is one of the few horror-movie franchises that can have multiple sequels, without loosing any of its power or originality. The concept of the movie can be used over and over again; a person has a vision of an upcoming accident which will lead to the death of several people. Thanks to that vision the person prevents himself/herself and others from dying. They cheat death but the death eventually catches up with them again, as every person that should had died during the accident, dies one by one.""Final Destination"" had a plane crash, ""Final Destination 2"" has a highway pileup. Sounds smaller and less impressive but it really isn't. The car crashes are massive and awesomely choreographed and filmed. It truly honestly is one of the very best and certainly most spectacular car crashes out of cinema history. You have to see it to believe it.It's one of the things in the movie that makes it obvious that this time they had a far bigger budget to spend, compared to the first movie. Not only the beginning is more spectacular, also the deaths later on in the movie are better constructed and especially better looking and more graphic. The story and concept of the movie might not be original anymore but the death certainly are. It makes ""Final Destination 2"" a wonderful sequel that still can be original and surprising, even when you've already seen the first movie.The movie however makes a crucial mistake. Basically the movie has a fresh story with new characters and settings but yet it feels the need to constantly refer to the events in the first movie and even bring back a character from the first movie. A quick reference to the events in the first movie would have sufficed but instead the movie heavily relies on the events of the first movie. It makes the movie a bit hard and less understandable to watch for persons who haven't seen the first movie. Basically every Final Destination movie should be a movie on its own, with new characters and settings every time. I haven't seen part 3 yet but I hope they haven't made the same mistake there.But really, who cares about the story in a movie like this. Basically all that makes this movie good and original are the deaths that are featured in it. They are extremely graphic and quite brilliantly put together. You just never know what is going to happen, which helps to make the sequences tense as well as scary. It doesn't really matter that the characters aren't really interesting and the story is quite unlikely and far fetched at certain moments.An highly recommendable horror sequel but perhaps only if you've also seen the first movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
death like time's got her own plans 2,"Many horror movie fans were pleasantly surprised by the discovery in 2000 of ""Finale Destination"". Its author, James Wong who cut his teeth on the X-Files saga (I'm not a fan at all of this series) had made a killing with this classy B movie which encompassed teenage, slasher, fantastic and horror movie in the same package. The viewer remembered of the invisible but omnipresence of death which was adamant about her plans and desperately tried to kill one after the other, this bunch of students led by Alex who tried to thwart her plans. It paid off well since this mix met the public's approval. So, in the wake of this little triumph, the nearly inevitable follow-up was De Rigueur.At first sight, ""Final Destination 2"" seems to have the essential elements to have thumbs up from the audience. First, the multiple crash is impressively filmed. The director David R. Ellis who was a stunt-man and partly responsible for some action sequences in ""the Matrix Reloaded"" (2003) could show his expertise to film this vertiginous sequence. But his certain talent for directing can also be felt here and there throughout Kimberly's efforts to subvert death's plans. Then, there's a palpable, taut scenario. Many horror flicks today rely on special effects as the backbone of the film. Okay, there are rather flashy special effects here but used only when necessary. The moments during which death tries to take away the unfortunate victims are set with clockwork precision and announced with foreboding signs. Macabre humor is also more than acceptable but as the film is much more gore than the first chapter, it is not really for the faint-hearted. So, it's an enticing menu and one figures that one wouldn't want to shelve ""Final Destination 2"" in the messy department of useless sequels.But if one takes a closer look, one realizes that Ellis' film is merely a photocopy of its first edition. The strengths of the film also constitute its weaknesses. Weaknesses because the qualities which contributed in cementing the first installment in its place of winner are rehashed here without novelties. The starting point and its development are identical as the thrust of the first film: to try at all costs to outsmart death's sinister intentions which isn't prepared to accept this and that's all. The surprise effect is absent and in short, you take the same old people with adequate replacements. So, the pile-up superseded the plane crash. Then, it seems that the authors tried to justify the making of this second chapter by linking the present story to a connection with the story of the first flick (check the sequence in the middle of the film when the ill-fated ones talk about the bunch of students in the first film). But in spite of these attempts and new tricks displayed by the scenarists to try to give the story substance, it's a run-on-the-mill fantastic film.If you really enjoyed the first opus, then this may be your cup of tea. If you liked it without hailing it as a miracle, you can pass by. What's the point of watching the same story again with minor changes? And the end leaves the door open for a third episode which opened early this year. Is it any good?",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Death returns with a vengeance,"While it was not a great or perfect film (particularly in the dialogue, ending and some of the acting), the first 'Final Destination' was entertaining and effective (especially with its terrific opening plane sequence and the creative deaths) with a fascinating idea done well.'Final Destination 2' gets my vote as the best of the four sequels and generally it's just as good as the first film. Like its predecessor it's patchy and uneven, but 'Final Destination 2' takes a bigger and bolder approach and executes it just as cleverly and effectively. Horror sequels have a patchy history, 'Final Destination 2' is one of the better examples. Structurally, the story is a re-tread basically except with cars rather than a plane but has enough freshness to stop it from being repetitive and the novelty from wearing off.Visually, 'Final Destination 2' may not be quite as stylish as its predecessor. It is all the same still as slick and atmospheric, with the special effects still being pretty good in particularly the opening sequence. The music has a suitable haunting eeriness.David R Ellis' direction shows a genuine understanding of the concept and the horror genre, breathing atmosphere, fun and freshness into a tried and tested formula. To me, he is second only to James Wong for the first film when it comes to ranking the 'Final Destination' films directors.Although there is a little too much of an over-reliance on gore, not all of it necessary, the death scenes are bolder, more elaborate and more creative. The film is never dull and much of it is fun, suspenseful and creepy. The highlight is the terrific opening car pile up, which is as high in the terror stakes as the opening plane sequence in the first. Liked the irony in some of the dialogue.The acting is very variable however. The best performances come from returning Ali Larter, providing a nifty link to the first, and a creepy Tony Todd. AJ Cook had her moments, but did overdo and underact some scenes, that she is so much better in 'Criminal Minds' is an understatement.Michael Landes looks uncomfortable the entire time and Jonathan Cherry is irritating. Again the characters are generally one-dimensional and not developed much beyond that which doesn't always make it easy to care for them.Excepting some nice irony and that the exposition isn't as clumsy, the dialogue doesn't flow particularly well and reeks of cheese. The ending is contrived and illogical.Overall, enjoyable if imperfect. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very enjoyable but not a patch on the original.,"FD 2 gets new director David Ellis and the story is literally the same as the first one where a teenage girl called Kimberly is on a road-trip to Daytona with 3 friends but on the highway she has a premonition of a massive pile up. Cue comes she freaks out and everyone who cheats death is put on a new list.Ali Larter's character Clear Rivers is revived from the first one and is first found at the Stony Brook institution as the only survivor as Alex from the first dies between films (a brick dislodged itself from a building and hit him in the head) Kimberley asks for Clears help as she is still on death's list.The story is nothing new though there is a connection with the people on the new list to the first one, which I liked. The deaths are still inventive and gruesome and the acting is still to a good standard. Ali Larter is the best actress of the film whilst Tony Todd the mortician from the first one reprises his role in one scene which he makes the most of and Kimberly played by A.J Cook isn't bad either.This isn't a patch on the original as it's not really scary but you do feel for the characters still to some extent particularly Clear.

Excellent sequel a great thriller,"If you liked ""Final Destination"" you'll really like ""Final Destination 2"". I remember the commercials for this one and was afraid they were ruining the thrill of this sequel.  So I didn't see it in the theaters.  I was wrong. If anything the commercials used the film footage to mislead you, so that the surprises were even greater.For what ""Final Destination 2"" is trying to do, they do it perfectly.  From the script, to the acting to the directing.  This was a tough score for me. While it doesn't rate up there with the the best films of all time.  In every aspect, they perfectly accomplished what they set out to do.  It's a Thriller, full of a lot of unpredictable turns and surprises, and with great action.

Pretty amazing!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
And Death strikes again!,"You're gonna die after me, right?The first movie had an engaging and original concept, which had death itself as the antagonistic force that would kill the survivors of the infamous flight 180. It was a huge hit amongst young adults, so New Line Cinema decided to make a sequel to it. But since most characters died, the writers decided to create new characters and make the plot centre around them.The protagonist of the second movie is Kimberly, at first average girl who likes to hang out with friends, but has an ability to see into the future. She saw that an accident happened on the road, where logs fell on vehicles, and killed people. And afterwards the death decided to chase the survivors once again! The plot is pretty much similar to the first one, which may turn some people off, since it feels like the creators just wanted to capitalize on the success of the original. However, it's one of the rare cases where it actually did a good job. Mainly because of it's thrilling concept of sudden deaths, which makes the audience both scared and intrigued, like it's so brutal with it's killing scenes, that you just can't get your eyes off and want to see what's going to happen next. Although, some characters may act stupid, like one of the characters chasing pigeons or another one inserting his hand into a sink hole. But despite that, it's still interesting.One of the best things of the film is the return of 2 characters from before - Clear Rivers, the last survivor of the flight 180 and Tony Todd's character who knows all the secrets about death, and even how to stop it. It's to let a new life being born. As for Clear, she actually got herself into a mental hospital due to her fear of the past events that occurred to her classmates. But at some point, she joined the group of new friends and now their goal is to keep each other safe and find the pregnant mother Isabella. As for the new characters, Kimberly is similar to both Alex from the prequel and Evan from Butterfly effect, since she also has an ability to predict the future, and her memories sometimes overflow, which causes her to lose breath. She was actually better developed then the previous protagonist, because her actress expresses her emotions more realistically and she's also curious about her mother's past in one scene. Other characters include Rory the confused guy, Eugene the skeptical motorcyclist, Nora the worrying mother and Kat the buisnesswoman. Each character surprisingly had a connection with the first movie events in some way. I'm actually glad that this plot isn't a standalone kind of a sequel and it has elements that made the first movie scary, yet creative. And especially their goal of getting to Isabella, a pregnant woman to let her have a baby in order to stay safe from death adds more spice to an already spicy feature.As for gory scenes, they are even scarier than before. Since the deaths are more brutal. Especially during the route 23 premonition scene, where the logs fall, causing the cars to crush and lot's of blood being splatted. Not to mention, it came up with new ideas of murdering the characters, like stabbing an eye with a ladder, smashing with a huge block, or with a huge explosion in a hospital. This makes the viewers worry about each character, and really wanting them to go through, unfortunately, only two survive. I must say the scariest scene was the one with the elevator, where one of the characters' head got stuck between the doors, and it started to go up, because it got malfunctioned. I'll say, that although it's not possible, since usually blocking the doors will result in then opening, however, it was still scary due to it's realistic tone and the fact that the character got suffocated. I'll be careful with the doors next time after watching this scene.If you ever looked for a sequel that captures the same shock and suspense from the first movie, then this one is certainly one of the best examples. Final destination 2 is a scary and thrilling ride for both newcomers and fans of the original. It's worth your watch. However, if your sensitive, then it's best to look away, cause some scenes are too intense to handle, which may even cause nightmares. Regardless, it's a good horror flick!Only new life can defeat Death.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"More gory than the first, but not as good","The director obviously thought that when making a sequel, everything has to be bigger and heavier. But bigger doesn't equal better, and it definitely isn't the case here. The death scenes are unnecessary gory, and only that; practically no build-up to the scenes, and little to no excitement. Unless you enjoy watching extremely bloody, gory death scenes, you won't like this movie. In fact, you will most likely hate it, unless you're a big fan of the genre, or of the first Final Destination. It's a huge gore fest, and probably made for(and maybe even by) fans of the old ""body-count"" movies, from the 1980's. It has very little realism; whereas the first Final Destination had some realism in the death scenes, this had little to none at all. As many other slasher movies, it has the little ""twist-in-the-end"" at the very end, but it is very weak, considering what it could have been. The first movie is a lot better, but if you *need* to watch a gory movie where you pretty much sit around and wait for people to die, this isn't the worst you can watch. But if the choice is between this and the first, I would definitely choose the first. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Final Destination= Atmosphere Final Destination 2=gore,"Okay, I liked the first one, I thought it was good, i think it was a hidden horror gem, there were some problems, but it sure was creepy! Then, I rented the second one, wow, this had none of the things I liked in the first one (okay maybe some). The first scene plays out very well, but I hated the guy on tv talking about death (only the kids should know, nobody believed them in the first). The car crash is excellent, creepy and atmospheric, and after that it goes downhill. The frequent prominations are annoying (what happened to the signs?) and most deaths are way too stupid and gory (The fence part, The kids death..) and the when Claire opens the door and gets charred, the fx they put in looks horrible! This has none of the original FD goodness (whats with all the prominations? Is she psychotic?). It does tie up some lose ends, but really creates more than that. Plot hole example: When the druggie saves that other kid, (wait, why is a ambulance headed straight for him??) and he um dies um later, does that mean everyone who almost gets killed will die later???).

Carnage. Although predictable and a bit campy.,"The dialogue seems to make this movie a little cheesy, but it is still surprisingly entertaining. I have not seen the the first ""Destination 1"", so I can't comment on comparison's between the two at this point. I had seen this movie by chance and knew nothing about it. It started off okay, then quickly got into to the main ""substance"" of the movie, which I can fairly accurately describe as ""carnage"". This is definitely a movie for fans of gore. It's not particularly scary, but has a type of ""tale of the crypt"" feel to it. I found it not particularly funny, but still amusing. There was one scene that had me reminiscing about a scene from the movie ""Cube"". It's not for you if you're looking for romantic comedy or something like that. Also not for you if you're expecting elaborate plot twist thriller. Also, there is no ""skin"" in this flick, but they do throw in the customary blonde chick. Anyway, I definitely put this as above average on my list of ""B"" movie ""sleepers"" (meaning under-rated and surprisingly good). So, my rating is based on that.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

6.5 / 10,Thankfully with this movie they didn't just rip off another episode of Twilight Zone to an extent. Instead we get the blonde from Criminal Minds and she is the psychic one! They really did get more creative with the blood and gore in this one and try to add onto it where you don't die until it's your time to do so.The big issue I had with this one was I wish they spent more time trying to figure out the order of everyone who is next so they can potentially save one another. They are racing to this one person and by the time they do two others are getting murdered. I like how this one was a little more grown up instead of just some school kid. They even find a way to get Death off their backs and thankfully they throw in a twist or two to keep it from being too predictable. Most of the cast is bottom of the barrel which we should expect in horror movies where none of them are memorable. Perhaps it's the script or directors fault for all I know as I'm not the one who directed this but regardless I did enjoy this one a bit more than the first.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
worse than the first.. hard to believe,this movie is so stupid... of course that many people are gonna die when they come up on a log at 10 miles per hour and suddenly flip 15 times then explode in mid air... the motorcycle chased the guy who happened to impact a log.. the log didn't kill him.. but his bike did.. DUHHH!!! Does anyone realize that the number of explosions in your movie doesn't dictate how well its rated? you should try being a little realistic once in a while.. cars don't explode when they flip over... and usually when something like a log through a cars windshield usually causes the cars behind them to stop.. i'm sure i would stop if i saw a log fly through someones car. you people suck and your acting skills leave A lot to be desired.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better then the first?  Hardly!,"Were you people even watching the same movie?The original was way creepy.  The forshadowing to the deaths was much more effective.  Yes, the death scenes in the second one were pretty gruesome, but that doesn't make it better.Actually, I didn't mind it that much.  It was pretty bad though.  I thought the idea that everyone from the 2nd was somehow tied to the deaths of the first was lame.  They really didn't need to make those connections to make a sequel.  They could have simply made all the people in the second have some kind of brush with death without it being connected.  It's called a concept sequel, but, like Blair Witch 2, it's obvious people don't understand concept sequels that well.I don't like how the second one was such a comedy of errors, as a friend pointed out in the theatre.  Everything in the second one seemed just thrown together instead of being well calculated like the first.As I said, I enjoyed the second one for it's crap factor, as opposed to the first which I enjoyed because it was actually good.

The most creative part about it was the deaths... and that's not saying much...,"The only words I could say after the credits started to roll was, ""What the f***?!"" This movie was an insult to the first and also to the whole horror genre. It felt like it was bordering on making fun of itself at many points, which would've saved the film a bit, but it didn't take the extra step to cross into that territory. The dialogue is completely laughable, and when it is good, isn't held in the spotlight as it should be. The spotlight of this movie, instead, is its gruesome gore, which at most times was portrayed in such a way as to almost make you chuckle at its lunacy.The actors who portray these poorly developed characters are faces you will forget as soon as you leave the theater. They are so bland and fit into such generalities that every actor will remind you of a friend or neighbor.

Gory Story,"I loved the first film, I purchased DVD and VHS copies, and the second one is as good, if not better than the first.

This movie takes place one year after the first, even though it has been almost three years after the original. Things happen in reverse as a way to tie up the ""loose knots"" that the first Final Destination opened up, sort of like an outward ripple in Death's design.

Rube Goldberg Killing Machines,"Any really good Horror movie walks the line between horror and comedy.  The better it does this - the better the movie.  An example would be Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"".  FD2 does this extremely well - between the writing and the editing it creates tension and suspense very effectively. The Horror is graphic and disturbing.The problem when you successfully straddle that horror/comedy line is the possibility of falling off the other side.  For the first 30 minutes the movie is really successful at connecting chains of events that seem almost independently sentient.  A coffee cup becomes a potential accomplice in Death's plan.After 30 minutes one begins to see humor in mayhem.  By the end of the movie and the not surprising ""denouement"", my wife and I (and the theater)were rolling in the aisles with laughter.  ""Scary Movie"" wanted this response but settled for sight gags and in-jokes.  I did not expect much from this movie, but was very impressed with the unintentional effect.  I will now see the first movie in the series, just to see more work by this team.  It is true that some did not laugh, but most were holding their sides.  It would not be fair to suggest that they rerelease this as a comedy since it is also effective as horror.  I also do not want to belittle the talents of David R.

"Subtle Differences, More Deaths","""Final Destination 2"" (2003) reveals itself to be a work that, although shy of innovations, repeats the narrative of its predecessor with few additions to the mythology of the ""death curse"", seeking creativity in deaths to maintain the public's interest.The film's atmosphere is notably less dark than that of the previous title, losing some of its seriousness. Disposable dialogues permeate the plot, and the sometimes comical soundtrack seems out of place, especially in scenes involving the characters' deaths. A new element introduced is the increase in visions experienced by the protagonist throughout the narrative, differing from the first film which presented a single premonition.Despite these characteristics, the continuity of the story and the return of actress Ali Larter to the cast are highlighted as positive points, enriching the project.

Ali Larter is back from the first movie, as that film's sole survivor. While she has little to do, her presence allows for a direct connection to the first film. The main reason for seeing this movie is the car pileup. It is amazing, and I haven't the slightest idea how they filmed some of it, other than to assume it must have taken a week to shoot.

Highway to hell.,"'Final Destination 2 (2003)' is a profoundly stupid movie, its Rube Goldberg machines growing ever more complex and ever more gruesome as its plot attempts to inject some semblance of story into a narrative that basically has nothing for its characters to do other than die in creative ways. It's these efforts at giving the thing a further sense of stakes, achieved by affording its players an enigma to solve and thus the hope that their fates may be changed, that actually makes it less credible than it's already fanciful predecessor. Having its characters chase after a pregnant woman in an effort to ensure the baby is born, thus invalidating death's design and forcing it to wipe the slate clean, makes even less sense than the idea that death is some sort of invisible slasher with a plan and the desire to correct it. Despite this general lack of believability, the picture is pretty fun throughout. It lacks any of the atmosphere that the original so surprisingly possessed, and it - though it dials back the personification of its unseen antagonist ever-so-slightly - it never really plays with the genuinely unsettling fact that each one of us could die at any given time for no apparent reason. The story's focus on premonitions does arguably make for a more active protagonist, or at least give her a clearer goal and method for achieving it, but it still results in the same stuff you'd expect it to. That stuff isn't bad, it's just predictable and, after a point, somewhat tiring. Still, the complexity and intensity of the deaths has been upped and so they're somewhat more entertaining, in a macabre sort of way. This is primarily because they play with expectation and are presented with a subtle, sick sense of humour. These moments are why most people are coming to a sequel that starts the franchise trend of these films mostly being the same, and they're undeniably well-achieved. Those who like more meat on their movies may be disappointed, but those who just want a bit of fun will likely find some joy here.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
DECENT SECOND INSTALLMENT OF THE FRANCHISE,"Watching the first two films of this franchise felt like slowly unfolding into a different genre of horror/thriller that was so exciting and refreshing to watch. This second installment was a bit better than the first one simply because of the new ideas to the plot/storyline. A major character reprised her role which was essential in connecting the first two movies. What I really enjoyed was the no-holes-barred showcase of violence and gore, which I personally enjoy and been constantly looking for in horror flicks. I must say that the performances were a little underwhelming and mediocre. Aside from that, every technical aspect of the film was good.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

What a great follow up to a good film.,"Who ever says that a sequel can't be better or improve in the original should watch this. The original was filled with surprises and edge of the seat tension. I have never been in the cinema and have every one watching react so intently as the original. Until I saw the sequel. We all knew what to expect, but when it came it was still shocking. But this time there was the added gore factor. I like to pride myself as not being squeamish, but I was shocked by the graphic scenes of death in this film. The opening car crash is amazing. So shocking and realistic it makes you think you are in the middle of the carnage. The film makers should be congratulated for some scenes that should shock you beyond belief but are twisted to make you laugh instead of throw up. Even if you haven't seen the first one, you must go and see this. Try and close your mind to reality and immerse yourself in this amazing, shocking and often laugh out loud film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Millennial Trauma,"What alot of the younger folk won't realise is how this film gave a whole generation trauma they didn't ask for. There's not one millennial who saw this film and now doesn't drive behind a log lorry on a motorway and want to change lanes...But I digress.It's very similar to the first film where you watch mostly out of nostalgia, however it's still a good film in concept. It has aged and because of the first film it does have more predictability, but you still hope for the characters to make it to the end.What I do think these films do well is not allowing the audience's connections built towards the characters, get in the way of a character being killed off. Just because you're a main character doesn't mean you get special treatment. Some horrors cave into this and let them survive, but not Final Destination. You never know if the main character will make it or not.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enhanced Kills Lead the Way to a Second Destination,"Same problem, different day for the unfortunate denizens of a New York City suburb. One year after an airline disaster claimed the lives of a hundred high school seniors, a major traffic accident deals the community an additional dose of destruction. As before, one unlikely survivor escapes with the aid of a timely premonition and incidentally rescues a handful of others from similar ends. Death, however, isn't one to take a rain check and seeks his pound of flesh.Ali Larter returns in a supporting role as lone survivor of the first incident (previous leading man Devin Sawa having unceremoniously eaten a brick between films) but the rest of the primary cast is entirely new. Which is important for a franchise that insists so many of them bite the dust in an increasingly grisly string of improbable accidents. Final Destination 2 doesn't waste time in getting to those goods. That chaotic highway pileup plays twice in the first fifteen minutes, treating audiences to all manner of twisted metal, blunt force trauma and roasting flesh, and from there we're never more than a quarter-hour away from the next inventive, violent demise. Aided by Larter's grizzled veteran, the diminishing crew of survivors sets to chasing an oddly specific series of made-up theories that make little sense and only increase their exposure to volatile new situations.This is an ongoing problem that's carried over from the first film: the need to fit the reaper's methods into a tidy little box. The original film structured its kills in a rigid pecking order (something to do with where they were sitting in the aircraft), while this one works in reverse and can be allegedly derailed if... one of the victims gives birth before everyone's killed? That's a pretty big stretch, and it's not the only one. I'm still foggy on Death's complaints as a whole: the opportunity to harvest this handful of souls was taken, but he claimed an equal number of others in their stead. The accident still occurred, with huge, fiery fatalities; only the victims' names were different.Whatever. It's a big, dumb, loud movie that's more about the action, anyway. In that, the second Destination certainly delivers. Its kill scenes are bloodier, more imaginative and more frequent than in the original, with less reliance on a spooky, invisible guiding hand and an added sense of darkly comedic timing. The log truck deaths get all the popular attention (good luck following one on the highway after this), but those are equaled, if not surpassed, by later scenes utilizing barbed wire, plate glass and an elevator. It's the rare case of a sequel that's one or two steps better than the first, but I still wouldn't say it's especially good.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
I was actually impressed,"Note, this is only my opinion; and the first movie (Final Destination) is one of my two favorite movies. I was setting myself up for disappointment with this sequal. as anybody should do with any sequal. Especially if the directing is being done by someone else. But I was in fact surprisingly impressed with this one for a few good reasons.1) It had the same tone as the first movie; death was still a presence of fate and destiny, instead of some super natural force2) You wernt cheated out of any death- note: do not see this movie if you dont like blood. It isnt gory like guts, slime, or Evil Dead kinda gross. However, it is realistically bloody, which would explain people leaving after the second person dies.3) The opening scene is amazing!- I can't drive without being a little concerned about getting into an accident. (Im convinced im going to die in a car accident anyways, but thats another story) Its just so realistic and you never think of it being like that when you see one on the news.4) This Movie had no mercy! - So much emotional attatchment to the charecters. You like most of them and really want them to live. You can relate to them.5) I dont think the acting was bad at all - Sure it was a bunch of no name actors and actresses in it, but so was the first. They all did a very decent job and how can anyone complain about these people after seeing Keanu Reeves in any of his movies. I was especially impressed with Nora's charecter and the job she did performing it. I think they were all done well and I'm in love with Ali Larter. (She's gonna marry me)6)I was shocked over and over - remember Terry Chaney getting hit by the bus in the first one? Okay they're all like that. Through the whole movie I sat there with my mouth open saying ""oh my god"". And I wasnt the only one. Again though, be prepared, most horror movies have comic relief so the audience isnt totally traumatized; this doesnt. Well it has a few subtle and tactfully done things but its not enough to lessen the impact of the shock factor this movie gives you. I am forever desensitezed to violence now. This movie is anything but predictable. My friends would say, ""Oh I know whats gonna happen next"", which would shortly be followed by, ""oh my God!""7) There was a good story to it - of course its gonna follow the same idea as the first. But it does add more depth this time and an interesting point about flight 180's original survivors and how them getting off didnt necessarily only effect their lives, but other peoples as well. Though this could have been presented better in the movie (it was kinda cheesy at the time) it worked very well with the plot and tied the new cast with the original story very nicely. It wasnt just a new premonition, new poeple who have nothing to do with the original story, and no reason for dieing.Now, I of course dont think this movie is perfect. As with any movie, if I had the chance to change a few things, I would. (Actually given the chance to change Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow' I wouldnt because I think it's perfect the way it is.) But there are no more things with this sequal I would change then there are with the original it branched of off.-I think Shirley Walker did an awesome job on this score, but I liked the original better -There is one scene where things tended to happen for no reason, they should have taken the time to show causes for these things, instead of them just happening. But it only happened in one case. -Ali Larter's charecter is so different. But even this is justified after all she's been through alot. -They should have gone into a little more detail or emphasis on what happened to Devon Sawa's charecter, Alex. They made it seem like they were bitter that he didnt agree to do the movie and avoided having to explain him as much as possible. So they killed him with a brick. (Dont worry, that doesnt spoil anything) -The reactions of the cast when someone dies doesnt seem all that realistic. Sometimes it does, but the first had better reactions. (exmpl... Clear throwing up after Billy dies and Carter p***ing his pants when the train is about to hit him) But in this one they scream of course, but it usually only seems to be one person reacting. Even as a bystander, if I were to see any one of these poeple die I would throw up, curl into the fetal position, and cry. Let alone if I had any emotional attatchment to them.So yeah, this movie is good. Thanks to anyone who actually made it to the end of this. And I dont think they left it open for another movie to be made any more then the first did. Which Im sure it didnt intend to otherwise they wouldve signed Devon onto a contract to come back instead of killing him with a brick and telling us about it in a news article. This movie is good and worth seeing. Im sure it exist for the sole purpose of making money off the tail of the first, but at least it doesnt come off that way.-Mike-",,Anonymous,Horror
"Stupid, but it works","To say 'Final Destination 2' is exactly the same as 'Final Destination' would be a mistake. A lot is the same though. What they did with 'Final Destination 2' reminded me a little of what they did with 'Hannibal'. Just more blood and gore. I must say, especially in the first half hour, it works. The opening sequence looks great and bloody and when the first survivor finds his death you heard a lot of 'aaargh' in the theater. Probably what the makers had in mind. After this it gets a little boring and very much the same and of course totally stupid, but I was entertained, sort of.There are some terrific scenes here. Not because they are that great but because they work exactly the way she should. One in particular that involves a dentist made the theater pretty noisy. There is some space for comedy moments as well, making this a nice film. Not as good, if that is the term, as the original, but it works well enough to give it a try.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Same Concept, Different Story, Good Result","Final Destination 2 uses exactly the same formula that worked the first time (so be warned if you didn't like the fist one you won't like this)The story is slightly different and manages to tie all the new characters into the characters from the first film and it does it well. The death scenes are better in this one, but the freshness is slightly tainted as you would expect from a sequel.

Best laugh I've had in a loooong time...,"In a movie that goes out of its way to explain Death's reasoning through characters who have rootless epiphanies as the plot necessitates, I find it amazing that nobody questions the convoluted methods Death utilizes in order to go about what, for him, is routine business. Death can, it seems, create these imaginitive and complicated Rube Goldberg chain reactions that result in a demise out of left field, but cannot simply give someone a heart attack, or enlist a goon to shoot them in the face. I must admit, after only catching twenty minutes of the film, I was postulating some very imaginitive manners in which I might slay the filmmakers for the obscene amount of money they no doubt made creating something that would fetch a ""c"" in a Junior High film and video class.The movies message seems to be: People shouldn't die. The writers, if they believe in what they wrote, must actually operate under the asinine notion that the world would be a better place if nobody died.But, I must admit, that rarely have I laughed harder than the scene following the dentists office fiasco.

When a Sequel Works and is as Good as the Original Movie,"Kimberly Corman (A. J. CooK) is going to have a short travel with three friends of her on the day that the accident with flight 180 (from `Final Destination')  is celebrating one year. She has a vision of a huge accident in the highway, and she uses her car to avoid the access of the other drivers to the road. Her premonition comes true, and the survivals decide to investigate what has happened with the survivals of the plane crash. Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) is the unique who stays alive, surrounded by safety precautions. A further investigation shows the group their option to cheat death. This is one of the few sequels that are worthwhile. I myself hate sequels and remakes, but this one is really good. The accident on the road is fantastic. The story is not bad, and hooks the attention of the viewer until the final scene.

The first one made me jump. This one made me laugh.,"The first Final Destination was excellent. It was well-written, well-acted, well-executed. It focused more on the story than it did on the killings. Final Destination 2 was excellent in a different way. It was well-written, well-executed, and focused on the blood and guts. Notice I didn't mention the acting, which was for the most part, MST3K-worthy.Story: 9/10. The story was very good. There were no inconsistencies from the first movie, and at least they had a very good reason for not using most of the original cast. Anyone who saw the first movie would know why. Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) has a premonition that there's going to be a major pile-up on the freeway. Like in the first movie, she stops her car in the middle of the street, preventing the people who were SUPPOSED to be involved in the pileup from being involved in the pileup. Her premonition comes true, and a rift is caused in death's design... again. Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), being the sole survivor of the first movie, becomes the experienced know-it-all who gives advice to the doomed people, who begin to die bizarre deaths, just like in the first movie (only bloodier)Characters: 3/10. Many of them were unoriginal. One of them is a hardcore druggie. Really, where have we seen that before, besides almost every movie in the horror genre?Acting: 4/10. A.J. Cook's performance was decent, as was Ali Larter's. The rest actually made the movie laughable, especially Terrance ""T.C."" Carson, who I found to be unintentionally hilarious.Execution: 10/10. The blood and guts spilled in this movie make it too good to be bashed, especially when the entire audience cheered whenever someone died. I awaited the deaths of the characters like one would await an FMV sequence in a Playstation game. The movie was executed so well that as much as I try, I can't hate it.Final Destination 2 fails to live up to its predecessor, but can we really name more than two sequels that do?

Is this supposed to be horror or comedy?,"Let's get one thing crystal clear: The Final Destination series is NOT HORROR! It's a comedy of errors. It's not Shakespeare's Comedy of errors because that would be giving this silly series of films way too much credit.Basically, Death sets up a series of ridiculously complex series of traps to kill people. Now, these are traps so insanely complex that the clown from the Saw films would be in awe.Now, don't get me wrong, I normally abhor blood and gore in horror films. But in this movie it's so over the top and unbelievably silly that in all likelihood this film will make you die... laughing. I'm serious man, when somebody is trying desperately to get out of a situation you may find yourself laughing and wondering ""wow, how can this get any more silly?"" And the funny part is that most of the time these people do something that leads to their own demise! You can't blame death for half of the things that happen. These people die because they are complete dumbasses! Anyways, at least it's got Ali Larter, she's pretty easy on the eyes. But the movie is impossible to take seriously. The gore factor is so over-the-top ludicrous that even for shock value it ends up(again) being silly instead of horrifying.My advice?

Scary??????,"This movie wasn't scary. In order for a movie to be scary there needs to be suspense. When the movie gives the order of the deaths before they happen you know who gets it and when. Where's the suspense?This movie was just an excuse for gore. Nothing scary, funny or intelligent in this one. The writers of this movie thought they were clever but were far from it. I hated this movie so much.The plot was totally stupid. I got it after reading the box or hearing the characters say over and over that you can't cheat death. If you are supposed to die you are supposed to die no way to beat it. But even here they are inconsistent. So many plot holes in this one - the premise at least needs to work and it doesn't. Why was one character not able to comment suicide yet and another was? Answer: because it was convenient for the story.This movie was just an excuse to show as much gore as possible. They would try to scare you that one gory thing would happen but another did. Very tasteless excuse to be as gory as possible. Why couldn't death just make someone stop breathing? No, they had to torture someone by having them go through hell at the dentist office then squash them like a tomato - a kid none the less. They had to totally drag out a decapitation. Even the crash scene at the beginning was way over done - everyone had to die a gross way in the crash.My stepson said it best: I've seen this movie before. It was called Final Destination 1. I myself didn't see Final Destination 1 before, but believe it because nothing in this movie seemed clever even watching this sequel to an 'original' movie I hadn't seen.At least in Friday the 13th there was Jason, in Night Mare on Elmstreet there was Freddy, in Halloween there was Michael Meyers, and even in Childs Play there was Chuckie - there was no visible bad guy in this one.This movie was total garbage even by horror movie standards.

"Not as good as the first, but still great","Final Destination 2 is a great sequel to the original. It continues with the first film's premise, while incorporating a couple of new elements and twists and turns without being boring or annoying.The inclusion of a character from the first film helps easily tie the films together, which the future sequels can have a bit of a problem with.One of the franchise's strong suits is its ability to have extremely entertaining deaths. This one takes those deaths to a new level and has some of the best in the series.I don't like this one as much as the first one, but it is a close second. Definitely give it a watch if you've seen the first one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Funny as Hell,When I saw this movie and you see the people die you can't help but laugh at them. The kills all make no sense and look faker than movies made in the 1950's. The people fold like paper and of course the blood looks like fruit punch and things are impaling people's faces and it's 1 cm from their face. If you are a horror fan then this isn't the movie for you. But if you want to laugh until you throw up then you got to see this movie. 0/10 in horror 15/10 for comedy.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Gore, Semi-Suspense and one pair of Naked Breasts","I have not seen the original ""Final Destination"", and I don't think I want to. Not that Final Destination 2 was a disappointment, because it was everything I was expecting. An easily digestable, predictable, teeny-bopperish horror movie with lots of gore, special effects and mediocre acting. If you're slightly sick-minded, you'll have tons of laughs.

Premonition,"I just saw Final Destination 2 for the first time. I really enjoyed this movie. It is another attempt at the original's plot line about how you don't interfere with Death's plan. If you do, you are going to die eventually. It will stock you. You are never safe. This story does have an overlapping connection to its predecessor. There are plenty of cool death scenes. Please anyone reading this I am not trying to glorify death and say its cool, but within the contexts of a horror movie it is exactly that. I saw the original when it first came out so the first premonition seemed foreign to me. I liked that feeling because it added to the overall mood of the movie; although some of the connections to the first movie were not connecting as easily for me.This was a good horror flick.

Another sequel that goes over the top,"If you saw ""Final Destination 2"" before the original (Like I did) you won't understand anything. Basically this movie is based on the first one completely, unlike other sequels that have a brand new storyline not based on the original movie.The plot is the same, but the way it develops it's totally different. This time, it's much more predictable than the original one and much more surreal. Deaths are a lot more gory, bloody and...as I already said it: predictable and surreal.About the characters, there's not as much chemistry between each other as there was at the first movie, they have anything to do among each other, is like you don't feel sorry that one character have just died 'cause it wasn't that important.The movie is good enough (for being a sequel) to entertain you, but it's one of those movies that you can only watch for one time 'cause it loses sense once you saw it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not Unlike Porn: No Logic, No Story, Just Money Shots","This is not a good movie.I went through other comments, and all that, and most of the ""pro"" comments seem to call it watchable, scary, gory, suspenseful... and the opening traffic accident is all of these things, but it fades away the instant this scene ends and the movie has to rely on its actors. It's not that they're bad, they're just under-directed, and stuck with a screenplay that has moments like, say, a character picks his jacket up, knocks a pool-ball to the floor, which rolls to a mousetrap, which snaps and flings the ball up into he air, knocking loose a suspended kayak, which swings loose and nearly kills someone. ""Should have seen that coming,"" says the movie's most experienced character... Is that supposed to be a funny line? Seen that coming HOW, exactly? By watching out for pool balls? Not unlike Friday the 13th Part... I dunno, say, VII: The New Blood, this is NOT a good movie.I'm defining ""good movie"" as something with character, a plot, and a conflict which must be resolved. The first one had these things. But ""FD2"" is structured like a porno-- the writers clearly got together beforehand and came up with each 'action' sequence, then cobbled together some terrible talking-scenes to hold them together. What saved this movie from being straight-to-video, I'd wager, is that the action scenes come off pretty well. Only half of them are clever or original, all are well staged and photographed, but what comes between them pales in comparison to ""Mimic 2"" or ""Leprechaun 4: In Space."" Director David Ellis, who is about as competent as the director of ""The Fly II,"" must be the best liar in the world. ""In this scene,"" he must have told an actor, ""There's smoldering remains next to you, but don't show grief or horror, we'll work that out in editing."" At least in the first one Devon Sawa was a good enough actor to pass off his lack of grief as growing madness. Here the actors just say the lines and move from scene-to-scene making no sense or logic, just chess pieces (well, checkers pieces) awaiting the next gore scene. And by the way-- the first film? The emphasis was on suspense, not blood.The first film was something interesting and clever (and cool) from writers of ""The X-Files."" Here, the writing is embarrassingly incompetent, there's as much tension as a trip to the mailbox, and the director blew 80% of his budget on two scenes, and suddenly he's A-List for ten minutes. It won't last; the final twenty seconds of the film were the only cheer-worthy moments. Something else it has in common with ""The Fly II"" ... which shows you the kind of raw talent we're working with here. Car crash-- 9/10. Rest of film-- 1/10. Subtract a point for completely wasting Tony Todd, leaves us with 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
I probably missed the point but I found this generally lazy and quite offensive,"One year on from the events that followed the destruction of Flight 180, Kimberly Corman and her friends are on a trip. On the road Kimberley has a vision of a horrific pile up and stops her car, blocking the access road. When the accident occurs Kimberley survives and has saved many other drivers. However when the survivors start to die in mysterious circumstances, Kimberley contacts Clear Rivers who survived the 180 flight and finds that death is coming after each of them in turn.I saw this with family and had no voice in the choice. I only semi-enjoyed the first film and couldn't see this being any better. The start of the film (i.e. the crash) is powerful and pretty well done - it is horrific, scary and very unsettling. However after this the film settles back into the rut it was in the second half of last time. In place of genuine scares the film goes for gore by killing each person in increasingly unlikely and gory ways. If this is your thing then you'll enjoy it, however I wanted more than just effects and gore. There is no tension and no scares - as a horror it works in terms of gore but nothing else.The characters are simply meat and nothing more - the film could have been 15 minutes long by cutting out all the pointless plot and just having the death scenes together. I felt no interest in any of these people and the majority of them were just given enough presence to make an impact when they were killed. I find this type of laziness really annoying - the makers just wanted the cinematic equivalent of a slaughter house, no substance or meaning, just a production line of body parts. I usually write a little about the actors and their performances when i do reviews but here it would be a waste of my time as no-one actually gave a performance worth talking about. They stuck in my mind only because of how they died. Only the Candyman added interest in a minor role.Even as a horror movie this is a messy failure. It has one good scene that is terrifying but after that nothing - just one more protracted list of red herrings leading to the eventual gory death scene. I found it offensive that someone felt I would want to spend 90 minutes watching people be cut up and killed in gory ways without having anything else to offer. No characters, no plot (other than a rehash of the last film), nothing new, no spark, no flair, no good performances, few real scares and basically a real lazy and unnecessary sequel. Like I said - I found this gory film to be offensive, dull and quite unpleasant to watch. Avoid it or you'll only be encouraging the producers to come back for a third one - and no one wants that.",,Anonymous,Horror

Alex from part 1 could have (more like SHOULD have) died with Clear in some overly-complicated, sudden, and gory accident that these movies are known for. The movie was still very good.

Decent Sequel,"Final Destination 2 (2003)** 1/2 (out of 4)It's vacation time so Kimberly (A.J. Cook) decides to take a trip to Florida with three of her friends. While on the highway Kimberly has a premonition of a deadly car accident, which will kill several people including herself and her three friends. Thrown into a state of shock Kimberly refuses to drive any further and within the matter of seconds a chain reaction wreck takes place and the entire road is filled with fire and death.Kimberly's friends are killed but she's saved due to Officer Burke (Michael Landes) who pulls her from death right before it would have taken place. Although her friends are dead Kimberly is a hero because she saved the life of everyone behind her on the road. However by doing this she has altered the plans of Death who will have to go back and fix things by killing those who were saved. Together Kimberly and Burke must find a way to save the others and destroy Death before it can take its toll.As with the case of many cash-hungry sequels, if you've seen the first film then you pretty much know what to expect out of this one. The story lines are pretty much the exact same and the movie really doesn't try to hide the fact that it's very unoriginal due to it being basically a remake more than a sequel. However, like the first film this one here has a very intriguing story dealing with cheating death that at least makes it watchable throughout. Just because the story is interesting doesn't mean anything else works though.What I really don't understand about this film is the graphic and over-the-top gore, which fills the screen every time it comes for someone to die. I'm a die-hard horror fan and gore has always played an important part in various slashers but Final Destination 2 isn't a mindless slasher but a wannabe intelligent film that tries to be a serious film. The director throws tender moments at us along with a lot a funny moments yet at the same time we get very graphic violence, which serves no purpose at all and comes off very mean and cold.Within the short running time we get heads ripped off, eyes poked out, explosions, torture, bodies ripped in several pieces as well as young kids being killed. All of this leaves nothing to the imagination and at first its rather shocking but before long you'll be rolling your eyes and asking yourself what's the point to all of this. The further the movie goes the more gore is thrown at us, which eventually becomes laughable and takes away what the film was trying to accomplish. Gore is never scary and it's not a good idea to use it when trying to make suspense or fear.Final Destination 2, outside the useless and tasteless violence is of course very stupid but in my opinion it's everything a Hollywood film is today. While watching the thing you might find yourself having a good time but three minutes after the credits role the movie is all but forgotten and you really can't remember too much about what you've just seen. I'm fairly certain had this film been made thirty-years ago some small time director would have made a very intelligent film about Death. This film however is too worried about being hip to a younger crowd that it's virtually pointless. As for the CGI, in case producers don't know, there's a guy named Tom Savini out there that could have done many of the death scenes a lot better and made them actually look real.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as good, but still fun","Final Destination 2 (2003, Dir. David R. Ellis)Whilst heading onto the main road, Kimberly Corman has a vision of a huge car accident. Halting up the traffic, Kimberly is horrified when the accident actually happens. Kimberly links the occurrence with a similar event a year earlier. Researching up on Clear Rivers, Kimberly discovers that death's pattern has been disturbed, meaning everyone who was originally supposed to die, will now encounter a freak accident. Including her! Kimberly and the rest of the survivors, must work with Clear to try and stop Death from repeating it's process.I personally had a great time watching 'Final Destination', and was hoping for much of the same experience for its first sequel. Although it felt like it to me, later i realised, that it actually isn't as good as the first film. Everyone was great in the film, including Ali Larter, and there was some surprising deaths, but the whole factor of not knowing about death seemed missing. That's what was so great about the first film. No one know how death works, but now they know, it seems to kind of take away the fun.

Great death sequences within a mediocre film,"Final Destination 2 is not high art; nor is it particularly funny or dramatic.  Yet several intricate and often very tense death sequences and an amazing sequence of car crashes make at least portions of this movie quite memorable.  The acting is mediocre, the script is routine, but the special effects and unabashed gore actually help make this movie pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Poorly Written, Lacking Originality","The first movie took the time to follow teen horror flick conventions, to develop characters -as thin as they were - and to throw in some theories about why all these people were dying. In the second movie, all these time-fillers are skipped and the movie becomes a heaping helping of mind-boggling mayhem. Final Destination 2 asks why it should bother with the parsley of plot, dialogue, or characters, when people just want a plateful of death.In many ways, tunneling all of the sequel's energies into a smorgasbord of imaginative deaths works better than the heavy-handed ""suspense"" of the original film. The acting is mediocre at best. Do they solve the riddle in time? Few will care, considering that there is no reason to like any of the characters and the main thrill of the movie comes from the elaborate nature of the deadly accidents. If this movie is supposed to be a scary thriller, then it flies far of the mark. If, however, Final Destination 2 seeks to take us no further than bloody spectacle, then it does a fine job indeed.

As a rewatch 12/10/18' Final Destination isn't completely as bad as remembered. Over five years since the original viewing, much remembered had been forgotten save for some scenes. Nothing too memorable about this film in comparison to the original. We can see as to why audiences preferred the original, with a main reason being the cast was more likable and easier to root for. Though this film,the death scenes and overall deaths are far more gruesome and violent.There is a different atmosphere here, as the film seems more serious, though filled with more noticeable silly dialogue. Overall Final Destination 2 isn't bad for what's it worth, as there are still several scenes of suspense, thrills and overall excitement. Rating changed from 3 to 5. As another rewatch 03/11/20' opinions remain same. There are some clever and good moments but as a whole, the original is superior.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A ""Bloody"" Good Time","First off, to enjoy this movie you have to take it for face value.  It is not attempting to be like THE RING or anything of that matter.  This movie is clearly made so the audience can watch people die in crazy ways (I know its a little twisted).  It really in a way is a comedic/horror picture.Unlike its predecessor, this movie realized the farfetched plot and runs with it.  The first one was good, but it took its topic to seriously.  The deaths are overly creative and drawn out to great legths in some cases, all given for shock value.  Before long the audience finds itself, ""I wonder how the next person is going to die?""  It brings about a lot of fun anticipation.  This sequel is good in part due to the fact that is doesn't have much to live up to, I mean the first movie was about the same thing, except in the sequel ""Death"" becomes a little more creative.The acting talent is none to remember, but that is what makes it fun is the fact that you don't care to much about the characters as they get picked off.  The movie does throw a few plot twists in the mix just to make things more interesting, and it works.Beware, this movie isn't for those with weak stomachs.  Along with the elaborate death scenes comes a very elaborate amount of blood.  Clearly the filmakers were hoping to win on shock value, and in this case they do.  The opening crash sequence is like none I have seen before.  IT is absolutely amazing and becomes very intense.This movie is fun.  It is in no way a movie that will go down on the top 10 horror movies of all time, but for what the filmakers were trying to achieve, they did a great job.For a great ""bloody"" time at the movies, I give FINAL DESTINATIOn 2 a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awful Conclusion to Final Destination,"A movie that took the teenage splatter flick in new directions is put to rest here by a sequel which returns to the usual improbable setups and warped laws of physics to burn, slice, and squish teenagers in ways you've never seen.FD1 had immensely imaginative death traps, which could almost always be completely construed as freak accidents.  FD2 stretches credibility in that field - a man who's hand gets caught in a stopped garbage disposal while his apartment burns down around him?  (Has this EVER happened to ANYONE?) Barbed wire that can tear through human bone?  (By the way, that was from Cube.)  And has NO driver in this movie ever heard of using brakes??  By the end, ideas have run short and the movie breaks all the rules it has established to kill off the last character (Eugene).Speaking of breaking rules, what is with the cop's gun which can now evade basic physics, because it isn't part of ""death's design""?  Since it suggests invincibility until ""your number is up"", then why wouldn't you go out and just have an all-out joyride until you became ""next"".Splatter films only work because you can see and relate to the psyche of the characters.  Once the circumstances of the situation become completely irrational, it fails to scare or entertain.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

In no less than 4 scenes, the boom microphone is clearly visable. In 2 scenes, it's just poking down into the top of the frame. In one, it came down far enough to ruin what would have been a great scene. In the 4th, the mic was at nose level with the actors.

Basically the same premise but it is still a decent sequel,"This movie basically has the same premise but it is still a decent sequel because of the creative direction it goes with it. This lacked the creepy factor the original had but the deaths and direction of it all was slightly more entertaining in my opinion. Maybe because it is faster paced even if it goes in a more ridiculous and stupid direction it has more action going on with this one. Movies about death or grim reaper has been done before in the past but I liked how it doesn't show death in this franchise so far. But since the build up and the set up of what is going on has been done before in the previous film, it makes this movie more predictable. The death scenes are creative in a way but seemed way too forced. They way the characters work with each other to survive wasn't crafted all that great or effectively but it's passable. Overall it isn't a great horror sequel but it's still decent. Lastly the main positive aspect about the plot though is how it cleverly connects to the previous movie.7.2/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The story of a female Nostradamus,"The story of a female Nostradamus version of the young one in final destination 1 is brought back here, the story is similar, only that the facts are quite different and the characters are new. Kimberly (aka female Nostradamus), has a lot of support with the people involved in the accident, this is different from the first movie; and when the things are ""easier"" for someone, the movie also lose some tension. The characters are all together supporting themselves trying to protect between them from their final destiny, with good visual effects and a lot of interesting and original deaths. (Sorry if this sound sadist!). Why i didn't like the movie?, well is just because in comparison with the first movie has very deficiencies (in my personal opinion): (1) This movie doesn't have the tension of the first, you see deaths but don't feel the level of drama of the first. (2) The story goes to a level at which you start to don't believe the events, are unreal and obvious at some moments. (3) You expect to see an even better movie when you already know the thematic, and you get disappointed when you watch an inferior movie. Well is my personal opinion but as always you have to see it for yourselves and make your own critic.ABOUT THE MOVIE: This story is held one year after the plane crash of the first movie, where Kimberly Corman (A. J. Cook) predicts a deadly accident on a high speed road, where a lot of people will die, she then stops and avoid death, her friends die in the accident after she stepped out of the car and it was crashed by another car, but with her, some other people escaped from dead; as the first movie, death follow each one of them to fulfill its purpose, they held together in order to stay alive; the group followed by dead are: police officer Thomas Burke (Michael Landes), Eugene Dix (Terrence T.C. Carson), a black boy skeptic of dead, Rory Peters (Jonathan Cherry), a rock style guy, Kat Jennings (Keegan Connor Tracy), a beautiful girl, Nora Carpenter (Lynda Boyd) a mother and her son Tim Carpenter (James Kirk), Evan Lewis (David Paetkau), Isabella Hudson (Justina Machado) and Shaina (Sarah Carter). They are aware that death will follow them, so Kimberly looks for Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) one survival of the plane accident to help them to avoid death, they together start to find clues and answers to escape from destiny, but this show being a rather difficult task.2/10!",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
fantastic,"when i found out that final destination 2 had come out i was so excited to see it i just thought wow but i also thought it cant be any better then the first final destination,no-way ,but when i watched it i couldn't chose which one was the best . with the big pile up on the motor way and how realistic the vision was ,and with the music it made you think oh whats going to happen here .The weirdest deaths were when the man got the ladder in his eye ,when the women was in the car and got the pole in her head and when the womens head was chopped of by the elevator.It sent a shiver down my spin .but what i also found great was when Eugene wanted to end his life so that he wouldn't die a horrible death,he went to shoot himself but none of the bullet's came out even though the gun was full.it was a fantastic carry on to final destination 1 the graphics of each persons death were brilliant especially when the man is cut up by the fence .and the clues that were shown e.g man with hooks ,birds and also bloody hands were great .altogether the film was just incredible to watch!!!!!!I've watched it that many times the DVD will probably brake loll!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The best of the series,This devolved into a black comedy rapidly and there's no real attempt to make this a horror film. This is purely about as many silly and complicated deaths the production team could come up with and on that level it succeeds. The acting is a little bit better in this one than most of the others and the writing is crisper. Overall this is just a funny film.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
There's Going to be a Huge Accident!,"This film is about Kimberly and her friends going to take the time off and spend their time going on a vacation. She drives the car and sees disturbing things that hints as a car accident. A truck is carrying logs in which the logs slides on the street killing many people in a gruesome pile up. While Kimberly and her friends are on the ground, in the car, another big truck, filled with flames, goes to her and before it crashes, Kimberly wakes up in a vivid dream.She blocks the road so the cars behind her wouldn't go. An officer spots this and questions why she's doing this. She tries to explain she had a dream that a pile up just happened. Then before long, the truck with the logs kill the other cars in the highway. She saves 10 people for that but three of her friends automatically dies at the beginning where another car crashes into them. Now 7, including Kimberly, are left. Suddenly, the survivors get killed one by one by gruesome accidents. Now Kimberly has to find a way to stop this before Death kills her.If you haven't noticed, this film has the exact same concept and plot in this movie as its original. On the contrary, it doesn't take itself too seriously, much funnier, smarter, and more elaborate and gruesome deaths. It's much lighter. Well, yeah, there are a few weeping scenes but I think this film was made to entertain the audience and not tire them with the over dramatic scenes.This film takes place one year from the original. The deaths, as stated above, are more elaborate and gruesome, which makes the film better. The clues that foreshadow each death are now more elaborate and I love the score in here, which is even more brooding and suspenseful than the one in the original that this film is even more thrilling. I acting by A.J. Cook is great.Basically, this film puts everything up a notch: The death, the premonition sequence (which has probably the best car accident scenes you'll ever see in your entire life!), the much needed humor, the intelligence, more characters to love, etc. I would call this a guilty pleasure and I love it THAT much! See the movie if you don't care if it's a repeat of the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good sequel to the original,This movie is a good follow up to the original. It introduces new mechanics in regards to death. The movie has a beginning that feels like a horror but again is not a horror film. The use of a character from the previous movie creates interesting scenarios but seems like it may have been the creators taking an idea from Saw II. Still not as much gore as I'd think but a little more than the original. The characters are more cooperative but their backstories are not as interconnected to one another (except they kind of are).,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Final Destination 2 as a sequel is very mediocre,"Final Destination 2 as a sequel is very mediocre. In sequels, everything should be better or at least more. There are sequels.

Bad acting and silly execution of an interesting concept,"Except for the lovely A.J. Cook, every actor in FINAL DESTINATION 2 shouldn't quit their day job. Oy! If you want to see a movie with a lot of bad acting, check out FINAL DESTINATION 2.The story is interesting (I didn't see the first film) but it's done like a TV movie-of-the-week way, which is unfortunate because for a story like this to work, it needs a lot of style. The film is as stylish as a pampers commercial.A lot of gorehounds have praised this movie for the amount of bloody action in it and I have to say that's it's good to see some actual violence after watching so many bloodless PG-13 so-called horror films. But the amount gore got boring very quickly. It just became a tad ridiculous after a while.

Final destination 2,"The story sees a young girl called Kimberley have a premonition in which a motorway pile up kills dozens of people including her and her friends. When she wakes up she of course avoids the disaster along with a few other cars full of people that she stops from driving into the path of the accident. Of course the result is that once again, the spirit of Death stalks all the survivors to ensure no-one escapes.A solid follow up to the first film and after a slow start it becomes gripping and involving with some inventive death scenes such as the ladder impaling a guy's eyes,an excitingly filmed road accident, strangled by lift doors and a boy getting crushed. The characters are complex and relatable, as some can be downright arrogant or ignorant, and the performances are great.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Yet another plot hole,"Again they mentioned about the order they will die. Well, they didn't die after the highway pile-up in the order they died during the highway pile-up. It was kinda random, actually. What gives? Why make that a major point when it's not observed all the way through? Nos. 2 and 3 are admittedly fun to watch, but they just contain way too many implausibilities and confusion and absence of logic in many cases. Still, better than Fried Green Tomatos....Now, the pick-a-part. Ladder through the eye kept going even though the ladder should have stopped after hitting the asphalt. Plate glass will not liquefy a human but will pound you into a smaller ball. Elevator inner doors prevent outer doors from closing on a person. Steering wheel airbags don't deploy when the force is from the side. Barbed wire, aside from a small barb every foot or so, is larger than 1/8"" and is round and will not cut through a body like razor wire, rather it will just slingshot you painfully (same error in Ghost Ship). The hospital room blowing up was just plain boring, what was so special? And I don't know of many barbecues, whether propane or briquettes or wood, that blow up like that. That's why the first movie was somewhat more believable. The second and third were just excuses to hype the deaths over the story. Regardless, they're still OK.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"More Gore, Less Entertaining","I watched the original Final Destination and absolutely loved it, I though the whole idea was great, as was most of the acting, but not all. I decided to check out the second, thinking it would be just as good, maybe even better. But I was bitterly disappointed. I mean the beginning part plot being a highway pile-up is pretty cool. But the death's just seemed too full of gore. Of course if gore is your thing then you will probably disagree with me but for a non-gore fan it's just my opinion. Anyway, the deaths in number two aren't as realistic...OK so the first ones were imaginative too but the point is, they were a little more believable in the first than in the second.

And that's exactly what Final Destination 2 is.It's even more over-the-top than the original movie was. A new group of people once again escape death in a huge accident, only to face further absurdly elaborate attempts on their lives. The death scenarios were all pretty entertaining, and if you weren't tired of the formula after the first movie, you'll probably enjoy the escalated efforts of this second installment. It's literally just more of the same, but guessing how each person is going to die is the kind of light entertainment that just doesn't get old, for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"not a bad horror movie, but...","The battle between fate and free will has been explored in much of literature and film.  Whereas Minority Report, the best picture of last year, examined the idea through large plot twists and the human emotions of its main characters, Final Destination 2 strives to do so through the impaling of large intestines and main arteries.  What culminates is not a bad horror film-it is better than its predecessor-but its reliance on the genre of horror sequels leads to its inevitable demise.With the exception of Willard, all of the horror movies released this year (Darkness Falls, Dreamcatcher, and now Final Destination 2) have had their strongest moments in the film's opening minutes.  Aside from obvious flaws in Ellis' direction, the sequence on the highway, from what most of the trailer is derived, stands out as the film's highlight.  The scenes after it should be renamed Final Destination Too, because the whole plot is the first movie.  The only exception is that it does not waste its time developing characters that we know will be killed off anyway.It is not essential to have any knowledge of the happenings in Final Destination.  The screenplay's exposition takes place in between both films, and all the returning plot elements are exhaustingly expressed through cheesy dialogue.  Through an overdose of foreshadowing, the predictability factor is just as high as its elements of surprise.  This unevenness hints at yet another sequel in the film's resolution-if it can be called that.**1/2 out of ****",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Everything looked good except for a slow-motion explosion near the end of the film which wasn't a very special effect. The sound design is engaging, especially watching with surround sound.

Weak Sequel,"Back in 2000, Final Destination was kind of a surprise mini-hit at the U.S. box office, with a $53 million domestic gate. Critics didn't generally care for it, but I sort of enjoyed the youth-targeted entry in the horror/slasher genre. It had a modicum of ingenuity, maintained an ominous tone, and managed to pull off some creative deaths which seemed to come jarringly out of nowhere. Oh, sure, it used the same old formula, but at least it handled everything pretty well.In that first film, a teenager pulled his friends off a plane based on a premonition that they would all die. The plane did blow up, but ol' Mr Death was mighty ticked off at being cheated, so he eventually caught up with them and killed them in the same order in which they would have died if they ha d stayed in their seats.Death has always been a sore loser! He makes John McEnroe look as gracious and white-bread noble as Lou Gehrig. Hell, he's still hacked off about losing that chess game in The Seventh Seal.This year's sequel takes place on the anniversary of that first plane crash. In the latest development, a young girl has a premonition of a massive pile-up on the interstate highway, so she uses her car to prevent her friends and some others from using the on-ramp. The pile-up does occur, so she saves many lives, but Mr Death is still being a poor sport in the sequel, and he starts immediately to kill off the people who were spared unduly.Um ... assuming that makes sense to you so far, it pretty much stops making sense there. The girl with the premonition goes to a mental institution to visit the one girl who survived the airplane incident in the original movie. (Ali Larter, who appears in both films and has enough talent that she should have a better career than this.) Together, the girls go to visit that Candyman dude with the really low voice, who is apparently in this movie because his own horror series has run out of sequels. He's supposed to be an expert in death, and he mutters some profoundly spooky stuff which makes little sense but sounds important, so the survivors mull it over for the rest of the film. He tells them that ""only a new life can defeat death"".Before the survivors can figure out the precise meaning of Candyman's advice, they come up with several misinterpretations of the cryptic remarks, and most of them end up dying in nasty ways - their bowels chopped out and their nostrils raped and ... well, for the details, consult the Sir Robin song in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Will any survive? You have to watch it to see.The sequel does not have the talented Devon Sawa. It has none of the jarring surprise engendered by the Rube Goldberg deaths that marked the first film. It also has very little of the macabre wit that powered the original, the only real exception occurring in the very last ten seconds of the film. Mostly it just has scenes which depict the explicit dismemberment, piercing, decapitation, and fricasseeing of various humans, and the distribution of their remains in unpleasant places.Although the original Final Destination was a popular film with young audiences at home and abroad, most critics hated it. I rather enjoyed that first one in a guilty pleasure sense, but I didn't consider the sequel worth watching at all.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

First of all, when things explode, biger parts, which have more energy loaded into them because of the explosion, get into flying, but a fence with two posts, this just is not possible. I have blown things up too and seen how it happens, in this move it is just a hollywood action, cars don't blow up when fuel ignites, they just burn, there is no explosive material, unless some guy just puts 2 big barrles of trotyle in a TV van!! So even when a car is loaded with explosives, fence just doesn't fly at that speed and slice a guy (posts are in the ground too, so the fence may just fall, not more).

Weakest of the franchise,Final Destination 2 Was Not Very Good It's Really Boring,2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Somewhat Fun, but Can't Stand Up to the Original","After the sleeper hit that was the original Final Destination, the studio was obviously anxious to deliver a follow up. However, the original crew involved in the making of the first, could not return. As a result, we have a whole new cast and crew. This was also done with the second Nightmare on Elm Street movie. And while this is not quite as bad of a movie as that one, it does still prove that sometimes the best way to do a sequel is to bring back the original crew.This new film ups the gore and humor of the original in an attempt to create a movie with more vigor and intensity. However, the end result is a mildly entertaining, but overall empty movie. It fails to deliver the tense atmosphere of the first movie, even if it does sharpen the humor of the first in some moments. These brief one liners delivered by the characters offer most of the entertainment of the movie, which is nit necessarily the best complement to give to what was a serious horror movie.This time around we have a more colorful group of characters. AJ Cook portrays what turns out to be a very compelling leading character. She manages to add a little more intrigue to the film, and is one of the main reasons the film is worth watching at all. The best character of the movie is probably Kat, who offers a does of effective dark humor to the film. Some of the other characters have a few clever moments. However, some are absolutely irritating. It was a great relief to find out that Kimberly's friends were not in that much of the movie as what screen time they did get, they proved to be insufferable. And the character of Eugene (the black motorcyclist) proved to be highly unlikeable as well.This films probably has the most convoluted plot of the whole series. The whole idea of new life is vague and baffling, but not in a way that creates intrigue for the future events of the movie. Death also works backwards in this movie for logic that takes a significant amount of thought to understand. And for a movie that is mainly supposed to be a fun romp, it seemed very out of place.The effects of the movie are a slight improvement on the original's, however the film is still dated by today's standards. It was no doubt a grand feast for horror fans as far as the visuals go back when he first came out, however, today's audiences who were either not alive or too young to remember the film's release won't be invigorated in the same way, nor will they be as compelled to re-watch the film due to a lack of nostalgia.However, the film is not without it's great scenes. Two in particular stand out. It features what is quite possibly the best premonition scene of the whole movie. The car pile up is now iconic in the horror community, even if the rest of the film doesn't measure up. Regardless, it is still a well shot and edited scene. The elevator death is probably the most horrific of the series, remaining both horrifying and tragic as the victim proclaims, ""I don't want to die"" just before death claims them. IN the most effective moment of campy humor, the end scene, involving a teenager barbequing is top notch over the top horror.A few stellar moments, scenes, and characters prevent the film from being unwatchable, and they may even serve as reason enough to watch the movie as some will definitely enjoy the experience, however, they do not save the movie from it's weaknesses. Some audiences, such as the crowds of people and fans who flocked to theaters after viewing the first one, and the most gore thirsty and least demanding horror fanatics will have a great time with the movie, and will be able to put it's flaws to the side. However, it does not escape the more critical eye unscathed.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the first but worth watching.,"I am a huge fan of the first Final Destination film. I would give it a rating of a 9/10. Needless to say I was looking forward to the sequel. So after talking about it for months with my friends, today was opening day and I went to see it. When it started out, I was like oh man this is going to suck because we had drug jokes, a flashing biker chick, and lots of bad acting by everyone in the movie except the main character Kimberly. Then two minutes later the movie got exciting with the best scene in the movie and from that scene on I was hooked. I watched it and enjoyed it. I was very entertained but the only thing that really bothered me was the acting. Ali Larter was still good as Clear Rivers, A. J.  Cook did a decent job in the role as Kimberly and Michael Landes as Officer Thomas Burke did a very good job, but everyone else should go back to acting class because their acting was incredibly poor.Now what I did like about the movie was the deaths. They were just as good as the deaths in the first film. The deaths were a bit bloodier this time around and for some reason caused some laughs which really confused me. I think the bloodier deaths were supposed to make up for the bad acting =). The Deaths were cool, the plot was interesting, the acting from the 3 main characters was decent, but the acting from everyone else was horrible. So if you liked final destination 1 then see the sequel, it won't disappoint on following the same plot and pace as the first one,  as long as you can get over the bad acting from the supporting cast you will enjoy yourself. My rating for Final Destination 2 would be a 7/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Less horror than expected,"When I was a kid I used to play a game called The Incredible machine. Basically, you had to build what is called a Rube Goldberg machine, a device which carries out a simple task in an over-elaborate way. This is the way this movie works, the characters meet their ends in bizarre, creative and elaborate ways.The plot pretty much follows the first part of the series. Criminal Minds-regular AJ Cook plays Kimberly Corman, who gets a premonition and saves a couple of people from certain death in the form of a huge highway pile-up. Of course it was their destiny to die and death will not be fooled.Clear Rivers is kept from the first film, clearly for exposition purposes. She informs the main characters of basically what happened in the first movie, the death list and all. Her character is one of the more interesting in the movie. As is Tony Todd's undertaker character, and it is a waste that his part is so small.I enjoyed the first movie because I felt the premise felt fresh, and though it had flaws it was pretty enjoyable. This movie is basically just more of the same. The horror elements are all but gone, the emphasis is instead placed on the impressive crash scene at the beginning and the elaborate deaths, which makes this more of a gore-action-comedy than a horror movie. The acting is also pretty bad, AJ Cook is decent enough but many other performances are way over-the-top.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Admittedly, on the face of it, that is what you get. But FD2 takes things a step further by showing that the events of the second film take place because of the events of the first film. They are connected far more deeply than simply being ""another batch of people that escape death"".The effects are well done and striking, as in the first movie, this time focusing on a road accident rather than an air crash. And, of course, death's efforts to ""put things right"" by offing those that escaped the road accident are the usual level of weird and seemingly impossible twists of chance that we grew used to in the first movie.Although I welcomed the plot development, linking this movie to the first one, the whole movie was never scary, as such. It's plenty gruesome enough (see the barbed wire scene, for example), but not very frightening. After some thought, I think this is in part due to the fact that I have recently been watching the series ""Dead Like Me"". Every time in the movie that things seemed to take on a life of their own, I was imagining Gravelings prodding and tinkering. It kind of ruined any suspense that might have been in the moment.However, the movie is a worthy sequel to the first. Not necessarily better, just worthy of the name. Again this is mostly due to the fact that it progressed the story a little, rather than simply cashing in on the first's success.If you liked the first movie, this one won't disappoint.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!,"Final Destination 2 Directed by David Ellis Distributed By New Line Cinema Starring Ali Larter Tony Todd!In 2000 we were mesmerized by a small horror film titled ""Final Destination"". This film brought us into the world of Death's day to day job. We find that Death shows a person signs about what's going to happen before It does.Final Destination 2 does the same thing but add's very interesting twists to it. FD2 takes off with a horrific Car accident, and when one of the Accident's would be statistic's see what's in store for them... She Prevents an entire on ramp full of people from getting onto the highway.... people who are meant to die. Now that she has just screwed up death's design her and other's have to find a way to cheat death. Now this sounds like a Solid rip off from the first  film.... And it is....... But it has a new twist and that twist I cannot give away because it is the heart of the film.FD2 is entertaining..... I mean if you can't fall asleep, hell pop it in and give it a watch.... before the end credit's I am sure you will be well on your way to getting those well deserved Z's. If Gore is your thing.......By all means give this one a try.... It's good to see Horror Films are starting to get gory again. FD2 is a guilty pleasure that you just have to indulge in....

Exactly what it tries to be.,"What I love about the Final Destination movies is that they don't try to hide the fact that they are gory trash, but instead they are almost proud of it. This is more bloody than the first, but also has a more complex story. Unlike the other two Final Destination films and most horror films, it doesn't just revolve around a group of high school friends but takes people from all ages at random from society and puts them into this terrifying situation. The acting, direction and so on are of a high standard for a horror film, particularly a sequel. Don't begin this movie expecting anything but a 90 minutes of blood, gore and shocks which is strangely enjoyable. I'm not generally a fan of horror movies, but somehow the Final Destination series has me as a fan.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"cool film, but not as good as the original.","Dont get me wrong, i did enjoy this movie and thought it was pretty cool, but it didnt reach the original's high standards. I thought that this film relied a lot on the original and virtually had the same pace and ideas, just put into new stunts and gore though. for instance when the stoner guy is chopped up by the wire fence i felt De ja vu only an hour later and realised that it was similar to Seann Scott's death in the original; where you see seann's head slide apart you see this guys body fall apart in the same style and position.  The film isnt scary at all, its funny! And the characters arent developed enough to want to see them make it. The film has obviously had some interesting plot twists though, it is just very hard for a film to live up to the origininality of the first i think. When i first heard that a sequel was being planned i thought "" oh good, they're gonna ruin the story"" but i was wrong and think it is definatly worth seeing and will give some good entertainment.RATING: 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Here Comes Another Sequel...,"And everybody knows what that means. Sequels always tend to suck and this one does too. Okay, Kimberly(A.J.Cook) is going to college with her friends and she has a vision that there is going to be a big car accident and everybody is going to die! Oh No!!!!! Unless they can cheat death but then death is going to get them anyways, so what's the point? Exactly, nothing is the point of this movie. The deaths are boring, predictable and ridiculous. The plot was more like a comedy then a horror movie. The acting was absolutley terrible. A.J.Cook has got to be one of the worst actresses ever. The rest of the cast was pretty bad too, the actors were all unrealistic and fake. The only good one was Ali Larter, who returned in this stupid sequel as Clear Rivers. Anyways, i did not enjoy this movie, like I said, unlike in the first Final Destination, this one was very predictable, it went by way too fast, the acting sucked and it was just silly and not exciting at all.

Better-Than-Average Horror Film.,"I never saw the first one; in fact I had never even heard of it until the trailers for the sequel came out. Since I enjoyed the trailers, and also because Tony Todd is one of my favorite character actors, I went and saw ""Final Destiny 2"" in the theater today. I was not disappointed- I enjoyed it quite a bit. Yes, it's gory, and yes, it's not hard to figure which characters are going to die (or live), but the death scenes are quite inventive, and the acting is fairly good. I would have liked to have seen more of Tony Todd (he only had one scene), and the last death was overly cheesy, but this is an  entertaining movie.Definitely recommended for everyone except the overly squeamish.

A Nutshell Review: Final Destination 2,"The saga continues with Final Destination 2, where Ali Larter returns as Clear Rivers (how can you take anyone seriously with a name like that?), in a sequel which rehashes the same premise of premonition and therefore death avoidance, and the survivors this time round getting picked off one by one in similar violent fashion fit only for the screens.The one with the powers this time is Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook), who along with her buddies are going on a road trip. However, she sees a violent accident along the highway they were supposed to travel on, and prevents herself, her mates and a whole host of drivers in other vehicles from going on that ill fated strip, so before you know it, they defeat death's design for them.But Final Destination says death will return to get the souls already earmarked, and here, the same drill applies. Despite the filmmakers here being a totally different team from the original, there are bouts of acknowledgements all around that ties the second movie to the first. Like the setting of the film exactly a year after the first, the return of Ali Larter, and a realization that all the characters here have indirect ties to those in the original. It might sound like a bad case of coincidence, but this is movieland after all.The highway pileup is interesting enough, though the jarring censored bits in this locally pressed DVD made the best bloody bits unavailable. And there were new rules and conditions shared in this sequel, which is probably a good thing to prevent it from being just an extension of the first. What made it a little more riveting was that the characters here experience that feeling that nothing is worse than having to know you have to die, and then waiting for it to happen. The first had most of them pretty much clueless, or much against the ridiculous idea, but here, the group had that set aside pretty quickly, and nothing is more fearful than waiting for your time to expire.The finale suffered though from needing to meet its self-fulfilling prophecy, but made up for it with its totally wicked ending. It doesn't lead to the third movie (each can work as a stand alone), but for those who did not watch FD1, this one pretty much summarizes it all for you.The Code 3 DVD by Alliance Entertainment comes with the widescreen edition with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. However, remind me not to get a locally pressed DVD when there's expected blood and gore. With movies like these, sadly the gory scenes get censored away, and all you get are frustrating cut scenes and jarring edits. Subtitles are available in English and Chinese, and scene selection is available over 15 chapters.The bonus features are quite scanty, with the teaser trailer (1:33), 2 music videos - The Blank Theory's Middle of Nowhere (4:16) and The Sounds' Seven Days a Week (3:20), and a series of deleted scenes.The deleted scenes were non-selectable, and instead of having split up the scenes, you can only view them all together. A total of 5 scenes are lumped into one 9:52 feature, featuring the initial interview at the police station, an extended scene with the mortician, looking for Isabella Hudson, a short scene where Nora was handed a cellphone at the elevator, and additional scenes in the truck en route to the hospital with an extended hospital scene.Decent efforts in visual and audio transfers, but short on the extras. Gone are the audio commentaries from the filmmakers, would sure like to listen to how they did the highway scene.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Next stop,"Well I can safely assume, that you have seen part 1 (if not, I will be spoiling your movie experience, because I will talk a bit about the first Final Destination). Since there weren't that many survivors in part 1, we get a whole bunch of new faces thrown into the mix here. Of course, since you have seen the first one, you know what is going to happen.Still pretty intense and very gripping, although of course not as fun as the first one. As the parts progresses, you always get another setting, where something bad happens, which someone predicts or foresees and tries to save some people (even if it is by ""accident"", no pun intended).

Mo of da same,"Death has a list. And if you're on the list, you're going to die in the order in which you appear on the list.

Anyhoo, that's probably all wrong but you're not going to care about the plot anyway as you watch this sequel to ""Final Destination 1"" in which a coed hooks up with a cop and a throwback from the original flick to thwart death's master plan. Though the film lacks in cohesion and sensibility, it is chock full of cause-effect chain reactions which result in a stuntfest and grisly actions sequences throughout. Probably a tad less than the original (which isn't bad for a sequel), FD2 is a worthwhile watch for anyone into gory horror action dramas made with the old teen and young adult crowd in mind.

One of the best sequels of its genre.,"Most of the time we like to pretend that sequels don't exist, especially in the horror genre, as they generally ruin most of what should have been left untouched from the first film. But every so often the horror genre nails a sequel that brings us everything we liked about the first entry and exemplifies it times two.Final Destination was a great standalone film and truly didn't need the excessive sequels to follow. However, Final Destination 2 delivers and it surely doesn't disappoint. Taking place a few years after the events of the first film, Kimberly and her friends set out on a road trip turned deadly. Having a premonition of a horrific pile up, Kimberly evades death saving the lives of many in what should have been one of the worst pile ups in history. But we all know that you can't cheat death and death always comes back around!Enlisting in Clear Rivers, survivor from the first film, Kimberly tries to save those who were meant to die on the highway that day from death itself. But with death lurking around every corner in the most unsuspecting of places, it's no easy task. The film moves at a solid pace, driving in character emotion as well as a building sense of urgency and suspense. The movie ties up every loose end from the first film, intertwining with the original in a creative, thought provoking manner.Is this film better than the original? In some aspects yes but as a sucker for the original, I would have to say overall no. However, this film is miles better than the sequels to follow and if you have yet to give the Final Destination series a chance- I suggest ending your experience after watching the first two!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Entertaining Sequel, best watched on DVD","Unlike some sequels which don't directly follow the original, Final Destination 2 has a clear link to the original, of which (the event) is mentioned many times, Ali Larter reprises her role as Clear Rivers, though she isn't as impressive as she was in the first, possibly because she is playing second to the classy A.J. Cook.Following a fantastic opening sequence (the infamous high-way pile-up), the film moves at a steady pace, though resulting in a rather disappointing finale. While the film is not necessarily that scary, the deaths are very interesting, and most of the time take place just when you think everything is safe. Worthy of particular note is the death of Lynda Boyd's character who meets an untimely demise involving an elevator.The cast are all competent, with Larter, Cook and hottie Michael Landes as Thomas the police officer carrying the film. Keegan Connor Tracy is always good, and Lynda Boyd is very sympathetic. The actor who plays her son Tim, James Kirk, is pretty good too, the others who are all destined to die are rather annoying. Justina Machido (from ""Six Feet Under"") is fabulous, once again playing a pregnant woman, who the group must somehow find.So while the film isn't groundbreaking, it is an entertaining watch with a mostly likable cast, good pace and some inventive death scenes. The reason I believe it is better watched on DVD is for the fun facts the pop up across the screen during the course of the film, loaded with trivia and behind the scenes info.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Average film, good sequel, doesn't live up to the first.","After finally getting to watching the first film, I've just watched this one last night, hoping it's as good as the first. Let's start off by saying it's not. I did have plenty of criticism for certain aspects of the first film (especially to do with the work of director James Wong), but unlike the first film - this one was never going to be as groundbreaking, original and inspiring.Not unlike the first film, the story kicks off with a group of youngsters on their way to to party somehow somewhere. During the drive, Kimberly (the driver) has a vision which makes her pull over, ultimately saving the lives of the people stuck behind her on the highway. When the survivors begin dying, Kimberly seeks out Clear Rivers, one of the survivors of the famous plane explosion from the first film, in hopes that she could help her and her new friends ""break the pattern"" and ""beat death's design"". The only original addition is new information shared by the creepy mortician (always great to see Candyman Tony Todd, eerie and unnerving as ever).Besides the obvious lack of originality or even the slightest attempt to offer something new plot and story-wise, Final Destination 2 suffers from two obvious shortcomings (in my opinion of course): First, any attempt to compensate for a lacking story with over-intensified gore scenes is low class in my book; and second, the deaths seem too supernatural, much more than in the first film. Where in the first film some water leak, causing the victim to slip - this time the amount of ""coincidents"" leading to each ""freak accident"" feel too much like divine (or unholy) intervention, too deliberate and too far fetched. Not as convincing, not as reasonable, not as good.The small attempt at a plot twist towards the ending isn't successful, and the ending itself is far too comical (again, not unlike the first film). All in all, as a standalone film the film is average at best, and as a sequel - not more than good. It's still a lot of fun to watch after the first, and it definitely isn't a bad film or a reason to quit on the anthology, it just very obviously could have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
REMAKE OR SEQUEL?,"WHAT FOLLOWS IS THE REVIEW I WROTE FOR THE FIRST MOVIE:""The strength of FINAL DESTINATION lies in its ability to keep audiences on (to use a cliche) the edge of their seats. Or rather, to convince audiences that something is about to happen, then do a complete turn-around and have something else inexplicably happen.WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?Well, for example the death scenes. A large build-up ensues, where the movie convinces the audience that a character is going to die in all sorts of horrible ways. Then an anticlimatical drop occurs. The audience sighs, the character will be ok they think. But then - WHAM! - the character is killed in a most unexpected way. This is the power of this movie. Otherwise, the acting isn't very good; the script unsurprising; and the direction often slack, surprisingly so for John Woo.As for the core of the movie, the characters are hastily sketched with no depth and the storyline is rather old-hat fare. There is no denying it, this is a very silly film - but it will have you hooked till the end.Also of note: FINAL DESTINATION is a slasher movie, and the first without an actual killer - death itself stalks the protaganists instead. Interesting too is the way the movie turns everyday objects and occurences into lethal weapons, and sometimes in rather original ways. There are also some neat in-jokes throughout.Bottom-line: Silly but with style and an ability to grip even the most reluctant viewer.""THE ABOVE REVIEW IS PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL FOR THIS - FINAL DESTINATION 2.

As Middle Of The Road As A Sequel Can Be...,"In this follow up to the sleeper hit ""Final Destination,"" in whichdeath comes to claim survivors of a plane crash according to it'sown design, death comes back with a vengence, but his designseems to be terminally flawed.A lot of horror movie enthusiasts will most likely subscribe to thefact that a good horror film means that anyone can die at any time,but what set the original apart was the fact that death had aspecific pattern. In this movie, despite set pieces just as elaborateas the original (including a scene in a dentist's office that isterminaly creepy), death seems to have lost any reason or rhyme;becoming a killer on the level of a third rate Michael Myers.This time around death stalks the survivors of a horrendousfreeway pileup after a young woman has premonitions that theaccident was going to occur.

"Not To Good, Not To Bad...","A year after the events in the previous film, Final Destination 2 picks up with a brand new band of characters. In place of the horrific plane crash premonition, it hits us with something more common in all our lives, an enormous pile up on the highway. Once again a lone girl sees this disaster before it occurs and saves a this time random group of strangers from dying a most hideous death. The characters are a bit more diverse in this sequel but some of them feel dull and unreal more of you can tell that these people are actors. The script is still strong though, keeping those clever death scenes and tricks that I loved from the first film. Duely noted this film contains much more gore then it's predecessor. Making the fancy dress up that the first film had and striping it a bit to seem more like a slasher. Also unlike it's predecessor this one moves quite fast with the story. At some points making it feel rushed and a bit far fetched. Ami Larter returns to play Clear from the first film but with a completely new Sigorny Weaver style (as I like to call it) attitude being an expert on death's little Bobbi traps it sets. It introduces a new idea of how to stop the cycle of death and begins to fill in unanswered questions taking away the mystery of the first film. It did seem at first that this film would follow the same patter as the last and it does but the new ideas keep it refreshing enough to watch. It stick precariously close to the first films script as in character's personality's and clever little puns. But now on to the part that pulls most of it's fans in and thats the gore, I mentioned before there is a lot, and the deaths to accompany them are a bit more far fetched taking the great this could happen to you out from most of the scenes, but I feel all that is made up for in the incredible opening sequence of her premonition.

A Worthy Successor to the First Film!,"Judging from the other reviews it seems most people either love this movie, or flat out hate it. I fall somewhere in between. I saw the first Final Destination in theaters, and at the time thought it was one of the better horror movies I'd seen. I no longer feel that way, although I do think it's one of the better ones to come out of the late 90's/early 2000's period. In the first one I felt like the lead Devon Sawa overdid it a little bit, in turn making the movie more unbelievable every time I watch it. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that Final Destination 2 is better, I will say that I think A.J. Cook played a better/more believable lead. Aside from her I liked Michael Landes as the cop, but the rest of the cast left a lot to be desired. Ali Larter, who played Clear in the first movie, returns for the sequel helping to bridge the two stories together. Clear was my favorite character in the first, so it was nice to see her return. The deaths are much more elaborate in this one, and quite gruesome. Which shouldn't come as a surprise considering that by that time all horror movies had become disgustingly brutal. A lot of people seem to think that that's the appeal of horror movies, but it's not. At least not for me. I've always been more interested in the plot/story aspect, and one thing I've always liked about the Final Destination series is that they make you think. I'm not saying the deaths aren't cool, because they are, and considering how lackluster I found this supporting cast to be I got much more enjoyment out of watching their untimely demise than I would have had the characters been more likable. If you liked the first Final Destination chances are you'll like the second. That's about all I can say without giving anything away. I'd recommend it to any horror fan though. Instead of some deranged psychopath tormenting the characters, it's death itself. Which is pretty cool if you stop and think about it. As a horror fan I'd like to rate it higher, but the supporting cast is so disappointing that I just can't bring myself to do it. Although Ali Larter, A.J. Cook, and Michael Landes carry the others as best they can, it's still not enough to justify a rating higher than a 6 for me. As far as early 2000's horror goes though, this is one of the best, and without question a worthy successor to the first film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Exactly the same...only a little grosser,"Final Destination 1 was one of the only films ever which basic plot-idea made me feel uncomfortable. Not that the film was so mesmerizing or outstanding but simply the idea of a higher force (= death) following you around because your time has come made me somewhat worried. The inevitable sequel to this unexpected little horror-hit has little ambition and practically re-tells the exact same story with different characters (duh!) and even filthier gore. This time, it's a girl (named after horror maestro Roger Corman) who receives a portentous premonition about a horrible road-accident and so saves the life of a group of people that were waiting at the traffic lights. Of course Mr. Grim Reaper isn't about to let them off this easily and the all start dying in ludicrously exaggerated ways (death by flying fence!!). The idiotic theories and added sub-plots are desperate attempts to make the wholesome look at least a little different than the first while the presence of Ali Larter (survivor of the original) is entirely unnecessary. I could also bring up that this film is offensive and contemptuous for portraying death as a simple special effect but I'm not going there because I don't want to give the impression that I totally disliked this film. The shock effects and visuals are astonishing and especially the initial car accident is horrific and very unsettling. The film is completely tensionless and it amazes me how cold and careless everyone's reactions are when yet another person horribly died right in front of their eyes. I can be brief about the acting performances since movies like this simply don't require skilled sense of dialogue. They all do their best, I guess, but it remains Tony ""Candyman"" Todd who steals the show with his 2 minutes guest appearance. Final Destination 2 is worthy horror viewing as long as you're not in a too demanding mood. Maybe the best way to look at it is picturing it as a morbid version of America's Funniest Home Videos.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Bad acting, silly ending hurt decent sequel","The first ""Final Destination"" film was entertaining and creative as a group of students tried to outwit death... now comes the sequel.. is it as good as the original? No.. not even close. Is it entertaining in it's own right? Yes, to a point. The lead character this time is played by A.J. Cook, a young actress who seems to be popping up in many of these thriller films these days. She plays Kimberly, a girl who has a vision that forshadows a freeway crash that kills herself and many others. She blocks traffic and saves a handfull of people, while others die in the gruesome tragedy. And this movie does not skimp on the violence or gore like many other films these days do. The death scenes in this one are quite gruesome. Of course death starts picking off the survivors in freak accidents and Kimberly goes off to find the only survivivng character from the first film (Ali Larter, looking like she's phoning this one in after cashing what was probably a decent size check for a fairly small part). The film is entertaining on its own face, but does have problems. The conections to the first film are tenuous and seem forced and rather silly and the acting (with the exception of Cook, who does a servicable job) is bad, even by these films standards. The story has enough twists and turns and false scares to provide a decent ride, though understanding all the hookum about death and how to trick him is rather mind boggling, the ending is as silly as can be.  Still, its entertaining enough and has some cool effects and gore scenes so that the less discriminating horror fans should enjoy it. GRADE: C",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Solid sequel, maybe a notch better than the first film","The first ""Final Destination"" movie from 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, the Grim Reaper, as an invisible spiritual presence. A group of people, mostly youths, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying those who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually involving an unlikely chain reaction. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash; in this second film from 2003 it's a horrible highway pile-up; in the third it's a roller-coaster mishap and so on.There are currently five films in the franchise and they all tell the same basic story with different characters and some nuances; they're all of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on whether you like the cast and the death sequences (and the locations) because, other than these factors, they're all basically the same, although the fifth film throws in an interesting new twist (Death's victim can find a substitute).Ali Larter returns as a secondary protagonist while A.J. Cook takes the reigns of the 'final girl.' Keegan Connor Tracy also has a considerable role in the female department while Sarah Carter has a smaller part. While this is a quality assortment of women, the creators coulda done more with them. On the opposite side of the gender spectrum Michael Landes stars as a state trooper. Jonathan Cherry, Terrence 'T.C.' Carson and James Kirk are also on hand. Their importance to the story is in that order. Meanwhile Tony Todd makes his second of four appearances in the series as a mortician who curiously knows more than he should.I actually like this one a little better than the first one, but like that film, the second half isn't as strong as the first. Is the final scene supposed to be horrific? Cuz it made me bust out laughing.The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area, including Campbell River (although the events take place around New York City).GRADE: B/B-",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
what is the meaning of a summary?,"This movie rocks all the way!!!!! The deaths are planned out very good and the surprising effects are great.

"You can't cheat death twice, but you can cheat it 5 times","Campy, silly, and rather entertaining- Final Destination 2 can often just feel like a rehash of the first flick- but at times it does manage to have some good ideas- even if they aren't executed very well. I like some of the elements of this film. The look is well developed, and all the actors do try their best. The opening of the film is a bit predictable, but I like the concept, and found it to be an interesting point to start off on nevertheless. The film does seem to bend the rules a little as well, in order to further develop its plot, and honestly the film itself is incredibly imitative of the first- so it's not hard to spot what is coming next. The deaths can often be kinda silly, and much of the logic doesn't make any sense. Some of the writing can be redundant, or just plain stupid, but you oddly feel invested in these characters one way or another thanks to the actors giving it their all- even though we all know its incredibly stupid. In the end, Final Destination 2 is not much of a sequel- but it has its purely fun moments. If you are looking for depth, you certainly won't find it here, but fans of the original and other cheesy horror flicks may have themselves quite a blast.My Rating: 5.2/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Shadowed by a Great OriginalA Guilty PleasureOr Not,"Taken on its Own Terms, these types of Movies have to be Compared to its Peers and not High Art. This is either a Guilty Pleasure or not.The Final Destination Sequel doesn't have the Luxury of being Groundbreaking or Clever. This is Number 2 and it is Spinning Off those accolades and delivering a Cash-In and seems like it was done Only for just That.It means that this is More of the Same. It might be that the Third Entry can go for Deeper Insights and Suspense, but it was not to be for the Follow-Up. The opening ""Highway to Hell"" pile up is one of the most Visceral and Smashing Car Crashes ever put on Film. It is Stunning.The rest of the reveals are no where Near as Engaging and are Nothing more than Semi-Clever ways to Countdown those that have Cheated Death.The Formula shows signs of boring Repetitiveness in the Dialog about Death and its Plan. It Has become more Airy-Fairy in its explanations that were there in the Original but then it was all New Stuff.Now its just seems Blah, Blah, Blah...Death's Design...Blah, Blah, Blah, Who's Next?, and so forth. The Gore is Great and the ""Fun"" is there if You Turn Off Your Analysis and sink Into Your bucket of Popcorn.But if the Third Final Destination doesn't Get Smarter it too will Sink under the Sameness.

Watch it out of curiosity only...,"Ok, so now we're already familiar with the story and know what to expect. Unfortunately, this film offers nothing new to the plot. Instead, it plays like a remake of 'Final Destination'. So much so that there really was no need for this film, and it therefore serves to please those who haven't seen the first film.The film actually follows on 'Final Destination'. Ali Larter reprises her role of Clear Rivers (seriously, that's the character's name!!). Hardly 20 minutes into the film, though, there are so many plot flaws. I must admit, the highway crash sequence was incredible. But why did the random drivers at the scene also go to the police station? Why were they involved? And why are only a handful involved then, and not everyone Kimberley blocked? They should have made it clearer that these people would have died in the crash had she not blocked them off. It would have made a lot more sense if her friends were involved. It's therefore not as good - or effective - a setup as the first film.Whereas the first film was rather serious, here they added humor. There honestly is some humor - and dialogue - that doesn't belong. It completely ruined the film's potential suspense. Quite a number of scenes were unnecessarily comical.The first victim dies much too soon after the incident - before we even got to know him. The killings are more brutal and more far-fetched than the first film, although it can essentially still happen in real life.The acting was unfortunately nothing to write home about. The make-up effects were very good, though. As for the film in general: forgettable.Would I watch it again? No.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Sequel,"Final Destination is my favorite movie of all time.

Final Destination 2 (2003),"I was originally very harsh on this film. It is a sequel just for the sake of money, but after franchises such as Saw, it doesn't seem so bad. We came here for ridiculous deaths and that's certainly what we get. The biggest problem is the amount of characters. Like all horror films, it feels as though it must up the ante. Unfortunately with more and more deaths, each death has less impact. We don't know nor care for the characters, and there is less build up to each death. Here, the characters spend too long looking for clues with no real way of stopping the deaths thus making the whole vision thing rather redundant. AT least this film tried to be inventive with the kills, and expand on the story in some way.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
More Foresight,"Another premonition about a freak accident leads to a different group of 'death cheating' survivors fearing for their lives in this surprisingly decent sequel. While the crash/collision scenes are magnificently intense and very realistic, 'Final Destination 2' does not get off to the strongest start and the first half of the movie feels like more of a remake or rehash of the original, except with even more inventive and elaborate deaths. As the film progresses though, there are some chilling ""outward ripple"" connections made to the characters from the first movie, which makes the overall project more interesting as an extrapolation on the events of Part One. And yet, even if one does walk away feeling that this is more of a rehash than a sequel, there are several improvements here. The death scenes, for instance, always leaving one guessing as to just what will deliver the fatal blow, the characters are more varied and have more personality than in the first film, plus there is quite a bit of comic relief that actually works. The sequel does not, however, have the visual panache that James Wong brought to the first film and nothing compares to Devon Sawa's hyper-awareness scenes in Part One. The basic idea is also not quite so fresh while delivering the same unanswered questions. As alluded to though, this is still a more worthwhile film overall than one might expect.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Entertaining, but not as effective as the original.","Okay, so sequels are rarely as good as the originals, and this is yet another case that confirms this. However, the film was still somewhat entertaining to watch, so it wasn't a total loss. The original was a very well-told story that simply creeped you out. It had a dark, foreboding feeling to it, which is exactly what this type of movie should have. Also, it didn't attempt to explain very much, instead leaving much to the viewer's imagination, which is often the most effective way to approach these topics.Final Destination 2 lacks all of the characteristics I just mentioned. The acting is so absolutely horrible, and the dialogue is lame, too. While I enjoyed how the writers tried to tie this movie to the first, the overall story was simply idiotic and flawed, mainly due to explaining more than we need to know. (And what was that crap about ""a new life"" clearing the list? Please!) Most unforgivingly of all, though, this movie lacks that creepy feeling the first one had. Instead, Final Destination 2 is mainly concerned with delivering the strangest and goriest deaths possible. If that is fun enough for you, then this is the movie for you.To sum things up, here are some helpful recommendations: * If you haven't seen the original, go see it first. * If you really, really liked the original, then see the sequel. * If you didn't like or only mildly enjoyed the original, then stay away from the sequel. * If you like gore flicks, see this one. It's a little more explicitly bloody than most mainstream American films.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the first.,"There is 2 elements that clash with this film.  One the horror gore element, and 2nd the philosophy part.  Yes there is a philosophy in this madness. The horror gore element will evolve into the modern Friday the 13th sequals. I can see Final destination 12 years form now with young people dieing in more dramatic fashions with each film.  Instead of a Goalie mask, and the woods as the fear stimulus, we got death and fate against us.  The first film was wimpy, especially the lead character, the new film picks up speed, and believe me the momentum will pick up with each film.  The pilosophy part of the film is about fate or absolutism verses free will and choice.  I believe if Death has a design and people out living there fate makes a time ripple against its own ends there would be no way to stop it, and the characters efforts would be useless.  The film makers create chaos theory were random event can create an order that has great effects on individuals. The plate of pasta, and the gas turn off would be 2 examples of this.  The film has its usual gross outs, and sick humor.  In the end, I give it a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A very sizeable drop from the original that I found so entertaining.,"'Final Destination 2' isn't a movie I had a bad time watching, but it is undeniably a very sizeable drop from the original that I found so entertaining. Last time out we had a cool plane-related plot, this time out's RTC doesn't quite come out as interesting or as peculiar.The cast are also downgrades, if nothing negative. A. J. Cook & Co. Are perfectly fine in their respective roles, but it is missing a sturdy lead performer. Their characters are also weak, which obviously doesn't help the acting talent. The effects/creative deaths remain fairly good though.It ends up creating some intrigue with the twist(s), though to be honest to me it felt too entwined. What doesn't help is that the cat is out the bag due to the original, it can't hit as much as you know the general gist of it all.

Not too bad of a sequel,"Final Destination 2 is a sequel to the 2000 hit that left many people skeptical of going on a plane ride, set with a new set of characters. This time around involves Kimberly Corman (played by A.J Cook), who sets on a vacation with her friends to Daytona Beach. Like Devon Sawa's character in the first film, Kimberly has a terrifying premonition of her friends and everyone around dying in a horrific disaster, only this disaster a massive car pile-up that leads to a number of deaths. Kimberly intervenes and saves the lives of many (not all) people on the highway. However, she soon learns that Death still has the lives of the individuals she saved on it's agenda. She teams up with Thomas Burke (played by Michael Burke) and Clears Rivers (played by Ali Larter), who revives from the first film, in attempt to save them.This film carries roughly the same story structure as the first film, with an opening disaster and the people getting killed in strange accidents. However, I didn't this one to be as realistic as the first one. Some of the deaths in this film were okay, others were a bit too laughable. The deaths that occur during the massive car crash scene at the beginning were quite good and surprisingly realistic. Secondly, the characters are a bit underdeveloped. Unlike the other films, each of the characters do not have any unique personalities. In the others films, you had the jock, the geek, the hot girl, and all the other character stereotypes. This film didn't have these and made the characters incomprehensible.The good part of this film is the plot. The film moves a decent pace and has its moments of suspense. The climax towards the end was my favorite part of the movie. What I also liked how it connected with the first film, especially having Clear from the previous film return as the character who is incarcerated in a mental institution to protect herself from Death. Overall, this movie isn't a total letdown. It just not as good as the first.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Worked In The 1st Movie, Fails Miserably In The 2nd","Final Destination is exactly the same idea as the first (obviously), and that's not bad.  But the execution, unlike the first one, leaves us with another bland horror film.  First off, this time the survivors are complete strangers, so there is no bond between characters, and we feel nothing for one based on the outcome of another.  They tried to fill it in with some hokey love story, but it just wasn't working.  And brining back Clear Rivers was a bad idea.  It made it way too simple for the people to understand what was going on, and was pretty much put in there to help speed up the writer's poor idea for cheating death.  It's also another movie in a long line since 6th Sense that just uselessly throws plot twist after plot twist at you in order to convince you it's really a smart and deftly crafted thriller.  It's not.  The ""big twists"" are anitclimatic.  The death scenes were much more far fetched than last time, but some are still fun to watch.  It's a little gore happy, but that's expected from a horror sequel.  They have to make up for the lack of story from the predecessor, so they just whip out the 'ol ultra violence.  The cast is nothing better than average.  The lead girl was pretty bad though. Sadly, Tony Todd is still gives the best performance, despite being the movie for about 5 minutes.  David R. Ellis is just a bland director.  Capable, sure, but bland.It's a throwaway sequel.  It takes a the good idea the first one had and throws it away in favor of violent death scenes, which are cool at times and a part of any good horror film, but should not be the main focus.  Sure to give teenie boppers a good scare, but any else should think twice about seeing this.3.5/10*/ * * * *",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Somewhat Enjoyable but Totally Ridiculous,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this film on video so that I could see it for a low price( judging from the stupidity of the original, this installment could not be worth $8.75). Before the film came out on video I read through quite a few of the reviews written on this web site for Final Destination 2, and judging from the general consensus, one would be led to believe that this film is actually a worthwhile movie. When July 22nd came around, and the video stores were stocked full, I actually felt a sense of excitement while driving to get it. So I rented the DVD version, took it home, and 15 minutes into the film I could have SWORN that I was watching the original movie, except for the fact that the characters were dying on the freeway, and not in the sky. I mean give me a Goddamn break, absolutely no originality or variation from the original. The only, and I mean ONLY reason why I didnt go back to the store and demand my 4 dollars back was because of the interesting/gory yet highly unrealistic deaths that the characters are led to.Anyone who took this movie seriously, or that felt any emotion other than simultaneous amusement and disgust should be hung naked by their eyelids with a laughing audience throwing rotten fruit at their backsides. I vaguely remember one reviewer's comment that any of these things could happen to any of us at anytime. This individual should be banned from this website for the rest of their life!! How could anyone in their right mind think that this movie is credible!?! The idea that some invisible force kills people and that death has a plan for all of us is absolutely moronic...... but I do realize that it was simply made for our entertainment.My overall recommendation: Rent it once, but try to convince somebody else to pay for it, i.e. a friend, parent, or significant other. Under no circumstances should anyone purchase this movie, and anyone who has the desire to watch this movie more than once had better have a good excuse, such as to simply watch the death sequences again, because if you watch this movie twice for enjoyment you will have to live the rest of your life knowing that your a complete idiot.

"""Final Destination 2"" sticks to the same formula as the first one","""Final Destination 2"" sticks to the same formula as the first one, keeping the eerie atmosphere and inevitable doom at the center of its plot. The story kicks off with a massive, well-executed crash sequence that sets the stage for another round of fate playing its twisted game. While the concept remains engaging, the script doesn't dive deeper into the lore, missing an opportunity to expand on what made the original so intriguing. The directing keeps things moving at a solid pace, balancing tension with dark humor, and the cinematography does a good job of making the kills feel even more brutal with clever framing and effects.The acting is decent, nothing outstanding, but it gets the job done for a movie that relies more on suspense and creative death scenes than emotional depth. The editing is sharp, though there are a few continuity errors that eagle-eyed viewers might catch. The score is effective, enhancing the eerie mood and building tension where needed.

Cheating Death,"Death is already showing to be unbearably formulaic and we're only two movies into this franchise. It looks, unfortunately, like the established formula is going to be the same for every single film: premonition, prevention, and consequences. Yawn.At the very least, this sequel acknowledges the film that came before it, taking what was started with the endlessly fun and suspenseful Devon Sawa original and trying to continue the story, which most slasher sequels don't bother to do.The kills in this one are just as inventive, fun and - in some cases - shocking as the original one, even if they are beginning to feel a little like more of the same already. This film can still entertain with its kills.It's also interesting the way the filmmakers chose to end these films with shock-induced comedic moments surrounding Death.This film will appeal to anyone who liked the first one; as a stand-alone, it really doesn't offer much. It's a run-of-the-mill slasher with the uniqueness of having a supernatural killer that never actually manifests itself. That's about it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hardly my favourite Final Destination movie, worst of the five","Some may not like this movie while I consider it WORST of the franchise. Instead of director James Wong and writer/producer Glen Morgan, they're replaced by director David R. Ellis (previously directed Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco, which I have a movie videotape of) and writer Eric Bress - both of whom did the fourth/FD-3D in 2009 - I personally like that one more than Final Destination 2 here.To start off, no Devon Sawa/Alex Browning (first movie's protagonist) who doesn't return in this sequel: no, it's revealed he was killed with a brick as shown before this movie began. Didn't we thought he was cautious than that? Unlike him, his girlfriend Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) returns yet she's turned into some mean girl with sour attitude, she doesn't do much in this movie and makes snarky comments to the survivors of some ridiculously looking highway disaster. If she's in grief over losing Alex and her other friends and family, it's hardly an excuse. Despite her change to blonde hair, she's still not pretty FD actress to me. Tony Todd returns as well as Bludworth yet brings up the whole ""New life defeats Death"" makes it more confusing twist or rather why wasn't it brought up in the first movie or when he appeared in Final Destination 5 when he said take the life of someone who wasn't meant to die in the bridge disaster?As for the movie's catastrophe: a highway disaster. Indeed, driving can lead to dangerous consequences and horrific accidents - way these vehicles flip over like it's been done by reckless joyriders or showoff stunt drivers, and I don't think they explode into fireballs on impact either. One motorcyclist slides along the road and into something before his motorcycle slams into him. At least it's more realistic, I guess, than NASCAR racetrack disaster in first 3D movie.The protagonist with premonition this movie Kimberly (indeed her actress AJ Cook in incredibly pretty, but...) is not well liked compared to Alex Browning, Wendy Christensen and other visionaries. Also Kimberly is really a big control freak: getting everyone to do what she wants, thinks everything goes her way, despite for everyone's safety, what gives her the right to rudely block the on-ramp at highway disaster, she then keeps all the survivors together, not let them go carry on their lives (unlawful detainment or imprisonment) until some pregnant stranger Isabella has her baby and sabotage Death's List?! This Kimberly one thinks she knows the survivors, doesn't want them do anything other than what she wants?!In fact, it was Kimberly who yelled Pigeons that the 15 year-old lad mommy's boy Tim was killed with large glass thing fell onto him. Kimberly is the cause of his death, same with her boyfriend cop Burke (like new version Scream's Dewey)(who didn't arrest Kimberly since she held up traffic) if he hadn't scared momma boy Tim's mother/the grieving paranoid widow Nora with so-called helpful message/threat ""A man with hooks is gonna kill you!"" she wouldn't have got her hair entangled by elderly man with prosthetic limbs hooks and beheaded between the lift doors - that was absolutely stupid!!!! Same with rescue worker tried to help business woman Kat from her car, instead killed her by deploying her airbag and her head impaled on broken PVC pipe - looks absolutely nasty and another of worst Final Destination kills!! Not long after that, there's memorable kill with drug user Rory trisected to pieces with barbed wire fence - indeed an unique kill yet felt queasy from seeing it few times and obviously there's NO WAY for a barbed wire fence to fly/propel metres through the air like that from a vehicle explosion!! It's similar with plane explosion in first movie shattered airport window, and the ignited oxygen explosion that killed Eugene and Clear (who should've stayed in her padded cell in mental institution. Wonder how orderlies let her out though earlier?) Final Destination has so many plot holes or goofs which impossible to happen in reality - this movie is one of them.I don't have many favourite characters in this Final Destination movie, mainly/only lottery winner Evan Lewis (wish he had longer role in this movie like when his actor David Paetkau played Colby in I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer) and idiotic drug user Rory. Like Terrence C. Carson as Eugene.Overall, this is undoubtedly the WORST movie of the Final Destination franchise to me!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Inventive deaths...but little else!,"The first film was quite inventive and had an ominous atmosphere that I really liked. And the plane crash in the beginning was incredibly well made and horrifying! Here the plot is more or less the same. A girl has a vision of a huge serial car crash on the highway and of course she is a survivor among a few others. And soon enough they start dying, one by one, in some VERY implausible ways. All the death scenes are very well made, nicely built up and most of them pretty shocking. But this movie has so little else to offer. Performances are adequate at best (the heroine is pretty sympathetic though), the plot is almost non-existent and, worst, the film is pretty tedious when there are no deaths. We get a lot of mumbo-jumbo about ""death's design"" and ""list of death"", but those of us who saw the first FD will yawn and think about something else. So rent it on video or DVD so you can fast-forward to the ""good parts"" and skip the dull interludes.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Simply wonderful and watchable sequel,"When a vivid premonition stops here from participating in a massive accident, a woman tries to convince those she's saved that the strange accidents they're involved in are a matter of death insuring his plans are carried out and tries to stop them.This one was an immensely enjoyable sequel that really rivals the original. Among the better qualities here is that this one manages to really portray a truer sense of dread and suspense about the situation as this one really gets a lot of great facts about the surroundings really affecting everyday life. This one really bridges that concept from the first one even further here by making the accidents seem so far out of of logical realms that they're simply, truly accidents brought about through actual, honest coincidences which makes for a rather tense time throughout the first half b building this through the repeated visions, the first few deaths and the call-backs to what happened in the original. This is compounded by the tendency here to showcase the warning signs rather well here as the suspenseful nature of these supposed encounters is some incredible foreshadowing on what's going to happen, and the fact that there's some rather creepy moments from these issues makes this quite fun. The film's best feature, though, is based off the most impressive part of the story here in it's really freaky action-packed encounters here starting with the film's high-point of the opening car crash. There's a fine piece of spectacle to be had here in seeing the kind of high-impact mangling of cars, vehicular stunt- work and continued continuations that not only provide this one with plenty of suspense building up to the crash, action with all the different spectacle encounters as well as the gory deaths along the way. Other big scenes here, from the insanely tense encounter in the doctor's office with several close calls here with the different traps with the electrified water almost getting here and the different false reactions here to the eventual death, the scenes in the apartment are really fun with the false scares followed by the actual kill in the lobby following the revelations found earlier and the absolutely fun encounter in the field makes for a great scene with the splendid set-up in the care beforehand which ties their fates into the original as well as showing another big crash and the fun, over-the-top kills that are present here makes this one incredibly fun. These here are the film's good points which manages to hold off the few flaws here. It's all in the finale here which really seems to meander around with numerous side-plots, rather middling suspense scenes and the rare occasions where the traps just seem contrived and the whole affair seems to be quite the letdown from what came before it. There's also the small factor of this one going for the same route the original in terms of how the story's paid off, but it's not as big a deal here. Otherwise, this one was quite the impressive enough sequel.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and drug use.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Biggest Shock - The Lame Ending,"As a director I would think you would have things made after the success of the original Final Destination directed by James Wong and written by Jeffrey Reddick.  You have a great story given to you and a good solid format to follow - horror, suspense, horror, suspense.And the director of the sequel seemed to understand this, as David Ellis follows the footsteps of Wong.  He does a great job of shocking you and leaving you guessing as to who is going to die next and how.  However, what is most disappointing and horribly tragic about the sequel is that it does not deliver in its conclusion.  The first ended with the same suspense that drove the entire film.  In the second, it seems Reddick through together a cheap new twist and then had Director Ellis give a hack job of an ending, complete with all the cheesiness in the world.  You watch 3/4's of a great film to be left with putty of an ending.I saw that Final Destination 3 is in production for 2006 with James Wong back at the helm.  I feel sorry for the guy because now he has the challenge of luring viewers back to the series after Ellis screwed it up.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"One of those successful sequels, that should now make it's final destination","If fans of FD 1, here's a sequel that humbly satisfies and this one's bloody, the violence sometimes in nasty and cruel taste. This one sees a terrifying chain reaction, murder pile up on a highway, and you guessed it, the lucky survivors, a group of drug/sex crazed teens of today's generation, save for the head of the group, a much more responsible chick, Kimberly, plus others, are the ones who must pay for cheating death. This includes lotto winner, Evan, where his chain of events, leading to a gruesome demise are simply ironic. This is as much fun as the first film, if more, where again the franchise here, didn't know when to stop. Kimberly seeks answers from the only survivor, Crystal (Ali Larter) of the first, who's barricaded herself away in a cell in a mental facility, from which she should of stayed. Too here, we have a different path of death which made for an interesting twist. FD 2 doesn't let go of the fear factor either, the inescapable of the survivors who try to challenge it, instead of burrowing themselves away in a psycho cell, which as referring to the original, put a cruel and nasty spin on. And in a finale, again, you better keep your guard, up too. When will people learn too, never to light up at a servo.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Shouldn't have bothered -- the first one was so good by itself,"Ah yes, the curse of all decent teen slasher flicks: the unimaginative sequel.For the most part sequels are the bane of film. For every ""Empire Strikes Back"" you get ten ""Final Destination 2s"".Sequels work like this: producer A has run out of ideas. So instead of trying to get imaginative people to bring good ideas to the studio (an expensive process), they simply rehash something that had success in the past (a cheaper process). They find one of the stars from the first one, usually one of the weaker talents (all the good people went off to do real projects). They get a hack writer to throw together a screenplay almost wholly contrived from the first one (I hope it at least pays their bills). Then they film it in the fastest time possible, super-size it with a made-for-MTV soundtrack, and send it out. Raking in the cash from teenagers with disposable income is the easy part.I just realized that I've been typing for a while and haven't really talked about the movie. It sucks.

If they do make a third film I hope they spend a little more time on developing at least one of the characters so you care if they die or not, actually Michael Landes was pretty good and had to carry the film by himself. Just like the first they wasted a talented Tony Todd - who actually had more lines in this one. One thing I really missed were the cool sound effects from the first one whenever ""Death"" was coming - it sounded like a death rattle. And after watching FD2 I noticed the similarities in appearance between the gorgeous Ali Larter and the stunning Deborah Unger. It's weird how similar in appearance these two hotties are.

Remains on the right track.,"Here we have sequel, that is essentially the same as the first film, but provides a lot more thrills and a lot more special effects than the first. Final Destination 2 has the same scheme as its predecessor - the hero of the film, this time a female named Kimberly (Cook), is on a road-trip with her best friend and her two pot smoking buddies. She has a premonition on the road that she is one of the many victims to a deadly traffic pileup. She blocks the on-ramp so no one can get by, the premonition comes true, various people survive, but are then killed off in the order they would've died if she hadn't blocked the road. There we have Final Destination 2.It's safe to say we get more of a variety in our characters this time around. In the original, it was all students aboard a flight to Paris. This time, we have a student, a mother, a teacher, a lottery winner, a pregnant women, a drug-addict, a self-centered woman, and a police officer. Clear Rivers (Larter) from the original film returns here to pair up with Kimberly and police officer Thomas Burke (Landes) to try and stop death's design.The idea is we all have a fate, but the flaw is we can cheat it. In this case, Kimberly and the crew's fate was to die in the pileup, but due to her lucky premonition everyone is saved. After you cheat death and save yours and many other lives the only way you can prevent the rest of the gang from dying is for the person who had the premonition to commit suicide or have a child being born, creating new life somehow saving the rest of the people. You're better off not to question the idea, and just go along for the ride.The special effects in this are sub-par to the first film. The problem with the first film was that some of the death sequences were at night, and some, didn't involved many crafty designs, or twists and turns, most likely because it was the first of its kind. They didn't know their standard. But still, Final Destination had some memorable and quite impressive death scenes. Especially when you consider frequent hidden hints and ""180"" appearances.Final Destination 2 offers a bit more build-up by showing something falling, shifting, sliding, moving, etc. The trigger effect that leads to these deaths is perfect, and reminds me why I love this franchise. It can go above and beyond everything if it just remains realistic and plausible.There are a few problems sadly. For one thing, some scenes in the morgue and the mental-institute are poor build-ups to the main event. They last long, and tend to ramble. It's best to try and make the rule make sense to you, rather than listen to a bunch of people talk about it. My advice; watch the first film. Watch it again. Get an idea of how this design works, and then continue to watch the remaining films in the franchise. Eventually, it will come to you. Patience is a virtue.One question I asked myself in the first film was ""Why Alex?"" Up until about halfway through, I asked ""Why Kimberly?"" The film provides logical information on why it's Kimberly's turn to have the premonition. But I still I have two questions; (1) Why does this premonition aspect exist if its purpose is to mess up Death's plan? Don't you think Death (I love how I'm using him as a real person right now) would try everything to stop this premonition? And the premonition sequence lasted about four minutes in this film. You couldn't tell me Kimberly sat stopped on the on-ramp, in utter silence with two talkative pot-buddies in the back seat and her annoying blonde friend without them shaking her or talking to her, and no one from other cars behind her came up to knock on her window. They took all the plausibility, pumped it into the death sequences in the film, but at the same time, drained it from the events leading up to the deaths. Never heard of that happening.Clearly, I'm over-analyzing what is supposed to be an enjoyable horror flick. That it was. Final Destination still remains calm, and not cocky, and cartoonish like one would think. While some franchises get carried away, for now, Final Destination is on the right track.Starring: Ali Larter, A. J. Cook, Michael Landes, and Tony Todd. Directed by: David R.

Continuation of the Death Hunt,"""Destination 2"" was an excellent continuation of the first film, a series of which then began to slide into a dull movie. At the time of its release in 2003, the idea of the film was still fresh, and the presented material is worthy of attention. This is a direct continuation of the successful hit of three years ago, and the story is only getting better twisted.It just so happened that I saw the second part first. ""Well, nothing,"" I thought. - A passing horror movie. I'll take a look at it, since the disk got caught."" What was my surprise when I finished watching. I immediately started looking for the first part. Then there were no subscriptions to online cinemas fashionable today, movie sites with ratings, from where I could find out about the film in advance. As a result, a film that promises nothing for me with pirated voice acting and a similar 700mb picture quality has become one of my favorites.The plot is slightly different from the plot in the first part, although not much. The film gives a lot of impressions thanks to high-quality special effects, decent acting and directing. The audience is still waiting for traps, and every object surrounded by characters can carry a deadly danger.Here, in my opinion, it is somewhat easier for the main character to cope with the situation, because on her side is a policeman who believes in what is happening, believes in the plan of Death and helps the girl in every possible way. This somewhat reduces the dynamism of the picture compared to the first film, where the main character had to not only run away from death, but also from justice. But this does not spoil the film at all. Rather, it gives its own entourage.A very worthy development of events. Dynamic scenes, beautifully created effects on the highway at the beginning of the film generally lead to simultaneous delight and stupor. The scene of the accident is so colorfully shown. Throughout the film, the characters will fight for their lives. And each such scene makes you empathize. Here in the subsequent parts of the franchise there is no such thing. This indicates the high-quality work of the entire team of creators, an idea that has not yet been worn out, a good script and cast.In my opinion, the film took everything excellent from the first part and supplemented it with its own. As a result, a high-quality movie turned out, which seems to complete a good dilogy.The film is very entertaining, it will keep you in suspense until the last frames, introduce the audience to the inevitability of death that haunts the main characters, and, most importantly, you will believe that the world around you can be deadly at any moment of life.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Death, you've become predictable in your old age","Kimberly (AJ Cook from ""Tru Calling"") is taking a trip with her friends. While driving she has a premonition of a massive road accident that kills her, her friends, and a great many other people. Back on the on-ramp, she's pulled over by a cop for blocking traffic. Saving her friends as well as a few others who were fated to die in the accident. But Death, like in the original, is a bitch and comes for them one by one. Kim also makes a visit to Clear Rivers (Ali Larter from the original). Substituting inventiveness with more gore, this film is lacking the wit that Glen Morgan and James Wong gave the first one and their non-involvement is surely missed.

From the crash there had been a big, sharp, metal poll sticking through the back of her seat which had just missed her head so she's thinking she's real lucky.

Don't waste your time on this film,"I typically don't write reviews, but this film was incredibly frustrating that I felt compelled to warn others not to waste their time on it. The first 'Final Destination' film was fabulous and epic; it introduced something fresh and cool, a 10/10 for me. However, 'Final Destination 2' couldn't have been worse. It follows the exact same plot line as its predecessor but is poorly executed. While there were some bearable moments, what annoyed me the most was the excessive focus on Kimberlie (or whatever that lady's name was)'s premonitions, rather than advancing the story.If I had to summarise the film in one word, it would be 'repetition.' It feels like watching a Manchester United season 2024/2025 match - nothing has changed since the last game, yet my expectations remain super high. An endless déjà vu.One last thing - why is there an actor named James Kirk in the cast? Sorry, what? James Kirk belongs on the Enterprise, not in this cheap imitation of a film.Anyway, thanks for reading.

She explained to us a lot of the information on death and its design.Tony Todd- Did a great job with also explaining death, But also kind of creepy. Of course he is the Candy Man. If they do make a part 3, Tony Todd should be the main lead.A.J. Cook- Did a great Job on a first real major role on a Movie. The Lead was great she played it well. I like how she managed to feel for her character and other characters as if she was really Kimberly.A lot of the information did make somewhat sense. I find this movie over all 9 out of 10.

Entertaining, funny, suspenseful... all the things a lot of these teen horror flicks try to be and fall short of. Sure the acting isn't fantastic and some of the dialouge is laughable, but L.A. Confidential this ain't. It's a movie about death catching up with people. So surprise... death is the star. Everyone complaining about the gore should have their heads examined. What kind of movie did you think you'd be seeing? The fact is that when you sit through a movie like FD2, it should be with the understanding that these movies ARE about who gets it next and how.There was zero character development. The music was less than spectacular. The editing was slightly amateurish. But the impact of the death scenes was so powerful that the rest of this becomes incidental. It's impossible not to leave this movie looking over your shoulder and feeling completely paranoid about a split second death you can't see coming. I for one did not want to drive home after that opening sequence (which was unbelievably well done!). This is a popcorn film. It had one goal. I think it accomplished it masterfully. A FD3 might be pushing it, but for now FD2 was a welcome sequel in my book.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
You Can't Cheat Death,"This was a great sequel to the Final Destination,something too see that is gruesomely fun on this horrifying ride...it may be your last.Now death found new ways to kill the survivors from the pile-up on route 23.And here we find out Alex and Clears' way to die,one by a falling brick on his face.And one by an explosion on the hospital.This was better than the original Final Destination.It's better because they die with better gruesome accidents,nudity,and fun traps that leads to the victims life.They made more blood,action,and scary parts that we don't ever want to do that.In the Dentist scene I went there and been-careful for not the same thing to happen to me.I think it's just great when you go to the same accident in both Final Destination 1 and 2 that you remember what happen to the person.Then you look out if that's going to happen,that;s fun that you play a game with that or to scare a person with that.This will make you fasten your seat belts and to be on a look out on death.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A trip that's still worth taking.  9/10,"In a number of ways, the sequel to 2000's surprise hit is a better-made, not necessarily better film than the first one.  It takes the ideas from the first film and builds on them.  While the first movie actually scared you, this one is more in it for shock value.  Yet that doesn't make it bad because you admire the craft that's gone into it.""Final Destination 2"" is unique amongst horror films in being that it has a unique villain (or hero?)  Death.  The movies are philosophical in being that they ask an ages old question: Is there any way to beat death?  Of course there is no way to beat death but according to the movies, if you recognize the signs or patterns that Death is willing to show you, it can be beaten.  The real truth is that Death has a really sadistic sense of humor in that it likes to toy with its victims before finally taking them.  It likes to trick its victims into thinking that it can be beaten, but the truth is that in the end, no one escapes Death; the only thing you can do really is delay it.  I think the ""Final Destination"" films are not really horror movies, but really dark satires that show how people react under extreme distress.""FD2"" is also unique in its portrayal of the characters.  In my opinion, Death is not the villain, but it's the characters themselves.  The characters go to these absurd lengths to try to cheat Death, knowing that they can't.  They and Death go to extreme lengths to outwit one another, but Death always comes out on top.  The people need to just learn you can't cheat Death, because when your number's up, it's up.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie has lived up to its standards as a sequel,"I enjoyed this movie very much, i had a choice between watching this and the Recruit and i chose wisely, FD2 is basicly 100 minutes of pure mayhem. From start to finish i was into the movie, there was no parts where it dragged on or lacked in continuity. I like how they tied everything together into the first movie. For one of the early runners in a so called ""scary movie"" i think it has done a great job at making a big hit.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A solid thriller,"The film is good. Unlike the Final Destination, there is actually a story (and pretty decent one), nicely tied to the events in the first film. There isn't much character development, but then the film's point is different, it is to show the omnipresence of death and the characters' encounters with it. And it does that brilliantly. Especially the ""encounters"". Death scenes are very scary and very impressive. The opening episode is amazing. To imagine the quality and intensity of the action, think about action scenes in the Matrix: Reloaded (like Burly Brawl), only with people dying.Even more impressive is tension build-up in several other episodes. The film frightens us most by showing how close are people to death in everyday life. The gas station episode shows it best. Cars narrowly miss each other, a man drops a gas-cylinder, dogs strain at leads. In that moment it is scary to see just a man fixing a lamp. Death is always around the corner, is always waiting for us to make a mistake. You can't help but think (half-seriously, but nevertheless) about miriads of small mistakes you make every day. Dropping a knife into the drawer, looking for the light-switch in the dark, holding a sharp object close to your face. Plain scary. And that even without mistakes made by others that can kill you just as well. Boo! :)Most of the film is downright scary, but there are few darkly humorous scenes. These scenes(only a few, mind you) didn't improve the film, but didn't harm it either. One may like or dislike it, but this is a valid writer's/director's creative choice and we just have to accept it.S P O I L E R: (Minor) I personally think that every lift (elevator) must have photoelectric cells in the doors (that prevent them from closing if something is there) and a big red stop button on the panel that immediately stops the lift when pressed. I nearly lost my dog once THAT way, but that red button saved it. If the lift that you need to use doesn't meet these standards of safety, you might be better off using the stairs.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"gory,gory,did I say gory.","I just have one word to describe this movie GORY.This was one entertaining film from start to finish.The surprising ways in which the players in the film die off are classic and did I say gory.The script for the film was very well pieced together and went along well.I know this might sound a little sick to some people but I don't care,I found myself anticipating the next victim in how and what way the characters were going to be killed off one by one.I probably would have given this film a ten if it weren't for one of the characters dying unjustly.To close I can just say that I found myself laughing out loud in disbelief of how the death scenes were carried out and I must tell you that I loved this movie and it will definitively un jade you in a big hurry.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Yes, more of the same - but better!","Final Destination was an OK movie about a teen and his friends who collectively avoid a tragic death due to a prophetic vision he has, only to each then die anyway in a series of mishaps, supposedly to ""maintain the balance"". (If they weren't supposed to ""cheat"" death, then why was he given the vision to begin with?)This sequel follows the same formula, but I must say, this one does it much better. The deaths, though quite gruesome, have an ""Omen"" kind of style, and it's actually intriguing to watch the series of innocuous events that cleverly culminate in the death of each person. Also, the director and writer include fake-outs to keep you off guard. The story is also more involved and complex, subtly tying into the first movie. I definitely enjoyed this one, but be warned - it's not for the squeamish.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Plot's the same as the 1st but they upped the gore,"The plot is basically a rehash of the first, to me anyway. It could be almost interchangeable. However, the part they excelled on was the deaths. WAY better than the first. I couldn't believe that they showed that much considering how PC the movie industry is these days. Granted, these aren't the calibre of gore from the early 1980's Euro-trash zombie and cannibal films, but it is a step above the Scream films and their ilk. Overall, not high on plot or acting ability (this won't win an award, obviously), but a decent flick for those of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better than the first,"FD2 proves that a sequel CAN be better than the original. Tighter, much more clever, and generally better in every way than the original, FD2 is a treat. Best of all, it treats Death as more of an ""accident"" or a series of ""coincidence"" rather than, as was the case with the first, some dark demonic force.Definitely a superior film than the original.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
iMacs anyone?,"Like the first Final Destination, this movie features a group of seven people who avoid a horrible accident only to later die in very elaborate, far fetched ways. Though some people may find this movie disturbing, I found it to be hilarious. Unlike the first which I found to be more of a suspenseful horror movie, this one was more of a dark comedy. Call me sick, but never before have I seen a 15 year old kid killed by a falling pane of glass; which is unfortunate because it was truly a sight to behold.As far as movies go this one was pretty entertaining, and as far as sequels go it was on par with the first. The pros include: its a decent recycled plot, it has a fast pace, good CGI, with pretty likable characters, and lots of elaborate deaths(if thats your thing). The cons include: a fairly weak ending, with some 2 dimensional acting, and lots of product placement. Every character must have owned or purchased a friggin iMac, with their little colorful apples displayed everywhere... and I hate iMacs.Final Summation 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good family fun!,"Having seen the original ""Final Destination"", I was not expecting much from the sequel. But I had a free pass to a preview screening and a couple hours to kill and I felt like seeing a dumb movie. I had no idea what I was in for.Maybe it was because I saw the first FD on tape, without a jazzed audience, but I would swear that FD2 whips it's dad's butt up and down the dark alley they would invariably meet in. I haven't felt an audience engaged with a flick like that in years. Sure, a lot of people were jeering teen Anakin in Episode 2, and those same people were cheering Yoda when he went off. FD2 elicited a sustained series of groans, laughs, and screams that was a beauty to behold.Without giving anything away, those responses are well earned.FD2 crosses the line over and over, making you cringe and squirm and laugh because you know it's going to happen all over again.Anyone who has seen the trailer will not be surprised to find out that FD2 has one of the most over-the-top car crash sequences ever filmed. Having personally been in accidents numbering in the double-digits, I can say that this film made me more scared of automobiles than all of those accidents combined.""Final Destination 2"" may just be another stupid movie with a lot of blood and guts, but it seems to know that and it just wants to have a good time. It sees the potential in the great idea in the original and plays it out the way it should be played.Go see it with a crowd on the weekend, and make sure you're in a rough hood where everyone is ready to see some of the grisliest deaths collected into one fast ride of a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is what modern-day horrors should be...,"We join another hapless bunch of people who narrowly avoid certain death when the main character experiences a premonition and saves their lives.  So will they be able to cheat death again?  While it isn't necessary, it's probably a good idea to watch the first installment before watching this one.For all those writers out there who are trying to write a successful scary movie, take notes.  Admittedly, you might not jump out of your pants, but there's only a couple good scares in 'The Ring' and THAT worked.  Be forewarned, the deaths dance on the line of gruesome and good taste, but they're executed (pun intended) perfectly.  Always trying to guess what's gonna happen next, you'll find yourself half-hoping they'll cheat death, and half-hoping you've correctly guessed how the next person will buy the farm.Now, there was the requisite malarky when it came time to ask the question, ""How do we beat Death?""; but don't worry it's rather brief.  The cast does a good job and you never quite get a feel of how long each character is gonna last, which is good.Who knows?

Surprisingly Good,"I came to this film with no expectations - I hadn't seen the original installment. The way the opening builds to a creshendo of horror is spectacular. From then on, - and, once I'd gotten over the shock of the gruesome death of the first ""survivor"", I found myself both thoroughly entertained and impressed. Intelligent horror? Yes, it is possible!Unlike, other reviewers, I thought the acting was excellent by and large. The only truly irritating moments in the movie were provided by the black character who repeatedly refused to believe something spooky was going on in the face of increasingly overwhelming evidence - it's a stock device and it's so lame. But this had nothing to do with the guy's acting ability, which I thought was excellent given the limitations of his given character.Otherwise, I was just totally impressed by the artistry of the team behind this shocker. The build-up of tension, the tease, that led towards each death was masterful.I read the list of ""goofs"" the film is supposed to feature and, with only one exception, I didn't spot any. I was just so drawn in to the action.I'm not big on horror as a genre but, if you're going to watch an odd horror or two, I can certainly recommend this.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"So far the best ""Part 2"" Movie I've seen this year.","Well, I would like to start my review by listing some stinker sequels that were released this year but then we'd be here for a while.I've been watching horror movies since I was 7 Starting with The nightmare franchise, and one thing I've noticed with horror lately is that instead of making you anxious and creeped out to get the scares, most Horror movies go for the BOOO! Scare where the killer jumps out of the shadows or there is a period of inactivity followed by someone jumping in through a window or some crap like that. To be honest I find that to be a cheap scare when done alone. In ""The Exorcist"" there was an absence of the BOOO! Scare because they knew that the audience would be scared by what was happening on screen, the horror of the situation.  This is what I believe this movie accomplishes an actual good mix of foreboding and the BOOO! Scare. The movie is set up so you think you know what's going to happen then it kind of tilts it on it's ear. Most of the deaths follow a system that worked for me... The Set-up - Foreboding - The Fake out - Relief - BOO! Or in some cases just plain old surprise.

"If you like blood, guts, and mayhem, watch Final Destination 2, if you want a more complex movie with less blood, guts, and mayhem, watch Final Destination 1, but I think that Final Destination 2 is the bett","Final Destination 2 follows 2000's hit film Final Destination. In the beginning scenes on the road, the film stooped down to the typical teen flick, with the unneeded, but really good nudity, and the teenager that sneaks in a bag of pot. That was one of the very few flaws that Final Destination 2 had. Like I said earlier, Final Destination 2 has tons of blood, guts, and mayhem, and that's what I liked about the movie. The beginning scene with all the car crashes seriously out-did the first films beginning scene with the plain exploding. Some parts of the beginning are a bit illogical, i.e. all the cars exploding fast like that. Another thing that has bogged down, is the acting. Ali Larter is a terrific actress, and she gave a good performance, but I was seriously disappointed with A.J. Cook's performance. Her last film before Final Destination 2 was Wishmaster 3, which was the absolute worst film of all time. Final Destination 2 surpasses the first film's death scenes. The deaths is Final Destination 2 were so creative, and so inventive, it was unbelievable. Final Destination 2 also has A LOT more blood, and gore than the first film, which I seriously liked. The story is basically the same thing, just with a few more differences. I didn't like the fact that there was a way to stop death from killing everyone, that was cliché, because every movie always has a way to stop everything. The first film was also more original, and the pacing was just right. Final Destination 2's pacing was a little off, because it was always one death after another, but I didn't really care. Overall, Final Destination 2 is better than the first film, because there is more mayhem, blood, and guts, and they did not waste time in the film with needless scenes. However, Final Destination 1 also had some elements that were better than the second film's. The acting was SO much better in the first film, and the story was more original, but the deaths were not as creative. I liked Final Destination 2, and from the looks of it when I was at the theater, it looks like it's gonna make some big bucks. 9 ½ out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Could Be Better...,"The sequel to Final Destination came out in the cinemas in the UK in January 03, and with only two of the original cast, Clear and the mortician. The second was not as good as the first and was funnier as opposed to scary, but also contained an awful lot of gore. The idea is that the 'survivors' in the original caused a ripple, in that because they didn't die, it prevented others from dying and now death is after those people. One of those people, Kimberly has a premonition similar to Alex's, but on Route 180 of a pileup one year after the plane crash. That is what gets the ball rolling as Kimberly saves the 'ripple' people from the pileup, but seemingly fails to save them from death. The only survivor left from the plane is Clear, as Alex died between movies. Kimberly enlists Clear's help in cheating death the second time, but by the end, Clear too is dead.

Better than the first,"Anyone who knows me knows how much I loathed the first movie. It was truly wretched. Though this one was surprisingly good. It had better (or just less annoying) characters that you don't want to die (the first movie made the mistake of being populated with awful characters), more inventive death attacks and developed the idea of death having a design more interestingly.Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) is the only remaining survivor of flight 180 and has now willingly committed herself to a rubber room to escape death's shadow. But lets herself out into the world when learning of a new disaster. A teenager (AJ Cook) on a trip with her pals has a premonition of an incredibly violent freeway pile-up (so more inventive than a distant boom in the sky; the first movie's disaster) and stalls traffic in her lane. Sure enough the pile up happens and all the drivers who she stalled should be dead too. So death begins to stalk them. But no one has any time for the warnings Clear Rivers has to offer and so death offs them in increasing gory fashion.It's lowbrow and pure popcorn fun but you'll definitely enjoy it. If only the first one didn't exist then this would be more unique experience. Still, buying this DVD would be cool because the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture and the DTS 6.1 sound are incredible.

Er thats what everyone went to see it for...hoping they DID!""   They did it better too!  Listen guys if this type of flick ain't your thing...why the hell go and see it?  If you don't want to be confronted by gross-out deaths - go and watch LILO and STITCH, MILO AND OTIS...LAUREL AND HARDY!  Personally, I LOVE gross-out deaths and this little flick DELIVERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!The flick is worth seeing for the freeway accident alone. Arguably the most horrific thing ever seen in a movie bar NONE! I have never been a fan of laughable CGI fx.....this sequence however is as good as you're ever likely to see. It has the power to shut down an audiences senses just temporarily. Some people could be extremely upset and feel emotionally violated by this incredible piece of freeway violence.  If you thought the ""bus sequence"" was scary in the first - close your eyes here!I tend to agree that the film got sillier as it went on but the sheer creativity of the cast's demise held it together. A.J. Cook was quite excellent (and believable) as Kimberly...Ali Larter really was little more than padding and in the upshot hardly even relevant to the film. Why she receives top billing is a mystery?  I also concede the repetitious attempts to link it to the first one grated after a while. The film and story hold up perfectly well on their own.Question! HOW did the cast and crew keep a straight face when Kimberly delivered the all time classic line, ""They're gonna be attacked by a flock of pigeons?""I'd knock a star off too for the inappropriate and unnecessarily comical ending!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This Accident Is Most Realistic Yet,Best Movie I've Ever Seen","This move is all about the real-life accidents and mishaps that could happen anywhere, anytime, to anybody. You think you're safe? Think again. This movie delivers with strong kills, a cast of unknowns(which is good, because you don't have to see pretty-boy Tom Cruise with a log through his face, which is good, because the rest of the cast doesn't have to to to compare to some big actor),and a plot that is just as scary. It starts with a group of people, 4 friends on a trip to Daytona Beach, a business woman, a biker, a druggie, a mother and son, and a cop. The driver of the truck holding the 4 friends, Kimberly Coreman,then sees ""signs"" along the road that hint of disaster, then disaster strikes. This has to be the most horrific/realistic car accident I've ever seen in my entire life. Like waking up, Kimberly then sees and hears all the signs that point out that an accident is in the works. She parks at the end of the on-ramp of the highway, and keeps everyone on it from being in the accident that follows soon thereafter. Sadly, her friends die tragically and brutally. What follows is a story about the survivors trying to save the life of an unborn child, and the lives of themselves. This flick just goes to show that accidents happen all the time, and at anytime in the day or night. You don't need creepy settings and ominous music to bring out the horror in this movie, because it's already there. Scary as hell kills and lots of fun is included. Definetly a must for the big horror fans. Have fun",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
solid horror sequel,"A horror movie that actually shows gore and isn't afraid to get a R rating. It moves at a fast pace and the film does have some real mouth opening gore moments.

Refreshing blood and gore,"Straight from the bat, let me say that I am a huge fan of Final Destination® - the original movie from 2000 and was really excited about seeing the sequal.The first movie gave us something so simple and yet so original that it was very easy to believe that, well, maybe death could and was stalking us. It's the most simple ideas that make us feel uneasy and what makes a person more uneasy than what is unknown - death.I watched the original just hours before going to see the sequal, just to gear me up for what I was expecting more of. The original is just as fresh as it was just under 3 years ago. I payed close attention to the signs of deaths imminent pounce and was ready for the second installment.So I made my way to the cinema and Grabbed a large CokeT and settled in for what I may call 'The movie event of the year.'.I was not let down!Final destination® made great use of the original plot without being corny although some scenes were (but isn't that what horror flicks are about?). The story, although no longer original, came up with a nice twist to deaths antics and design as he tried to clear up his mess from flight 180 which occurred a year before.The acting for the most part was ok, this is just a horror movie and not a beautiful mind®. WThe special effect were... well.... special! The gore, death scenes and destruction were just refreshing. To much are we cushioned from the real horror of blood splatter and entrails. Some directors think it is much more effective to ""suggest"" the horror rather than show it, but this has become very monotonous and now lacks any impact whatsoever. Kudos to FD for showing us what we have so long desired.The directing looks pretty good and had a nice style. The pace of the movie runs very smoothly and quick, keeping us on the edge of our seats.Camera work is very nice also. Good angles, lighting and mood presence all with a quality sound track.Hope you enjoyed my review, now go enjoy the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
AWSUME,"I think that the movie was great!  I took my 14 year old daughter to see it with me..we loved the first one.couldn't wait until the second came out. We both thought that it was great fun and entertainment.  Officer Burke in my opinion is a cutie.  He does a great job.  The only thing that was a little boring and drawn out was the apartment scene before the mom got killed.  A little drawn out, but other than that, the movie was great.  To the makers of the movie: there better be a FD3!  Loved this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Was not expecting much but got a lot,After seeing final destination one I was very impressed and wasn't expecting much out of the second. I got a lot more that i expected i thought it had a good plot and creative deaths. The movie takes place a year after the plane crash from the first movie. A young girl Kimberly and her friends go on vacation when she has a vision of a major car crash that involves her friends and everyone behind her in traffic. she stops every one from getting on to the doomed highway and saves there lives. but death comes for them. the only person that got off the plane in the first one that is still alive is in a mental institution. Kimberly visit her and she helps her out along with a police officer when the survivors start getting killed one by one the realize that they were somehow involved with the deaths from the first movie and they attemp to beat death once again,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Creepy Stuff!,"Wow, I'm impressed. The rare occasion that a sequel was a real improvement to the first part. Sure, Kimberly's visions make no sense, still there's the Candyman-guy who is Mr. Know-it-all without explanation. Who cares? The story convinces, there is a great connection to part 1 and the deaths, oh boy, the deaths are original and gory. You don't find that kind of stuff in slasher horror movies. The movie was a great roller coaster ride. They're gonna make a third part? Count me in!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fun film, worth watching.","As with the first film I reviewed for this website I just happened to catch it on TV tonight 22:00-23:45 on Channel 4 ( UK ) and decided to watch it, why not hey? I quite enjoyed it too, it wasn't too involved, nor very jumpy or scary.From what I know, the storyline is basically the same as in the other versions, but I might try and see those too sometime.There was some mediocre gore, which was pretty cool. It wasn't too predictable.Maybe I'm easy to please. One of the Actors shares my name, that was cool too haha.Check it outttt.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Picks up where we left off,"This movie picks up where the last movie left off. I'm surprised that Alex was killed off in part 2. A falling brick? From where? And Clear Rivers(Ali Lauter) institutionalized herself after Alex's death. And the aborted traffic fatality for Kimberly(AJ Cook) took a whole new meaning for this movie. The one year anniversary of the 180 crash, started a whole new phenomena for different people. There's were other survivors that the first movie never mentioned. And the events from the first movie plays a role in the sequel which gives the term a whole new meaning. Eugene Dix(T.C. Carson of ""Living Single"" and Living Large"") was almost like Carter from the first FD. And the junkie in the Mustang prepared himself perfectly when the explosion occurred. It was gruesome when the traffic accident first occurred when the log truck knocked the trooper's head off. And all the other pileups follow through. A whole new story, the same old consequences, is there a possibility for a FD3? We shall see about that. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than part one,"Although the movie is a follow up and the story line is basicly the same, I liked it even more than the first one. Maybe because it contains more ""shocking"" elements even while a lot of scenes are predictable. The director did a good job making each death happen in an (nearly) unexpected way. Must to see if you've liked part 1",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very clever sequal!,"It had the most clever way of tying into the first one. It was just as bloody, gory, and exciting as the original, plus a nice little twist.

Here's hoping FD3 will at least try to top this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Love it, almost on par with the first one!","It was inevitable after all. Considering there's so much to explore with the concept set up in the first installment, there was bound to be a sequel. But luckily, this movie is awesome!A character once again has a premonition of a horrible accident, this time a disastrous car crash. A couple of people thankfully are saved... but for how long? There are slightly more survivors in this movie, partly because Clear from the first movie returns (this is only a spoiler if you haven't even seen THAT one). In terms of characters, they were really good. Kimberly and Thomas were very likable, Eugene is hilarious and of course it's also a plus that Clear is back. Speaking of her, she's different in this movie. She's more cold, sassy and doesn't manage to get along all that well. But considering what she has gone through, I think it's commendable character development. She has a lot of scars from previous events and so is not the same person she was before. Even so, I was completely rooting for her. Here, she plays the role of guiding the new survivors in order to help them escape Death. She and... Mr. Bludworth. It would have been stupid not to have him return, so I'm happy he makes another appearance here. He knows even MORE about Death this time, and the scene with him is perfectly uncomfortable. You won't BELIEVE what he's doing while talking to the teenagers!David R. Ellis directed this movie, and with the over-the-top action in this movie, it's easy to see this is the guy who made Snakes On A Plane. He's clearly having fun, but also seems to know where the limit goes here. Sure the action is crazy, but it's FUNNY-crazy! The humor is even darker than the first movie, and I was laughing hard so many times I lost count. That's not a negative thing however, this movie knew what it was doing and so managed to highly entertain me. And there is still great tension, as it often is unpredictable where the movie will go.New twists and turns, many quotable lines, a great cast and is just enough chilling to be interesting. Don't worry, this is a sequel worth batting an eye at.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very cool,"Well, I just finished Final Destination 2 and may I say that it is so cool to find a sequel that is just up to par with the original. Normally, most sequels attack the original and loose it's originality. But Final Destination 2 had a cool story with many more awesome deaths and scary suspenseful scenes. I loved the story and I understand finally why these movies are so well liked.This time there is a girl, Kimberly, is about to go on a road trip with her friends. But right before she gets on the main high way, she has a horrible vision that she is about to get into a horrible accident causing the biggest pile up in car accident history, when she comes too, a cop pulls her over and she gets out of the car telling him that there is going to be a crash. It happens, but her SUV with her friends get tragically hit and killed leaving Kim alive with an officer that was also supposed to be killed. Everyone who was supposed to be killed on that road is dying off one by one, so she looks to the help of a person who has been through this before, Clear.Final Destination 2 was a great sequel and I would highly recommend it for any horror fans. Even though I knew what was going to be the last scene, it was so cool watching it. Although I'm questioning the plot somewhat, because now it seems like almost everyone is going to die, but I guess that's the whole scary point of the story.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Worthy Sequel (...but still a sequel!),"If you liked the first one, you're in for a treat!  FD2 takes you on a bigger, wilder, and, of course, gorier ride than the first one.  I was hesitant at first with a new director and the absence of Devon Sawa, but I am pleased to report that the result is deserving of being a sequel to Final Destination; even though the title here doesn't fit as nicely without a plane crash - but what else would you call it?A good sequel gives you more of what you liked from the first one and new twists to keep you from saying, ""been there, done that"" or, ""I should've stayed home and rented the first one.""  FD2 has wonderful new twists that help it to rise above the typical sequel.  Yes, it's got more twisted fun that made FD such a kick, and it's done in an even more playful fashion. Best of all is how FD2 relates itself to FD.  That is what ""made"" the movie for me.  Where FD2 lacks is in its overall sense of foreboding, which really gave FD its charm.  Still, it is a nice complement to FD and shouldn't be missed for fans of the original.As for those who rip this movie to shreds based on acting/story, etc. This is not Oscar material here.  Who cares?  It's just a sick and twisted good time at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

(Gives you a different view on airbags!)The humor was more thin in this sequel then in the first, and the language was more pervasive and frequent.

"A great sequel of campy, gory and great fun.","Now, this is a sequel to 2000's surprise hit, and one of my favorite movies, `Final Destination'. I want to add how much I was expecting this movie (since Final Destination) and now I am happy to report that the movie was not a letdown and the three year wait was very much worth it.I will start off by mentioning what I did NOT like about this sizzle sequel, I know I shouldn't compare this with the prequel, but that way, you'll get better the idea. One of the many things I adored about the first movie was it's freaky and very scary atmosphere but where is it!? Not here! The movie is mostly shot in daytime, and that lowered a lot the sense of creepiness. One more thing I couldn't stand is that they turned this movie into another pop corn horror movie. It has way too many jokes I didn't appreciate all that much (the last frame comes to mind) and that mucho lowered the tension, which was another of the many things I adored about the prequel. The script had some flaws right there, maybe it is just me but maybe it didn't explain fully the idea of death's design, I didn't fully get it, but then again, maybe it was just me. The characters are much less developed as in the original, as being a bunch of strangers, you couldn't care less for most of them...they are all stereotyped and I was only waiting for most of them to die...(I kinda loved Nora actually) and add to that some extremely disposable side-characters (BBQ kid...lmao). As for the acting, I must say it's mostly convincing; if it's not the at times tacky dialogue pulling some characters down, it's mostly fine. I really didn't like Eugene I don't know what p***ed me off, if it washis characters or just HIM...I was waiting for the Angel of Death to do his thang on him.And guess what mistake the sequel did? The same as in Final Destination.a scene where some of the characters visiting the same creepy mortician (Tony Todd) we saw before, again, his character is not explored in any level, the scene again slowens the pace big time and is much more useless than in the original.Now, for the upside, this is by far the ballsiest R rated movie I have ever seen. I was extremely uncomfortable and was yelling like a maniac in the movie theater. I am not talking only about ball gripping tension, but the goriest, most 'out there' kill sequences I have ever seen. Remember how strong the run over kill was in the original Final Destination? That's nothing ok? Hear me out here. The kills are just amazingly strong and mind bending.awesome s***e. I also mucho enjoyed the fact of 'death' being again only a sadistic presence that we feel all around us. For some reason I felt it much more time than in the first one, there are thousands of accidents here. I also appreciated how they didn't just made 'another' Final Destination story, they also added a clear link between the events involving Flight 180 and this car pile up. Another great thing is that they also added some really cool new effect in death's design for this one, I will not give it away, but I really liked how it's not the same thing as Final Destination, the cool omens are still there, especially in the opening car pileup, which is definitely the harshest bit IMO. The Ellis man definitely knows his s***e, he has a great imagination and has BALLS, he also pulls tons of great enlarged shots, overhead shots, fluid camera movements, tension and silence. He has style!Final Destination 2 is a sequel that succeeds and fails in some levels. I will grade it a `8.5/10' for it's great entertainment and freak out value; Maybe it's not better than the original, but definitely doesn't embarrass it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
really funny,"I've just seen the movie today and I found it to be really funny and relaxing.Call me sick, but every time a person died I laughed at the way it was executed and the looks on the people's faces (the ladder guy and the kid in the end).

"While not as good as the original, still very watchable","It is often difficult for a sequel to live up to the original film it follows, and in that ""Final Destination 2"" is no exception. The problem is that it was not directed by James Wong, and Ellis, while doing a good job, did not have the vision that Wong did for the first film. That having been said, this film is still a very watchable sequel and bringing back Ali Larter as Clear Rivers, the one survivor of the first film was a definite plus.It is now a year after the crash of flight 180 and death is out hunting again, as the plot unfolds we find that nearly everyone on his list had some tie to one of the dead people in the first film.

The same with Final Destination. They show EVERYTHING. I walked out of the theater about 10 minutes through the movie. It's such a shame they would make this type of movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
Failed Potential,"I could almost have liked this movie.  The premise was interesting -- no wonder it has been used in a hundreds of teen horror flics.  The execution was horrible. (Q: What do you think of the director's execution? A: I'm in favor of it!)Peter Weir's The Last Wave takes us to a similiar alternate reality, but despite a lower budget and much less technology, it does so w/ intelligence. The screenwriters and/or the special effects techs that did Final Destination 2 are simply clueless.  I read alot of sci-fi and the trick is that while you can change any aspect of reality, everything else has to be brutally realistic.I will not go into all absurdities that the makers of this film expect us to accept.  They are many.  I'm sure that it started w/ the screenwriter, continued w/ the special effects coordinator and finished w/ the editors. Sure Death can do anything, but making s**t flow up, repetitively, is the last refuge of the incompetent.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the first one,I just saw the movie and I thought it would be just like the first one. But It started off good but then it was so gross. It was worse than the first one. I liked that one better than this one. Why would they change the whole plot to make it worse than the first one? This is the worse movie I saw. I thought it was so gross after the first ten minutes. The preview from the site looked like it wasn't going to be that bad as it was or maybe like the first one but it didn't. If anyone would like to e-mail that who just seen or who seen it.

A crapfest of killing.,"For the record, I was (and still am) a big fan of the movie Final Destination. I thought it was a great flick, and appreciated the inventive storyline and creative killings. This film, however, was a huge disappointment for someone who was so impressed with the original. The plot was OK-stolen from Life or Something Like It, but OK.  Also, the deaths in this movie-and that's all we really watch it for, right?-are too cheesy. A fire escape ladder? A plate of glass? Come on, writers! You can do better! Urgh. Anyway, if you happen to like this, watch the aforementioned flick Life or Something Like It. That one's better.",,Anonymous,Horror
Your typical Sequal,"Death is back with a vengeance in this new tale of escaping the inevitable, as director David R. Ellis takes the front with an attempt to fill in the shoes of the witty success `Final Destination' so cleverly brought us. `Final Destination 2' brings us a new story of it all, following a young women's pre-vision of a horrific car crash and her escape from the jaws of death along with other feeble characters who were conveniently at the right place at the wrong time. You can pretty much guess the rest if you've all seen the first movie that was so unique in delivering a fresh taste into the world of horror creating our perfect Friday night popcorn enjoyments. This is a predictable sequel that clearly decided to pawn off all the great elements that the first film had for us and polish the scenarios up tightly to create a film that is bloodier, cheesier and flat. Expect more original death scenes as death decides to off every character using everything from barbecue grills to falling objects. The cast unfortunately wasn't decent either; the story left us with a bunch of rejects from the first movie that obviously never made it to the audition. Their attempts to play characters whose fates were entwined by death along with their flaccid abilities to portray fear was insulting to the movie viewers eye. This film almost directly disregards everything the first film stood for by trying to resurrect the scenarios and attempting to continue the story of the first film that was clearly finished years ago. If you enjoyed the first film so much then clearly this film will ruin the affect of everything the first film gave you. `Final Destination 2' is a definitive example of why most sequels are regarded as trash. The film is nothing more than a semi- decent video rental that tried so hard to better the original.",,Anonymous,Horror
Faster plot and more intense,"If the first film's highlight was Amanda Detmer's death scene, The second film's highlight was with the airbag, FD2's plot is much more faster. I wouldn't say that this is a teen-slasher horror film, It's just plain horror, And most characters involved here are adults.I like the coincidence and the connections of each character cheating death it really worked. Ali Larter did a good job passing the baton to A.J. Cook and Michael Landes for the next one. I'm also glad Tony Todd is still there in the film, In closing, the series is one of the most original horror films of all time I wish the final chapter would be more dramatic yet horrific at the same time.",,Anonymous,Horror
You will squirm in your seat..,"Oh yes you will.  To put it simply, this film is a series of one grisly death after the other, the next usually more gruesome than the one before. The word ""gratuitous"" comes to mind...The first one was something new - it even had some style to it.  This one throws that all out of the window - it's about nothing more than grossing out the audience and making them squirm in their seats.  It kinda redeems itself with the death sequences - the first one is particularly impressive. Final Destination 2 doesn't take itself too seriously - but then it doesn't descend into the depths of oh-so-stupid-self-mockery.

Sickest and Most Disgusting Film of 2003,"This has got to be the sickest and most disgusting film of 2003.""Freddy vs. Jason"" is probably a close second but the gore factoris so extreme and overshadows any semblance of a plausiblestory.  It attempts to tie up loose ends from the first film, but I feelpity for anyone who found watching the disgusting gross outdeaths entertaining and even humorous let alone anyone trying tomake any sense of the plot which is the same nonsensicalstoryline from the first film.  It is like a slasher film except insteadof a killer like Jason or Freddy we have Death who is like a personand seeks out specific people and finishes them off in the mosthorrible and gruesome accidents possible except Death is aninvisible force that has some kind of mapped out plan or design.All in all it was like a theatrical version of ""Faces of Death"".  Bewarned the graphic nature of this film is very disturbing but there isno real suspense.  You pretty much know the one main personwho is going to live and basically has to for there to merely seemlike this mess has a plot as in the first.  Mainly it is just onegrotesque scene after another.  This one is definitely up there with""Starship Troopers"" as one of the sickest and most disgustingfilms ever.",,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining but nothing else.,"Final Destination is one of those films that most people will love, because, let's face it, no one goes expecting to see tremendous acting, scripts, storylines or anything really, just original and entertaining gory deaths. And that's all this film is expected to provide- and it does.FD2 is a re-hash of the original, but that doesn't matter. For all the film, you just find yourself looking forward to the next gut-wrenching agonisinig death and as it builds up you can visibly see the audience getting more and more excited. And boy, are those deaths fantastic. My particular favorite was the druggy being diced up by a set of flying barbed wire, but the ladder and the glass platform ideas were good too. I'll say no more.go and enjoy yucky deaths but don't expect anything else.",,Anonymous,Horror
The First One Is NOTHING Compared To This One!!,"I came in this movie expecting pretty much the same as the first movie. But It was much better.

Mixed feelings,"I liked the first Final Destination because it wasn't the typical teen horror movie, although it wasn't perfect (no movie is). It had a little bit of a story and had quite a few creepy moments. The deaths were sudden and violent, but for the most part they weren't excessive. I had hoped that Final Destination 2 would continue with these traits, but it seemed to be just an excuse to show people being constantly splattered, burned, smashed, ripped, crushed and impaled very graphically. This is not scary, it's just makes the movie hard to watch for some people. I was entertained by the movie because it was fairly fast-paced and because it's fun to pick out all the mistakes, illogic, stupid dialogue, continuity lapses, etc., but I really don't care to see guts and heads flying all over the place. I understand that this is sometimes necessary in horror films, but really, can't we leave SOMETHING to the imagination anymore? All the best horror films have a message or a moral that they are trying to get across to the audience, however crudely executed it is, and that message is the focus of the story. But in Final Destination 2, and similar movies that emphasize blood and guts over plot and atmosphere, there is no message to be taught. It exists for no other purpose than to glorify death and carnage. I don't understand why some people find graphic portrayals of people getting sliced and diced amusing. At least in a movie like, say, Evil Dead, people are taken over by evil spirits that are bent on murdering everything in sight, and they HAVE to be killed in gruesome ways. FD2 is just full of nice people, who have done nothing more evil than avoid a car accident, getting destroyed in the sickest and most painful ways possible. There's no satisfaction in that, it's just sick and mean-spirited. So while it is entertaining, FD2 is definitely not a must-see movie. If you like bad movies, there are plenty out there that are way more entertaining than this one, without all the senseless gore.",,Anonymous,Horror

A nice sequel!,"The sequel was good. Not very scary and too graphic but a good example of ""edge of your seat thriller"" and somehow funny. The final scene was pretty funny in particular. Although the story is good and does get to a conclusion (unlike the first one) it is not superior to the original story, and I repeat not as good as the original story does not mean it's not just as good.

"Way to go, humanity.","In the time of Ancient Rome, one could pay a small amount to sit in a coliseum, enjoy a loaf of bread, and watch a human body be ripped apart by a pair of jungle beasts.  After seeing Final Destination Two, I can only conclude that the level of entertainment has actually declined since then.Director David R. Ellis took over where James Wong, who also directed The One, left off with the sequel to the 2000 film Final Destination.   The film centers around the same idea as the first;  a teen sees the future, saving the lives of several people, and p***ing the hell out of Death, so Death goes out of its way to claim those who had been saved, as it was their time to go.  The teen, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) has a vision of a tremendous and wholly unrealistic two-dozen-car pile-up, caused by falling logs.  The premonition comes to her on the one-year memorial of the plane crash of the Final Destination, so it is the one-year memorial of teen premonitions. The survivors of the crash don't believe there is any connection between themselves and the people who started mysteriously dying after they were saved by a forewarning, until, of course, they start dying.  Kimberly then goes to Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the sole survivor of Final Destination, and tries to figure out how to cheat and beat death.  Though the title `Final Destination 2' is rather oxymoronic, if not just moronic, the film was made to tie the loose ends of it's predecessor.  The only question I begged to have answered was, `Why?'If there was somehow a way for one to act one's self out of a paper bag, everyone in the cast would've had to spend eternity with someone's lunch. Somehow they were just unable to handle their jobs of screaming and burying their faces into the person next to them at the sight of someone being crushed by a large glass pain or cut into three pieces by a barbed-wire fence.  I have not seen acting this poor since Queen of the Damned, in which actors went in and out of random lisps and accents as if they knew no one was going to see the film anyway.  The dialogue was exceedingly inane, and it could strongly be felt that writers Jeffrey Reddick, who worked on the original, and J. Mackye Gruber really tried hard to work the word `premonition' into lines, as it had covered all of the commercials.  The writers also tried to work in post-death jokes, as if to lighten the film up for the sub-human audience, reminiscent of the jokes in the film Stir of Echoes, used to break the tension.  The only difference being, of course, the jokes weren't funny.The visual effects, meant for horror purposes, were both wildly comedic and painfully nauseating.  Deaths that could've been alluded to by leaving the camera in the dying character's point of vision, were shown in all their mindlessness, complete with sound effects, much more disgusting than Alfred Hitchcock's stabbing of a watermelon for the film Psycho, and ruby blood droplets flying high into the air from the improbable ends of characters. Even the car pile-up was designed for blood-hungry viewers, with cars flipping into the air, completely defying the laws of physics, instead of making an attempt to stop at the sight of the blatant pile-up, and two shots of a man screaming while he burns to death, one from a distance and then a close-up.  I will give some credit to Ellis, though, as in one scene, when four of the characters were killed in a field, one did get the feeling that Death was rubbing them out.  However, the death sequence started out with a woman being impaled by a white tube, so the credit given is miniscule.This film astounded me.  I had no idea movies were made so poorly.  And it's the number 5 movie at the box office this week.  Way to go, humanity.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Out-Omens ""The Omen"" and ""The Omen 2""","A much better film than it has any right to be.  As other reviewers have stated, the FX and the DVD video transfer are excellent.  The first FD actually made an effort to philosophize about death and the inevitability of fate, but FD2 quickly dispenses with that and heads straight for the fun buffet.Now, down to the nitty-gritty...doesn't everyone see the homage to the ""Omen"" movies here?  Damien was always knocking off his enemies in the most surprising and convoluted ways.  Remember the ""elevator cable"" scene?  FD and FD2 simply extend this a bit and build a different framework around the death scenes.  There's also more than a bit of the ""Dr. Phibes"" movies here. We enjoy seeing the imaginations of the director and writer(s) at work, as they concoct more an more outrageous scenarios for Death to get back in the game.(Now that I think about it, that same approach has kept the James Bond films coming long after the franchise should have been put to sleep.)Last, but not least, I really don't have much patience for anyone who's complaining about how unreal or contrived the death scenes are.  For Pete's sake, people, we're talking about a movie that personifies Death as having purpose, motivation, excellent planning, and great recovery! If you can buy that, then you shouldn't be complaining about flying barbed wire.I give this a 7 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Horror

Modern horror as it should be.,"Having read many of previous users comments I have noticed how polarised the views are. It is either love it or hate it. I am surprised, because FDII is what modern horror is supposed to be about.  Lots of gore( this film is so gory that Ireland made it an 18 cert), plenty of shocks to make you jump and although none of the acting was Oscar winning, it was more than adequate for the genre. The film was pacier than the first and  more graphic in the death scenes. My husband who I suspect is much older than your average reviewer was jumping out of his chair and said at the end ""where do they get these ideas from""? He prefered FDI merely because it was less gory.FDII is for it's genre a very good movie. It does not set out to do anything other that what it intends to do and that is deliver the gore, make you sit up and be surprised and does it all with a big tongue in cheek. These type of films are not meant to be analysed and dissected because they are not intellectual nor intelligent films but rather they are 'sit on the sofa, leave your brains behind and have a good laugh'  I think the film's critics need to lighten up a little and see the film for what it is. That said, I hope they don't make FDIII that would be 'taking the mickey'.",,Anonymous,Horror
Are the film-makers actually proud of this???,"I saw this movie, only because the film I had originally intended on seeing was sold out.I should have saved my $8.50.This is definitely one of the cheesiest movies I have ever seen.

The only entertaining element was the sheer idiocy of the entire movie.The plot could have been promising (although it's exactly like the first one). But the movie is so loaded with predictability, and teenage ""humour"" (breasts and drugs equal fun?) that it wasn't even enjoyable in the ""this is so bad it's funny"" manner.I will say that the pyrotecnics (while overdone) and special affects makeup were excellent.Overall: Save your money and take a nap or something.1/10",,Anonymous,Horror
"BBQ, anyone?","You'd think, reading some of these comments, that this movie is the greatest thing since Yamila Diaz. It's not. This movie really isn't good. If you look at it as a whole, you'll find it's less than the sum of it's parts. It gets pretty annoying at times, what with all the ""Death's Design"" talk and blah blah blah. There's a point in the movie where you beg the people chattering away about Death's plan to shut up and go do something to get themselves killed already. Some of the acting sucks and the characters are all transparent and paper-thin. The first one is ten times better and achieves it's goal with a little more dignity and class. So, why then, after all I've said in regards to how schlocky this flick is, am I recommending it? I'll put it to you like this: PEOPLE GET IT IN THIS MOVIE. It's that simple. And it's not even that they get it, I mean they really get it. In extra bad ways, no less. For example, I'm sure that you've heard about the beginning of the film with the huge car crash/pile-up deal. It's the same setup as the first movie, where the kid dreams this whole airplane disaster only to wake up and find that it hasn't actually happened... yet. Small nuances of the premonition start to arise and he realizes that the plane he is about to fly on will actually explode. He freaks out, some of the passengers leave with him, plane blows up mid-flight, Death starts hunting the survivors down in the order they're supposed to die in, blah blah blah. If you're reading this review, you should already know the deal. Same thing here but with a twist. In the sequel, when the first person buys the farm in the sequence, you'll know that you're in completely different territory. I'll spare you the details cause I'd like you to be surprised but that moment shook me up real bad. Never before had I seen something so unsettlingly realistic. It reminded me of the test footage you see of those crash test dummies, it was that real. And then pretty much everyone else in the vicinity of that crash gets it, some worse than others. The movie is worth seeing just for the intro alone because it was pretty intense. Throughout the rest of the movie, everyone who was ""saved"" from being in the accident starts getting bumped off. And how! People get it, folks and I think you owe it to yourself to catch this in a theater if it's possible. One thing that made this movie even more enjoyable was the crowd's reaction to the death scenes. It was like applause for an awards ceremony. To make it short and end this, see the movie if you wanna see people get greased in horrible ways. Don't watch this looking for an Oscar winner. Watch it for the visceral thrill of seeing someone get their ticket punched! I'm definitely getting the DVD, at least for that. Rating: ***1/2 out of *****. P.S.

First, Shirley Walker's music for the original Final Destination was so good I bought the DVD for that reason alone.  Her score for FD2 is nice, but not as moody or atmospheric.

Cheesy trash movie.,"Final Destination didn't need a sequel in the first place, but I guess all those gore-hungry teens and their wallets were too much to pass by. If you've seen Final Destination then you've seen part two already, they are exactly the same. Kimberly is on a road trip with her friends, foresees their deaths and many others' in a huge traffic accident, wakes from the premonition, saves several people from getting on the freeway, the survivors start to die...wow, how original, add in a plane and you've got the first movie again! Magic! The script is Final Destination with new characters and new deaths. The dialogue is very corny, I felt embarrassed to be watching a movie where every character goes ""What are you talking about?"" or ""What's going on?"" every other minute, as if that line hasn't been used in horror movies over and over to the point it's a cliche in itself. Plus, it just adds to the bad acting. The girl playing Kimberly is serviceable and of course Ali Larter is fine, but the other ""actors"" must have done this between their commercial shoots. It's bad. The body count is the only thing the movie is concerned with, and that's no surprise. Everything just leads up to another deathtrap in which someone dies in a horribly gory way. If you don't like blood, stay away. Really there's nothing much to look forward to except to see who's going to bite it and how. There's some bogus subplot about how only new life can defeat death, but it's very cheesy and uninteresting, just like the movie. The opening car pileup is neatly choreographed but brought down by the bad acting and amateur music, which should have been more impactful. Ali Larter should have stayed away just like Devon Sawa and made a real movie where she gets better lines and a chance to show she has talent. Her lines are bad, just like everyone elses'. The movie takes itself way too seriously at parts that it's embarrassing how corny it all is.The first film was no masterpiece, but it was a serviceable thriller with a fine cast. There is no one in this sequel with a bit of acting talent observed from the first cast. I'm sure this movie will be an embarrassment to Kerr Smith, Devon Sawa, and surely Ali Larter since all it does is give the first one a bad name. Yep, they've turned Final Destination into a franchise. This one is not even half as good as the first and the direction, music, and acting minus Larter is rock bottom. If you like gore and no more, treat yourself. Otherwise, the creepiness and deft craft of the first film is absent and cheesiness takes over. Stay away if you can help it, death should have taken this film.",,Anonymous,Horror

The Premonitions,"One of the problems I had with Final Destination 2 was the premonitions. In the first Final Destination, Devon Sawa only had one premonition and that was in a dream.  Now in Final Destination 2 A.J. Cook has premonitions but she's awake all the time she able to see them... and the fact that she gets them out of nowhere and can even look back on them, it's like she has a gift for predicting death.  I just think it's stupid because Devon Sawa saw signs of death happening like a reflection of a train and a bus in a window and the torn up piece of paper that said Todd.Two more problems I had with the movie were you were never told what happened to Alex (Devon Sawa)and the opening premonition... hasn't anyone heard of breaks???",,Anonymous,Horror
...,"Last night, after work, I decided to catch a late showing of FD2, a film I wasn't really sure if I wanted to see to begin with.  The first one boasted some pretty nifty death scenes and managed to keep me entertained for most of the running time.  Knowing that this was going to be more of the same, I went anyway, glad that Devon Sawa was now out of the picture.  Well, it was more of the same, but this time it was done much better, with a lighter (and sickly funny, I might add) tone.  True, this one had most of the stuff that has made me hate most of the so-called, half-assed, ""horror"" movies over the last ten years, but this time it really didn't bother me and I was surprised that I liked most of the characters.  What really made this one stand-out to me was the fact that we had a good director who's not afraid to show us some gore.  No fake outs or camera cut-a-aways here, nope.  This one shows it all and gleefully at that.  In short, it's not for the squeamish.Now, the plot paralells the first film to a tee, but what I really liked was how it tied each of the main characters to those poor souls in the original. It was a pretty cool idea and it was pulled off convincingly.  Tony Todd shows up again as the mortician and I'm not really sure what his purpose is supposed to be, other than to be ambiguous and aggravate the hell out of me. Now it may just be my feeble mind, but I have yet to figure out his character and how he's supposed to know all of this stuff about death. Please, on the next one, let's have a little bit of background info on him.The death scenes here are something to behold.  Yes, some may complain that they are too elaborate and blah blah.  Yes, they're elaborate, but that's what makes them fun.  I won't spoil anything for you.  Too many people have mentioned the opening highway scene already, so I'm not going there, but I will admit that it was pretty damn unsettling and it did cross my mind more than once on the way home.  brrr.If you liked the first, you've probably already seen it.

Hands down WORST movie of the year,"Horror movie sequels are rarely any good, especially in the past decade, but this one takes the cake as the epitome of a BAD horror movie. Even more than that, it is the epitome of BAD movies period. I would be ashamed to be anyone involved in the making of the movie. The script was TERRIBLE, the acting was even worse. Its an excuse to see how gory a death can be. Whats the most creative way we can kill someone? I dont know what is worse..the people who come up with disgusting deaths or the sickos who actually enjoy these stomach churning sights. Its a sick world where THIS is okay but the beautiful expression of sex is  considered inappropriate in films. I wish I could get back the two hours of my life wasted in the viewing of this ""film""...life is precious..dont waste any of your time on this piece of trash.",,Anonymous,Horror
Hooray for guts!,"I expected Final Destination 2 to be practically a remake of Final Destination, a film which I enjoyed.  I was correct, as it happens, but it didn't matter - FD2 was nastier, gorier, and more fun than the original. I'll need to rewatch both on DVD some day, but I think the sequel is actually a better movie overall.The humour actually works for the most part (though a few jokes fall flat), which turns FD2 into a seriously gruesome black comedy for most of its running time.  The elaborately constructed death sequences will make you cringe, cover your eyes, and laugh out oud all at once.  This may be the goriest horror movie Hollywood has produced in a decade or more.If you have a weak stomach, stay far away from FD2.  However, if you want to have some fun with an extraordinarily gruesome romp through the city and countryside, have a look.",,Anonymous,Horror
You can not escape deaths plan...,"Whoa!I saw the first movie when it originally came out and thought it was fantastic. When I heard that the sequel was coming, I thought that it would never beat the original, but would go and see it anyway due to the clever adverts they where showing on UK TV!!!I am so glad that I saw it. This movie is brilliant, and on a par with the original. The car pile-up scenes at the beginning are some of the best shot sequences I have seen, and the way the director / writers build you up to a death scene by dropping lots of hints, and then twisting it totally away from what you thought was going to happen right before it does is a stroke of genius.Will there be a third?",,Anonymous,Horror
mood just went from freakish scary to plain silly,"The script is basically non-existent, since most of the movie is less chitchat and more freakish hellish fatal death accidents one after another just like in the Friday the 13th films except here it's not a physical being but an invisible stalker/killer called death. On video, the whole point is to watch the gruesome grisly horrible scenes, and skip/avoid the nonsense talk about death's plan that the characters discuss exhaustingly throughout the movie, which is just plain silly and dull. I repeated and slow-motioned every silly death scene just to see which one's actually looked real, which some looked downright convincing and all with the computer special effects but of course some didn't, like the glass scene. I know this is simply a movie but come on, fake or not, can a plate glass actually pancake a human being into tomato sauce? That scene should have been cut immediately or at least find a more realistic approach like use a concrete cinder block. They had some good ideas this time around, but most of the stuff is just over the top movie fun, for it's not enough to shock the crap out of anyone unlike the first movie for example with the airplane scene, the best scene in the entire movie. 6/10",,Anonymous,Horror
Sequel Worth Seeing...,"Final Destination 2 is indeed a sequel worth seeing, if you have the stomach. This movie has to be by far one of the goriest films that I have ever seen. Walking into it, I thought this was going to be nothing but poor lame sequel. I was shocked how well done this film was. The up close deaths and constant suspense kept me interested. This film goes along with the old saying, ""Sequels are never as good as the Original."" But I think it's one that Final Destination 1 fans will enjoin.",,Anonymous,Horror
weeeeeee what a movie!,"What can i say... INCREDIBLE movie just fantastic.First the story line, it keeps you busy 6/10, the tension however throw the whole movie is a must! 8/10 and the shocking accidents god! 10/10!!!!.I have seen 1000's of movies, and i like horrors/thrillers allot, but these accidents are just wild, very creative minds put this together and i just wanted to thank the makers! ""big compliments to Jeffrey Reddick, David R. Ellis, J. Mackye Gruber, they made it look like the real thing"", and i enjoyed it allot. The funny thing in final destination you see the accidents come that's special, it should be in the genre comedy/horror cause its funny as hell.Watch it with your girlfriend she will hang on you the full 90 minutes hehe :-)I can't wait till part 3 arrives go go go!!! make me happy",,Anonymous,Horror
A typical sequal..,"Ever heard the expression that a sequel fails every time - and while that unfortunately is true in 99.5% of all cases, this one is no exception..It's tacky, nothing new - it has a great scene of a huge carcrash in the beginning, though - very well carried out, kept me on the edge of my seat...too bad for the rest for the film I kept sliding more and more down in my seat almost falling asleep by the end..It's a typical horror movie, following up on an already average first movie..",,Anonymous,Horror
Kewl film,"In comparison to the forst film, of course this one looks alot better, much more upclose death scenes(all thanks to advanced digitrickary). The plot for this film compleatly sucked, the plot for fd1 was much better, but overall i liked this one a little bit more. The bit that i really liked was the girl running out of the cinema when the eye crush scene takes place, she like totally flipped........",,Anonymous,Horror
funny as hell,"i loved this movie it was very funny when me and my friends rented it we were trying to guess how the people died but not the ones we saw die in previews. I loved the ending the kid went to the grill then bam no leading up or anything just dead and then the arm landed on the mom's plate that got me laughing so hard I was crying. I hope they come out with a FD3 and also i loved how they all died. impalement, decapitation, getting blown up, smashed, ummm well anyway it was funny as hell. i love some of the similarities between the first and second one. flight 180/route 180. what was really funny is that in the first the guy who was saved at the very end was knocked off by a brick...me and my friends were also making a joke that kimberly sees one last premonition...the word ""brick"" she asks what the hell does that mean as someone kills her with a brick",,Anonymous,Horror
"My synopsis, minus the fluff","Good points:1.)  Interesting, unique, and thought provoking plot.  Not insulting to viewer's intelligence, like Darkness Falls. 2.)  Very good, if not excellent, special effects, unlike Darkness Falls, whose producers seemed to chinse on the effects. 3.)  Thorough scene weaving with minimal plot holes, again, unlike Darkness Falls. 4.)  The characters that you want to die the most, do, and in heinous ways. 5.)  Plenty of mayhem,destruction, and gratuitous violence. 6.)  Obviously a huge budget was approved for this movie,yet again (take a guess), unlike Darkness Falls.Bad Points:1.)  Jumbled dialogue between characters, sometimes leading to sloppy scene development. 2.)  Inappropriate and morose humor injected into scenes.  It so inappropriate, you almost could miss that humor was intended. 3.)  Not enough gore. 4.)  No sex. 5.)  Relatively predictable scenes. 6.)  Boring at times. 7.)  Dialogue when Kim Corman goes to visit Clear Rivers in sanitarium is stupid and unrealistic. 8.)  Throughout the film, lots of cliches, really infantile gestures, and crappy character development. 9.)  Mediocre acting. 10.) You actually hope for a violent demise of the main characters, instead of rooting for their safety. 11.) Horrible development of suspense.  Producers appeared to concentrate on gratuitous violence, thus sacrificing ample opportunities to develop true suspense and horror.  This is the primary flaw and downfall of the movie. They blew it here, big time.All in all at best, I give it a 2/4 rating.  That is being generous on my part.",,Anonymous,Horror
Solid fun.,"Despite all the bad reviews, I highly enjoyed this flick. If you're willing to just kick back and have a good time, this is one enjoyable movie. The acting is good, the special effects are incredible, and the plot is actually above average.Like Final Destination before it, this is a more creative horror film. It's not a hack and slash, but more a dark comedy of sorts. The fun of this film comes not from the events leading to death, but death itself. Luckily there's a large cast and the inbetween time is quite enjoyable.The scene that puts this movie over the top however, comes right at the start. Just like FD's plane explosion, it sets the pace for the entire movie. FD2's highway scene is simply an amazing event. It's jaw dropping, it's gruesome, and it's fun.They thankfully went for a strong R rating, and didn't shy away from getting really gruesome. They also threw in biker babe who briefly flashes early in the film, which probably should have been left out. Otherwise though, the suspense to gore ratio is just about right.Rirath_com",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, but not as good as the first","Well judging from the trailer I thought this would be CRAP. Just a quick buck to make some more bling bling bling. But it's actually a 50/50 ride. Some of it is just amazing, and some other stuff is pretty crappy.First of all, I'm wondering why there is only ""one survivor"" from the first movie when there were obviously 2. But it turns out, from what I could tell, the GUY in the last movie was killed by a brick in the face? At least that's what I thought the newspaper said.Anyway, same idea as the first, except the female lead, Kimberly (?) keeps having these ""visions"". I thought that was kinda lame since in FD1, there was only the 1 vision, but this chick keeps having several.I thought some of the death scenes were so well laid out it blew my mind, but others were just like ""ok, quick, time to kill someone!""They did a nice bit referring to the first movie, but overall I felt this one didn't quite measure up. The whole idea of how to ""thwart death's plan"" in this one was really really bad, and all the girls visions amounted to a pretty lame ending.But, I did like it, just not as much as the first one. I'd say it gets a 6.5, the acting was actually not too bad. Some of the scenes were so intense I foudn myself just staring at the corner of the screen because I couldn't handle it anymore.",,Anonymous,Horror
all I have to say about this movie is...,"YUCK! I thought the first one was bad with the gruesome death scenes. This movie was all right, but the gore seemed overdone and the plot, while not as bad as some other horror movies, was not much of a change from the first time around.",,Anonymous,Horror
Catchy like a boy band!!!,"Ever hear one of those boy band songs on the radio, and you know you that you hate the song but for some reason can't get it out of your head. Well that's what this movie is like!!!It's better than the first only because the first was a test movie. This has more dialogue, same cheese, but more. The opening is great and you won't blink from that point on. This is one of the movies that you can still enjoy even if you're in a packed theater with noisy ""a-holes""...I'm actually waiting for the third one just as much LOTR:Return of the King....I say go see it to be entertained. For students of film go see it to get away from the pressure of trying to succeed in the film industry!!! 9 out of 10 (only when compared to the first) 5 out of 10 when compared to movies period.",,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the first,"I was surprised that I enjoyed this movie so much. I never liked Final Destination, and when I saw the preview for the sequal I thought it would be even worse. Except to my surprise i found it much more enjoyable especially with Michael Landes. I didnt recognize him when he was driving in that police car but after awhile i knew it was him from ""Lois and Clark, The New Adventures Of Superman"".The whole movie i was just hoping that he didnt die!",,Anonymous,Horror
what do u expect of a squeal that kills off the main....,"Character from the last movie, really it wasnt all that great, the deaths were mostly very un realistic, matter of factual being is that half the ways the new charaters died were more than likely humanly un possible of working. Im sure if u really paid attenion and werent too scared u tell this by the way they happened. soo this movie was nothing close to as good as the first, for crying outloud they killed alex, u cant kill the main character of the movie that this ones based on, it just doesnt work.",,Anonymous,Horror
almost as good as the first,"i liked this movie cos it was kinda funny, but nothing could beat the first final destination. im glad they made second one, and i hope they make a third. it was nice to see that they had included somebody from the last one, so we know that they didnt all die, although i would have liked it if Alex could have lived for longer. as ever, there are gory deaths, and plenty of parts to send shivers down your spine. it was a good follow up, and im glad to say that it was worth the cost of buying it. definitely a must-see if you've seen the first.",,Anonymous,Horror
stupid,"I can't believe they can take a good idea (the first final destination)where you wonder if this person is gonna get killed and hope this person will make it, and turn it into a hyper-violent slasher movie where you expect everybody to get knocked off. I might as well have seen a friday the 13th sequel.",,Anonymous,Horror
what all people will die in horror ways ?,"this is a good gore or freak accident movie, don't take it seriously I just see this movie it got a good violence but the plot that they tried to do it they make a connection to the first one ( final destination ), Kimberly Corman tried to figured it out what is Death and how to cheat it. a great directed by David R. Ellis for this movie i gave it 5/10.",,Anonymous,Horror
You already know the whole plot to the film...,"but what makes it fun to watch are the gruesome deaths.  We have a guy who gets the end of a ladder in the eye, a boy crushed by a glass window, a women's head caught in elevator doors, new meaning to airbags are dangerous, and a flying wire fence that literally leaves a guy in  pieces.  Plus, a couple of deaths at the end, which aren't near as thrilling.  It certainly won't make you use any brain cells.  But, the film delivers tension since you are wondering when and how the next gory death will happen.FINAL VERDICT:  If you like blood and gore like me, then you will want to catch this film.  You could just fast forward to the death scenes and you won't be missing anything.",,Anonymous,Horror
"maybe, almost nice","for me, the best point of first film was the idea. violent death is present in too many films. but its sequel is just victim of this form of seduction. and the original idea is perfect sacrifice of adventure. sure, special effects are impressive. the detail about end of circle is nice. but the film is out of normal line. and this is source of not big enthusiasm. maybe, it is good. it is a problem of taste and expectation. a question for new generation for who violence is basic cultural food.but the basic charm is out. and the possibility to create an army of Final Destination - open. a film about/for teenagers, it is nice horror and interesting challenge.",,Anonymous,Horror
Oh... another teen thriller...,"I have to confess - I really enjoy watching ""regular American teenagers"" (pretty much like myself, although I'm not really ""American"") getting run over by cars, ripped to pieces, shot, stabbed, hung, drowned, thrown off high buildings and burned to ashes on the big screen. I have no idea why - maybe because I do not tolerate violence in real life. Anyway, in my personal opinion, if a movie is not thoughtful, if it does not have a message within, and if it is not a comedy/melodrama, it has to have violence in it. The more, the better (preferably, at random moments). And, yes, it has to have a happy ending (a little twist in the end, with a hint to a sequel, is allowed though).The sequel to Final Destination falls under these conditions perfectly. Like in any other teen thriller (see Scream or I.K.W.Y.D.L.S.), there is really no plot - who needs it anyway? There is also no ""message"" behind it. Don't look for director's views on life, death and all that philosophical junk in it - it's just a bunch of people getting killed in very interesting ways at most random moments (the director should be give a credit for that). And, yes, there is a happy end (sort of), and there will be a sequel (most definitely).One good thing about this movie that makes it so different from other teenager-oriented junk thrillers, is the absence of any kind of candyman in white mask/fiserman's outfit. People just get killed. Sometimes, in really odd and suprising ways. But - alas - this concept is (like any other thing in today's so-called ""blockbusters"") a rip-off too. Go see 1976 ""Omen"" and you'll understand what I mean.Anyhow, if you like blood, gore and violence, it's a perfect one for you. It's a little better and smarter than all other ""teen thrillers"", but it is also not burdened by any kind of philosophical meaning (the latter is what I like it most in the movies - that's why I'm giving it a 4/10 on an overall movie scale and a 8.5/10 on a teen thriller scale).",,Anonymous,Horror
"""Overdone on the gruesomeness but good suspense.""","A young woman has a premonition of a series accident on an American highway.When this actually happen she manages to survive along with a few others but then they start to die in a series of horrific incidents...More or the less the same mixture as before (see Final Destination); but this sequel is overdone on gruesomeness, which tends to undermine the entertainment. It does, however, prove as equally effective in the suspense department as it's predecessor. I hope they don't squeeze out a third movie because I fear that they will go even further over the top with gruesomeness and I can see the basic premise wearing thin by then. As actor Christopher Lee pointed out ""When they get a popular type of picture they do it to death.""",,Anonymous,Horror
Good points and bad points,"This show was rather good for a sequel, I must admit. However, it pales in comparison to the first one. First of all, most of the acting (with the exception of Ali Larter) is way overdone, except for a few parts, the entire movie is thoughrally predictable and incredibly fake, and a lot of the scenes are just bad versions of ones from the first movie with different characters. On the plus side, the death sequences are interesting to watch, and the special effects are decent.",,Anonymous,Horror
***1/2 out of ****,"""Final Destination 2"" doesn't merely rehash the idea from the first film, it adds intriguing new ideas to it. The first film was very dark in tone and had subtle humor, which made it more of a chore to watch, but this film cranks up the laughs, possible to help us digest the more gruesome deaths.Speaking of the death scenes, this movie goes all out, cranking up the violence with some of the most unpredictably clever deaths I've ever seen in a movie. The violence is disturbingly effective. ""Final Destination 2"" is definitely worth seeing, much better than the first film.",,Anonymous,Horror
If you saw the first one- this one is a must-see,"If you saw the first final destination, this one is a must see. it continues from the first one, and has some new ideas of its' own. The movie has some interesting death scenes, and will keep you on your toes. The cast of this movie was great. Ali Larter, who co-starred in the first one, co-stars in this one also. Aj Cook plays the main character Kimberly Corman, and Michael Landes does an amazing acting job playing Officer Burke. This isn't JUST a sequel to the first one, it's a movie of it own that's WELL worth the time to see it. I Highly recommend this movie if you enjoy good thrillers, or good scary movies, but i also recommend it if you just enjoy good movies, because this is surely one of them!",,Anonymous,Horror
