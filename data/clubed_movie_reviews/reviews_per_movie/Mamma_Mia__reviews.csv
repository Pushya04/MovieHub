mamma mia!,"I didn't use to like this movie, but as I got older I started to love the movie more. It's definitely a cheesy movie and far from perfect, but it's a fun watch with catchy songs (duh, it's ABBA). It's not too long nor too short, so it's a perfect movie to watch when you're feeling down or to watch with friends on a movie-night.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good light hearted fun for the summer,"With this big opening weekend either you're going to see the darker film The Dark Knight or you are going to see something more light hearted like Mamma Mia! Now I work at a movie theater, a lot of people were just assuming that everyone was going to see The Dark Knight, yesterday someone came up disappointed saying ""my show sold out""... I looked at her with a smiling face and said ""oh, yeah, dark knight, I know""... she said ""no, mamma mia"", I looked up all surprised, Mamma Mia sold out as well, people were really looking forward to this movie as well. I did see this movie on Saturday and really enjoyed it, as cheesy as it was, I do enjoy musicals, I think the only thing is that this this is the happiest musical that I have ever seen. So it was nice to just sit there and be happy with these characters and you can't help but laugh at the predicaments that they get themselves into.Sophie is a young woman who is about to tie the knot with her loving and adventurous fiancée, Sky, her life is great. She has a very loving mother, Donna, who is running a broke down hotel in Greece and used to be in a girl group called The Donna's. Sophie has one problem, she has never met her dad, she finds her mom's diary and discovers that she has three potential fathers. She invites them all to the wedding putting her mom's name on the invitation. So the three men: Sam, Harry, and Bill come to see her and Sophie is caught in a situation where she doesn't know who's her real dad, but they end up having the time of their lives and enjoying life together.Mamma Mia is the light hearted comedy that I'm sure any musical lover could enjoy. I loved how well paced it was and how the cast looked like they had the ultimate time making this film, that's what made it so much fun. This film also brings a lot of fun energy into you and just keeps you smiling. The songs were very catchy, which I know this musical was based on the songs of Abba, so we have that good old 70's groove going on. I would recommend Mamma Mia, if you're looking to smile, laugh, and dance, I'm sure you'll love to see Mamma Mia. It's a sweet film with the cheesy plot that is so much fun to laugh at, plus it has men in speedo's who are dancing like crazy, where can you go wrong with that? OK, you can, but it's all good.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Here we go again ...,"Mamma Mia! Does the mention of anything Abba-ish send you cringing to a corner? Or are you already joining in and dancing on the tabletops? Maybe another few drinks . . .In short, if you are not allergic to Abba, book your tickets now. If you are, why would you be reading this? At a pinch, it is worth seeing for Meryl Streep alone, who not only throws herself headlong into every refrain with unashamed gusto, but adds a touch of class and nuance to what otherwise could be a one-dimensional adaptation. Streep vacillates engagingly between playing herself and not taking herself too seriously. Pierce Brosnan just about keeps up, and manages more expressions than he ever did as James Bond. Colin Firth and Julie Waters trail behind somewhat. Yet Mama Mia! is a roller coaster of emotion, careering colourfully from the blue waters of the Adriatic, bursting 'like Aphrodite's Fountain' into the lives of Donna (Meryl) , her lovers and friends, and her soon-to-be-wed daughter. It is the party spirit that says kick your shoes off and sing silly cheesy songs. Altogether now.And yes  there's a story. Donna's daughter Sophie is getting married. To the buff-looking Sky. Only  where's her dad? She's never met him. A sneak-peek at Mom's diary shows Mom had three lovers before Sophie was born and Sophie secretly invites all of them. This is a film of threesomes. Three past lovers (Sam, Bill and Harry). Three close friends (Donna and two best pals). And, not to be outdone, Sophie meets up with two other young girls at the start of the film.The breakneck pace still allows for brilliantly put together shots. Like Streep doing a 'Titanic' with drapes blowing in the wind. Or a pier-load of young hunky stag night crew doing a dance in trunks and deep-dive flippers. Moonlit boats and beaches to ""I Have a Dream."" Filmed on location, the views won't disappoint. And like a favourite song whose ending we know, the drama is in the details and execution.As with many adapted-from-stage musicals, two young leads are played by talented singers, and the older parts by serious actors can sing well enough. Streep manages extremely well. Her performance is so professional and assured it leaves others standing. Fortunately, it is perhaps easy to paper over any cracks in musical comedy. Sweeney Todd relied heavily on Depp's charisma and stunning cinematography. Across the Universe, too heavily on the songs. Mamma Mia!, on the other hand, simply tailors everything to its joyous headlong rush. The songs fit naturally to the action. Streep even manages to sing them with her tongue firmly in cheek. She confesses to having been a ""stupid reckless little slut"" but then says she ""grew up"". (To which her pals chime in, ""Well grow back down again!"") The film is not without faults. There is a notable lack of chemistry between the people that throw themselves rapturously against each others' faces. Even Streep looks less than convincing in a brief lips-mash. And the men are a bit croaky in the singing department (Hugh Grant might even have been a preferable casting choice). And some of the time-line is wobbly. For instance, strange as it may seem, music from more than twenty years ago does not all come from the same era. So reminiscing about flower power (early sixties) in the same breath as a Johnny Rotten t-shirt (Sex Pistols, mid-late seventies) is either anachronistic or wishful thinking.Sadly, I am of a generation that can remember Abba-mania. The records would shoot to number one. Yet even then few people would admit to buying them. I used to manage a night club, and Abba was great music to ask a girl up to dance. My entire chat-up repertoire at that time consisted of, ""Would you like to dance?"" and ""Do you want to come back for a coffee?"" But girls would be so happy dancing to Mamma Mia they'd say yes anyway. I'd fall in love with a new girl each week. Ah, those were the days! Now there's a new generation of Abba fans who have no need to 'come out of a closet'. Abba is retro-chique. Even Madonna segued an Abba riff into one of her songs. From karaoke to hen nights. From '70s' nights to gay dance-floors. Dress up. Camp it up. Sing it up. Get sassy and cheesy. Or, if you're old enough to remember, fly back in time to wonderful memories.Mamma Mia!, whatever detractors might say, has been one of the most successful stage shows of recent times. Supported by the same director and original band members, the movie may well reach the similar fan bases. Or just the party spirit in all of us.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
If you think you'll love/hate it then you probably will  for the same reasons as those that feel the opposite way,"The critical and audience reactions to this film seemed to suggest that it was very much a Marmite of a film, with people either loving it or hating it. By the time I thought I should check it out, the ""biggest film of the year"" had become a sing-a-long classic and I decided to wait for the DVD. Watching it myself I can totally understand why this reaction was forthcoming and it is not really down to the film so much as it is the viewers. See, those that hate it will do so for the same reasons as those that love it. Mamma Mia is a film version of a stage-show but it is not an adaptation in that it has been made into a film so much as it is a stage musical made into a film. What I mean by this clunky sentence is that all the standards of the cheesy musical have been left in  from ""big"" action, colour and simple dumb cheer.For me personally this doesn't really appeal and nor did I particularly enjoy the film as it did feel all forced smiles and joys, scenes shoe-horned to fit the lyrics and fake fun in the actors and extras. By the end I had pretty much had as much camp fun as I could really stand and was glad it was done. Now others have taken that to mean that the film is rubbish, but it isn't  it just didn't work for you either. However for what it does Mamma Mia is actually very good because it knows who it is aiming for and what it has to do. Yes this means that it is daft and cheesy but that sort of ""big"" cheerfulness is what the target audience want  they want to feel elated and lifted even if it isn't real in any form. In that regard the film delivers as it is built on beautiful colours in the sets and costumes and a cast that put their egos to one side and throw themselves into it.This last part is important because to my disinterested eye all the star actors came off looking daft. Streep is certainly not someone I expected to be doing this and to her credit she throws herself into it, showing a camp overacting side I didn't know she had. Likewise Walters, Baranski, Firth, Brosnan and Skarsgård all do much the same  albeit to varying degrees of success. If you're into it then the ""big"" performances are all part of the fun but if, like me, you're not, then it will be endlessly embarrassing and it will be hard to shake the feeling that I was watching award-winning actors making themselves look and sound like muppets. Of course that is why they are ""good"" in the context of what the film is trying to be and yet at the same time ""bad"" if you are not in the swing of the film.What we are left with then is a film that we have seen plays really well to those that get it but leaves everyone else wondering why on earth people like Streep and Walters would make such nonsense. I personally disliked it but that does not make it a ""bad"" film, only a bad one from my point of view. For what it sets out to do though, it is a winning achievement  full of cheerful cheese and lots of colour. In fact, it is such a targeted film that you will already know whether you will love it or hate it long before you press play.",,Anonymous,Romance
James Bond needs singing lessons!,"I did enjoy this romp in the Greek Islands and was surprised at how well Meryl Streep sang. It's light, full of froth and bubble and perhaps has some aspects of Grease and Bollywood in it. The reason the music works I feel is that they haven't really messed with the arrangements of the songs keeping them generally faithful to the Abba originals. But Pierce Brosnan's vocal efforts were abysmal, almost laughable. Perhaps it was meant to be a send up of the original songs all the way through but he really did manage to mangle the vocals in my opinion. If you have seen the musical on stage you will know what to expect and there are some funny moments in the film and the Greek islands are as always a superb backdrop for the action.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Pure happiness, that is all and that is enough.","This movie is two hours of music and happiness. This movie is an easy 11/10 method of being happy and one of my all time favourites. There is no ingenious plot or thought provoking question, and that's fine. Just sing along and enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A strong soundtrack, casting against type, and a few laughs","As a musical, pure and simple, 'Mamma Mia' has the briefest and silliest of stories, backed up by a large selection of Abba songs (Super Trouper, SOS, Voulez Vous, Gimme Gimme Gimme, Money Money Money, Dancing Queen, The Winner Takes It All, Lay All Your Love On Me, Our Last Summer, Mamma Mia, etc.).Meryl Streep has a daughter about to marry, and a cloudy past which has left three possible dads - Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth), and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard). Now you can imagine that when Brosnan was James Bond he never thought he'd be cavorting along to Swedish pop on the big screen - but despite his weak voice, he does OK - the same can be said for Firth, who seems to choose roles with such little discrimination it is no longer a surprise to see him in anything.Donna (Streep) also has two friends to support her - Julie Walters and Christine Baranski. Walters is as fun as ever, cavorting in her headscarf and singing appallingly; while Baranski is another Samantha from Sex and the City - chasing young barmen and struggling in her high heeled boots. Their scenes together and apart are hilarious - and Streep's singing cannot be faulted.Is the film any good? It is hard to tell. It is certainly fun, and funny. The direction isn't particularly inspired, nor is the screenplay clever or profound - but then, neither is the music of Abba. Taken purely as bubblegum, feel-good cinema, it does OK, and isn't as bad as you might have expected.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Whose idea was it to make a musical where no one can sing or dance?,"Armed with irresistible hooks, soaring melodies and near-celestial vocal stylings, the Swedish pop group ABBA churned out a body of insanely catchy and superbly crafted tunes - ""Waterloo,"" ""SOS,"" ""Fernando,"" ""Dancing Queen,"" ""The Winner Takes it All,"" etc. - that made it the world's top-selling musical act of the 1970's and early 1980's. Several decades later, ABBA's music became the basis for a hit stage musical entitled ""Mamma Mia!"" in which a simple narrative was deftly woven around many of the quartet's songs. Now, the much-ballyhooed movie version of ""Mamma Mia!,"" written by Catherine Johnson and directed by Phyllida Lloyd, has arrived on the scene.The story takes place on a beautiful Greek island where the never-married Donna (Meryl Streep) single-handedly runs a modest hotel for an ever-thinning crowd of tourists. Her daughter, Sophie (the charming Amanda Seyfried), has never known who her real father is, mainly because Donna herself doesn't even know. With the help of her mother's diary from twenty years ago, Sophie narrows the candidates down to three (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard), then secretly invites them to her wedding in the hope that she will be able to figure out which of them is her real father in time to have him accompany her down the aisle.On stage, ""Mamma Mia!"" succeeded primarily because it was able to keep its wafer-thin storyline modest in scale and life-sized in scope. But blown up to the magnified proportions of the big screen, the material becomes a compendium of overacting (Julie Walters being the most egregious culprit in that regard), ham-handed literalization, forced spontaneity, and production values that look both gaudy and chintzy at one and the same time. Moreover, the direction is clunky, the choreography abysmal (especially compared to what we were treated to in ""Hairspray"" just a year ago), the photography either over or underexposed (depending on whether the scene is set at night or during the day), and the singing not unlike what one might hear emanating from the local pub on an average karaoke-night.In fact, there has always been an inherent problem built into ""Mamma Mia!,"" which is that much of ABBA's charm derives from the crystalline voices of its lead singers, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha Faltskog. Take away those harmonies and at least a certain percentage of that charm is lost. Now the movie version of ""Mamma Mia!"" comes along and simply compounds the problem by hiring big-name actors rather than trained singers to somehow interpret the pieces for us. Indeed, this must be the only musical in movie history made up almost entirely of people who can't sing (at least in the old days they used to dub the voices in if they had to). One has to give Streep brownie points for at least trying to belt out the tunes, but her rendition of ""The Winner Takes it All,"" which was the rafter-rattling showstopper in the stage version, falls flat due not only to her own inadequacies as a vocalist but to the awkward staging and foolish hand gestures she uses to accompany her singing (almost as if she were trying to act out the lyrics as she's singing them). Actually, I've never understood why anyone would buy either the original cast recording or the soundtrack to ""Mamma Mia!"" anyway when the real thing is readily available and clearly far superior to any imitation.All that being said, I am still inclined to at least half-heartedly recommend that people go to see this movie for a number of reasons. First, because the music itself (written by Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus) is fun, infectious and finally irresistible, no matter how much the singers may be unintentionally stomping all over it; second, because even though their singing leaves much to be desired, Streep, Bosnan and Seyfried somehow make us care about the characters and the silly little predicament they're caught up in; and third, because there are a number of scenes that actually work quite nicely, the best being when Donna sings the sweet mother's lament ""Slipping Through My Fingers"" (a song clearly within Streep's limited vocal range) to her soon-to-be-wed daughter. Streep and Seyfried are both very moving and poignant not only in that particular scene but in all of the scenes in which they appear together.For the half dozen or so audience members who aren't already familiar with the ABBA oeuvre, one can only hope that they will use ""Mamma Mia!"" as a springboard to sampling the real deal.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly good,"Went to see Mamma Mia without particularly high expectations. Not being a big connoisseur (or even fan) of musicals, I didn't really know what to expect. Though I adore ABBA, I never bothered to watch the stage production of Mamma Mia. But having a cinema membership, I didn't have much to lose (no money, at least), so I went for it. And boy, am I glad that I did! I can safely say that I enjoyed every second of it. And I'm not even ashamed to admit it!Give Meryl Streep another Oscar and get it over with already. If she could get a nod for the Devil Wears Prada, she definitely deserves one for this. She really let her hair down on this one. Mrs. Streep can obviously not pass for a trained singer, but somehow, it just doesn't seem to matter. It just really worked in the movie (unlike -say- Helena Bonham Carter's singing in Sweeney Todd). When I heard Meryl's rendition of ""The winner takes it all"" in advance, it lowered my expectations considerably, but in its context, it totally made sense.Most of all though, this movie was just sheer fun. People were clapping, laughing...Rarely have I seen an audience as enthusiastic. The crowd especially responded well to Meryl and her two cronies (arguably the strongholds of the movie). Also, because I had never seen the musical before, I was amazed (and amused) at the inventive ways in which they managed to incorporate so many ABBA-songs. Equally brilliant was the way the extras (usually some Greek old women) were deployed throughout the movie...And then of course the setting (beautiful Greece) was mesmerizing...Basically, Mamma Mia is a superb musical that doesn't take itself too seriously. If you're just a little bit crazy and want to have a good laugh, if you love ABBA, want to see Meryl Streep like you've never seen her before or if you simply have a secret crush on Colin Firth and/or Pierce Brosnan (his singing was nothing short of hilarious), you will LOVE this movie. Best summer flick so far. Warmly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Super Pooper,"Let me tell you. Just because I've been listening to ABBA almost non-stop since I saw MAMMA MIA! two days ago does not mean I enjoyed the film all that much. It's just the Swedish pop super group's music is so darn infectious. You would think that energy would translate to feel-great good time at the movies but sadly this is not the case. First time feature filmmaker, Phyllida Lloyd, spends far too much time dragging her feet when they should be dancing up and down the beach and no matter how many shots of the moonlight shimmering against the waves there are, the film is still a clunker instead of a stunner.When a musical is paper thin on the stage, it runs the risk of being just plain silly on the screen. On the stage, MAMMA MIA! is a somewhat justified excuse to revive a bunch of ABBA tracks wrapped into a completely implausible, overly romantic farce. Young Sophie (played on screen by Amanda Seyfried) is but 20 and about to marry the very supportive and very handsome, Sky (Dominic Cooper). Something is missing though. Sophie has lived on this tiny Greek island her entire life and helped run a crumbling hotel with her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) but she has never met her father. As far as she knows, he left before her mother could say anything to him but a chance encounter with her mother's diary from the summer of her conception narrows the possible men to three. So rather than talk to her mother about her desire to know where she came from, she invites all three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) to her wedding, pretending to be her mother looking for a reunion. Naturally all three men accept the invite and hijinks ensue. While the campiness of the whole affair is forgiven on stage because the suspension of disbelief doesn't apply, this screen version is too far removed from the stage to feel the least bit plausible.I believe in angels, something good in everything I see. And while there is very little good to focus on in MAMMA MIA!, at least there is always surprising Streep. She jumps up and down on beds, slides down banisters without the least bit of concern for breaking her hip. She can sing too. Much like she did in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, Streep's performance as the lonely mother of the bride carries the film forward and, in the show stopping ""The Winner Takes It All"", elevates the film to heights it could never have achieved without her participation. Though the two don't get nearly enough screen time together, Streep and Seyfriend make a great mother/daughter combo. Seyfried's fresh exuberance seems like it might actually be inherited from her movie mom. The rest of the cast delivers varying results  Julie Walters clearly thinks she is a comic genius but she comes off too brash; Christine Baranski is miscast as an older bombshell making for some particularly awkward moments with younger men; and someone should ensure that Pierce Brosnan never sings on screen again.Ultimately, MAMMA MIA! never connects all of its components. A melodramatic moment is followed by a peppy ABBA song, which somehow erases everyone's pain. In that sense, ABBA's music is the perfect choice to set the tone as it is some of the most depressing pop lyricism set to upbeat melodies in pop history. While the contrast adds weight to the songs themselves, the musical masking casts an air of falseness that never lifts. What your left with is a compilation of poorly choreographed, plainly sung music videos. No offence, Meryl, but you are long past your MTV days.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Pretty Missfire,"Relentless like one of those loud action movies. The entire cast seems to be on speed. I didn't quite get the director's intentions if any. I wonder if she's ever seen a Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure, please! This is one hell of a mess and I loved Abba. The costumes the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) The one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of Meryl Streep making a fool of herself. No chemistry with her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman film and you'll understand what I was hoping for. I was embarrassed in particular by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. The audience, however, seemed to enjoy it so it probably it's just me.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Feel-good musical at its best!,"When you hear the name ABBA, do your eyes light up? Does it send you into a frenzy of dancing and joy? Well then, stop reading this review and go see this movie! Conversely, does the mention of ABBA send you running in the opposite direction in fear? If so, then why are you reading this? In short, Mamma Mia! is a film for ABBA-fans and even people who enjoy feel-good movies at their best! Musical is not a genre I usually go for (the select few I like are probably the most obvious: ""Chicago,"" ""West Side Story,"" ""Sweeney Todd"" and ""Singin' in the Rain."" However, Mamma Mia! succeeds in every way a musical should do. With stunning locations, an excellent cast and toe-tapping musical numbers, it should strike a note with most people.The story itself is a piece of light fluff. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) lives with her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep), in a run-down hotel on an idyllic Greek island. She is engaged to the handsome Sky (Dominic Cooper), but wants nothing more than to have her father show up to the wedding. Unfortunately, she had no idea who he is, until she reads her mum's diary and narrows it down to three men: Bill (Stellan Skarsgård), Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan) and Harry Bright (Colin Firth). Sophie proceeds to invite all three to her wedding and naturally, chaos ensues. The story follows a seemingly predictable pattern, but honestly, too much enjoyment is to be had for that to really prove annoying.Director Phyllida Lloyd does something which often determines mediocre musicals from good ones; and that is to seamlessly work the songs into the story. Every song becomes relevant to the plot and not one seems out of place. Also, all the actors can sing well, and this helps draw one into the movie. Most people have ragged Brosnan's singing ability, and while it is not perfect by any means, it is tolerable. Streep is a natural stand-out, who just throws herself into her role (obviously not taking herself seriously at all). Her rendition of ""The Winner Takes it All"" is definitely a note-worthy scene. Likewise, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters, who play Donna's friends Tanya and Rosie, are complete scene stealers. They can sing and dance and do not feel like supporting actresses at all (both there numbers are incredibly catchy). Seyfried was a great choice for lead actresses, she is not only gorgeous, but has a fantastic voice and just exudes charm. I can not forget the guys, though, Cooper, who plays the tanned husband is not on screen a lot, but is a competent actor. Firth and Skarsgård are as good as Brosnan, all three are funny and obviously had an awesome time making the film.The music, is well, what you would expect from an ABBA musical. All the numbers are very well filmed, especially ""Dancing Queen"" and ""Lay all Your Love on Me."" Those two would easily have one dancing in the aisle and singing along. Mamma Mia! was filmed on location in Greece and what a sight it is! All the colours are vibrant, the sea sparkling and the beaches dazzling. Mamma Mia! is without a doubt one of the best feel-good films of the year that even manages to provide some genuine laughs at times. I say give it a go if you need some cheering up or you love your ABBA!3½/5",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The cinematic equivalent of water boarding,"Everyone knows the so-called plot, so let me cut to the chase.Forced frivolity. Miscast performers working hard to have fun so you can have fun. The brilliant Meryl Streep gives it a great try. Pierce Brosnan just plain embarrassing. Inexplicably set on a Greek Island. Lots of squealing, shrieking women. Lots.It was a silly juke box musical on stage, now it's a big, splashy, poorly shot screen juke box musical. If you like ABBA, so-so. If not, an assault on the senses and an insult to whatever intelligence you're left with when you exit the theater. I readily admit that I didn't really want to see this movie and went with some friends who did, but for the love of God. Why does my gender shriek and squeal to convey delight?

Brilliant feel good laugh out loud film,"I saw this film at the screening on Sunday and was not too sure of what to expect from it. I hadn't seen the west end show so was not really aware of the story line but that really did not matter.As soon as the first song started I was loving it! The actors may not be that great at singing but does it matter?! They are actors after all and this is not the west end! The actors play the parts really well and make fun of themselves at the same time. The story line is fun and has laughs for all ages. Julie Waters is her fantastic self in it and Meryl Streep plays the mother really well. The dance scenes are great and well put together. Loads of people in the cinema were singing and dancing in their seats so just enjoy it and have some laughs for a few hours.If you take it for what it is, a fun laugh out loud film with good actors and fantastic songs, then you will enjoy this film so much.I suspect that this will be a summer box office hit!

Just horrible!,"I do not remember, at least in the last ten years or so, a movie that I have liked less than Mama Mia. From the non-existent acting to the atrocious singing, I was cringing at least once per minute. I don't believe I could even recall one brief segment that I tolerated. I do know that I will never watch this disaster again. I cannot believe that with such high expectations due to the talent - Colin Firth, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, that a movie could be such a flop. But to see the lack of acting skills shown, the seemingly drug-induced dancing, and then, horrors of horrors, to hear the singing of Pierce Brosnan(!), I cannot see how this movie will not make it into the hall of shame. Definitely, a movie that never should have been made, and just in case you missed it the first time, one that I will never watch again.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Mamma Mia....,"After sitting through this film, I have decided that it is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. I knew it the moment I was subjected to three teenage girls screaming and overacting when they (OMG!) meet again, and then watching the same thing, only done by women old enough to be my mom. And that was only the first few minutes. Yeesh. So here are my comments...1. Middle aged women + ridiculous dance moves complete with hip thrusts and over the top costumes = not a good idea.2. Pierce Brosnan could not sing his way out of a paper bag. Nor could practically anyone else in this pile of excrement, for that matter.3. The songs were so random. It was obvious to me that they were thrown, willy nilly, into the incredibly contrived and STUPID plot.4. My three year old nephew could have written a better script.I was either cringing or laughing derisively during the movie. And I normally really like movie musicals. Of course they are bound to be a bit corny...but this was ridiculous. What a waste of talent.

Fun film - Don't take it seriously,"This is feel good, have a drink with it, have a sing, don't take it seriously, just laugh and have fun.I went to see Mamma Mia in the WestEnd three times and it was amazing, so I was thrilled to hear that there were doing a film of it. And then I heard Merlin Shreep and Pierce Brosnen were going to be in it. At that moment I became worried that they had made the fatal mistake of filling this film with famous actors and actresses who can't sing. In my opinion, the producers got the casting wrong. They didn't need to have big names in it, the Mamma Mia name was big enough to attract viewers.However, it can't be denied that the movie is hilarious and some of the bad singing is funny, indeed I can sing some of the songs better than the actual cast (and I can't sing!!).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Can't This Just Go Away.,"I don't know where most of you were at, but where I watched the film we didn't have people singing as some have told they experienced, we had people laughing, mostly at the campy plot line, the horrible dance sequences and the singing of the likes of Brosnan. The only people in the audience who seemed to be enthralled with the film were the seventies generation folks who were some how reliving the past with the songs. I was a DJ in the seventies and even went to the ABBA concert at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in Sept of 79, so I did appreciate them then and I still do now. But this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce. The sequences were so poorly staged, the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be Meryl's worst production. I cannot believe an academy award winner would stoop so low as to do this piece of garbage. So save your money, wait for it to come out on DVD and then maybe spend your money on something better, like cat litter.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just go listen to ABBA Gold,"Having read Anthony Lane's review of Mamma Mia for the New Yorker, I approached this film with appropriately low expectations. I knew everyone was going to have orange skin. I knew the actors would not be doing very graceful or interesting things while they sang. I knew the film was just a vehicle for ABBA songs, which meant that it was going to have a thin, contrived plot--and that was fine with me. Like virtually every other viewer who has chipped in to the financial success of this film and the Broadway musical it was based on, I was only watching it for the ABBA anyway. It would be nostalgic, it would be peppy, it would be fun. I'd get to enjoy the pleasure of anticipation--""Oh, I know what song is coming here!""--or, alternatively, the laughter of surprised recognition when the actors launched into a song I hadn't seen coming.In the end, I didn't even get that. It was clear within five minutes that this film was going to be excruciatingly overacted. The loud cackling laughter, the slapstick, the spastic dancing, the needless acrobatics (hanging and falling off of roofs). Certain leading actors' inability to sing, which made it hard to enjoy the music. I give the creators credit for incorporating songs into the storyline in, let's say moderately clever ways. But watching how poorly acted and choreographed this movie was, I thought: Is the problem that the people making this film are too embarrassed by the silliness of the premise to take it seriously enough to make it good? You can know that the premise of your film is silly--you can signal to the audience that you know it's silly--but you can still love it enough and pour enough care into it to create a film that's impressively executed and delightful to watch, even heartwarming. Baz Luhrmann has demonstrated that brilliantly with Strictly Ballroom and Moulin Rouge. Perhaps Luhrmann could have made this film enjoyable. As is, I'd have gotten more enjoyment from just putting on my headphones and popping ABBA Gold into my CD player.",,Anonymous,Romance
Take a Chance... It's Surprisingly Brilliant!,"TheFanCarpet.Com - Initial ReactionTake a Chance... It's Surprisingly Brilliant!While the majority of the film is brilliantly silly, Meryl Streep gives us an emotional show stopping performance of 'The Winner Takes It All. Who wouldn't pay to see James Bond singing 'SOS'? Pierce Brosnan was humorously over-emoting everything but it worked perfectly within the context of the film.Donna and Sophie (Mother and Daughter) are perfectly cast with an uncanny similarity in both looks and personality. Julie Walters almost steals the whole show, sorry I mean film, with her performance of 'Take a Chance on Me'.It does take you about 20 minutes to settle down from the excitement of this outstanding cast singing their hearts out. I'm not the biggest 'movical' fan but if go in with an open mind and a bunch of people and you'll leave uplifted and pleasantly surprised.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Puts the noxious in obnoxious,"Good God, what were the filmmakers thinking? I have never seen the stage show on which this nightmare of a film is based, but watching this thing, I have to wonder if it's really any better, even with people who can actually sing.The plot and characters are nonexistent, and the songs often have little to do with what little is actually going on in the story, but those are not the reasons why this film is so terrible. It's the obnoxiousness and utter lack of charm and humor. Every moment is cluttered with screeching, laughing, screaming, and terrible singing. It's enough to make a lover of musicals abandon the genre forever.Just stay away from your own health.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'm Coming Out ... the year's guiltiest pleasure.,"I have a confession to make that could land me in serious trouble here. I love this movie with a love bordering on the unnatural. Of course, I hear you saying, that can only mean one thing; you're a gay man of a certain age and if you haven't come out of the closet already. you're coming out now, and wearing sequins at the same time. No straight man, I hear you say, could love this movie with this kind of unbridled passion, so if you have aspirations to being a 100% red-blooded heterosexual male, (is there such a thing?), then keep any fondness for ""Mama Mia"" to yourself; you will automatically be suspect. Of course, I could just as easily be a teenage girl, (it's a chick flick, after all), and be in equally serious difficulties with my peers, for loving ""Mama Mia"" would then mean I had already turned into my mother, for this is a chick flick for the older chick and no mistake.I had avoided it on stage. I have never been a fan of 'juke-box' musicals where a plot is conjured up around a set of songs by a well-known group or artist. And my undiminished love of Abba, (there, I'm out of the closet - happy now?), made me shy away from, rather than run to, a show where their greatest hits were sung, karaoke-style, by others. But something drew me to the movie. Perhaps it was Meryl, (if Meryl liked it, it can't be that bad, I kept saying to myself). Perhaps it was the locations, (it all takes place on a very travelogue Greek isle). Perhaps, ultimately, it was the songs, (who isn't a dancing queen, after all). Nevertheless, going to ""Mama Mia"", the movie, was still like dipping my toe in the water before deciding if I wanted to do a full length of the pool. The last thing I expected was to fall head over heels, to turn into a blubbering mess, to turn into the oldest dancing queen on the block and into my mother all at the same time. ""Mama Mia"" is a guilty pleasure, (no self-respecting cineaste should ever admit to even liking this movie, never mind loving it), but as guilty pleasures go, this is the best junk meal you are ever likely to have.It's director, Phyllida Law, did it on the stage so at least she is familiar with the material, but she is new to movies and after the mess Susan Stroman made of ""The Producers"" I didn't really expect anything, but while ""The Producers"" was stagey,(and not in an appealing way), ""Mama Mia"" is genuinely cinematic. Lloyd's idea of film-making may be to let her camera roam all over the place, (she seems to have an MTV mentality), but she also knows how to build a production number. This is a fully-fledged musical of the old school. And now I am beginning to see the light. It's OK, guys, you can admit to liking ""Mama Mia"" without worrying too much about revealing your sexuality. Straight men are allowed to like musicals, too, aren't they? Then, of course, there are those songs, the ones we grew up loving. I read somewhere that Abba didn't write great songs because no-one covered them, unlike, say, Lennon and McCartney; that what made Abba's songs 'great' was the Abba sound. There may be something in that; the 'Abba sound' produced some of the greatest pop ever. Arguably, the songs that Abba, (and by Abba, I mean Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson), wrote and recorded are the greatest pop songs we've been given. So how do they work coming from the mouths of people who, effectively, aren't singers? (Ok, Meryl, we all know you can sing and act and probably split the atom at the same time, and the girl who plays her daughter, Amanda Seyfried, sounds very pleasant to the ear). Well, the answer is bloody marvelous. Most of these songs sound as if they were written for the film and not the other way round; in other words, they fit the plot in the way that songs in a good musical should and they are good enough to stand on their own.These are Broadway show-tunes and they aren't wholly reliant on 'the Abba sound'. So what if Julie Walters and Stellan Skarsgard croak their way through 'Take a Chance on Me'; by the time they get around to it I would have taken a chance on anyone. So Pierce Brosnan can't sing? Neither can Tom Waits or Leonard Cohen and yet we love them to bits. (Actually, Brosnan can just about manage to hold a tune and he makes a fairer fist of it than Lee Marvin or Clint Eastwood did in ""Paint your Wagon""). And Meryl, of course, is wonderful. Our greatest living actress is having fun here. This is her first fully-fledged musical: I just wondered what took her so long, (her rendition of 'The Winner takes it All' is one of the great solo performances in any musical).But does any of this justify my over-whelming and totally inexplicable passion? Probably not, which is why it is inexplicable. It's not a 'great' movie, (although it could just be a 'great' musical); it often feels like a bunch of friends' best ever holiday video where they keep bursting into song with fully orchestrated backing, and it gives a totally new meaning to the term 'Greek Chorous'. So, obviously I am a middle-aged gay man with a full wardrobe of seventies gear. (I certainly haven't turned into my mother!). I mean, what other explanation can there be? Oh, I've just thought of one. It is a great movie musical and it's a terrific way to spend an evening. So I can now safely go back into my closet if I can find room among all the sequins and seventies gear.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining and Forgettable,"The 20-year old bride-to-be Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried) finds in her mother's diary that the strangers Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) or Bill (Stellan Skarsgård) might be her father. The needy Sophie dreams on having her father walking with her to the altar on her wedding with Sky (Dominic Cooper) in the Greek Kalokairi Island and she invites the three men to her wedding as if she were her mother Donna (Meryl Streep). Sophie believes she will immediately recognize her father in the trio of guests. Donna owns a simple hotel in the island and used to sing with her friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski), who also arrives in Kalokairi for the wedding, in their band Donna and the Dynamos. When Donna sees her former three lovers together in her hotel, she gets stressed and confused with the situation while Sky is upset with Sophie's attitude.""Mamma Mia!"" is an entertaining and forgettable musical that has an interesting idea but a foolish story. ABBA was a successful Swedish pop music group from the early 70's to the early 80's, and the screenplay uses the lyrics of some of their most popular songs along the story entwined with dialogs. Therefore, for fans of this group, it is a plus. Another good point is the always wonderful Meryl Streep. Last but not the least, the paradisiacal locations in Greek islands is another great attraction of this feature. Unfortunately the shallow story is too silly and the choreography is very poor and could be better and better. In the balance of pros and cons, my vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Mamma Mia!""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Vaudeville,  but not ""Musical Theater""","I love musicals, all of them, from joyous Oklahoma, to Poignant Porgy and Bess, to the touching romantic ""Damn Yankees."" And I know most of the songs, sometimes singing them spontaneously, with a crowd or humming them alone.In a ""real"" musical, as differentiated from this vaudeville show, every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment. It is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or exaltation--a natural extension where mere words fail. So, in Guys and Dolls, ""My Time of Day"" describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. Every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood, or develops a character, creating a phantasmagoria of place, turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of song.For this lover of the Broadway Musical, and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the 20th century, Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre. There, the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate, often delightful, plot lines. While here, the songs, simply picked up from a collection, only interfered with the shaky premise of the film.Perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th century Musicals. They have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love, as achieved in ""Sweet Charity.""Let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review. Perhaps, another day, another mood, I could have gotten into it, and not have been so critical in this review.But I can't help but imagining what Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise. I think about it, while the memories of seeing this film is fresh, and I can not help but to mourn the great loss.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic movie full of joy,"After watching the Mamma Mia! musical in London, I was thrilled to hear about the movie coming out. Meryl Streep in a musical seemed like just one reason to watch it. Well, I must say.. It was a lot more than what I expected! The beautiful scenery, the cast and the songs. A good mix of tears, laughter and love that will make you feel like you're a part of the gang and enjoy every bit of this movie. Not one of the cast members let me down. It really is a feel-good movie and it made me want to stand up and sing a long. The ABBA songs are made for dancing and in this movie it reassured me. The singing and the dancing put smiles on people's faces, and it makes you feel happy and as if all worries are gone. I certainly smiled during the entire movie. The cast members were all wonderful singers and especially the two lead actresses Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried impressed me. A well-made movie that is worth watching more than once!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Saving the world is easy, singing is difficult","In order to enjoy this movie, you should be a fan or at least like ABBA's songs because the whole Mamma Mia's idea is just an excuse for letting the grateful viewers/listeners experience their favorite songs in a relaxing and feeling good setting on a colorful sunny idyllic Greek isle surrounded by the bluest sea you can imagine. I consider myself a loyal ABBA's fan. I still remember how I heard their songs for the first time almost thirty years ago, how happy I was to be able to own their albums on LPs, how much I enjoyed ABBA: The Movie (1977) which came to Moscow in the beginning of the 1980s and was basically the record of their concerts in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide. I also saw the famous musical Mamma Mia on which the last year movie is based on and I liked it a lot. It would not hurt if you can take with humor outrageous psychedelic outfits of the 1970s and the tight boots with the platforms so huge that it makes your feet hurt just to look at them. If that sounds like your idea of fun, fun you'll have. I sure did, at least for the first hour or to be precise until the very moment, Pierce Brosnan had ruined my favorite ABBA's song S.O.S by attempting to sing it. I guess it is sometimes easier to save the world from all sorts of evil than just to sing a song. While that torture lasted, I kept repeating instead of S.O.S, S.O.E which means Save Our Ears. I later found out that when asked during an interview why he took the role, Brosnan replied that when he heard from his agent, ""Mamma Mia, Meryl Streep"", he took it without asking whom he'd play. Well, acting next to Streep is a great reason, and I believe Brosnan had a lot of fun sharing the screen with her. I also believe that there is nothing impossible for Meryl. She can play anything and anybody. Just to think what she has done in all the movies she has graced with her presence. She did very convincing accents, she learned how to play a violin, she dances, she has been a villain and a saint, and everybody in between and she's been always the reason to watch any movie. While watching Mamma Mia, I got the crazy idea. What if Meryl played all six older characters, Donna, her two girlfriends and three men from her past? I know it sounds weird but if Eddie Murphy could do it, I am sure Meryl Streep could act and sing for six characters and she would be simply fabulous. Between Streep and young talented Amanda Seyfried, two of them made a nice singing/acting team. But even with Meryl playing and singing only one part, the film is still entertaining and fun mostly due to the fact that everyone involved had a good time on the charming little island, the serious actors were not afraid to make fools out of themselves for all of us to enjoy, and in the end everyone was happy and got what they wanted even if it was not exactly what they wanted in the beginning of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gameplan: 1) Sing Abba 2) ??? 3) Profit,"If you want proof of how a movie could be drawn out of thin air just connecting the dots which are really songs in a band's catalog, do the right thing.Choose Beatles and watch Julie Taymor's excellent Across the Universe. But if you wanna forget the nam war, and take a bite out of a fake flower power cold leftovers and feel the plasticky taste on your tongue, savour how far you can push a silly style without a bare trace of some substance, then definitely watch this.In this badly casted, poorly sung and worse written movie, everything seems out of place. The first half hour goes about with everybody screaming on the top of their lungs and trying hard to convey a feeling of sunny joyfulness while brutally forcing their faces into meaningless atrocious expressions and squeezing their eyeballs out of their skulls, then again some more shrieking for good.You would believe it couldn't go more downhill than that, but then a plot tries to unfold (and utterly fails), because of the sheer nothingness it is made of. Vocal performances that you could pull out under shower (and I'll just say Brosnan), leave you plenty of time to appreciate the gorgeous backdrop which is Greece, and also a bit more to ask yourself why this had to be done, really.The vacuum-packed silliness of the story is completely revealed by the end (which ideally should have been the marriage), and then it will be full clear why it doesn't really end there.It's just an excuse to sing some Abba.

Mamma Mia!,"So you meet a girl and you start talking, things are going really well, you share a lot of common interests. You're especially attracted to her because she loves both ""Mulholland Dr."" and ""Lifeforce"" and can discuss the minutest details of labyrinthine television giant ""Lost"". Another common interest is a shared, unabashed love of ABBA. You ask her if she's seen ""Mamma Mia!"", she says she hasn't but probably wants to at some point though it looks cheesy. The DVD's out a couple of days from the conversation, so she suggests watching it together. Now it's Wednesday, the DVD was out yesterday, but knowing that she has a thing for aging, over-the-hill action stars and the movies they are involved in you attempt, after watching the sugary-sweet trailer for ""Mamma Mia!"" again, to avoid it by suggesting that you rent ""Rambo"" instead (she doesn't know that you rented ""Mamma Mia!"" the night before this phone call). To your surprise she expresses relief, and you watch Stallone destroy what seems like the entire Burmese military force. The movie's dark and grim, more so than you expected, and not very good, but you have fun and everything goes great. Now you're confronted with the choice of either wasting your ""Mamma Mia!"" rental or sitting through it alone.What the heck, right? No. This was one of the most painful things I've ever sat through. Last year Julie Taymor made ""Across the Universe"", a lunkheaded, moronic, unbelievably simplistic and ridiculous movie set in the sixties using Beatles music, but it had a good cast, good performances of the songs, a neat visual style, and a dependable sort of romantic feel that took me by surprise. ""Mamma Mia!"" on the other hand, is a musical where NOBODY can sing OR dance, where every scene is dumber than the last one, where ""Dancing Queen"" is reduced to something far worse than even having a girl over and then realizing that your mom's friends are coming over for drinks under the pretense of them being 20 again, and having to be in the same house as all that. There's not one good performance here, not one good line of dialogue, the film is flat and boring visually, the choreography is unbelievably awful, and the story as bland and idiotic as can be.What a completely worthless, putrid waste of space which didn't provide a second of entertainment, which butchered every song, which was clearly done without any energy or commitment, as an internet acquaintance of mine said, it feels like a bunch of stars taking advantage of a paid vacation to Greece. What a completely horrible film, what an insult to ABBA and to fans of their music. ABBA didn't become popular because they appealed only to women over 35 or gay men, and while I've enjoyed several things with that target audience this is so exclusively aimed at that audience that it truly boggles the mind.

Disappointing but worth watching,"I really wanted to see Mamma Mia! as I love Meryl Streep, I love Julie Walters, I love musicals and I love ABBA. The film does have some very good things, but there were some disappointments as well.Cinematography/Visuals: I loved the look of Mamma Mia! The cinematography was beautiful and the Greek locations were stunning, colourful and wondrous. The costumes with the exception of the horrible ones Meryl, Julie and Christine Baranski had to wear as they sang over the end credits are lovely as well.Music: Nothing to complain about here. All the songs are great, especially ""The Winner Takes it All"", ""Dancing Queen"", ""Money Money Money"", ""Waterloo"" and ""I Have a Dream"". Then again, it's ABBA.Story/Writing: I think the story and writing in my personal opinion were the biggest failings of the film. The writing is very clichéd at times, and the story while it has its sweet moments does have its ridiculous moments as well and lacked a sense of structure.Direction/Choreography: The direction from Phyllida Lloyd was nothing to rave about but it was good. I actually liked the choreography in general, not so much for ""Waterloo"" but yes for ""Money Money Money"".Acting/Vocals: I had mixed feelings here. Starting with the good, Amanda Seyfried was lovely beyond words as Sophie. She had allure and acted with real charm, and her vocals were very lightweight and tuneful. Meryl Streep, I actually liked her. I did worry that her singing was too low in ""Money Money Money"" but she really emotes in ""The Winner Takes it All"" and she looks gorgeous in the sunlight. However, I have to concur with those who didn't like Pierce Brosnan's singing, it had a decent tone at times but it was flat and lacked support particularly in the infamously bad rendition of ""S.O.S"". Julie Walters was also a disappointment. I don't hate Walters, far from it, I think she is amazing, however she isn't given as much to do, and her singing I found on the shouty side.Overall, I was disappointed, but for the Greek locations and the music I guess it is worth seeing. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Utterly dreadful,"Let's get one thing out of the way first: I used to really like ABBA's music, some of the songs are recognised classics of pop and their place in pop history is assured, but this film (and the stage 'musical' by association) has savaged that legacy. This movie is so contrived, ridiculous, awfully plotted and embarrassing, it should never have seen the light of day; it makes Alvin and the Chipmunks look like high art.I love genuine musicals, especially Sondheim, so to call this throwing-together of a few pop songs a musical is derogatory IMHO. Sweeney Todd showed what can be done when bringing a real musical to the screen and having big name actors (who you didn't think could sing) take the lead roles. I was embarrassed for the actors, I was angry that Benny and Bjorn every got involved with the whole project and felt cheated out of my entrance money.This trend for turning pop/ rock group songs into musicals has to be stopped.

"Love, music & a good story conquer all","First and most importantly: Those ABBA people are great songwriters. The storyline is compelling, good-feeling and tugs on the right heartstringsenough to overcome the disappointments which mostly involve the casting of well-known and well-loved but non-musical performers in musical roles.

And if you love a song enough, you'll keep watching even when it's not being performed by your favorite performers.

It would have to be the worst movie ever created to undo the goodwill of ABBA. It's not that, but it's not good either. Props to Meryl for showing up and still doing her job without retching the whole time. I've heard loads about how bad Pierce Brosnan's singing was but I could deal with it, he's no worse than Gerard Butler. But the lead girl, although not tone deaf, her voice sounds to me like nails on a chalkboard. Otherwise you have good actors having fun.I can only imagine what the people who paid theater prices to see this on the stage must have thought. At least a movie ticket isn't that much money. I'll clue you in to a better way to spend your money. I bought the CD of ABBA Gold about 15 years ago for probably about $13.

Mamma Mia!: A Star-Filled Musical Movie,"The Broadway musical Mamma Mia! took London by storm in 1999 and was later developed into a flamboyant film in 2008. This musical was written revolving around the greatest hits from the Swedish pop group ABBA. The movie adaptation of this musical utilizes the storyline that is less than brilliant and features back-to-back ABBA tracks that are not everyone's favorite format of film. What makes this movie appealing is the striking list of names that appear over the title of the film: the cast. From Meryl Streep to Pierce Brosnan, this film is packed with big name actors that draw in viewers of all ages.Many of these actors had been very prevalent during the time this movie was released. It tends to be agreed upon that Meryl Streep is one of the most well- rounded and talented actresses out there today. She is known for her ability to successfully portray any character that she could be given and her role in Mamma Mia! is no exception. Streep had seen the musical in New York and was thrilled to be asked to play the part of Donna, the carefree mother figure (Levy 2008). We see Streep employ a childish nature throughout this film that we don't usually experience. From jumping on beds, to daydreaming about money, to feverishly interacting with past lovers Streep is able to completely embody the multi-faceted character of Donna (Puig 2008).Amanda Seyfried was a no-brainer for the role of Sophie: a young woman with a charming balance of minx-like youth and innocent fun. She stood out for her vocals during auditions and was able to blow every number out of the water with emotion and playfulness. Seyfried starred in the teen flick Mean Girls that had just been released four years prior to this movie and was thriving in the continuous wake of that movie's success. Her name had been thrown around so much because of her unforgettable role as weather-girl Karen in Mean Girls. This gave her a new credibility and name-recognition that she didn't have before the Mean Girls phenomenon.The list continues with Sophie's father prospects: Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgrd. Brosnan claims to have been nervous about the idea of having to sing and dance. He says, ""I experienced sheer terror at the idea. I don't think I have ever been so nervous about a job. In the end, I just surrendered to the whole experience, and had a great time doing it"" (Levy 2008). Firth had much success in previous films including Nanny McPhee and Love Actually and therefore his name served as an effective attention-getter to prospective viewers.The promotional movie poster was specifically designed to draw attention to the cast list. Instead of naming just one or two of the main actors it lists eight names side by side on the top of the poster. This advertising mechanism is rarely used and shows how much this movie relied on its star-power cast list. It is a plead asking viewers to focus on the actors and watch the movie to see their favorite celebrities. The poster also features the two leads, Streep and Seyfried, front and center of the design. The picture clearly shows the faces of these two immensely recognizable actresses. By clearly showing these actresses the focus is brought to their celebrity. If the movie poster had decided to not showcase any of the actors and instead shown something completely different, a portion of the movie pull would be lost.Mamma Mia! is unique in the way we see these actors. Many of these actors are more commonly featured in slightly serious, non-musical films and roles. When we experience Meryl Streep, a sixty-five year old woman, jumping up into a split or being pushed off of a dock, we cannot help but be surprised at her youthful demeanor. Many of these older actors are usually relatively put-together and its fun for their fans to get to see them in a different light. There is a scene when Julie Walter's character, Rosie, is crawling on top of a dinner table trying to chase after one of Sophie's fathers (Mamma Mia!). These youthful acts send carefree vibes throughout the whole film and leave the audience feeling like they want to run off to Greece and live life freely. By having these well-established actors play child-at- heart, adult roles, the audience absorbs the contrast and really gets in touch with the feel of the magical musical movie.Mamma Mia! saw much success not just because of its attractive story-line and fun musical hits, but because of the incredible talent of all the cast members. The casting in this movie was crucial to its success and was done with precision and accuracy. Each actor was able to completely take on their free-spirited character and pull in audiences of all backgrounds.Works Cited Levy, Emanuel. ""Mamma Mia!: Casting the Film."" Emanuel Levy.

Disaster!,"it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Let me think... mm, nope, I'm wrong, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Think about it, Streep singing and dancing, so Brosnan. (of course if you can consider those funny movements as dancing and awkward sounds as singing.) What can I say? Worst movie and except Amanda Seyfried and Colin Firth, worst cast ever.Streep's exaggerated acting meets with her ""can't dance"" talent and plus the singing. At this point the only true thing about the movie is its name: MAMMA MIA! :)ABBA is one of my favorite bands in music history. What a pity... Nothing much to say. Complete waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
True to what it promises: A First-rate Crowd Pleaser,"I have to admit that I was neither a fan of ABBA or of the musical show on which this movie was based upon, and didn't attend it when it was shown in my town. But I went to the movie excited about three things: a very good trailer, recommendations from all my friends and most importantly the presence of Myrel Streep and Colin Firth, two of my very favorite actors.So, let me put it that way: Mamma Mia! is one of the most entertaining pieces of cinema that I have seen in a long, long time. Yes, it doesn't have the gorgeous stylization of Moulin Rouge or the raunchiness of Chicago, but in its own way, it's just amazing. The simple presentation is backed up by a fantastic cast, a heartwarming story about love and the meaning of family, and a bunch of beautiful songs. Watching this film was one of the most beautiful movie-going experiences I had; I saw it 3 times in packed theatres, where audiences were quiet when they needed to be, and active and responsive otherwise. In those three times, the first Dancing Queen number got wild applause by the minute it was over, a proof of the entertainment value of the film. And near the end, when Donna looks at the screen and asks why everyone is still there while the credits are rolling, she says ""do you want one more song?"" and the entire audience would scream ""YEAH"". This is a first-rate crowd pleaser; a film that takes you into its world until you feel you are part of it. What an achievement.To some cynics, the story, involving a 20-year-old girl inviting three of her mother's old flames, suspecting one of them would be her father, is just an excuse to build a movie around Abba's songs. But what's wrong with that? The story is sweet and simple; the characters colorful and lovable, and the musical numbers are breathtaking without even trying to be anything spectacular. The cast are all excellent, starting with the adorable Amanda Seyfried, playing an energetic, practical girl torn between her love to her boyfriend, her sense of obligation towards her hard-working mother and her sense of incompletion because she doesn't know who her father is. A complex role, presented in an airy method, and played to perfection by the young actress. Julie Walters and Christine Baranski add comic genius to the equation as Donna's best friends, and so does Stellan Sarskard and Dominic Cooper. Colin Firth gives one of the best performances of his rich career, deserving all the praise possible for his ""spontaneous"" performance, and his final revelation is hilarious, and handled with so much cuteness and zero cheesiness that would be expected from Hollywood on such occasions. Pierce Brosnan was as hot as ever (sorry, can't find another word) and he added some real charm and star charisma to the picture.Which brings us to Myrel Streep. The Woman Who Can Do No Wrong. Yes, she can appear in mediocre movies, most recently in the likes of Prime and Lions for Lambs, but even then she adds a spark to the entire project, and makes watching these films an agreeable experience. In Mamma Mia! she is just absolutely fabulous: she dances, she sings, she acts like the legend she is, and in one particular scene preparing her daughter for the big night, she reminds us why she is so respected and, at 59, she is still a major Hollywood star: she is just simply a phenomenal performer. Fun, lovable, and definitely capable of handling a tune, her Super Trouper and Mamma Mia! numbers are highlights in the film.So, all in all, Mamma Mia! was the ultimate fun experience for me this year. Sweet, sensitive, and charming with a superb cast and beautiful music. Give it a shot in this summer of superheroes and bad movies, and it will help restore your faith in old-fashioned, simple cinema. If not, then at least you will have a heartwarming 2 hours of music, love and Streep and Firth excelling beyond expectations. Go see it with an open mind and, most importantly, an open heart and you will be ""having the time of your life"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fun and joy-able!,"When I went to see this movie a week ago, I soon noticed that a majority of the audience were people who most likely listened to ABBA as youngsters. I didn't. I'm a fan of musicals, ever since I saw Moulin Rouge, but just a few minutes into ""Mamma Mia"" I wondered if this really was my scene? Wasn't this kind of silly? But after 15 minutes I was convinced: This wasn't any air headed, dumb musical for a middle aged pop-music-loving audience - this was a super cute, funny and joy-able musical for everyone. My boyfriend, which i dragged to the theater because he claimed he hated Abba, laughed out loud and so did I and the rest of the audience.Meryl Streep was a beautiful performer, her whole appearance was powerful (as always) and her singing skills was pretty awesome. Amanda Seyfried was sweet and sang really good! James Bond's, Mr. Darcy's and... well, Stellan Skarsgård's singing skills wasn't in the same league as the leading ladies, but they were entertaining.Overall, this is a movie you can take your mum, your date or just yourself to and come out happy, and with a new perspective on ABBA's songs.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
You will need Onomatopoeia to describe the Euphoria of this movie,"Those Doodley-Doodley-Do, Dippy-ti-Dippy-ti-Du melodies, combined with a Humpty-Dumpty tiny precious lyrics, made my brain wonder ""Uh-Huh"" in surprise, and my lips to mutter ""Oh-WOW"" in amazement until my mouth burst in ""Ah - Hah - Ha-Ha-Ha"" happy girlie giggle. That's when my heart started going Rum-Tum-Tum along the bas-line, my pulse started jumping Bum-Bum-Bum in the tact with the disco rhythm, my skin started itch-itch-itching from those pulsations, my stomach started hush-hush-hushing down the noisy butterflies but it couldn't stop my soul from screaming ""Hip-Hip-Hooray"" and ""Yippie-Yippie-YEAH"" from the immense joy and pleasure!

It's not the play; get over it and you'll enjoy it.,"To enjoy this film, it helps to leave some expectations at the door. One is that ""ABBA sound."" This isn't it. That sound was created in a studio with a mixing board, etc. Some of that sound was in the stage play and it worked there because the majority of the audience is far enough from the stage to really think that gorgeous sound is coming from just the cast on stage. But when the camera is right in the actor's face, and that face is several stories high, the music must come from the singer.In that regard, the movie is very good because of that authenticity. Put it this way, you and I would never have a chance to be part of the ABBA sound. But we do have a chance, if we leave our inhibitions behind, to live life to the fullest and just break into song from time to time. The movie works very well at that because of the high level of skill from the actors, the sets and setting and the bright light of the cinematography. (Was Thomas Kinkade ass't DP on this?!) Also suspend your beliefs on monogamous marriage. It's just a movie, church folk...and otherwise it's a feast for the senses. Yes, a little too much estrogen, but mid-life women need their moments. Think of it as Under The Grecian Sun (including the bed jumping scene). Guys, you might want to just download some iTunes of ABBA's hits if you can't be man enough to go with your wife to see this.And that giant sucking sound you hear is the escalating costs of destination weddings! Who will settle for the little church on the corner (or worse, the Justice of the Peace), after seeing the beauty of the Creation on this location.Thank you Benny, Bjorn, Frida and Agnetha for bringing this music to my generation. And thanks to the movie production for letting the current generation eat from film version of a smörgåsbord.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Stinker of a Movie,"This is the worst movie I have seen in the last five years. If you think ugly Americans stinking it up in a foreign country is bad, you should see these Brits ruining a picturesque little slice of Greece. Everybody acts like they're drunk and having a grand old time-- it's excruciating to watch. Nobody can sing. Meryl Streep has done somber, depressed roles in the past that are really good, but she is just terrible in this movie. I hope this doesn't mean she has lost her ability to pick good roles for herself. This movie felt like the actors got on board because they thought it would be great fun to have a party in Greece, but they forgot they had to make a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"All singing, all dancing Meryl Streep","Taking the music of Abba and telling a story that has nothing to do with Abba or Sweden or the 70s/80s and casting Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnon seems like a crazy idea....and it is....but there is a fine line between insanity and genius.The plot is, Sophie is about to get married. But she doesn't know who her father is. She invites the 3 men who could be her father to the Greek island where her mother has a hotel and the wedding will be held.People, sing, dance and well things get confusing and emotional.The music is ABBA, you know you like it, even if you won't admit it.The acting is good. The thought of Meryl Streep dancing and lip syncing to ABBA might make people shudder, but this is her genius. She is emoting to every lyric and few people could pull it off.In fact the cast is generally superb.Pierce Brosnon manages to miss the point of the movie. He only accepted the role (script unread) for a chance to work with Meryl Streep. It is not actually a matter of bad acting, but it just some how doesn't work.Something different and it if you like it, it will be your little secret.",,Anonymous,Romance
Good Songs!,"I'd definitely give this ten out of ten for the songs but I feel that the storyline wasn't very good at all! Julie Walters is hilarious in this but i feel that the film has but a bad reputation to both Abba and their songs. I also fail to recognise why Colin Firth was gay. What was the point? Furthermore I think that wasn't that a waste of a good actor? I did love the setting though - the Greek Island took my heart away. The beach looked gorgeous and it looked incredibly warm. I have nothing against the actors I thought they were all amazing, their voices were great I just think that comparing such great songs to quite a rubbish story failed to impress me!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Me..... i had the chills going down my spine pretty much most of the time :) No one stood up before the final credits were shown and everybody was simply sitting down listening to the music, happy by the unexpected joy this movie brought them ;) I strongly recommend this piece to everyone regardless of age and genre preferences, cause i really believe that this movie is so good that there's no way not to fall in love with it! :)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cringeworthy,"It's quite a feat for the scenery to steal the show but that's what happens in this dreadful transfer from the stage to film. I tend to avoid musicals apart from the Gilbert and Sullivan type - deliberately tongue in cheek. However, I have a feeling Mamma Mia is a fine stage musical - it just doesn't work when straight actors take the main roles. The piece requires singers primarily as there is very little acting...a bit of dancing is called for but that is typical for a stage musical and there are plenty of performers who specialise in this genre. Streep and Walters are just so wooden it is unbelievable. Brosnan can't sing and Firth, what was he doing there? The daughter character comes over as a 13year old but is supposed to be 20 or so. So silly. This film represents a missed opportunity. The costumes are so much better than the dreadful stuff ABBA really wore, and the Greek island looks really enticing. Other than that there is nothing of merit.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Amazing acting, breathe-taking places. Great Singing. Brilliant all round","I went to see Mamma Mia, on the 10th of July, when it came out first in the UK. I'd never seen the musical production of Mamma Mia, but thought the adverts for the movie, looked interesting, and also the soundtrack was good.The film was in my opinion Amazing. The actors & actresses acted their roles so well & obviously put a lot of emotion and hard work into the film. The music was brilliant, the singing amazed me! I had no idea to expect what i'd seen. Some scenes have you crying with laughter, others have you in floods of tears, because of the emotion & the lyrics of the songs.. I would definitely recommend you go out & watch this. As soon as it began, i was obsessed. I've been back twice to see it, and I'm planning to go again soon.

A.S.A.S. = Abba Songs Always Slap,"This star-studded musical movie is purely vibes, which is not a negative when the vibes are IMMACULATE! Full of Abba bops and heavily saturated shots of Greece, this is the perfect watch for a relaxing summer day.Amanda Seyfried is in her bag when cast in film musicals, as is Merl Streep because she is Meryl freakin' Streep! It's fun to watch the potential fathers-Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Colin Firth-sing along to varying degrees and bounding on a boat. Some of the choreography feels like it lost some of the stage sauce in its film adaptations, but its hard to complain when its performed over pure Abba heat.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Do not take a chance on this one!,"ABBA, Abbacadraba, I want to reach out and grab you! Why? In vengeance for the cinematic torture you put me through in experiencing the film adaption of the ABBA inspired musical ""Mamma Mia"". This asinine film stars Meryl Streep as Donna Sheridan, a rundown Greek hotel owner whose daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is planning her upcoming nuptials in the Greek island. The primary ""Who is my real Pappa?"" premise of this film is that Sophie was never informed by Mamadonna who her real father is, even though there are three main candidates who Mamadonna went over the sexual borderline with twenty years ago. Sophie's choice then is to invite all three to the wedding so she can finally have ""faith"" to know the ""father figure"" truth. These Sophie Daddy nominees are the ""I still love Donna even though I dumped her after I did her"" Sam, the former hippie but now stable banker Harry, and the free spirit boat-aficionado Bill. Along for the wedding ride are also Donna's best friends: the lunatic Rosie, and the middle-aged lush Tanya. Throughout all this ""Who is your daddy?"" humdrum plot there are spurts of these characters singing away to ABBA tunes. All I can say is, to quote a classic ABBA hit- ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" less of these ridiculous musical scenes; even though Meryl Streep's pipes were not as bad as I thought coming from a seasoned actress. I cannot say the same for The Three Dads who were Pierce Brosnan as Sam, Colin Firth as Harry, and Stellan Skarsgard as Bill. Brosnan was the main singing daddy here and his musical voice was undoubtedly both shaken & stirred. Let's just say that Brosnan's singing was ""The Matador"" to my ears. The ensemble acting of ""Mamma Mia"" was appalling but the ""main weapons of acting destruction"" were found in the performances of Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya. Catherine Johnson's screenplay of ""Mamma Mia"" was dreary & wearisome, and Phyllida Lloyd's direction was as clumsy as direction can get. Harris Zambarloukos' unauthentic cinematography seemed like he used a Greece Photoshop software program for the film's look. So to cap this monstrosity of a film in musical fashion, I will use an ABBA tune: Do not ""take a chance"" on the musical horror of ""Mamma Mia"". *Failure",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Surprise of the Year!! (From a none Abba Fan!),"I went to see the film with my girlfriend and wasn't really interested, although it did have a very impressive cast! I LOVED it! What a great surprise, I laughed the whole way through and found myself completely invested in the plot!! The acting, singing and dancing was superb, I honestly believe Streep (who looked fantastic!) could be up for an Oscar.Additionally it's a genuine breath of fresh air to see a primarily older cast given roles full of fun and energy!

Not a bad musical!,"My friend showed this to me and it actually brought a smile to my face! While I typically don't gravitate towards musicals and while there could've been a bit more focus on the main character instead of the supporting characters, this one was executed quite well in a few scenes with its dancing sequences and musical numbers. I liked seeing Piers Brosnan as one of the possible fathers, always a good presence on screen for the audience. Meryl Streep also did well and I'm surprised at how well her and her friends moved in certain maneuvers for being their age! Dancing as an older woman can't be easy on the bones and muscles but they did it enthusiastically and convincingly in many parts!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Weak Script, Shallow Characters - Just Abysmal","Far too many Abba songs were shoehorned into this extraordinarily shallow and trite romantic musical.Unlike ""Grease"" or ""Chicago"", the characters are not fully developed and are left with little or no substance. The tale itself is just as shallow, dotted with story lines that virtually spring up out of nowhere to bring about its end. Maybe if the characters didn't burst into song every few seconds, we'd get to know them and a true, definitive story would be allowed to develop.Furthermore, a few of the songs don't correspond with what's transpiring with the characters on screen (""The Winner Takes it all"", for instance).Don't fall for the overly joyous singing, lame choreography that appears to be glorious, and the light comedy fair - it all adds up to a brainless and wasted exercise without depth and structure.Worst still, the story is like a glorified ""Flintstones"" episode where the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing, loaded with a multitude of confusion regarding character intent and circumstance.I'm not only surprised, but extremely disappointed to know that Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth agreed to appear in this utterly pathetic horror show - and that Tom Hanks was willing to produce it!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Three Dads and A Wedding,"Phyllida Lloyd's 'Mamma Mia' is a lighthearted energetic musical shot in Greece and an English Studio. It's nowhere near 'Moulin Rouge' or 'Chicago'. It's a tribute to Abba and it's so bad that it's funny. Most of the song sequences, especially those featuring Streep, her backup girls Julie Walters and Christine Baranski and the three dads are well executed and hilarious. The only song that I felt was horribly filmed was the one at the beach between Sky and Sophie. The actors (except Pierce Brosnan and the younger cast) do a good singing job. Well, the singing itself certainly isn't of professional standards but it fits the characters and the general mood of the scene even though Brosnan is laughably bad. The non-Abba songs are totally misplaced and unnecessary. One such example is Madonna's 'Hung Up' which is repeatedly played in the background.Meryl Streep is the heart of 'Mamma Mia'. This is perhaps one of most energizing performance and she seems to naturally exude vibrant energy like a teenager on adrenaline. Her singing isn't particularly first rate but she so hot! Julie Walters is excellent as always and she provides some of the funniest moments. Christine Baranski is equally great and she too has an entire hilarious song. The three actresses give a great performance of 'Super Trooper' that almost reaches the heights of the classic musical moment like Rachel Griffiths and Toni Collette's 'Waterloo' sequence in 'Muriel's Wedding'. Amanda Seyfried is good but she doesn't have any chemistry with Dominic Cooper (thankfully he doesn't have much screen time because he's awful). As the three dads, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgård fit their parts but except for Sam Carmichael, the other two characters aren't well fleshed out.While 'Mamma Mia!' is silly, the plot is very clichéd and predictable and it gets messy in the middle. Most of the song sequences are fun to watch. It's also one of those films, you may enjoy while watching but once the end credits have rolled, there's hardly much that resonates and this isn't something I would voluntarily revisit. Even though 'Moulin Rouge' had a sketchy plot, it was the execution, the songs, the charming characters, the art direction and the overall treatment of the story among many other things, that made the film unique while 'Chicago' had all of that and an engaging story. Even 'Hairspray' stands on its own because of the whole colourful 60's feel and the message it delivers. Unfortunately, 'Mamma Mia' lacks such substance and it is most likely to be forgotten amidst other musicals. Only time would tell.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Fun and enjoyable, but let's face it, the hardest part was over...","""Mamma Mia!"" is such an openly and shamelessly cheerful movie that any attempt to criticize it would make you sound like a killjoy, as infuriating and convenient as it is, it's not that far from the truth. And I would lie if I said I didn't find myself enjoying the film most of the time, but on the other hand, I disagree that a film should be immune to criticism just on the basis of the positive emotions it inspires, which supposedly compensates every loose ends or plot flaws.Speaking for myself, I have at least five ABBA songs in my playlist and there are certainly five more I would instantly recognize and hum if I heard them, I don't know how much a 'fan' that makes me, but let's just say that I like their songs, I even love some and I think they are some of the catchiest Pop-Music ever produced, with a super power, they mix very well with movie or TV scenes. I still have in mind, the dance between Dewey and babysitter played by Bea Arthur in ""Malcolm in the Middle', with ""Fernando"" (one of my favorite ABBA songs) in the background or ""Waterloo"" playing while Mr. Burns was pulling a 'Ride of the Valkyries' attack on the Simpsons' house.ABBA songs have that incredible appeal, and it's no wonder that Catherine Johnson thought it would make a terrific musical, and no wonder it was that successful. But what I expected from the film (directed by Phyllida Lloyd) was to rely on a little more than the worldwide popularity of ABBA songs and the musical, because one can easily argue that the hardest part was over, the songs were great already; even the 'plot' on which to hang every popular song was written, with the exception of ""Fernando"" (couldn't they invent a character with that name!?).Now, I saw the bonus features and I understand how shooting on location was difficult and what's more, teaching all the actors how to sing and dance, but with such a star-studded cast, the film was a no-fail-guarantee, let's not kid ourselves. And I won't even complain about the cast, Streep and Seyfried made the film, their enthusiasm was so catching that the screen was always illuminated by their presence, and the three bimbo males (Firth, Brosnan and Skargaard) took the whole thing in good spirit and everything was made in a fun and innocent way. So what went wrong?Nothing exactly, except that the film basically recycled the plot from the original version and put stars into it, the director didn't try to appeal to a more demanding audience or to enrich the story a little bit, as if she was convinced it would be a hit already. In the end, the story doesn't really matter, and if some plot elements are incredibly contrived, if it's the kind of idiotic plot that could be solved if simple questions were asked at the right moment, well, we'll just have to pretend that the film is deliberately fun and corny and doesn't take itself seriously, so why should we? But I don't know, sometimes, I enjoy the 'what the heck, let's have fun' aspect, and sometimes, I wonder if they aren't all in on a big joke, that we're supposed to enjoy, without asking questions.But I'm sorry, I couldn't believe Donna wouldn't figure out why these three guys were here at the same time, I couldn't believe that it took her till the wedding to realize the truth or not to have the right conversation with her daughter, I couldn't believe that that free-spirited woman would finally pick that guy and I couldn't believe that the three guys would react the same way. I understand that the plot is as unconventional and lighthearted as a female-oriented fantasy, but these are not complex points, and the reason why I insist on these elements is because the impact of a song should rely on the moment's genuine emotional resonance. When Streep sings ""The Winner Takes it All"", it should have been a powerful moment, emotionally rewarding, but since they preferred ""not to take themselves seriously'"", well, it only works for the song is powerful, nothing else.See, I only wish that 'Mamma Mia!"" tried to be embrace its own free-spirited fun and take enough distance from the stage musical, so that we could wonder if we loved the story as well as the songs. The film took its material for granted and didn't try to elevate it a little more. I understand we should enjoy it for what it is, but sometimes, that just works as a convenient alibi against criticism, especially since there are other feel-good musicals that still cared about telling a good story, ""Chicago"" or ""Singin' in the Rain"" to name them.Now, I feel guilty after having written these lines, to conclude on a positive note, I'll say this is an enjoyable movie as far as you can enjoy ABBA song, the beautiful Mediterranean isles' landscape and Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried's communicative smiles, I guess sometimes that's enough. But it's precisely because I enjoyed these elements that I wish the film tried a little more. To keep on the bright side, after having watched the 2016 ""Ghostbusters"", I want to say ""Mamma Mia!"" is the perfect example of how a film can make fun of men in such a good spirit that even a man can enjoy it.This is film written, directed and driven by women, but it's far from being just a chick flick, not surprising since ABBA was perhaps one of the rare bands represented by both sexes., and certainly the most successful. At least, this is a film that is not divisive, and it's fun, positive, exactly what ""Ghostbusters"" should have been, but wasn't.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"I don't like musical movies at all, but I have to admit that this movie was good !","What made the movie enjoyable for me were the music, the visuals, and, surprising to me, Meryl Streep. I usually don't like Streep's movies or her performances. Her films tend to contain subject matter I don't care for, and, often, they are preachy in a way that I find disagreeable. The tendency to underplay a role is normally a desirable quality in an actor. Unfortunately, she underplays to barbiturate levels.However, Mama Mia is a musical. It is upbeat. It is over-the-top. It made her climb out of her pill-box. It also made her use her voice. She doesn't get to sing enough in the movies she typically makes. Too bad.Pierce Brosnan, on the other hand, is not that suited to the musical genre. Also too bad. His format is usually over-the-top, and he does that well. But, his singing voice is only passable, and, for some unknown reason, he seems to be trying to play a dramatic role here.For Entertainment: 9.0/10Overall Score: 8.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I will never trust PIERCE again and will read every review before saying OK again. I was in so much pain that a person behind us asked me to stop talking during the show and I was MOANING.

Knowing Bjorn, Knowing Benny, it must have been all about the Money, Money, Money. The very effeminate, almost gay Pierce Brosnan may be a true Dancing Queen (in the worst possible Baz Luhrman way), but wouldn't a woman have been better suited to that role? Voulez-Vous actually watch the vastly overrated, hideous, big-nosed Streep ravage those nice ABBA songs with her hellish voice? You do, you do, you do? Well, I Don't, I Don't, Most Definitely Don't. This must be the campiest, cheesiest, most absurd-looking movie to hit the screens (literally HIT the screens: like a high-speed 16-ton piece of turd) since... well, when was George Clooney's last movie released? If Brosnan and Streep are meant to be Fernando and Chiquitita, then I'm sorry that the lyrics to these songs don't end by having the title characters face a firing squad. (""Chiquititaaa, you'll be shot to deaaaaaaath..."") A bloody end, with all the cast getting obliterated in a savage orgy of violence, might have saved this movie, giving the more intelligent viewer a sense that justice does exist in this world. Gimme!

If the songs on that album were any indication, then it was clear all along that if Bennybjorn ever started doing something again, they'd do it quite badly. Even more simply put, Benny and Bjorn are two aged, bored dullards. We may have been able to forgive them for grinning like morons and dressing up like failed clowns, simply because they made great music, but their involvement with this should give ABBA fans the legal right to send them into a nice, quiet retirement home.

Mamma Mia!,"Although ""Mamma Mia!"" is full with many imperfections, it brings so much happiness that you get out from the cinema desiring to dance and sing the tunes you've just listened during the film, and I think this is a very positive aspect in these trying times. Abba's songs are crystalline and joyous, and they still maintain their potential also in this film, in which, let's admit it, not everybody can sing (Pierce Brosnan wasn't born to sing, and even Meryl Streep hasn't an unforgettable voice, but the newcomer Amanda Seyfried is quite OK according to me). All in all, the best things in this film are: the character of Tanya (Christine Baranski is so funny!), the ""Dancing Queen"" scene with that fantastic choreography, and the paradise island setting of this story.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

When bad weather traps you inside, there is no better uplifting fun than this movie. Everyone has their favorite song, but mine is the guitar ballad on the boat by Colin Firth. I never really paid attention to ABBA years ago when they were popular(even though I'm of Swedish decent), but somehow, I knew almost every one in the movie.

"Just like ABBA's music, you'll either really like or just hate this movie.","Right after having seen this movie I still feel like I could go either way on it. I could completely pick this movie apart and blast it for its silly story, weak directing and whatever more but truth is that this movie is simply harmless fun, that you can either hate on or just surrender yourself to.Maybe it will also depend on your mood on how you'll see this movie. Guess I was in the right mood, since I'm really willing to give this movie the benefit of the doubt.It's a true happy-go-lucky and cheerful looking movie, that you obviously shouldn't take very seriously. I see this movie as basically a great one to have a fun time with and for a while makes you forget everything you might had on your mind.Don't tell anybody else but sometimes I can be quite fond of ABBA music, so I was never opposed to the idea of a musical movie featuring most of the ABBA evergreens. As a matter of fact, I though it was a great idea! So how did it work out in the movie? Only half successfully I feel. They were of course very depended on already existing songs, that were never supposed to be part of one big musical or movie in this case. Some songs fit really well into the movie, while others seem a bit forced in and actually have very little to do with what is happening on the screen.It also was quite annoying and weird at times how fast some of the songs were following each other. There are moments in the movie that they perform 3 musical numbers in a row, without a real break between them. That's just crazy! Even for normal musical movie standards. It also seems like more songs got crammed in as the movie was heading toward its ending. It was like the movie was saying in its first half; here we set up the story and characters and in the second half; here we can go crazy with all of the songs and forget all about the story!Overall the songs are all performed quite well, even though the choreography, for musical standards, isn't really anything impressive to look at. I'm also afraid not all of the actors had the best singing voices. I really like Stellan Skarsgård, Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth and all but the movie should had never allowed them to sing! Sorry to say but their talents obviously lay elsewhere. Luckily the female cast seemed to have less problems with this and also luckily they are the ones that do most of the singing in this movie.I really can see and understand that this is not a great movie by any means but it's nevertheless perfectly fun and harmless to watch, if you're in the right mood and can handle the funky Swedish sounds of the ABBA music.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Serves it purpose,"With musicals on stage coming out left, right and centre it was no surprise that they would start to put them back into film. With the recent Sweeney Todd film setting the standard for musicals, the Abba musical had a lot to live up to. To start with this was not going to be artful masterpiece that Tim Burton created, this was going to be a feel good movie that was designed to entertain. For this it works, however the story behind this film is quite simply terrible, and the singing isn't up to the standard of the likes of Chicago. Julie Walters and Meryl Streep steal the show completely, they're worth watching and Streep's version of ""The winner takes it all"" is stunning.The film is a sure hit with women and most gay men, but won't satisfy the needs of most film lovers.

"My, My What A Movie!!!","Being such a huge ABBA fan, I went with my WHOLE family - there were 13 of us (plus kids) and we all had a really good time.What impressed me about the movie is that Phyllida Lloyd is a brilliant director - I guess cause she now knows the musical backwards! She has kept the movie at a lively pace that it's never boring. I really don't get what all the complaints are about. She did a great job! Period.Meryl is wonderful. Fantastic in her role as Donna. I liked Pierce's singing voice as it lends a kind of seriousness to what he was conveying to Donna in ""SOS"". And in ""When All Is Said And Done"" the setting is just so wonderful. Julie Walters is so hilarious...and how come no one talks about Christine Baranski's eye-popping splits in ""Does Your Mother Know""! Amazing! The ABBA songs doesn't feel forced at all as some critics foolishly argue. Catherine Johnson's story is simple and I believe the whole team knew that the ABBA songs were going to be the star and the crowd-puller.Of course I wished some ABBA songs were written in the movie like ""One Man, One Woman"", ""As Good As New"" or ""If It Wasn't For The Nights""...but then it would make for a 3 hour movie! I won't complain!!! The movie's general release here in Malaysia is Sept 25 but they usually have sneak previews one week earlier. Overall I'd say the crowd was mixed - males and females almost equal in number, mostly over 30s and it was like everyone knew the songs, laughed at the right spots (well, most of the time anyway!), tapped their feet and some were even bobbing their heads!

Greece.  Abba.  Meyrl Streep and Amanda Seyfried.  What else could you ask for?,"""Mamma Mia!"" may not be the best musical of this decade, but it certainly is one of the funnest. After an action laden summer with ""Iron Man,"" ""Indy Jones 4,"" ""Wanted,"" and ""Hancock,"" it's nice to see at least one film without stunts but dances, and with without special effects but songs. Director Phyllida Lloyd has fashioned ""Mamma Mia!"" more in tune with its stage counterpart; the cutting isn't so fast (so you can focus more on each individual shot) and, like the musical, has a big encore at the end featuring all of the major characters in tight spandex (that alone is worth the price of admission). The result is a lot of bright, feel-good fun and a bunch of ABBA hits to go along with it.The plot is ridiculously easy to follow (not that it matters much anyway). 20-year-old Sophie (Seyfried) is about to be married to Sky (Dominic Cooper), but wants her dad to give her away. Upon reading her mom's (Meyrl Streep) journal, she learns that she has three possible dads (Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard, and Colin Firth). When they arrive on the island, expected complications ensue.Both Streep and Seyfried are the standouts of this movie. Streep moves with such agility and energy you'll be surprised that she still has it all in her at 50+ years. She's also quite funny and, in one scene with Pierce Brosnan, she steals the show with ""The Winner Takes it All"" by putting some real, genuine emotion into her performance. Seyfried is a surprising find; I'll admit, after watching ""Mean Girls,"" I never thought she'd make for such a great singing lead! But great she is; her voice sounds wonderful and she's easy on the eyes too. Both Streep and Seyfriend do a good job acting too.As for the rest of the cast, both Christina Baranski and Julie Walters steal scenes with ""Does your mother know"" and ""Take a chance of me."" (respectively) And yes, the rumors are true, Pierce Brosnan sounds very un-Pierce Brosnanish when he sings (but its fun watching him try anyway- at least he can act well). Skarsgard and Firth do relatively well with their roles to, as does Dominic Cooper.The choreography is good, and the cinematography is easy to watch. As said before, the director fashions this a little more on the Broadway side, so if you're looking for something insightful or enthralling like last year's ""Sweeney Todd,"" you've come to the wrong place. This musical is nothing more than fun, fun, fun. In a summer season so dominated by ""blockbuster"" pictures, take a chance (quite literally) on this movie. It's better than you think, and its 107 minutes of your time that you will enjoy a lot.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Every actor played very well and sang very well as well. I went to this movie because of the famous group called ABBA. They are my parents idol. They said that when they were young, they listened to their songs almost every day. So when the movie is shown in the theater we rushed to it.

A Wonderfully Entertaining and Uplifting Musical,"Mamma Mia! What more needs to be said? In the latest Broadway-to-film adaptation to hit theaters, Meryl Streep stars as Donna, whose daughter, Sophie, has discovered all three of her possible fathers by reading her mother's diary and has now invited all three to her Greek Island Wedding. From the first moment 'Mamma Mia!' starts you know you're in for a unique and uplifting experience, and the film does not disappoint that expectation. Full of catchy pop songs and fun choreography, this is one musical that embraces its flamboyance for all it's worth- and comes out the better for it.The cast is all having a great time and it shows. Meryl Streep turns in yet another wonderfully entertaining performance and creates a character unlike anything we've ever seen from her before. Her Donna is a heroine for middle-aged women everywhere, a funny, saucy, and utterly lovable mom. Then there's Donna's two best friends played to comedic brilliance by Christine Baranski and Julie Walters. Any moment those two appear on screen you know is gonna be great. Amanda Seyfried also turns in a fine performance in her first semi-leading role as Sophie, and her ""fathers"" (Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, and Stellan Skarsgard) all deserve praise for committing to such a different project for all of them.I'm sure that there will be many people who will refuse to enjoy 'Mamma Mia!' and find it over-the-top, silly, and utterly cheerful. But if you open your mind and let yourself give in to the infectious happiness radiating from the screen you're in for a wonderful ride. It is over-the-top, silly, and utterly cheerful; it's also utterly entertaining and enjoyable. Mamma Mia indeed! How can I resist ya??? 8/10 stars!Jay Addison",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I enjoyed to watch this movie with one of my best friends, both of us are married and have family, we shared a little space of time for going to the movies and have a good time with Mamma Mia, we sang, we laughed and we also remembered wonderful times with those timeless songs of Abba.

"Halfway through ""The Winner Takes it All"", my resistance finally died","Don't get me wrong. This is a bad film. The plot is poor and badly carried out. Some of the songs are appalling. Pierce Brosnan cannot sing at all. Colin Firth struggles. Story lines pop out of nowhere. In short, it's badly written, badly directed and has some of the worst singing ever heard in a cinema.I had spent quite a lot of the film with my head in my hands as the awfulness just flooded off the screen. And then, halfway through ""The Winner Takes it All"", with Meryl Streep delivering the lyrics as if it were the ""To be, or not to be"" of musicals, I suddenly had a realisation. ""Oh dear"", I thought, ""it's all gone right"".That is about two-thirds of the way through the film which leaves you smiling by virtue of the fact that it's done with such a great deal of fun that some of it is bound to rub off on you. If you have no affection for Abba then you will be in trouble but if you do there is fun to be had.And it's not all bad. The aforementioned Streep is excellent as Donna, belting the songs out with gusto and clearly having a lot of fun. Brosnan's singing has to be heard to be believed but other than that he's fine. Stellan Skarsgaard's is as good as ever, whilst Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are as entertaining as ever.But it is a bad film, a very bad film. But, almost because of its awfulness, it's actually a good way to spend a couple of hours. This joins the very large category of films that are absolutely terrible, but wonderfully enjoyable.N.B.

I did not expect much, which usually means I get more than I bargained for. But 'Mamma Mia' - utter, utter cr**. I like ABBA, I like the songs, I have the old LPs. But this film is just terrible. The stage show looks like a bit of a musical, but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another, no characterisation, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the DVD) are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen, the dance chorus of north Europeans appear on a small Greek island at will, while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced Cliff Richard's musicals in the sixties!Meryl (see me I'm acting)Streep can't even make her usual mugging effective in an over-the-top musical!

Pales in comparison to the stage production,"I have seen Mama Mia twice on stage, and it is one of my favorite musicals, so I could barely wait to get to the theater to see it as a full feature film. Unfortunately, the movie was quite disappointing to say the least. I felt the casting of the characters was weak and poorly represented the characters as originally written. Donna was always portrayed as spunky and attractive though overworked and exhausted, and Meryl Streep just didn't have that ""umph"" to her. Pierce Brosnan had the look of Sam, but his singing was terrible. When adapting a musical to the big screen, quality of singing voice should be given more consideration. There are so many amazing actors with phenomenal voices, I can't understand why they didn't cast a little more carefully. There were also songs from the stage production that were not included in the movie including my favorite, ""Thank you for the Music"". I kept waiting for it to be thrown in somewhere along the way, but it was not included at all. While I wouldn't say the movie was terrible, I think if you have seen it live on stage, prepare to be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

ABBA songs thrown randomly into a movie and sung by people who should never attempt to sing does not a musical make.

It should have been called ""I'm a mindless, immature girl who idolizes my mother for being an addlepated tramp"". I'll admit I'm not a fan of Meryl Streep, but watching her over-act and fumble her way through this was painful. Actually, watching everyone in this was painful; even the usually good actors failed miserably. The whole production came off as if done by toddlers; the script was awful, the story was awful, the camera work was awful, the acting, singing and dancing was awful.

"A great, fun movie if you like musicals","Critics have panned this movie pretty badly, but who cares??? I read one critic complain about lack of character development and a cohesive plot. Plot??? Who cares! It's an ABBA musical! That's what you go for. It wasn't made to be an Oscar winning masterpiece. It was made to be fun and on that, it delivers - very well. If you are in the mood for a fun movie with zero violence, low profanity (if any), then this is it. Be warned, there are a few sexual innuendos that might not be suitable for pre-teens, but would fly over the heads of under 8's or so.Things I liked: * It was just downright fun. It was cheesy as can be, and you just have to go with it, and then you'll have a blast. * The music was great, of course, assuming you like ABBA. * Meryl Streep can flat out sing - I was extremely impressed by her rendition of ""The Winner Takes it All"". * All the actors played the over the top campy cheesy style very very well. * Shot in Greece - scenery alone is worth the movie admission. * No violence and I didn't notice any profanity (not that I'm against it - I plan to see Batman next, but it was a refreshing change of pace). * You laugh a lot. Sometimes at the story, which most people will know, sometimes at the movie itself and it's high degree of camp. * The end - it's done exactly like the musical - and it's hilarious. * The entire theater was singing at the end and there was a huge applause - when was that last time you saw that in a movie theater???What I didn't like: * There is one scene with Meryl Streep driving where the backdrop is clearly a movie - the steering wheel turns don't match the direction of the car so well. * Pierce Brosnan's solos. He was very good in the movie as an actor, and my wife enjoyed the beefcake, but he has very limited singing skills. The director should have worked past this by having him backed up by other men which could have compensated for his lack of skills. * You have to let yourself go. It's totally unbelievable. It's totally campy, and if you can't let yourself go, you won't like it. If you aren't an ABBA fan or didn't enjoy the musical on stage if you saw it, this movie is clearly not for you.As a closing, I was really impressed with how much fun the actors seemed to be having. I think being on the production crew for that movie would have been a blast. You could tell that the making of the movie was pure fun. They were in an exotic location and it looked like most of them had been drinking all day and night before the shoots, hanging out, and having a good time. That certainly added to its charm.",,Anonymous,Romance
Bollywood-Style Jukebox Musical Benefits from Streep and a Game Cast,"Let's face it. If Meryl Streep was cast in a Fruit of the Loom commercial, she would still be the standout piece of produce, lending conviction to a one-dimensional part others would easily dismiss as too superficial. That's the way to view this ebullient, featherweight 2008 confection based on the long-running jukebox musical from the prolific songbook of 1970's super-pop group ABBA, all of which were written by bandmates Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus. Even though there is barely a part there, Streep throws herself into Donna like it was Sophie Zawistowski, Karen Blixen, or Miranda Priestly. She also gets to perform the lioness' share of the over two dozen songs that drive the flimsy, derivative storyline over its 108-minute running time. If you've ever seen an underrated 1968 Gina Lollobrigida farce called ""Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell"", you'll recognize the plot straight away since it pilfers the same basic idea.This time, we are focused on the upcoming nuptials for Sophie, the beautiful twenty-year-old daughter of Donna, a resourceful hippie-chick who runs a dilapidated inn on a stunning Greek island. To make the chronology work, the story, one can assume, is set sometime in the late 1990's as Donna apparently led a hedonistic lifestyle in the late 1970's when she became pregnant while fronting a girl-group called Donna and the Dynamos. This becomes pertinent because Sophie's paternity is a big question mark, which is about to be answered because Sophie clandestinely invites the three men who could possibly be her father to her wedding - staid British banker Harry, adventurous Swedish travel writer Bill, and divorced architect Sam. The inevitable complications ensue when all three show up on the idyllic island, each coming to the conclusion that he is indeed Sophie's father. Meanwhile, Donna invites the Dynamos - now best-selling cookbook author Rosie and multiple-married, cosmetically altered Tanya.Add Sophie's intended, a hunky beach boy named Sky and his equally tanned and toned pals, as well as her two giggly bridesmaids and a rhythmic chorus of Greek villagers - and you indeed have a musical revue for anyone in the mood for one. At the same time, that's the caveat because you have to love ABBA's music to be enthralled by a movie riddled with flaws. The pacing often feels off, especially when characters belabor their individual dilemmas ad nauseam. Some of the choreography in the production numbers feels amateurish, and the cinematography frequently looks washed out (Streep looks particularly pasty and red-eyed in certain scenes). These lapses probably have to do with the arguable decision to have the Broadway crew of producer Judy Craymer, writer Catherine Johnson, and director Phyllida Lloyd translate all this to the screen, none of whom have any significant film-making experience. Perhaps a Rob Marshall could have lent a more polished sheen to the proceedings, but then again, there is a certain camp value that makes you wonder whether the whole venture is meant to be a parody of a good musical. Note the energetic ""Dancing Queen"" number which feels like a Bollywood production number with all the village women parading down to the dock in exaggerated unison.In the end, I guess it doesn't matter since a game cast has been recruited to make it all work at the intended level of fun. Streep shines without peer and sings with supple conviction on lighthearted ditties like the title tune and ""Money, Money, Money"", as well as the more emotive ballads like ""Slipping Through My Fingers"" and ""The Winner Takes It All"". She can't help Pierce Brosnan who duets with her sounding like a wounded cow on ""S.O.S."" (The audience erupted in laughter whenever he sang). However, he regains some of his self-respect when he plays Sam straight-up. The other two actors - Stellan Skarsgård as Bill and the omnipresent Colin Firth as Harry  are also likable though hardly challenged in their roles. Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya perform petty larceny in stealing their scenes, especially in their specialty numbers. As the hopeful Sophie, bright-eyed Amanda Seyfried is sweet without being cloying and has a bell-like voice which she shows off well on the bookend anthem, ""I Have a Dream"". The climactic wedding party scene is like watching news footage of Sydney's Mardi Gras festivities, while the end credits flash on a karaoke reprise of ""Dancing Queen"" complete in Vegas drag-queen regalia followed by a funny encore of ""Waterloo"" (my personal favorite in the ABBA songbook). Go at your own riskyou may love it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Frivolous fun!,"Okay, so here we have an entirely implausible storyline shaped into unashamedly enjoyable cinema experience. Personally, I hate going to movies, just because they are so expensive these days. I went to see this one twice... People in the audience were laughing out loud, clapping and enjoying themselves. Isn't that what we go to the movies for, to be entertained? Admittedly, Pierce Brosnan can't sing... so what? He was a ton of fun. The leading ladies (Streep, Walters and Baranski) seemed to be having such a good time... there is not much sexier than mature women having fun and being the mature women they are... The characters looked and acted seasoned, which was quite refreshing.I can't wait for the DVD with the outtakes...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cotton candy no good for tummy but sometimes good for heart,"I never saw ""Mamma Mia!"", the play. Never cared one way or the other about ABBA -- though I did enjoy how neatly their music fit ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert."" And I understand that in a musical, all you need in the way of a story is just enough to link the production numbers. So I wasn't planning to go see this movie -- until I saw not only was Meryl Streep in it but also Colin Firth and Christine Baranski and Julie Walters and Stellan Skarsgard, and I'm thinking this'll either be a major train wreck or glorious fun.The story's simple -- as it should be. Girl lives on fantasy island but don't know who daddy is. Invites three likely candidates to her wedding but doesn't tell mom. All three come and chaos ensues...along with big production numbers and lots of joy and laughter after all the tears.Well -- it wasn't glorious fun, but I left the theater smiling and humming the music. And that's despite Phyllida Lloyd's nearly catastrophic turn as director. Who the hell decided just because somebody's directed a play on a stage they know how to direct a movie? Her clumsiness came damn close to ruining the film...as did the editor, who really must have been on coke at the time or else has a major case of ADD. I think it works better for a musical if you can see the numbers come together as all of a piece and not four-thousand, three-hundred and fifty seven different pieces, like they do on music videos.But -- and this is the film's saving grace -- the actors barreled right over Ms. Lloyd's mistakes and blasted through the jittery editing to provide performances that can be intoxicating. Meryl was fun and sexy and actually decent as a singer, and Christine and Julie backed her up, bigtime, in the musical numbers -- turning ""Dancin' Queen"" into an anthem of GRRL power and memories of youth was beautiful. I was shocked at Pierce Brosnan's tinny voice; he's Irish, for pity's sake, and don't ALL Irishmen sing beautifully? But he has charisma to spare and his charm made up for it. Same for Colin Firth and Stellan in thankless roles. It shows what not only talent but experience and professionalism can do with a bad script and characterizations. Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper -- they're pretty and have nice voices, but they still have a lot to learn about commanding a screen.Overall, however, this was a pleasant experience and I did not want any part of my $12 back. It was like going to a carnival and seeing all the sights and eating too much popcorn and cotton candy and getting a bit of a tummy ache...but having had a joyous time of it all, considering. If you go in with that expectation, you'll have fun, as well.But there's no way ANYBODY'S ever gonna say this is in the same league as ""Singin' In The Rain.""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Infectious Fun,"In my mind, this movie had a lot of negatives to overcome: Christine Baranski, Meryl Streep singing, a cast that didn't exactly scream ""hit"", ...the music of ABBA, for pete's sake! But as difficult as it is to say, I'll say it.... I am a heterosexual male, and I enjoyed Mamma Mia!There's plenty to like - Amanda Seyfried's infectious joy (and beauty), the stunning Greek isle scenery, and yes, the music. It won me over practically from the start. The positives far outweighed the negatives - in fact, the negatives turned out not to be.Abba's music never did much for me as pop songs, but in the context of a musical, they work quite well. There are a couple numbers I think could have been left out, specifically Baranski's ""Does Your Mother Know"" and Streep and Brosnan's ""Winner Takes It All"", but even those weren't bad. The singing is good pretty much across the board. Even the weakest singer, Pierce Brosnan, did a surprisingly good job. His voice has a certain Peter Gabriel quality to it (with a dash of Randy Newman).For those friends of mine that refuse to see anything not considered a ""manly"" movie (and you know who you are), skip it. But for everyone else, take a chance on Mamma Mia. You may find yourself tapping your toes and smiling along.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Should have been a lot better,"I love Abba's music, and looked forward to this movie - what a let down! The movie makers here were just out to make a fast buck, and don't have a single clue as to the reason for Abba's popularity.They created a story to cram the songs into, instead of the obvious - make a movie celebrating the wonder and pleasure so many have got from listening to Abba's music.Don't get me wrong, a movie with Abba music from start to finish, can't fail to entertain, but this movie has been done in such a back-handed amateurish way, you can tell all involved didn't care a toss.The sound sucked, the actors were all to old, Abba were not in their 50's in their heyday, so why on Earth are the actors singing so ancient?The storyline is NOT the reason folk will go to see Mamma Mia! The main point is this movie could, no SHOULD have been done so much better.But obviously - not by these dolts!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mamma Mia - Chaotic and Absurd,"I probably saw the trailer more than a dozen times and randomly saw the movie last night. Well, it sucked. It was bordering on absurd. And I've never felt this horrible about a movie in a long time.""Mamma Mia"" was artificial and downright contrived  there was no flow with the story, the songs were hardly relevant to the situations, and the song numbers were so unnecessarily long (take ""The Winner Takes It All"" for instance.) There was hardly any conflict  just a lot of miscommunication. It was like a lengthy and overly-acted music video of sorts.Meryl Streep acted so awkward, over-the-top and crazy, especially during that ""Mamma Mia"" song performance. I didn't enjoy listening to Pierce Brosnan sing and even Julie Walters was just too corny for my taste. Amanda Seyfried, Colin Firth and the movie location were the only saving graces of the film.I don't know how such big names managed to be pulled to doing such a crappy project. Really. I hope they had fun doing it at the least. Maybe the stage musical is a lot better but I still can't imagine anything praise-worthy coming out of such a pretentious concept. Then again, I don't know, maybe I just totally missed whatever it was they wanted to portray.Okay, so I'm completely bashing the film because I certainly hardly enjoyed it, but who knows, maybe die-hard ABBA fans would.

Feel Good Movie of the Year,"No this is not a great movie I wasn't expecting it to be. But if you want to enjoy yourself and have fun this is the movie to see. The music is catchy and great and the performances campy and over the top but who cares. It has to be. Meryl Streep, Christina Baranski, and Julie Walters are awesome. I loved them all. Pierce needs some singing help but who cares. He plays it campy as heck as does Colin. They are both great.This movie is great fun and I can't believe all the people and critics complaining about the lame plot and lack of character development, This is Mama Mia what the heck. It's fast paced and fun. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really fun  and Worth the price of admission,"We really enjoyed this film because we are big fans of ABBA, Mamma Mia, Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Julie Waters, Christine Baranski and Pierce Brosnan. The dancing and acting was top notch, but as expected the bride and groom, and MS Baranski were by far the best singers. No one really expected the rest of the cast to be professional singers. The older generation was a bit too old to fit the story line and it was probably a mistake to mention the internet in one scene and then show pictures of a hippy past in the next. But the beauty of Mamma Mia is that the quality of the music is such that the next door neighbors could perform it and the audience would still be dancing in the aisles.The stand out character in this film (aside from the Music) was of course the Greek Isles and the Blue Med. The location and the cinematography was FANTASTIC.You need to see this movie in the theater with big screen and the high quality sound system. It was a lot of fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't believe the hype,"Really, don't believe the hype. This film is really a major disappointment. I wasn't particularly looking forward to it but was prepared to be pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately my scepticism was entirely justified. What on earth was Meryl Streep thinking of? To say nothing of Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgaerd and Julie Walters.The only saving graces which cause me to give it the frankly generous 4/10 are the scenery (1 star), the original songs (1 star), and the excellent dance with flippers on the jetty (2 stars) which was absolutely the only point in the film where I actually laughed.Streep just about gets away with her singing. Pierce Brosnan was embarrassing and I think I need therapy to get over Colin Firth sitting on a boat and strumming a guitar singing a soppy song.I am so pleased that I didn't pay to see this. Do yourself a favour and watch something worthwhile. I would prefer the 'Sound of Music' frankly.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's hard not to be drawn in by this film!!,I heard a cynical reviewer give Mamma Mia a good review and I was intrigued to see whether the film could work the same trick on me. This is the sort of film that I'd generally hate. I'm really into intelligent films that make the viewer think. You couldn't get a film that's further from this genre than Mamma Mia. The plot consists of a soon to be bride trying to work out who is her father from three possible candidates that she discovers from her mothers diary. She invites all three to the wedding in order to find out who her father is. That's it in terms of plot.The film uses the songs of Abba as a backdrop and all of the characters launch into renditions of the Abba songs at regular intervals. It's one of the most ridiculously cheerful movies I've seen and the camp/crass levels of the film are off the scale! The amazing thing is that even though the singing ranges from average to appalling (Brosnan has to be heard to be believed) you can't help tapping along and loving every minute by the end of the film.At some point in the future I may well be ashamed of my score/review and come back to make changes. The truth is though that even though the only thing I'll remember in the long run is how awful Brosnan was at singing the other thing that will lodge in the memory is how feel good the movie was. To make my life harder in the future I give this film eight out of ten!!,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Good,"Mamma Mia is not your typical ""female"" movie. It is a nice, refreshing film that is a lot of fun to watch. It does not have the typical female movie aspects of two horrible characters you cannot stand (As Good As It Gets) or two characters who despise each other yet somehow get together (Message in a Bottle)--it is an old time romantic musical that intelligently brings the aspects of Abba's music into the storyline. The characters are portrayed very well, though a few of them are not the greatest singers. The storyline is well thought out and written. The direction is well paced and nicely done. The scenery is gorgeous and adds to the story. It is an overall nice film that you can sit down with the family and watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Oh dear.........,"Just got back from an afternoon screening of this film. Even though the film has been showing for almost three weeks now, the cinema was PACKED with (mostly) over 50s. Firstly, I am a HUGE fan of ABBA (have been since the early 70s, even before their Eurovision win) and I so wanted to enjoy this film but I'm afraid that I felt like watching it with my hands covering my face and peeking through my fingers, such was my embarrassment! Overacted to the extreme by all concerned it is truly cringeworthy. The dreadful Julie Walters was the usual awful hammy, mugging Mrs. Overall persona that she always is (you may have guessed that I can't STAND this particular 'national treasure'.I really had to force myself to go to see it knowing that this ghastly woman was in it.) The music is actually tolerably sung by most of the cast (with the exception of Pierce Brosnan) but the 'OMG' hystrionics of the actors to show that they are having 'fun' is just appalling. Incidentally, not one person in the cinema laughed at the 'funny' bits. All in all, a miscast (the leads were WAY too old) misfire and one that any discerning cinema goer will find poor.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fun! Fun! Fun!,"I have a difficult time imagining anyone not being uplifted by this movie, if only for the music. I was 17 yrs old when ""Dancing Queen"" was popular on the radio, so of course, this movie would appeal to me. But my daughters (ages 20, 16 and 14) all enjoyed it as well. Even my husband, who really isn't a fan of musicals, didn't complain about this film (I dragged him to it on our anniversary - the film's opening day).I get a kick out of all the people that come on this board to bash this movie when clearly they don't like musicals by their own admission. That would be like me critiquing a horror film - I despise horror films so it would be hard for me to find anything redeeming about one. So why people insist on seeing a film in a genre that they knowingly do not like or appreciate, and then proceed to criticize it, is beyond me! Anyway, regarding the movie - Here's the good: 1) The location and cinematography - absolutely breathtaking! It makes a person want to seriously consider Greece as their next vacation destination. I'm sure the Board of Tourism in Greece couldn't be happier with this film. 2) Singing talent - while many have roundly criticized the choices for the leads in this film, I find the fact that Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan and a few others aren't trained singers rather endearing. In fact, I found Meryl Streep's rendition of ""Slipping Through My Fingers"" more emotional than any stage version I've seen and even the original song. And to improve upon Agnetha Faltskog's voice/version is a tall order indeed! The young actor/singer who plays Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is beautiful and has a lovely, angelic voice. Visually, she is a believable casting choice to play Meryl Streep's daughter and I thought they had good on-screen mother-daughter chemistry. 3) The Plot - Yes, it's thin and silly and frothy, but that's what makes it so fun! I mean, think about it. Any time you watch a musical, you have to suspend disbelief. When in real life does anyone ever belt out a song and dance in the middle of a conversation (with backup singers to boot)? And besides, who amongst any of this film's viewers doesn't know and understand the fact that this plot was created from stringing a number of unrelated ABBA tunes together? Since the process of matching music to the plot is reversed from the normal way, I'm amazed that they were able to create as cohesive a story as they did. 4) The dancing bachelor party boys - Yea! the film left the flipper-flaunting boys (from the stage version) in the scene for ""Lay All Your Love on Me"". I looked around the theater when the boys first appeared and I couldn't find a single person who was not laughing or at least grinning from ear to ear!With the good, comes the bad - 1) While overall I think Meryl Streep did a wonderful job, her rendition of ""The Winner Takes It All"" (the other tear-jerker song in this movie) will never allow me to listen to that song in quite the same way. Vocally, she was decent, but I'll forever be haunted by the odd hand gestures she made while singing it. The lyrics describing the breakup/betrayal are so powerful that perhaps closeups of Meryl's and Pierce's faces would have served that scene better than Meryl's over-emoting with her hands. I found the original video for the song on YouTube. In that video, the pain and anguish of the song were so beautifully conveyed by Agnetha Faltskog in just her eyes and facial expressions - no awkward hand gestures needed! 2) While I applaud the inclusion of Pierce Brosnan in this film (it never hurts to have an attractive man on the screen), perhaps the roles for Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan could have been reversed. Pierce Brosnan's voice is clearly not awful or even cringe-inducing, but it's not a particularly strong voice, and as such is not really strong enough to carry the two songs (""SOS"" and ""When All is Said and Done"") that the role required. I could definitely have seen Pierce Brosnan singing ""Our Last Summer"" instead.To sum it up, if you like the music of ABBA and enjoy exuberant celebrations of life without the need to over-analyze every detail, then you'll enjoy this movie! If not, then choose a different movie.Not since Grease have I seen a musical that's as much fun to watch as it must have been to make!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
My my how can I resist it? Quite easily actually....,"As the last strains of Waterloo eventually faded away I was to stay in my comfy chair for quite a while numb and trying to bring back to life my facility for objective criticism. What can possibly be said about Mamma Mia other than to recall Lord Reith who once said ""He who prides himself on giving what he thinks the public wants is often creating a fictitious demand for low standards which he will then satisfy"". That this DVD is what the public wants is not in dispute.But will this truly abysmal film now create a run on of ""fictitious demand"" as Hollywood rushes to copy it  well don't hold your breath.Of course objective criticism is a bit of a waste of time as those of us who think that good Cinema should at least be about films having a decent plot, well cast actors and decent production and direction may soon be in a minority. Those of us who suggest that on the evidence of the success of Mamma Mia that it is final proof of the maxim that nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the public are likely to be seen as elitist killjoys. Well so be it  I'm not going to dilute my crucial faculties just because the public votes with its feet and its money to crown Mamma Mia as worthwhile entertainment. Never mind the quality feel the width of the box office takings! But, for what its worth  and that's probably not much, here is a brief list of the reasons why Mamma Mia is such excreta. The plot is trivial, unbelievable, ill-constructed, offensive and just plain dull. The casting is dire. True Meryl Streep is wonderful  but when has she ever not been? But Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth are wooden throughout and they can't sing  and no this is not irony or even remotely funny. It's a MUSICAL. The leads must be able to sing. Doh! Amanda Seyfried can sing and she's very pretty too. But what about those bloody teeth? Sorry this may be a bit from left field but why would a nice little 20 year-old have to have shining white and 100% artificial looking brilliant white teeth. It made her look like an American Ryder Cup wife for goodness sake! Stellan Skarsgard (who?) was dull and he couldn't sing either. Julie Waters gave us one of her batty old ladies  we've seen it before Jules and it made no sense in Mamma bloody Mia. Christine Baranski was good  almost in the Streep class but surely a film with this budget could have cast all of the principals rather more thoughtfully? The editing was woeful as well. There seemed to be a good few gaffes that should have been edited out and reshot  did nobody care or not think that we'd notice when an actor forgets their lines? And was that set meant to look realistic  or the extras look like real people? Maybe not. And maybe on stage it wouldn't matter. But it wasn't on stage  it's a movie! Musical Theatre only really transfers well to film when it is opened out. Think ""Sound of Music"" or ""Carousel"" or ""My Fair Lady"". Mamma Mia was claustrophobic despite the stock shots of the Aegean. It looked more like Pinewood. It was Pinewood! OK so ABBA write catchy songs and we all like occasionally to hum along with them. But why put them into a stage show with a supposed plot in the first place. Why not just perform them as song and dance in concert? And if you must try and make a facile piece of drama around a random collection of songs and put it on stage then please don't later think that it will make a film. But you have  and a few rich people have become even richer as a result. And the Cinema is the poorer for it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Plot is very basic and the characters and/or performances are mostly ridiculous. Julie Walters' character has to be one of the most irritating in cinematic history.So bad I can't believe great actors like Meryl Streep, Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan agreed to appear in this.What prevents this from being a total cringefest and bore is the music. (Well, most of it - some of it isn't great - depends on the singer - see later). Just the fact that the music was originally by ABBA creates a large sense of nostalgia (well, with me, at least). Plus, the original songs are great. In the movie, they're generally good, but there are a few exceptions. Pierce Brosnan really shouldn't sing, yet he does, and on more than one song...The only other plus is Amanda Seyfried. Great performance by her - charming, sweet and engaging.

"Big, loud, silly and wonderful","Here's the thing.There are no vocalists in ""Mamma Mia!"" anywhere near as good as the ABBA girls, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha Fältskog.

Really brilliant. Such a crowd pleaser. An exuberant, energetic, sparking musical, full of timeless songs and a cast (step forward Meryl Streep) who attack their roles with true gusto. Big, loud, silly and wonderful. As bright and camp as Graham Norton and Dale Winton on a night out. Look in any dictionary under the phrase 'Feelgood Movie' and you will see ""Mamma Mia!"" writ large. They should prescribe ""Mamma Mia!"" on the National Health.

"Could be better, but not a total failure either","I have read many reviews that completely despise this film and I think that that is unfair. This film wasn't great, and it had so much potential that was foolishly squandered, but it was quite nice all the same.I have heard several people refer to it as a 'girly' piece, and I, for the most part, agree. There seems to be two main characters and their respective story lines: a mother worrying about her daughters wedding and about the three guests, all of whom might be the father (it's a bit hard to explain), and the daughter trying to find out about her father. The mother has two friends (rather well played) who help her out in these situations while engaging in casual fun of their own while staying on the mother's island.The acting was a mix of great and disappointing. Meryl Streep, contrary to popular opinion, can sing quite well, and her performance of 'The winner takes it all' was quite emotional and apt, albeit slightly mistranslated. The daughter (played by the rather charming Amanda Seyfried) sang quite well and gave across at times the energy of an already active young woman right before her wedding, and her desperation as things go wrong when she is trying to find out who her father is. The singing was actually one of the better parts in the movie, but I think that Pierce Brosnan, while being a fairly good actor, needs singing lessons.Brosnan's singing was the largest flop in this movie. Apart from that, many would say that the plot is cheesy, the ending lame, and that the entire plot is simply an excuse to sing. I would agree with that, but the only really misplaced song I saw was 'Money, money, money', which was placed out of nowhere and had nothing to do with the plot. The plot is rather cheesy, and the ending was, if not lame, then lacking, but I believe that the movie doesn't need a magnificent plot or a mind-blowing ending. And the ABBA songs were changed quite a lot, but I had no complaints to the changes that were made (although they left out my personal favorite 'One of us'). Oh well.All in all, a rather nice movie to watch when you have spare time. This is what got me re-interested in ABBA songs. I give Mamma Mia... 7.1. That's a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of those half-mad stage ideas which makes for a predictably dreadful film...,"'Perky' times two thousand... Ecstatic young woman on the Greek island of Kalokairi, living in the ramshackle hotel owned by her single mother, invites three strange men to her upcoming wedding--all of whom shared intimate nights with her mom some twenty years ago, resulting in her conception. So the big question is: which of the trio is the girl's biological father? And when will the prospective bride admit she stole her mother's diary and invited these lackluster would-be dads without mamma's permission? Unctuous, fatuous movie-adaptation of the international stage musical, which utilizes pop songs from the oeuvre of Swedish super-group ABBA to create its reedy-thin 'plot'. ABBA truly did record some beautifully-crafted, catchy and imaginative hits in the late-'70s, but the music as rendered here seems plastic and useless. Meryl Streep, with no character to play, hams it up; she's so professional and refined a presence that this not-inexplicably goofy approach just manages to squeak by, however her co-stars aren't so fortunate. As Streep's daughter, Amanda Seyfried bops around like a squealing teenager in a toothpaste commercial; by the time she and her fiancé are crawling towards each other on the beach singing ""Lay All Your Love On Me"", one is apt to make a mad dash for the exit. The picture is lousy, but it isn't offensive--it's far too innocuous and eager-to-please to be a complete debacle. To get angry over a movie like this would be pointless--it would be like flogging a sponge. The bloated production feasts on glittering aerial shots of the Greek isle, while the cast is continually directed to leap from boats and foot-bridges into the water.

I'm so happy.....,".....that my wife just borrowed the DVD from a neighbour for us to watch on a very wet winter evening, so we didn't spend a single cent on this utterly mind-numbing drivel. But for the fact that we had checked the running time in advance and seen that it was only about 100 minutes, I'd have totally lost the will to live, but I knew there would eventually be light at the end of the darkest of tunnels.Like a lot of contributors here I love musicals, both on stage and screen.

Mamma Mia- this is why we go to the movies!!,"Ignore all the critics dissing this film!! ""Mamma Mia"" is pure bliss, movie magic through and through. Dance your way to the nearest multiplex and see it! The cast is superb, I was especially taken with Amanda Seyfried as Sophie-she does quite well in the lead role as, of course does Meryl Streep-what can't this woman do?? Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are scene stealer's as Rosie and Tanya-Their individual musical numbers are hysterical!! Be warned though, the three men(Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) playing Sam, Harry and Bill do not sing very well, but thats part of their charm. They were obviously cast for their acting and the fact the characters do not sing well only adds to the fun! Dominic Cooper as Skye is a vocal revelation-he actually can carry a tune and is quite sexy to boot!! Listen , bottom line is this-""Mamma Mia"" will not be everyone's cup of tea-the local paper critic here gave it 1 star!! I don't know what movie he saw or what kinda crappy day he must of had beforehand, but this movie had the audience laughing, crying and cheering and a round of applause at the end!! All the reasons people go to the movies-simply put W O N D E R F U L !! My thanks to all involved-Great Fun!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
You don't have to an ABBA fan to enjoy this if you don't take it seriously,"This film was more enjoyable than I expected. I found it to be a lot of fun.Although I recognize ""Dancing Queen"" and ""Take A Chance On Me"" as big hits, I don't really know much about the singing group ABBA and the songs they wrote. According to the reviews of ""Mamma Mia,"" I shouldn't have liked this musical. But it was free on my cable TV so I thought I would watch a little to see for myself if it was as bad as some reviews said. After all, while Meryl Streep has been in occasional ""B"" movies (e.g., 1994's ""The River Wild""), her performances in her movies have all been worth watching.But despite all of its faults, and with the knowledge that the film is not meant to be taken seriously, I found I really enjoyed ""Mamma Mia."" As has already been described in other reviews, the plot (a girl, raised by a single mother (played by Meryl Streep), is about to be married and invites three men to the wedding to give her away on her belief that one of the three is her father) is merely a device on which to hang a number of Abba songs, not all of which have lyrics that are completely appropriate to the story. The fun is watching the mostly tongue-in-cheek performances. Meryl Streep did some singing in at least one of her previous films, but she really gets to show off her more than adequate singing ability in ""Mamma Mia."" Accompanying her as a trio are long time Broadway musical star and comedic actress Christine Baranski, and British actress/performer Julie Walters. The one star who seemed miscast as a singer was Pierce Brosnan.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Mama Mia, what have you done?","It's been a while since I've watched this awful piece of Hollywood trash, but I felt the need to contribute my point of view on why I believe Mamma Mia! is an overrated soap opera.I'll start by saying that I love ABBA. I've been a fan since my youth. Then, one day, I saw an ad on TV about this film, combining ABBA songs with a cast of actors I adore. Even though I'm not a fan of musicals (saying I generally dislike them would be an understatement), I thought, what the hell? So I watched it.I can only say that I was appalled. The first thing that hit me was the awful technicolor. It was too bright, almost like tripping on something. Then there was the singing dancing and... Acting (not that you can call it that). Meryl Streep (bless her soul) portrayed an unstable woman. And it wasn't even funny (!!!). How could she sink down like that? I was speechless. What were the directors thinking? To degrade her like that. I love her, I really do, but Meryl Streep can't sing. Or dance. And they made her do both.The other actors... Like Pierce Brosnan. Whose idea was it to give this man a singing role? He can't carry a tune. At all. It was a pain to watch.Then the plot... Predictable and boring. But one can live with that, right? I guess. But then they sang everything in the most horrible ways possible. It was fake, it was boring - a complete and utter flunk. A waste of time and sanity.Do yourself a favor and don't watch Mamma Mia! Go buy an ABBA CD and enjoy their music in its pure, delightful form.In the end, all this film has done was to (almost) ruin ABBA for me. I'll get over it one day, but it's a scar I have to bare now.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lighthearted and funny,"This movie, about a bride-to-be who is trying to find her real father told using hit songs by the popular 1970s group ABBA, is a good romance movie!It doesn't take itself too seriously. It seemed that much of the money was spent on a casting of popularity, but I think it was the right casting. Even Pierce Brosnan (as Sam Carmichael) because he I think he was awkwardly funny. The movie used a lot of ABBA's songs, and speaking of not taking itself seriously, I'm glad the the musical scenes had the same mindset. Amanda Seyfried (as Sophie Sheridan) has a fantastic voice, which was lovely to listen to, but when some of the other actors sang, it was awkward and entertaining. Despite little screen time, I especially liked Stellan Skarsgård (as Bill Anderson) and Julie Walters (as Rosie Mulligan) because I think they were really funny.I can imagine that the production had a lot of fun on set. I noticed that the general quality and the execution seemed very varied. Sometimes it was very on, and sometimes very off. Without knowing anything about the behind the scenes, my guess is that the movie was based on both pre-production and improvisations where they probably kept surprisingly many improvised scenes. However, I think those scenes helped to create that funny feeling in the simple and cliche story, and I had a good time watching the movie.In conclusion, despite its varying execution and reliance on popular casting, this lighthearted and funny movie, driven by ABBA's hit songs, delivers an enjoyable romantic experience. The mix of improvisation and pre-production choices adds to its charm, creating a humorous atmosphere that complements the simple yet clichéd storyline.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Razzle Dazzle 'Em and They Won't Notice It's Awful,"Hubby and I paid $4.99 to watch Mama Mia on Pay Per View last night and have decided we wasted $4. We're also grateful we didn't plunk down money on movie theatre tickets to see it. Thumbnail sketch of the film: A bunch of people with women's uncombed hair streaming and guys bare-chested (so's ya know they are 70's leftovers) run up and down the streets of a seaside village, singing. They are joined by happy peasants who also seem to know the song and the dance moves. The same bunch of people run up and down a pier singing a song that sounds like the first one, and end up in the water. The same bunch of people run around rocks and trees, singing a song that sounds like the first two. The same bunch of people run up and down the beach, singing a song that sounds like the first three. The same bunch of people run through a labyrinth of halls and rooms in some sort of seaside inn, singing a songyou get the idea by now. Three men visiting the seaside inn for a wedding run around the deck of a boat, singing for the bride-to-be, whom one of them has fathered years ago but not raised. The bride (omigosh!) ends up in the water. Who knew? The same bunch of people sit transfixed on the ground as three of them, ostensibly a female trio reunited for the wedding of one of their daughters, sing the songs that made them (in)famous.ABBA's songs are round-pegged into the square holes of the screenplay, with laughably awkward song cues that smack of a Broadway stage setting. I guess it might have worked on Broadway. As for the volume competition between the accompanying background music and the singers, final score is Instruments 10, Singers 0. Given the vapid nature of the lyrics, this is not necessarily a bad decision on the part of the film-makers. All the manic music in the film sounds alike--well, shoot it's ABBA for heavens sake--except for a nice ballad sung by Streep and the bride, her daughter. One of ABBA's best tunes, ""Fernando,"" was missing from the film. He probably died from a heart attack brought about by all that manic running, or maybe drowned off the boat or pier.The actress playing the daughter has expressions that run the gamut from upset to VERY upset. The most active parts of her anatomy were her frowning forehead and wild eyes. Pierce Brosnan delivers a miscast performance that makes you wonder if he's contemplating strangling his agent, or throwing him off a pier or a boat.I know that some commentators on IMDb thought the film was wonderful. ""Chacun son gout."" On the + side, Meryl Streep proves once again that she is a Protean actor who can really sing. Is there NO role this woman cannot play?",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Uplifting and feel-good experience,"I understand that movie critics do not see this movie as a masterpiece. Anyway this movie really stands as a movie that you want to watch especially if you like the great tradition of musicals and if are not embarrassed to share that you in fact like ABBA's music.I have a seen the theatre show and I thought it was an excellent idea to promote a story using a series of songs (by the way this is possible if you have an incredible number of hits that also have meaningful lyrics). The story has a simple thread but it is as well full of lessons on motherhood, daughter-hood, friendship and it is probably really for a female audience but in fact depict the typical failure of male commitment and the recovery of romance and forgiveness that is all about life and love.The movie follows up the steps of the show and it offers two hours of good spirit, great music, and at the end an uplifting and feel-good experience. I did not expect great actors to adapt well ... but in fact they did (Meryl Streep is really amazing and Julie Walters as much comparable). Yes we might not compare this to Singing in the Rain ... but given the fact we live in a very different world ... this is a musical of many generations and from my perspective a many times to see movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mama Mia:  a Glorious Mess,"The movie version of Mama Mia is almost but not quite a disaster. Despite a cast that was mostly nearly a generation too old, couldn't sing, and couldn't dance, the film mostly succeeded. The brilliant Meryl Streep was a lot of fun and could sing better than adequately, despite her nearly 60 years. The lovely Amanda Seyfreid was young enough and could sing, too. Also Christine Baranski proved that she is as funny as ever and has a nice singing voice.On to the not so good stuff. Although tasked with important songs, Pierce Brosnan was not up to that task. The guy just can't sing. Oddly, Colin Firth, who had much less to do musically was pretty good. The dancing was awful. It looked like what a group of friends at a bowling alley might try to do after 3 or 4 beers.Despite its shortcomings, Mama Mia is a lot of fun and its wonderful old Abba songs were often moving, thanks to a strong screenplay. Seeing the movie made me regret than I didn't have a chance to see the 2001 Broadway production.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
cinematic pimping,"To begin with, please understand that for this story to have any plausibility, the Meryl Streep character would have had to have slept with three guys all within about three days - either a guy a night or a four-way, or something like that. Pretty romantic, huh? But however good (or not) musically, certainly one major demographic of ABBA's original audience were those suburbanites and yuppies and former hippies who really did believe, at the time, that multiple partners were kind of romantic, and could enhance an ""open relationship"" with one's significant other: ABBA provided the soundtrack for many 'singles' bars' and 'swingers' parties. There are a lot of women of a certain age who really aren't quite certain who the fathers of their children are, thanks partly due to the thrilling sounds of ABBA.I don't agree with the recent reviewer who referred to the older women of this film as ""whores."" Men and women have the same right to the sexual expression and enjoyment of their choosing. What does disturb me in this film is two fold - that it romanticizes choices such as these and that it insists that somehow they represent progress - all the Greek women in the background appear suddenly enlightened by experiencing the dysfunctional sit-com/soap-opera of the main characters' dilemma.And wouldn't it have been a nice ironic tough if the way to discover 'real dad' would be to check to see who was spreading the STD around at the time? That would certainly have been worth a few laughs, and a nice new ABBA song, huh? ""Now I've got sores everyplace/ my nose is dropping off my face/ Hernandoooo!"" As for the young woman's response to the problem - who's the real father? - she expresses no real anger or angst or hurt or loss, just a childishly voyeuristic enjoyment of her mother's past adventures. She also doesn't know any science (and neither does the script-writer), since the simple answer to her basic question is really available through DNA cross-matching, which makes the whole story of the film pointless.Given that this is a fantasy for older women, I suppose this would be forgivable - if it were a well-made fantasy - but it's not. It's gaudy, noisy, poorly designed, poorly photographed, poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted, It is not even amusing in a 'bad but funny' sort of way. It is visually and aurally assaultive, and emotionally and intellectually insulting. I honestly cannot think of a worst movie experience I've ever had. Maybe the disgustingly sadistic Hershel Lewis film ""10,000 Maniacs."" But that film went on to develop a cult following, and this one has apparently made millions.Well, that's showbiz - you want it to be an art, but it's only another form of prostitution. Maybe that recent reviewer was right - not about the characters but the cast and crew involved in this hideous con-job.

Joyous Therapy for the World,"I have seen Mamma Mia x7, (x1 w/ my Son, x1 w/ GirlFriend, x2 on a lonely sad ish night + x1 w/ a friend across the country that I hadn't seen in 33 yrs + x2 w/ the ""sing-along"" presentation). I have purchased & am listening NOW to its CD (& under its influence) which I MUST also suggest for purchase- (whereas it is not filled w/ nonsense instrumental)- but the vocal power, accurate direction & beautiful wonder of the film. It is such a high power, feel-good film. There is nothing here anyone could talk negative about. It is bright, happy, sunny & takes place on a remote Greek Island. ABBA songs envelop the beauty of the musical. The songs are driving, w/ excellent lyrics, great (and fairly complex) composition & background musicality. Regarding the vocals in the songs- the actors/actresses whom the general public do not usually associate w/ being singers are superb (hearing Amanda w/ Rachael & Ashley as back-ups will ""blow your socks off""), Colin can sing beautifully also . Go see it. Forget prior ingrained assumptions of 007 or what exactly people are supposed to be (on film). Meryl Streep played a wonderful hard working guest house owner- singing, & acting (she was simply a beautiful & genuine ""down to earth person""). Everyone did a wonderful job in the film & I'm sure it was a wonderful film to produce. I love everyone associated w/ the film & silently (& unobtrusively) Praise Tom Hanks as the Executive Producer.

Delightful Light Entertainment,"In recent years the success of TV shows like X Factor, Pop/American Idol and Britain / America's Got Talent have reminded everyone of the simple pleasures of singing, dancing and having a good time. Curiously, the Musical genre, which epitomises this, has been slow to reflect this interest on our cinema screens. However with the success of Hairspray, High School Musical and now Mama Mia, I suspect there will be many more to follow.Mama Mia starts from a strong base. A fine musical catalogue, a successful stage production, the co-operation of songwriters Benny and Bjorn and a well known cast are a good start.But then it pretty much overwhelms the audience with it's sheer ""joie de vivre"". Don't listen to the curmudgeonly doubters, if you want to find fault with this production of course you can. But thats not really the point. This film is for enjoying the music, laughing at the slapstick comedy, having a good time and perhaps even kicking off those heels and having a dance.Meryl Streep successfully dominates this film with all the enthusiasm of an Aunt visiting for Christmas and determined to have a good time. Ably assisted by Julie Walters, and a particularly good Christine Baranski the three of them laugh, dance and cry themselves through a plot which is frankly only there to allow everyone to enjoy themselves.Amanda Seyfried as Streep's daughter is the right mix of innocence and verve and the three prospective ""fathers"",Brosnan, Firth and Skarsgard ham up their scenes monstrously.The only real query on the film is Brosnan's singing. It is terrible. I hope that it was left in as a joke because it does cause you to literally laugh out loud. Which is in marked contrast to Streep who sings admirably, giving Madonna a run for her money in the latter's starring role in Evita.The sun of course always shines, the buildings look rustic and welcoming, and the sea is blue.The ""set pieces"", Voulez Vous, Dancing Queen and a raucous Does Your Mother Know always entertain, Chiquitita is an unexpected delight!

Meryl's Waterloo,"I liked ABBA in the '70s.I saw ""Mamma Mia"" on stage in Vegas, and loved it.Then I saw ""Mamma Mia"" the movie.Oh dear!I've never agreed with the notion of bringing in big-name stars to create a film version of an already popular musical, but in the past, when a few of those big-name movie stars couldn't sing, the directors (and I would assume the non-singing stars who didn't want to embarrass themselves) had the sense to bring in the Marni Nixons, Bill Lees, Margery McKays, Giorgio Tozzis, etc. to dub the sound tracks.No such luck with ""Momma Mia.""Dominic Cooper is good as ""Sky,"" and Amanda Seyfried is more than good as Sophie, but the rest of the cast is too old and can't carry a tune in the buckets it looks like they are about to kick.In the 2000s, ""Duets,"" ""Chicago,"" and ""Moulin Rouge"" were pleasant big-name star surprises.What happened with ""Momma Mia""?

This movie had me singing and dancing in my seat and was simply a wonderful feel good kind of movie. The cast made it look as though they had great fun during the filming. Who would have known that Ms. Streep could sing too? We should have known. Her strengths and diversity as an actress are unmatchable. Pierce Brosnan and Collin Firth were convincing and inspiring in their roles. Julie Walters demonstrated her ability to portray a free spirit, with wild energy and Christine Baranski did an excellent job as well. Amanda Seyfried is a star in her own right and has an incredible singing voice. This is a movie I will purchase and watch for a long time to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Relentlessly Awful,"If this aggressively, sadistically cheerful movie does not make you want to jab a fork into your eye within the first two minutes, then you and I should probably never get together for drinks.A stage musical based on the songs of ABBA was probably an unnecessary endeavor to begin with, so a movie based on that stage musical is unnecessary to the second power. But was that any reason to inflict a film this terribly made and relentlessly un-entertaining on its audience? Who was director Phyllida Lloyd trying to punish anyway?""Mamma Mia!"" the movie! retains a single monotonous! tone of mania! that I think is supposed to be wacky but instead comes across as deranged. I didn't think I could be embarrassed by a Meryl Streep performance, but this movie proves that there's a first time for everything. Streep mugs and writhes and jumps up and down on beds and emotes to pointless songs shoe-horned into a vapid plot to the point where I just wanted someone (the grip, the script supervisor, anyone) to shoot her and put her out of her misery. But the misery inflicted by Streep's performance is nothing compared to the misery endured having to listen to Pierce Brosnan sing ABBA songs in the style of Bruce Springsteen. Wonderful actresses like Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are asked to behave like fifteen-year-old girls (which is the only demographic I can even come close to seeing this film appeal to, by the way). Other nightmarish images flash across my eyes when I think back on this movie, like a phalanx of male dancers wearing scuba flippers and a fleeting glimpse of Stelan Skarsgaard's naked ass. Everyone looks like they're having a good time, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were doing so at gunpoint.What's next, a musical based on television commercial jingles?Grade: F",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Walking,"Musical movies are movies after all, and even a good musical play can be a bad, bad movie.This is a bad bad movie, made by someone who is not a filmmaker. No Julie Taymor here: her stage skills do not translate well to the screen and in fact every single cinematic device here is borrowed, many even from ""Sound of Music.""But its still an enjoyable experience. The girl is pretty and there are is a staging of a wedding that will color fantasies for a hundred years. The songs, even in their versions here, are gloriously catching. They all seem to have been designed to walk, walk, walk, hold, so even by listening you are dancing; the prancing we see is only a reminder, clothes exaggerated to highlight the important parts.The only affecting thing in the performances is that Meryl gives the impression that she is having fun. And we enjoy that, especially a bit after the credits start. She's near sixty and I imagine has a long life yet.

MAMMA MIA - Thank ABBA for the music,"When I was young, my parents told me that they need Abba's songs to be played to feed me all three times a day. I'm still a big fan of Abba. The movie features 22 songs of Abba. Few of my favorite songs weren't there but still this movie features many others. Thanks to the actors Meryl, Brosnan, Firth and Stellan who re-sung these classic songs. Meryl was particularly good in that and I felt the voice of an Abba within her (my opinion). The movie was very joyful from start to finish and made my mind relaxed because of the magic of Abba. The movie location in Greece was like a summer fantasy.If you're watching it as a serious movie watcher then you may have these problems. One with women (of all ages) screaming in a number of scenes. Brosnan could've worked on his voice better and so many actors' voices. The plot line without such great songs would be certainly be horrible. The songs could have been choreographed better. Having such great actors, the script could've been far better.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Going for my 9th viewing,"I have become a ""Momma Mia! aholic"". The movie is probably the most fantastic movie I have ever seen. I have never seen a movie more than once at a theater. I believe the combinations of music, comedy, near Shakespearean farce, some drama, fantastic acting and unexpected cameos makes this a top, top winner in my opinion. I know it cannot qualify for music awards but it should qualify for other awards. I don't want to spoil it for anyone out there but if you haven't seen it by now, since its been out for over a month, shame on you. Part of the reason why I have gone repeatedly is because I have enjoyed the audience reactions nearly as much as the films multi-talented stars. The audience has been mostly Baby Boomers who can relate to Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan. It has been mostly women but when couples show up, the men hoot with laughter as much as the women. The comments overheard while leaving have always been positive and most are delighted they came; surprisingly so, they say. The movie is also an education in taking chances regarding type-casting. I hope this sets a precedent for the future of all those actors who are waiting for their chance to broaden their scope of their chosen careers. Hurray for this movie on so many levels. Go see it.

As for the sets and locations, what photographic genius created this feast for the eyes! All the actors and actresses were spot on in their roles, delightful, fantastic. it allowed for singing weaknesses, after all, they are actors, not professional singers and they were hired for their charisma in acting which was delivered beyond expectation in this movie!

"Mama Mia makes noise, not sense.","First of all anyone who says this basic plot wasn't stolen from ""Buena Ser, Mrs. Campbell"" is nuts. The real difference is that the 60s movie with Gina Lollbrigida was hilarious and well- plotted and this Abba dabba doo film is a mess. Despite a wonderful cast, notably Meryl Streep, the story is completely implausible from the Greek Isle setting to the arrival of the three possible fathers, to the fact that no song has anything to do with the plot (or what there is of it). This is not a musical, but a music video with every song pretty much the same, which is fine if there were no pretense at having a story and real characters. The good news is that it shows us how deeply talented, Streep,Julie Walters, and Christine Baransky are. The bad news is that the three male leads fared less well and everybody looked old, tired and unmade up. One wonders if the misdirected director ever helmed another film. This film will probably do very well with millions of unsophisticated moviegoers who will tell you how swell it is. But if you really care about the integrated music, character development and silly little things like logic, you'll probably find yourself saying, ""Mama Mia, who thinks this is a good movie?""

"It's NOT The Sound of Music, That's for Sure!","Call me silly, but The Sound of Music is still my favorite musical and the film by which I judge all musicals and Mama Mia sure comes up short. All I kept thinking during the movie was why Julie Andrews wasn't the female lead? Meryl Streep? I LOVE Meryl Streep, but not in Mama Mia! She is the miscast of the year in this role and she CANNOT sing! Nor can Pierce Bronsan or anyone else for that matter except the two young leads who are both knock-outs - both to look at and to listen to. Colin Firth, my very favorite male lead, was the only singer who moved me to tears and he can't sing either. I kept thinking why have they made a musical without singers? What am I missing? But there's so much about this film that annoyed me. First of all, the story is the least romantic I have ever come across. The idea that a young woman on the day of her wedding wants the three men her mother hooked up with and one of whom may be her father is not only silly, it's just plain neurotic, hardly the basis for a romantic story. Okay, so the location shooting was fabulous, but the actors paled in comparison, all of them looking terrible except for the two young leads who looked fantastic! Merly Streep especially looked positively gruesome. All I kept thinking was that the director must HATE Meryl Streep to have her photographed so poorly. But the men didn't look any better especially Pierce Bronsan. The choreography was incredible, no doubt about it, but there were way too many songs and entirely too much motion - everyone on Earth got into the act every time there was a song to be sung - people coming from every direction so that it looked like the entire world was dancing, which might not be such a bad idea, but NOT in a movie, especially when you're trying to follow what little there is of the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"What a joy, what a life, what a chance!","What a joy, what a life, what a chance!This is exactly the kind of movies that make you feel all happy and cheerful once you leave the theater. I've really enjoyed this movie and yes it's a fun one. The songs are great the scenery is amazing and the actors do an excellent job. Meryl Streep surprised me the most. She turned up to be an excellent ""Donna"". She is fun, funny and she gives an excellent emotional performance of ""The Winner Takes It All"". But the most outstanding one was definitely Amanda Seyfried. That girl has an amazing voice and she gives a great, and fun show.

What the hell was that??,"Okay, so maybe your six year old sister might like it, but it might just make you want to fall asleep, or chuck the remote at the television screen. The main actress is TERRIBLE. Somehow, she manages to be irritating and sickly sweet in everything she does. Meryl Streep (usually a great talent) was just as bad. The plot was tiresome and predictable, none of the actors could sing -especially poor old Brosnan-, and everything was just a little too polished and nicey.Yes, it was in your face no-fears cheesy, but it was done really badly. Spare yourself some childish waste of time, and watch something of taste, please.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

The stage version was better,"I've seen the stage version 3 times. Was hoping the movie to be good too, but it doesn't deliver.One problem is the cast. None of the big names are much above amateur level in singing, unlike the leads in Chicago. It really distracts from the songs. As for the acting, I felt Streep did a bad job with ""The Winner takes it all"" by resorting to pantomime (pointing to the sky for ""the Gods"", throwing her hands for ""roll a dice"", crouching for ""staying low"" ...) Though her acting in ""Slipping through my fingers"" was exquisite.The other problem is the transition from stage to screen. Apart from the fantastic outdoor scenery, there is not much improvement. You can forgive certain things on a stage play, like being dumped into the middle of the story in the first few minutes, or jarring transitions, but on the big screen these problems are magnified. And not only are these issues retained, some of the character interactions are even more truncated than the stage version! Lastly, the final ""encore"" numbers on stage got the audience on their feet. Here the energy just peters out.The one clever thing introduced here is having the Greek ladies etc. comment on the action just like a Greek Chorus. As well, the full blown fantasy segment of ""Money money money"" was great.I would have given 5 stars if not for the music.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a blast!!!,"One of the unique aspects of musical theater is the ability of a good production to transform the theater stage to the location of the action with a few painted curtains, lighting and set decorations. Of course, the audience generally buys into this transformation since they have an idea of what to expect when they walk into the theater. With 'Mamma Mia', as with most other movie musicals, the actual location sets make it much easier for the audience to buy into the movie. This movie's location sets and scenery are absolutely glorious and are one of the highlights of the show.Ane then there is Meryl Streep. What a wonderful lady and actress. Some have complained she is overage-cast for her role, but to me, her singing and dancing abilities do not suffer at all. If one blanks out the fact she is 55, it's obvious she is up to the role and has a great time in it it. I thought her version of ""Winner Takes It All"" (which according to the IMDb trivia was done in one take) was right on and went well beyond ABBA's pop version.My only complaints with the movie are that two of my favorite songs ('I do! I do! I do' and 'Thank you for the music' from the production were shortened or placed over the credits. Oh well...My recommendation is to see this movie and be prepared for a couple of hours of musical escapism and watch one of the world's best actors perform at the top of her craft.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fun,feel good flick but s.o.s from some of the singing!","I never saw the Broadway show but today I decided to go see Mamma Mia the movie in hope that it would be as great as last years Hairspray. Unfortunately, I found it quite disappointing. It tells the story of Sophie who, in an attempt to find a father to walk her down the isle on her big day, secretly reads her mothers diary and finds three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) that might possibly be her father . Meanwhile everyone keeps breaking out into Abba songs and dancing around cheerfully. The music is fine but the singing pretty laughable at times, especially from Brosnan who the audience were actually laughing at whilst he was breaking out into song. The main problem with this movie is that it can't figure out who the story is following, Sophie or her mother Donna. One moment we are following Donna around trying to work out which man out of the three men who have arrived she loves the most and then we follow Sophie who is trying to sort out which one is her father. In the end it becomes one huge mess and the songs become quite annoying and just plain corny! Streep does OK with her singing but not good enough for someone that sings around 10 songs throughout the whole film. All in all, Mamma Mia has some great jokes, good scenery and good acting, but the singing and story line let it down. But by all means go see it for the feel good vibe and the songs that will stick in your head for days!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cheesy and disappointing.,"I was incredibly disappointed with this production of ""Mamma Mia"". I thought the directing was awful, most of the singing was lacking (MOST, not all.), and the script-Oh my God! Horrible. The only thing that helped me get through this movie was the acting. The acting was phenomenal. I was simply amazed. Meryl Streep-need I say any more? She is so talented and absolutely makes this movie for me. Nothing else about this movie was enjoyable. I loved the stage Musical, and the music is amazing, but this movie was an insane disappointment. Horrible camera-work, choppy editing, simply awful. I really wish I could have gotten back my 2 hours and 8 dollars and used it for something much more entertaining, like watching grass grow, or getting blood drawn. Had I known how much I would be frustrated when walking out of the theatre, I would have just gone to see Hancock like I had originally planned on doing.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Colossal Misfire,"I'll admit I didn't expect to like this movie beforehand, but upon watching it, Mamma Mia! somehow still shocked me with its low quality. One third of the movie is a ridiculous story surrounding annoying, ditzy, bland characters, and the other two thirds are just a collection of cheesy, obnoxious music videos. I suppose that's the downside to writing an entire film loosely around a collection of ABBA songs. I can't exactly say I was surprised that this movie was a mess, but I didn't anticipate just how unpleasant it was. Take the poor structure I already mentioned and top it all off with terrible acting (even from Oscar winners Meryl Streep and Colin Firth), even worse singing, and an irritatingly over-the-top and campy tone, and you have Mamma Mia! In the end I got very little enjoyment out of this movie. I guess it's just not my thing.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"No, I'm not broken-hearted at all!","So rarely do I enjoy a movie like I enjoyed this one. I've never seen the actual show, yet I'm an ABBA fan, so this movie was must, since I read about it on this website. I found myself singing the songs and laughing like I've never laughed in a movie before. Mamma Mia! is one of the leading movies of the year, even though we're still in July. And no, I won't take it back.The casting for this movie was just perfect. Meryl Streep couldn't be more perfect, jumping and singing like a 20-year-old, while she's almost kissing hello to the early 60's. There's no trace of age in her, as she pretty much was the focus of the movie. The ABBA members called her a miracle. I couldn't agree more. Am I smelling an Oscar..? Our good ol' James Bond was pleasing, even though his singing abilities were.. well, let's just say he should stick to drinking his vodka martinis ""shaken, not stirred"". Acting-wise, he was great. Julie Walters, she really deserves a ""mamma mia!"" for her part in the movie. She's second in command for Streep, showing her AMAZING acting and singing abilities. She was the main reasons for the moments I laughed so much. New-comer (even though she's been in movies suck as Mean Girls) Amanda Seyfried was truly touching, proving she's more than plastic figure that follows Rachel McAdams. As for the rest of the cast, the two other father figures, Stellan Skarsgård and Colin Firth really did make it a super cast, along with Christine Baranski as the never-aging friend, Tanya.The re-makes of the songs were absolutely perfect. I've heard the ABBA version many times, but I must say, Streep made it sounds SO MUCH BETTER! I'm truly waiting to purchase the soundtrack, and add it to the movie/musical list of cd's I have on my iPod, which includes Sweeney Todd and Hairspray.The view, oh wow, the view. Being shot in a Greek location really made the movie so much more believable and alive. The sets themselves were truly entertaining, especially the goat-house which plays an important part of the story.Why did I give it 10? Well, I should ask, why not? It had everything I wanted in a movie like that, which makes me laugh and enjoy a Friday night like I've never enjoyed it before, when I went to a movie. Now I need to see The Dark Knight, but tell you the truth - I feel like seeing that girl and watching that scene one more time, dig in the Dancing Queen.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Will Certainly Appeal To Dancing Queens,"I put off seeing this film simply because ... well it's MAMMA MIA isn't it ? A musical based on the stage play and centered around the music of Swedish legends Abba a band I'm old enough to remember and a pop group still held in high regard by heterosexual women and gay men of a certain age but I certainly was never a fan and it was the main selling point of the film . You can point out that it contains some cinematic star power big hitters but if the same cast appeared in a film with the song and dance numbers provided by The Beta Band would it have the same box office appeal ?Talking of box office in 2013 it still remains the 75th highest grossing film unadjusted for inflation . I'm guessing much of the world box office is down to the nations of Sweden and Britain making a big contribution to the film's profits ? That said despite never making number one at the US box office it did remain in the top 10 weekly box office for two months . It seems to have been a film that captured the hearts of the international market . Maybe it does have something going for it after all and I was being prejudiced ?Any prejudice is quickly met . It is very camp kitsch guilty pleasure material . No attempt is made to portray Greek Islands with any reality , no attempt is made to make MAMMA MIA the greatest film since CITIZEN KANE . Everything is constructed around the show stopping song and dance numbers and after a while even a hetrosexist male who can remember these songs almost gets caught up in the sway of things . It's camp nonsense of course but relatively enjoyable camp nonsense , a sort of low brow Derek Jarman does MGM musical . That's entertainment ? Yes to a degree . It's not a film that will be remembered with any great affection by the critics but does what it sets out to do relatively well",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Enjoyable On Any Level,"When this movie came out, it looked so appealing in the trailers. I never got around to seeing it and just recently heard that Mama Mia is breaking all kinds of records in the UK so figured it was time to give it a shot. What a waste of my time. I hated this boring turkey with a passion. Why? I liked the actors. I love ABBA music and I like beautiful scenery. With all these positives, why did I hate this movie so much? If the singing was passable, I could have found something positive to say about it but it really was mediocre. This was so boring and didn't work on any level. Amanda Seyfried was pretty good which is about the only nice thing I can say. Maybe I would have enjoyed the Broadway play more but as movies go, this one stinks.

I finally know why my mom loves the musical Mamma Mia!,"Okay, so I finally saw what now seems to be my mother's favorite musical-her being an ABBA fan and all-in both stage and movie versions since she loved this when she saw it on her birthday last year and requested it for a Christmas present from me. Overall, it was indeed enjoyable despite the somewhat shallow characterizations and plot. Of the singing cast, Meryl Streep comes off best and Pierce Brosnan the worst. In fact, I wished he and Colin Firth had switched roles since Mr. Firth is the much better singer. Of the supporting cast, both Julie Walters and Christine Baranski had good vocal chops throughout while Stellan Skarsgard was adequate the few times he sang. Then there are the young leads Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper who both warbled in fine form. Nice cameos by both former ABBA members Bjorn Ulvaeus and, in the ""Dancing Queen"" number, Benny Andersson on the piano. Overall, Mamma Mia! The Movie was a very enjoyable experience. So to anyone who doesn't mind a little frothy entertainment, that's a recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Getaway to Greece,"Mamma Mia is my vacation destination this year. If I can't afford to go to Greece, then this is the next best thing. To top it off, I get Meryl Streep & Amanda Seyfried singing my favorite ABBA tunes (and doing a great job as well - with gusto).I don't want full-bore reality when it comes to musicals (i.e. Sweeney Todd - yuck). I want a semi-getaway from reality.I want romance, dancing, laughing, great music & fun (with a bit of seriousness to it - but not taking itself too seriously). In my opinion, Mamma Mia delivers that.I love it when the audience is swaying to the music, smiling throughout the film, leaving the theater with big grins on their faces & humming the songs on the way out. That's entertainment, folks, & money well spent at the movie theater.BTW, this is not a chick flick - it treats men with respect & personally the term ""chick flick"" is way overused. What does that mean anyway? Is there an official explanation somewhere? Life doesn't revolve only around women - men make up the other half of the population!!! I saw plenty of guys in this film & some of them were really handsome & nice too!Anyway, I loved Mamma Mia & I am glad it's doing so well abroad. I wish it did better in the USA but maybe people were sidetracked here by ""The Dark Knight"". Lighten up everyone - go see Mamma Mia.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The over-60 crowd loved it,"Saw this in an older theater that is apparently frequented by seniors aged 60 and above - at least that's my impression based on the attendance when I was there. I was surprised at just how crowded the theater was given the movie's been out a few weeks now. I enjoy much of ABBA's music (a must for anyone seeing this film), and found the movie watchable and mildly amusing throughout, but while I sat there with a slight smile on my face, the older folks would break into raucous laughter regularly. The performances were enjoyable, though I would have liked to have seen someone like Hugh Jackman in Pierce Brosnan's role because I understand Mr. Jackman can actually sing (but I give Mr. Brosnan credit for expanding his boundaries, and he certainly wasn't terrible). The movie is also very colorful, so in general, it's a rather ""happy"" experience all around. Not a film I'll remember for long, but pleasant and relatively innocent, though I will warn that some themes and suggestive words/behaviors will likely offend the most conservative viewers.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Excellent,"Anything with Meryl Streep is worth watching. Even Doubt, which was uncomfortable but amazing. This movie is one of the most feel good movies I have seen in a long time. Amanda Sigfried is a revelation. Even with her voluptious body it was not distracting. I was dancing out of the theater, singing the songs in my head. Okay, I wasn't dancing, but the tunes really stuck with me. I hope we see more of Amanda in upcoming movies. I'm sure she can be a great dramatic actress too. But Streep steals the show. What did I expect? She is brilliant in every single movie she ever makes. HEr performance in this just solidifies her as the best actress probably ever. From the Bridges Of Madison County to Silkwood to The Deer Hunter to Doubt to this? Every performance is different and all of them on the same level.

Mamma Mia,"This is officially my top favourite musical movie of all time. I won't go into the plot as I suck at describing them. I wasn't even aware of that this existed until I read a post talking about the sequel, so decided that I would give the first one a shot.
The story is hilarious and well-written. I had never heard of ABBA before, so I concur with Mark Baker (a blogger), that if I hadn't known where the music had come from, I would have thought that they were written solely for this movie. They really fit this movie's storyline that perfectly - and I am now a big fan of ABBA music. And I also really loved how whenever someone burst out singing, it had me and my family cracking up laughing.
The cast was perfect for their roles - they really threw themselves into their roles and their singing scenes. I was surprised to find that they were all singing themselves - especially Pierce Brosnan. It's weird thinking that someone who played James Bond can sing, but he did and he did it very, very well. What's with the complaints about Brosnan singing? It's silly, like people complaining about Sean Connery's role in the third Indiana Jones movie. In fact, everyone who sang did it excellently.
The laughs were plenty and that's what made me enjoy this so much. I've never laughed so hard in my life.
I really, really, really love Donna's two besties - they are hilarious! They steal a lot of the scenes they are in and are the cause for plenty of laughs. I especially really love Tanya - don't mess with her as you'll be playing with fire (and you'll love her singing scene). The characters are all great and they really draw you in.
I love how it ends - it fits it. It's not weak, but a strong, fitting end for the movie. I highly recommend this movie to those who love musicals or to those who simply love a good laugh - which this movie will provide it bucket loads.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I went in expecting nothing special and came out totally pleased and happy. The music is a given and anyone who loves ABBA is definitely in for a treat but how it is performed is surprising. OK, so Pierce Brosnan is not the biggest and most talented singer but he gives it all his got and that really shows. So if you are willing to overlook a view shortcomings when it comes to that it is wonderful. Meryl Streep was always one of my favorites and now I absolutely love her. Her Donna comes across vulnerable yet powerful and her singing is amazing, I would never have thought she could pull it of this well.Amanda Seyfried is adorable as the bride to be and Christine Baransky and Julie Walters are so hilarious,I was laughing all the way. Go see it and then try to wipe of that stupid grin from your face. It took me a week and I'm going to see it again, and again and again.

I mean it was a lot of fun, the scenery was gorgeous, but I think they definitely could've got better singers. Amanda Seyfried has a lovely voice, hers was definitely the best in my opinion, and Meryl's was probably the next best I think, but the others left something to be desired.

Set on a Greek Island, with interesting lighting effects during a boat scene towards the beginning of the film. When I view this film It brings up many emotions for me. There is humor, good fun, and laughter, along with seriousness, and melancholy. I want to sing along with the music, smile and dance. Who cares if some of the voices are not the best singers in the world, it makes it all seem more real. The movie may appeal to some age groups more than others, but I have viewed it with a variety of people and everyone has liked it, usually more after viewing it again.

A disappointment; poor execution ruined it's potential,"I was expecting a cute-if cheesy-musical film that would be fun to see with my mom. I can't believe how wrong I was. I know that this was adapted from a Broadway musical, but I don't think the filmmakers took into account the differences in the mediums. All of the over-the- top acting and humor works in a theatre setting because it's more difficult to portray emotions subtly to an audience who can't get a close up shot of the actors. The filmmakers should have toned it down in order to make the movie fun and not tacky.The premise by itself is a cute idea, but the characters aren't well developed, and therefore I couldn't care less about what happens to them. The husband-to-be is a character that is especially lacking, and any ""argument"" the couple has is transparent. The same can be said of the 3 potential father's, whose entire background is revealed via montage and a song.Unfortunately, this was obviously a lame vehicle for ABBA songs over a good story because the songs used were interchangeable (mostly generic love songs, recalling past romance), some were put in unnecessarily (entire scenes just for one song unrelated to the major plot), and they simply went on for too long. Also, most of the songs were introduced too abruptly, making the term ""break out into song"" quite literal, with blasting background music on the very first note. I prefer it when the song progresses a bit more naturally into the story.However, the major downfall of this film was the fact that the songs did very little to advance the plot. I understand that relying exclusively on preexisting songs can be a hurdle, but when you look at a work like Moulin Rouge, you can't make too many excuses for this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Turbulent surprise. Give up your resistance!,"I have to admit that it was an ""accident"" that I even watched this movie. I had successfully ignored it on my flight to America, and I would have ignored it on the flight back, too, if not two things accidentally happened to occur in the same time: firstly, somewhere over Iceland we entered what is told to be the heaviest storm since ""Kyrill"", with heavy turbulence allowing me not even to dream of a bit of sleep. Secondly, the roundabout 70-year-old lady beside me watched this movie and seemed to be extremely happy with it (as it turned out, she had visited some ABBA-Concerts with her children some decades ago, remembered most of the songs and was mainly impressed about the accuracy ""Mamma Mia"" had been bend around the original song texts). So I finally gave up my resistance and the movie a chance.It was worth it, that's why I write this comment. Enough has been written here about the story, I don't have to tell you how much I liked the performance of Meryl Streep (although I'm not at all a fan of her and was heavily disappointed about this whole Prada thing), or how beautiful the set was.The only thing I want to say: If you have general doubts about this Mamma Mia idea, if you don't know whether you might like this stuff, if your girlfriend wants to lend this and you fear a boring evening on the couch: At least give it a chance.

ABBA-dabba-do,"I'm a fan of movie musicals and fondly remembered the group ABBA's tunes from the 1970's so I thought I'd give this one a shot. It's based on the world-wide stage sensation which was, in turn, based on the Swedish pop-group's hits. It's kind of fun at times and has beautiful location photography, but this middle-aged, female fantasy is awfully contrived and somewhat sappy. Stellan Skarsgard and Colin Firth seem uncomfortable in their roles and Pierce Brosnan's singing leaves a lot to be desired. It does showcase Streep's fine voice and some of the numbers are inventively staged, but I think an appreciation of the film is pretty dependent on one's enjoyment of the stage show or the group's music.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

And that is pretty much how i felt through the whole movie. I'm not going to talk about actors or scenes(just the feel). OK, when i got back to the car and sat down my girlfriend asked me what i thought, stupid i said. I was watching you she said.You were laughing and smiling the whole time. Dammit, she was right.

Musical train wreck,"I had no idea the entire musical oeuvre of ABBA was really about a girl looking for her true father before she gets married on a Greek Island. This is the storyline on which the writer hangs 18 ABBA songs in Mamma Mia!

As if 400 million records sold didn't already tell us this.If you have to write the book or script for a musical, the big problem you have to solve is how to use the songs to drive the story. Otherwise story and song become two separate tracks and the audience waits for the song to end so they can get back to what happens next.But in Mamma Mia! this problem is reversed. The storyline is so lame, absurd and emotionally phony that the audience can't wait to hear another catchy song to find relief from the awful script. I've never been a big ABBA fan, but during the course of this movie I came to believe that they were the greatest musical geniuses in history; such was the chasm between story and song.And then there is the matter of the casting. Any director will tell you that 80-90% of the job is who you pick to play the roles. This has to be the worst cast movie in modern memory. Most of these actors are at least 20 years too old for their parts. Watching 60+ Meryl Streep cavorting like a 15-year-old teeny bopper was one of the five most painful moments of my life. And Pierce Brosnan will surely be nominated for best statue imitating a person trying to sing. In fact, the casting of this movie was so mind-boggling that I realized it was actually a stroke of genius in which the filmmakers were using aged movie stars to highlight the artistic absurdity of the entire decade of the 70s.What can a screenwriter learn from this train wreck? Well, first, be sure to make friends with the most popular candy pop band in history so they will give you the rights to 18 of their songs, and then you can write a horrible script tying them all together and no one will care.

It's kind of fun which holly wood generally doesn't offers...,"Being used to the Indian movies makes you a fan of 'song & dance routine' in movies. So a musical is never surprising for us. In fact movies without nice song & dance may seem strange to many of us. For me it has been disappointing mostly, when it comes to Hollywood musicals, especially Chicago which was terrible or even Moulin Rouge. Why the hell they even speak dialogues by singing them, that's stupid (like singing & dancing around trees with changing clothes & all other ridiculous stuff is so sensible & smart, but we are used to it). Somehow the Hollywood musical doesn't seem to work much to me (The Enchanted and Music & Lyrics were nice though) but this was a clear exception.The movie looks fresh and interesting, the performances are subtle and keeps you hooked having fun while watching. That's what you expect from a musical. The storyline is well known, (hopefully... it was not well known to me though) a girl searching for her real father out of all 3 men her mom has dated earlier. She plans her marriage and invites all 3 men to figure out who is it. And the story goes through twists & turns and lots of SONGS, coming to a happy ending (sounds like bollywood).I haven't seen the Broadway show but this film is definitely captivating enough to hold the audience. It was interesting to see Mr Ex James Bond singing and dancing on musical tunes. Others looked good as well. Just one suggestion, if you enjoy the movie then don't leave theater immediately after it ends, there is a nice song and dance routine with the end credits (ABBA songs 'Dancing queen' & 'Waterloo'), so ENJOY the Hollywood's bollywoodization!!!(Read my blog as well... http://iambetterthanthebest.blogspot.com/)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
When All Is Sung And Won,"Being a fan of the legendary pop group that supplied us with such adorable hits, I was keen on seeing this musical for several reasons. The title, MAMMA MIA, which originates from ABBA's 1975 chart-topper, evokes certain curiosity and enthusiasm. Except for the world-known song ""Mamma Mia,"" and the box office success of the movie, there is a story behind, a story to sing rather than to tell...a story to sing with the creative use of immortal ABBA hits...And I admit that the great merit of this musical lies in the humorous, adequate use of the lyrics and dynamic music by the Swedish pop group. As a matter of fact, we get the wide range of their tunes with certain contexts that fit particularly to the very moments. Among many unforgettable scenes, I particularly enjoyed ""Money Money Money"" (with its excellent manifestation of Donna's finances); ""Our Last Summer"" (with its desirable reference to her carefree past); ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" (with the lovely combination of fun and erotic tension); and ""The Winner Takes it All"", one of my ABBA's favorites where pain of loss goes with some hope for the future...the scene is very good because it does resist the 'temptation' to fall into exaggerated sentimentality. And the content?The dilemmas of a young woman, Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried) are depicted humorously and flexibly enough to result in a convincing storyline. Her dilemmas, just before her wedding, focused on figuring out who her real father is absorbs all the people around, including her two best friends Ali (Ashley Lilley) and Lisa (Rachel Mc Dowall), her mother's friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baransky), and, most importantly, her own mother Donna (Meryl Streep). What a character....this Mamma Mia! Donna Sheridan is the owner of a wonderful villa rumored to have been built on the legendary fountain of the goddess of love, Aphrodite. And love has a significant word in that... Donna seems to know her 'secret Fernando...' As the story develops, the love occurs to be stronger than anything else and ""there is no hurry any more when all is said and done..."" More and more couples, more and more sympathies, the lovely words ""I Do I Do I Do"" are being sung and the hearts in dance being won.The locations of the movie...Greece...where people breathe love with the air and where song, no matter if romantic or ecstatic...has a power to win people's hearts constitute an important aspect of the artistry. The small Greek island Skopelos and the Pelion area have been chosen as the locations for the Kalokairi island where the events are set. And the use of the sets is truly brilliant with the feeling for the Mediterranean beauty. Where else could such a story be set if not in those idyllic places?Except for Amanda Seyfried who looks gorgeous, the performances are rather average...even if the movie has such an important cinema star as Pierce Brosnan. Yet, there is one exception, one person that truly stands out in her performance and that is Meryl Streep. She does a marvelous job portraying her character with wit, with flexibility, with a magnificent flair for combining craziness essential in such comedy with a great degree of emotionality that links her with the viewers. But, foremost, she surprises as by her singing ABBA songs. Having been taught opera as a child, she has already stunned viewers by singing in films like SILKWOOD and A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION but in MAMMA MIA she is just marvelous, magnetizing and incomparable.A nice musical, a lovely film for TWO being watched affectionately at a summer night city flat, a beach bar somewhere on the coast or in a nice cottage room...an inspiring romantic sentiment, humor that always makes our lives brighter and a lovely escape from the everyday rush that occurs pointless when all is sung and won... It seems that we are having fun, indeed! Thank you for the musicAL!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Bad casting, singing, and acting.","Loved the play. Love the music. Hated the film.First of all, the math doesn't work. They mention in the film that Sophie is 20. Then they bring in a cast that were in their 40's and 50's when she was born. Meryl Streep is way too old to play a woman whose mother kicked her out of the house for getting pregnant. The casting of her to play Donna is laughable.Let's move on to the singing and acting. Several cast members can't carry a tune in their back pocket. Also, there are a lot of brilliant, well-respected, award-winning actors and actresses here, and most of them seemed to have forgotten all that.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Ruined, Just Ruined","This movie is pathetic not because it's poorly directed, acted, sung, danced, filmed, etc ... but because it's really difficult to ruin a movie using an ABBA soundtrack - yet, unfortunately, this is the only thing the movie succeeds in doing. The musical presentations in the movie, SouthPark, was much better than in Mama Mia. The director of Mama Mia is proof that you don't need talent to be a director - all you need are ABBA songs.Just to give a sample of the awfulness: An aging Meryl Streep is shot with close-ups in the harsh sunlight singing and just ruining the song with all the distracting wrinkles on her face. Why do that to one of the most talented Actresses out there?",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The ultimate feel-good movie,"If you want to watch this movie to see an out-of-the-ordinary masterpiece, or ""The Best Movie Ever"", then this isn't your type of movie.Mamma Mia is an excellent combination of a musical with popular songs and a good light comedy, whose only purpose is to make you laugh. It features a great performance by the never-disappoint Meryl Streep, who again shows her versatility by providing us the cheerful and hilarious Donna. Her supporting cast backs her with good, constant performances, and certainly hold out their own in this movie.If you're depressed, heartbroken, or just want to cheer yourself, then this is the perfect movie to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Feel good movie of the summer,"This summer there have been a lot of really good movies, but I had yet too see one feel good movie, that is until I saw Mamma Mia!I'll admit, I wasn't really excited about seeing this film, I choose it because I thought my mother would like it. And I was right she did like it and so did I. The singing and dancing was marvelous, the way the songs matched the mood and forwarded the story of the film was great.There were a couple of times were I was tempted to sing-a-long to the tunes, if a musical makes me do that, in a theater no less, then mission accomplished.I loved Meryl Streep in this film, but then again she's always wonderful. Amanda Seyfried breaks out of the high school persona she's been known for playing in films such as Mean Girls, she is beautiful, and literally lights up the screen, apart from her looks and acting, I must mention she has an incredible voice, she was made for musicals.Other great performances were those of Christine Baranski as Tanya, a plastic surgery loving cougar; and the always delightful Julie Walters as Rosie, an unmarried woman who just likes to have fun.Also Pierce Brosnan, Dominic Cooper, Stellan Skarsgård, and Colin Firth give entertaining performances, but they are out shined by the ladies, who are the ones that really dominate this film.I must also mention that the sets were great, and the location was gorgeous. I must give kudos to Phyllida Lloyd for directing this entertaining and fun piece of film.It's not the best film of the summer, but it's definitely worth while. If you like Meryl Streep, Abba, and Greece then this movie is for you.In the end I give the film a 7/10 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Basic but good-natured fluff,"Bright and cheery, good-humored but absent-minded.Mama Mia! has a great premise: three guys, who is the father? However much of the comic potential gets lost in catchy but long-winded songs. The film remains light-hearted though and if you have a mind to cheer yourself up after watching a horror film like I have, this is good escapism. How believable the film is another question, often moving up and down the emotional steps without a moment's breath.Still a charming and optimistic film, but lacking depth. The three men are all very good-looking and likable fellows with their own kind of charm and humor. However their portrayal is not exactly realistic. They are almost in permanent good humor.This is a fluff film, but it doesn't really try to be anything else either and there is a unified tone. However there are dramatic actors here and it felt like the film was a bit more average than it really had to be, being far too bright and shiny and lacking contrasting shade.But do watch this film because of its good humored charm. Sometimes there is a time and place for fluff starring your favorite actors and actresses (looking at you Colin Firth). 7/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good for what it's worth,"I used to love ABBA when I was just a boy. Their music was extremely cheerful, easy to listen, catchy and it just made you want to dance. So, while musicals aren't exactly my personal cup of tea, I went into this film with a smile on my face. And, I can't say that it disappointed. I wouldn't exactly call this a good film, as the execution is rather corny, the story is predictable and some of the characters consist of a singular stereotype. But, the thing is that the movie doesn't need to be anything more than a well-good film. It is its purpose and it succeeds spectacularly. The songs all work, and I was actually kind of amazed how they managed to fit all of them in and tell a coherent story at the same time, but then, I believe that we can thank the original stage musical for that. Very nicely done in any case. Furthermore, most the actors are very talented with special mention going to the mom-daughter duo that is Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried. Many of the best scenes in this film revolve around the relationship between these two.The movie isn't without its faults, though. The story, as mentioned, is nice enough on its own, but it's also very predictable and, dare I say, mushy. This film's reputation as one THE chick flicks is well-earned, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but the dudes and ladettes should be forewarned. The movie's biggest concern, though, are some of the characters and the actors playing them. Like the two old friends of Meryl Streep's character, whose main characteristic seems to be that they like to party. Sure they are there for Streep, but I still got the impression that it was more because they wanted to start drinking already. The love interest of Amanda Seyfried didn't leave much of an impression either.Still, I must admit that I liked this film in sort of a guilty pleasure kind of way, which is the way that most people like this film, I suppose. And really, the point of this film is ABBA's music and that is brought forward and played out beautifully. The songs are classics, they are catchy, they are performed well and they create their own unique mood to this film. Sure some of the actors leave something to hope for as singers, but the passion and the enjoyment is still there. Pop the DVD in, take your special someone to your arms and just relax. It's cool.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

"With a good cast and an enviable and appealing soundtrack, the film promised to be excellent... but it turned out to be much more average than I imagined.","First of all, I think I need to make a note: I can't say that I'm an ABBA fan, but the truth is that I have a great affection for the band and their songs, because they were songs that I remember hearing on TV when I was a kid. It is a childhood memory, which has a sentimental charge, and which cannot be evaluated in a completely neutral way (childhood memories never leave us neutral).I have yet to say that I had high expectations for the film. I'm not just talking about the music and the various songs I remember listening to, but also the enormous quality of the cast selected for the project, and the active participation of elements of the former band in the production. It was something that promised to have great quality. Well, the film has its qualities, it's undeniable, but the truth is that I noticed some laziness and sloppiness in the production, in several aspects.The film's biggest problem was the absence of a well-written script that could support the action and songs. In addition to the slew of summer movie clichés, the script copied an old Italian movie called ""Buona Sera Mrs. Campbell"", whose action is based on the dubious parenting of the protagonist's daughter, played by Gina Lollobrigida. I cannot say that we are in a situation of plagiarism because there are many films about children that do not know their parents, but the lack of originality is remarkable. Also, the film seems to almost make the apology of sexual promiscuity! In the midst of an uncomplicated, light, ""hippie"" environment, the film puts the main character's mother in an embarrassing situation: she is the single mother of a daughter who grew up not knowing her father because there are three possible ""candidates"", with whom she got involved almost simultaneously! And I'd rather not talk about that scene where a mature woman flirts with a guy much younger than her!Jumping from Broadway to Hollywood, Phyllida Lloyd assured a sincere, but not excellent, effort at the direction. She was not able to demand more from her crew, she allowed a very poor conception of the characters and the choice of actors was not at all happy from the moment they had to sing. The best choices were Amanda Seyfried and Meryl Streep, two solid, charismatic, expressive actresses with an excellent voice. The scenes in which the two are protagonists, speaking or singing, are among the best in the film, which was an excellent bet that Seyfried made in her career. Stellan Skarsgard did reasonably well, but I felt he had little to do, and so Colin Firth... in fact, this English actor, whose voice is not particularly pleasant, already seemed to me to be a dubious choice for a musical. However, he looked like an opera diva when compared to Pierce Brosnan or Julie Walters. The ex-Bond has great difficulty with the treble and sings almost in falsetto, and Walters can't sing without starting to scream.Technically, the film isn't brilliant either. On the positive side, we have the elegant cinematography, with the sun, the sea and the scenic beauty of the Greek islands favoring the visuals (we have to agree that the filming locations were wonderfully used), as well as the well-conceived sets and costumes. But the film's strong point is the soundtrack, of course, with an abundant list of ABBA songs, so famous that we can sing the entire movie. However, the insertion of each song in the film leaves a lot to be desired, something that, along with somewhat artificial choreography, leaves us with the feeling that the film is almost a gigantic music video clip, with the script being just an excuse for the songs to appear successively.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
The movie is FUN!,"The best way to watch Mamma Mia! is not just as a movie but for what its origins are: A musical.... It makes the movie all that more entertaining!

This is ABBA a not Rodgers and Hammerstein.,"This is an international hit musical brought to the silver screen or some sort of Blu-Ray screen. Many screen adoptions fall short of the actual play, yet occasionally they surpass the play because they can show things such as facial expressions and outdoor locations that cannot be seen in a play. Unlike the stage play, this film also is relying on many major actors. Unique and gutsy is the fact that the actors themselves sing the songs.This is a musical. The storyline and dialog are used to glue the songs together.

Magnificent Performance!,"This movie was absolutely amazing! I went into watching it with some doubt, having heard from family that the movie was not good, but to be honest it was an amazing, fun-filled film. Meryl Streep is an amazingly funny actress here, playing very gracefully, in a comedic way into her role, and I find that I would watch it again and again. I went into this movie with no particular love to musical films, preferring much more to see them live, however with what I have seen, the cast has matched what I would expect to find on Broadway. I have never seen this musical myself, however I believe that it is now quite a must for anyone that has any appreciation for music and acting.

Learn When To Cut It Out!!!!,"The first hour of this movie was okay. Nothing great, but not bad. It was watchable. Some of the moments were funny. And Amanda Seyfried (sorry if I spelled that wrong) was surprisingly good at playing the lead roll.But past that, things start to go down hill. Particularly during and after the wedding scene where it seems like everything is just flying out of the blue. It doesn't make sense! Where did these feelings come from? What is going on? And then the movie keeps going...and going, and going. It's like they tried to fit as many songs into the last 20 minutes as they possibly could, and it wasn't the good songs either. The movie goes flat and so did my patience with it.I can't imagine seeing this on stage.

Should of stayed on stage.,"I went to see the stage performance of Mama Mia! a few years back and loved it. The music brings me back and the story was touching, and I left the theater in high spirits.The movie on the other hand left me with a totally different feeling. The singing was very forced while they tried to fit the music in with the story. Some times I felt the song fit well into the scene, and other times I wondered what the production crew was thinking.The movie started promptly, as the very cute Amanda Seyfried places three invitations to her three possible fathers in the mailbox. From this one scene, I felt the hair on my arms stand up. This whole movie was so cliché and cheesy, and definitely meant for the female crowd. This upset me because although the play had the exact same plot, I very much enjoyed it and it seemed like it was meant for both genders.Now Pierce Brosnan. I just don't know where to start with him. Three women sitting behind me were screaming in my ear every time he appeared on screen, and every minute I hear ""OMG he is sooo cute!"" And that may be all he is. I don't think I have seen a person who was ever more miss-casted. He can't sing - or he can but his vocals did not fit the song, and it was very noticeable that his voice was digitally enhanced and fixed up with all the cool technology gadgets they have. I never thought I would ever see James Bong sing.Why do I give this movie a 6 then? Meryl Streep was absolutely amazing. No, she wasn't pretty in this movie. Her hair was a mess the whole time. I don't even think they put make-up on her, and that is what I liked. Her voice is amazing and her acting was incredible (like always), but most of all, she was a mess! She put so much character into Donna, that it made me feel that this movie was just rotating around her.In the end credits, they are all singing on a stage. WHY? If I want to see them dancing on stage then I would of went to see the actual play with was much better! Some things are better left on stage.Oh yeah, and the film work was beautiful. I loved the cinematography. If you appreciate that kind of stuff then you may appreciate the work put into this movie.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A British perspective,"As a Greekophile and a big fan of ABBA, who only got to see the stage production of Mamma Mia last year, I have to say that the movie exceeded my expectations in all respects - a tremendously talented cast gave it all they could to reproduce a fantastic collection of songs in an unique vocal style which, in my opinion, does not deserve the criticism that I have read. The movie is a true delight combining, as it does, an incredible soundtrack with a visually superb location and a light-hearted approach to a credible life situation. If you watch this film and fail to be emotionally stirred then you have no heart as it entertains on all fronts and will certainly be only the second DVD that I have ever purchased - the first being the Sound of Music! Not only will this movie see a resurgence in demand for the fabulous music but it will provide a tremendous boost to ticket sales for the stage production and Greek tourism. Every single member of the leading cast played a brilliant role and the film deserves to win many awards. Feel good factors are extremely rare these days but Mamma Mia truly compensates for this in a movie production that will undoubtedly become a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mamma Mia...we need some real singers,"I love Abba music. I have to start off by saying that. I truly do love it. And maybe that's why I was disappointed with the new film Mamma Mia, because I just love the music too much. I just truly felt that Meryl Streep and especially Pierce Brosnan butchered the music. I'm sure they both were convinced by their agents how amazing this movie would be..""Look you guys..you've never done something like this before, it would be so brave of you. I know you can't sing but we'll get you lessons. Take a chance on me...you'll be great"". But it seems so gratuitous that they did this movie. We need actors who can actually sing (Ewan McGregor, Catherine Zeta Jones, Renee Zellwiger, Jamie Foxx, even Nicole Kidman faired MUCH better at their attempts.) The truth is I think Meryl is a great actress....just not a great singer. And my lord....how AWFUL was Pierce Brosnan's singing. It was truly painful and I was literally embarrassed for him. Shame on him for thinking he could do this role. His ego must be out of control to think he could pull it off...because he truly didn't. The only one out of the whole cast who could carry a tune was the charming and beautiful Amanda Seyfried. Now that's a girl that can act AND sing. I was just really disappointed by the film. The scenery was spectacular but the film wasn't. Too bad. I'm sad.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Does not waste its emotion, but delivers an ideal cocktail of bouncy exuberance and self-effacing humour","For the sake of making things abundantly clear right from the start, those whom generally harbour a dislike or intolerance of the movie musical genre, be forewarned: Mamma Mia! is not the film for you. It is not a film which will change anyone's mind regarding the genre by refuting general criticisms of musicals offering only shallow, superficial spectacle at the expense of content, potentially irritating bouncy exuberance and credibility straining anti-realism. Nor does it intend to be such a film, as Mamma Mia!, rather than attempting to overcome such potential concerns, embraces and exemplifies them with a cheery charm, making otherwise vacuous source material brim with such incessant energy that one cannot help but either be consumed by it or discount it completely.Yet the fact that Mamma Mia! is content as a film to settle for supremely bouncy entertainment rather than striving for further complexity does not indicate the film remains within a blissfully ignorant bubble of its own froth. Director Phyllida Lloyd is shrewd enough to inject her film with a slyly self-referential sense of humour, never afraid to poke fun at itself or the inherent silliness of the musical genre it is highly aware it fully subscribes to. It would even be an overstatement to say the film offers no deeper thematic complexity whatsoever, as a faintly detectable air of quietly introspective sadness circles around Streep's character and her reflections on aging and past party-filled lifestyle. But for the most part, the film's aim is abundantly clear - to be as silly, upbeat and flat out entertaining as possible, cranking out elaborate dance numbers to the continually thumping beat of absurdly catchy ABBA songs and proving so infectious that even the most skeptical viewers who manage to see the film through will find it exceedingly difficult to avoid singing and dancing along. While the film can hardly be considered a cinematic masterpiece, taking it at face value for all it aimed to be, it can be considered no less than a jovial success.The majority of the film's merits come from its talented cast, throwing themselves into the fray with unashamed abandon and the sense of fun they appear to be having is undeniably contagious. Meryl Streep alone makes the film worth viewing, belting out songs and performing acrobatic dance feats with the energy, skill and spunk of a woman half her age. But apart from mere musical interlude plaudits, Streep fills the screen with the star presence only she can truly deliver, contributing a wisdom etched sense of dignity and utter plausibility, making her character's embracing of her sillier, more fun loving past all the more triumphantly genuine. Amanda Seyfield also sparkles with appropriate energy and starry eyed enthusiasm as Streep's daughter, aiming to discover which of her mother's three past beaus was her birth father. As said potential parents, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and (delightfully unorthodox piece of casting) Stellen Skarsgard all have a great time embarrassing themselves, making up for their woeful lack of singing capabilities with witty, measured and charismatic performances. Similarly, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are a riot as Streep's fun loving friends, and Dominic Cooper delivers strong vocals and impressively earnest acting talent as Seyfield's free thinking fiancé.While few films will divide audiences so definitively, Mamma Mia! is commendable for never striving to be anything more than an infectiously bouncy and cheerily entertaining expanse of time, with Lloyd's willingness to poke fun at her own film adding a welcome tinge of upbeat irony. The film is single-minded enough in its purpose that those who will not be able to stand it should know well in advance, and those well versed in such fare should be swept away, having nothing less than a supremely fun time.-7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Knowing Me, Knowing You- Is This The Best You Can Do?","Donna Sheridan is an American expat running a small hotel on one of the Greek islands. Donna's daughter Sophie is getting married, and wants her father to give her away. Unfortunately, Sophie does not actually know who her father is. To make matters worse, even Donna (evidently something of a slut in her young days) does not know who Sophie's father is either, although she has managed to narrow it down to a shortlist of three:- Harry (British), Bill (Swedish) and Sam (American, although you wouldn't think so from Pierce Brosnan's accent). Unknown to Donna, Sophie invites all three men to the wedding. That's all the plot you need to know. The rest is just a series of excuses to sing one ABBA song after another. I'm just surprised they didn't make one of Donna's lovers a South American revolutionary named Fernando and thereby tick off another song.I have a confession to make. I am probably the only heterosexual British male of my generation who likes ABBA, or at least who likes them in a straightforward way and not in an ironic, postmodernist spirit of ""I know they're naff, but then naff is the new cool!"" Even in their heyday in the seventies and eighties it was fashionable to sneer at them as uncool, and even I cannot deny that they wore some seriously bad costumes. (But what seventies pop star didn't?) To my mind, however, Andersson and Ulvaeus were in the same league as Lennon and McCartney, or Simon and Garfunkel, when it came to writing unforgettable pop tunes, even though my interest in the group may also have had something to do with the looks of its two female members.Unfortunately, however, I cannot say I liked this film, and there are three main reasons why I didn't. The first is to do with the basic concept. In all great stage and screen musicals the principle is story first, songs second. The purpose of the songs is to serve the story by illustrating the thoughts and feelings of the characters. ""Mamma Mia!"" inverts this principle by putting the story at the service of the songs. ABBA's songs, of course, were individual pop songs written over a number of years. They were not written in order to tell a coherent story, so the only way a musical can be based around them is to concoct a very contrived plot.Not all of ABBA's songs were cheerful ones; they also wrote their fair share of songs like ""Chiquitita"", ""SOS"" and ""The Winner Takes It All"", dealing with the pains of unhappy love affairs. ""Mamma Mia!"", however, like the song from which it takes its name, is quite remorselessly cheerful, the sort of film in which nothing seriously bad is allowed to happen. We hear all the above-mentioned songs, but in the context not of genuine unhappiness but merely of irritation at some trivial upset, which weakens their impact.The second reason why I didn't like the film is to do with the songs themselves. Pop singers, provided the music is good enough, can often get away with dodgy lyrics, but in musicals the words take on greater importance. Benny and Bjorn may have been gifted musicians, but few would have considered them gifted lyricists. Contrary to popular belief, most of their songs were originally written in English (""Waterloo"", written for the Eurovision Song Contest, was an exception), but all too often they sounded as though they had been written in Swedish and then translated into English by someone with a less than fluent grasp of either language. (Sample, from ""When All is Said and Done"":-""In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex"").Why the lovely Frida, in her mid-thirties at the time she performed this song, felt the need to deny that she was too old for sex is beyond me. Moreover, ABBA's lyrics do not always fit the music well; for example, ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" (a song not performed in this film) is about divorce, but one would not have thought so from the catchy, upbeat melody.My third reason has to do with the performances. It has long been taken for granted in the film industry that Meryl Streep can do just about anything demanded of her, but we now know there is an exception to that rule. She can't sing- at least not to the standard normally required of those aspiring to the leading role in a cinematic musical. Dame Meryl's attempt at ""The Winner Takes it All"", perhaps ABBA's most ambitious song, was particularly wanting. She was, however, not the worst singer on display here- there was some competition for that dubious distinction, but the honour must go either to Brosnan or Julie Walters. The exception was Amanda Seyfried (Sophie), who has a sweet and melodious voice, but she makes up for her above-average singing with some below-average acting. Her only techniques for expressing emotion are to open her wide blue eyes even wider and to flash her large but perfectly formed teeth. (Incidentally, Sophie's dazzling piano-keyboard dentition seems to give the lie to the idea that she has spent her whole life in Greece; Europeans generally do not share the American obsession with cosmetic dentistry).No doubt anyone who goes to this film looking to have an undemanding good time will end up having one. Anyone, however, who is looking for more than that is likely to be disappointed. This is not a film that does great credit to those in it or, for that matter, to ABBA. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
An awesome Movie to uplift your spirit!,"It is hard not to like Abba music. I was shocked to see a movie made after the successful Broadway play based on Abba's music. I was even more shocked to hear Meryl Streep was one of the title characters. She is a A list actress after all. Boy, was I surprised after watching this movie! It was great to see Meryl play such a fun loving character.Christine Baranski can steal a scene every time she is on camera. She is one amazing actress. Julie Walters was a hoot. I am not sure I am used to hearing Pierce Brosnan sing yet. I have watched the ""Dancing Queen"" scene about 30 times! So, my advice, don't go looking for excellent singers.

Meryl Streep is the dancing queen!,"Like most musicals, Mamma Mia! does nothing to hide its blatantly artificial nature: it's a collection of intermittently enjoyable songs by the Swedish pop group ABBA and deliberately ridiculous coreographies, all woven together by a thin yet somehow plausible ""plot"" and carried by a committed cast. It's silliness for its own sake, and most of the time it actually works.The story unfolds on a Greek island where a young girl, Sophie (the lovely Amanda Seyfried), is about to marry her beloved Sky (Dominic Cooper), her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) and her ""aunts"" (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) being in charge of making everything perfect. Only Sophie's father is missing, and for a very good reason: not even Donna knows who he is! Nevertheless, Sophie manages to retrieve her mother's diary and finds three potential dads thanks to it: Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), Harry Bright (Colin Firth) and Bill Andersson (Stellan Skarsgård). Not knowing which one to invite, she makes sure all three of them show up. And as the titular song goes, here we go again...The plot is, of course, utterly ludicrous, its sole function being to act as an introduction for the musical numbers (this has to do with the fact that the original stage version was created around the pre-existing songs). The singing and dancing is the movie's sole reason to exist, and there it has both its strength and its undoing: unlike, say, Chicago, it manages to retain its wild energy during the music-free ""interludes"", but unlike Chicago it also suffers from having set-ups of varying interest. Basically, it boils down to this: whenever Streep, who sings like an angel, or Brosnan, in his best non-Bond role to date, are involved, there is nothing better; otherwise, it's pretty much hit and miss (with more hisses than hits, unfortunately).Overall, this isn't a movie people will remember with the same fondness as they do Moulin Rouge or The Sound of Music, but its delightful silliness, largely spot-on humor and exhilarating performances are enough to keep everyone entertained for a couple of hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

This revolutionary musical is an ideal combination and takes us to the past, the innocence, the way our lives should be, the nature, the beautiful islands, our loved ones.Movie-wise, I totally enjoyed it.

Dot ... Dot ... Dot,"Greetings again from the darkness. In the interest of full disclosure, I was not fortunate enough to have seen the Broadway version and I know the stage aficionados are not necessarily pleased with the screen version. Judging it strictly as a film musical, I will say it had me laughing out loud, tapping my toes, singing along (in my head) and most importantly ... fully engaged in the story. This is pure entertainment that most adults will really get a kick out of it.The best place to begin is with the incomparable Meryl Streep. Besides being the best actor and singer in the film, she just knows when to push it and when to let the others have their moment. She is a marvel to behold.The story is simple (and inherently funny) ... 20 yr old daughter reads mom's diary and discovers she has 3 possible fathers and, without her mother's knowledge, invites all 3 to her wedding in hopes of solving the mystery. The three forced-amigos are all well played by Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard (very much against his type!). None can sing very well, though Brosnan gives it his all ... twice!.To balance the influx of men, we are also treated to Streep's two best friends in brilliant performances by Christine Baranski and Julie Walters. Sure, you can accuse both of over-acting, by I contend the entertainment value is even higher thanks to their willingness to push the envelope.Streep's daughter is played with extreme bright eyes by Amanda Seyfried, who is just terrific whether singing on the beach or scheming against her unknowing mom. Seyfried's fiancé is played by up and comer Dominic Cooper.Of course, the ABBA music dominates ... it is after all a full fledged MUSICAL. Don't miss Bjorn Ulraeus as the beach piano player! The sing-along songs are just a blast in this setting. If you go in expecting to have fun, you too will find yourself dancing in your seats and humming ""Take A Chance on Me"", ""Dancing Queen"" or about 6 others.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stunningly bad,"I will preface this by stating that I am a big fan of movie musicals, be they off-the-wall masterpieces such as 'Dancer in the Dark', top-end popcorn fare ('Hairspray') or Broadway adaptations ('Chicago', 'Evita' et al). So, no-one can accuse me of hating the genre, and blaming my negatives comments on that. Abba are the undisputed monarchs of modern pop, and I adore them. I wanted to adore this movie. I really did. I have to say, I found the stage version contrived and obvious, and didn't enjoy it at all. But I really did think that given the freedom of location shooting and a top-notch casting, this could be something special. How wrong I was.The fact that this movie made so much money (highest grossing movie musical ever?!) and has a rating as high as 6.9 on IMDb astounds me. It is testament to the popularity - and brilliance - of Abba. It has to be. Because this movie is gobsmackingly bad. Just dreadful. I watched it at the theatre in disbelief. I recently rented it again, following its phenomenal success, just to be sure. Yeah  it sucks.Blame the director. Not only is it full of ill-advised and badly timed farce, but it is shoddily choreographed and looks like it has been edited with a pair of children's scissors. This is a theater director who is making her first feature film, and boy does it show. Messy is not the word. Clichés work well on stage. They even work well on film, if they are used in context and with a knowing wink. But here... oh my God. I cringed through most of the movie, at the sheer depth of its amateur look and feel. The part where Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan are singing back to back with a wall in between them oh my God. Not a hint of irony. And so-obvious-it-could-be-film-school shot framing and camera 'trickery' beyond description.The ONLY saving grace is the energy of the cast. Streep, Baranski, Walters and co. launch into this with so much gusto that they manage to make it not just bearable, but actually watchable. The female leads are a joy to watch, and the music itself means that I was certainly not bored. And when I found myself not being swept along by the music, it was fun to marvel at just how badly made a movie with this pedigree can be. And as for Pierce Brosnan. Sweet Jesus, NEVER let that man near a microphone again. EVER. I'm sure his performance was pitched as camp and hammy, but just comes off as amateur and embarrassing.On the plus side there is one song/set piece that works beautifully  a lovely scene just before the wedding, with Meryl singing 'Slipping Through My fingers' as she helps her daughter get ready. Simple and affecting, it's what the rest of the movie should have been like. And (ironically) a deleted version of 'The Name of the Game' that has a similar feel. They deleted it presumably because it wasn't in keeping with the sheer crapness of the rest of the movie.Make sure you have a few drinks first and prepare for what is quite possibly the most badly made big budget movie for quite some time  and you will probably enjoy it.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
How can I resist you,"The pop group Abba did produce great songs and their music has lasted. My daughter loved Abba even when she was a toddler, she was born years after the band had broken up. I had to book tickets for the musical Mamma Mia on a visit to London some years ago because she kept pestering us and she was only 5 years old at the time.This film adaptation of the musical consists of Abba's greatest hits wrapped around a thin story. It really is a greatest hits musical and if you think about it, some of the main cast (Meryl Streep) are too old for the role.Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is getting married in her idyllic Greek island and wants to invite her father. However she has no idea who he is. Her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) had three lovers in a short space of time when she was a young woman and then fell pregnant. Donna has raised Sophie on her own and also ran a dilapidated hotel.By looking at her mum's diary Sophie has tracked down the three men, Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) Harry (Colin Firth) Sam (Pierce Brosnan) and invited them to the island who all come looking for Donna.Obviously Donna would had been a teenager when she had her lovers making her a woman in her early 40s when Sophie gets married.The film is cheesy fun but the songs do come thick and first almost to paper over the cracks in the story and in Donna's hotel. You cannot help getting involved with the fun and silliness as well as listening to Brosnan's singing. You have to laugh at Christine Baranski and Judy Walters trying to entice the men.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Horrible,"When I first heard about this movie, I was somewhat excited to see it. It seemed like it would be a fun movie, and being as I love musicals, I was sold on it.However, I was completely disappointed. The choice for Sophie was poor, she simply wasn't a good actress. She rarely showed emotion in any of the scenes, and talked as if she was acting in a middle school play. I also feel that Meryl Streep was a poor choice for her mother. They desperately tried to turn her into a hot, young mother. A whole new cast might have saved this movie, assuming they got different writers.The only thing that saved the movie for me were the songs. I loved almost every song sequence. The sound was great, but visually it wasn't. Poorly choreographed, and some of them tried for humor (Dancing Queen sounded great, but the scene was just awkward enough to make me laugh.I wish I would have left halfway though the movie, but I had nothing better to do that night.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

In short, Streep plays a funny, heart-warming role as Donna, and Colin Firth (Coah!!) looks just as sexy as ever. Pierce Brosnan - wow, but can't sing to save his life! Julie Walters is fantastic, but looks somewhat dykish (on purpose??) and Christine B... can't remember her name but anyway, they're all brilliant as the outlandish 70s trio.

Mama Mia falls a bit short,"Mama Mia falls a bit short for me. Meryl Streep is not a believable 40 something. Nor is Pierce, Boranski, her friend or the blond. All are too old for the part. It is a musical. One would hope they could sing and dance a bit. Especially since Meryl was supposed to have been a rock singer. Meryl could just sing. No range. No power. No musical art. Pierce has a poor voice...when measured against pros....Ahh the possibilities.The story is not low brow. More of a Greek/Shakespearian comedy. People are drawn to island to witness or participate in a wedding and to resolve the bride's parentage issues in order to achieve a standard, white wedding, parental blessing. The Greek Gods (possibly the fairy king?) seem to intercede to confuse a simple plan into a comedy of errors as each player has a separate take on the auspiciousness of such a revelation. Personally, I think the various characters could have been crafted far more artfully and with much greater humor. Ultimately the story reveals a true tragedy of ill starred love....Albeit not nearly as well as Shakespeare would have....Only to have...Aphrodite?.... unleash her well spring of love (and not a little forgiveness) for the benefit of those that have suffered long enough without it. What a wonderful opportunity to do something great...missed.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Meryl Streep is as good as it gets, as always.

Her 'singing' could wake up the dead. It is impossible to believe that a character looking like that could ever have attracted, let alone, slept with 3 guys!

Meryl Streep was OUTSTANDING, especially in her solo of ""Winner Takes All"" (if she doesn't bring home another Oscar for her mantle after this, the Academy must be on crack)! Amanda Seyfried comes off the bench from ""Big Love"" and hit's a home run throughout the show. What a great talent this beautiful and talented young lady is and I hope we see more of her on the Big Screen. And Pierce Brosnan brings his charm and good looks to round the movie out.

We didn't know that Colin Firth could sing and dance, Stellan Skarsgård who usually plays the guy you love to hate becomes the guy you love to love, Christine Baranski who stole scenes in ""The Birdcage"" and ""The Grinch"" steals the scenes in this too (you gotta see her sing ""Does Your Mother Know""- she's a killer!), Julie Walters' character is a complete departure from her usual ""Harry Potter"" role and is great comic relief... I could go on and on! And the best part- knowing that ABBA not only continues to transcend from one generation to the next, but also has crossed all medias- live concerts, recordings, radio, TV, Broadway, and now the Big Screen- and continues to entertain and wow the crowds.

Why would the producers/directors/writers of a movie that plays tribute to the songs of ABBA allow this awful voice to sing such a classic as ""SOS?"" Let me be clear, Brosnan can act. He killed it playing 007, for example? But he must know he can't sing. I'll admit it didn't kill the movie for me, but having seen Mamma Mia on Broadway, it was disappointing.

Set in the sunshine of a Greek Island how could the scenery fail? And the chorus, presumably composed of young professionals- excellent. That is as far as I can go with praise however. The Movie was a disaster because of the casting of the four main characters who were each so far out of their comfort zone as to be totally lost.

Funny and enjoyable even without the music,"I liked the music of ABBA in the 1970s. Or rather, I liked the familiar music of ABBA. This movie features a lot of songs I never heard and for the most part don't like. But part of the appeal of ABBA songs is those beautiful voices. An added bonus, as I found out after Dick Clark died and ABC showed a New Year's Eve special with the best moments from New Year's Eves past, is seeing those good-looking girls perform.This movie had a perfectly good plot without the songs. I liked the mystery of who Sophie's father is. I liked all the comedy and seeing Meryl Streep not take herself too seriously. The film was especially funny when each potential Dad realized he must be Sophie's Dad.The songs do add something. Some of them have dancing that is fun to watch. And Streep gets to be even more silly. Plus she's quite flexible, but that's nothing compared to Christine Baranski, who apparently can move like a circus performer.The natives seemed real enough. I'm referring to the people who didn't seem American or British who apparently had always lived wherever this movie took place.I don't even remember the names of the potential fathers, but they all did a good job. Particularly the one with the boat. Pierce Brosnan was my favorite of the three, and he could even sing. Well, he had the talent that George Burns has for singing. In other words, not really singing talent, but you like him enough you don't care. Sadly, I saw the movie ""Evelyn"" around the same time I saw this, and he sang in that too. He wasn't any better and yet his character was trying to make a living.I could have done without the wild rock concert at the end. Surely Streep has more dignity than that.

She has 3 possible fathers and wants to know which one of them she shares DNA with.,"Mamma Mia itself was, in my opinion very cheesy. How could such a successful play turn into such a terrible movie? Pierce Brosnan really needs some singing lessons because he actually ruined some parts of the movie with his singing. I really enjoyed this movie but it could have been improved so much. The cast was great because it included Meryl Streep,(Donna), Amanda Seyfried(Sophie),Pierce Brosnan(Sam),Colin Firth(Harry),Stellan Skarsgard(Bill),Julie Walters(Rosie),and Christine Baranski(Tanya). They should have kept it a play because as a play it was wonderful with all the ABBA songs.The setting of the movie was stunning and every scene was better than the next!

Take a chance ... just for the sheer fun of it,"As gratifying as it is for me to see, say, a deeply meaningful foreign-language or independent film about the nature of man or the fundamental questions of life, there is something to be said about seeing a movie that makes absolutely no pretensions about what it is.""Mamma Mia!"" is made for the sheer fun of it all. True, it is banking on the immense popularity of the stage musical, which I have seen and thoroughly enjoyed. (For the sake of full disclosure, I grew up an ABBA fan. You couldn't turn on the radio from the mid-1970s to the very early '80s without hearing one of their songs.)I am giving away no secrets here - the plot of ""Mamma Mia! is flimsy at best. If you can call it a plot, that is. The basic premise - a young girl trying to find out who her real dad is on the eve of her wedding - is merely an excuse to string along a whole number of ABBA songs. It was so in the stage musical and it is the same in the movie.The film relies on the charm of the songs - let's face it, ABBA was a genius at linking simple lyrics to catchy tunes. And once their songs get into your head, it's awfully difficult to get rid of them. Try listening to ""Dancing Queen,"" ""Take a Chance on Me,"" ""Waterloo"" or ""Mamma Mia!"" on the radio without finding yourself humming the tune or singing the song just minutes later.The film takes a bit to get going. But it does settle down after the initial screech-fests when Sophie's two friends and Donna's two friends are introduced. The film's thin plot unwinds and all the actors gamely throw themselves lustily into the musical.What surprised me about the movie was the filmmakers managed to find some pathos, some real emotion, if you will, in the midst of this disco nostalgia. Much of the credit goes to Meryl Streep, who carries this film. She brings such exuberance to her role that it's downright impossible not to be utterly charmed by her Donna. She is a marvel here and her rendition of ""The Winner Takes It All"" had some women in the audience reaching for their tissues at the screening I attended. Streep knows how to belt it and her take on the song is as emotionally potent as it was when Agnetha first sang the number in the waning days of the musical group.The rest of the cast is good, too, though with their shortfalls. Pierce Brosnan singing ""S.O.S."" might be the cringe-inducing moment of the year. But I suppose it's forgivable to look beyond his vocal shortfall because the others make up for it and the music takes you along for a wonderful ride. Stellan Skarsgard clearly is having fun and if you ever had any questions about his talent, watch his reaction when he speaks to Sophie during ""Gimme, Gimme, Gimme."" That alone might be worth the price of admission. Though his vocal talents might be on par with Mr. Brosnan.Christine Baranski is a fine comedic actress - and the role is tailor-made for her - and a sensationally good singer. She brings so much sass to her role, I couldn't really envision anyone else in it - okay, Bebe Neuwirth perhaps - and winds up having the best musical scene in the movie. If her number on the beach doesn't get you toe-tapping, I suppose nothing will.Christine Johnson's screenplay doesn't exactly sizzle; her dialogue serves as mere transitions to the next song. But you aren't really going to see this movie for its crackling dialogue, are you? The film also would have benefited from more inventive choreography, especially during the initial moments of Streep's rendition of ""Mamma Mia!""While watching ""Mamma Mia!"" it occurred to me that I was actually having fun. That's one of the wonders of movies and certainly is one of the film's many charms. Sometimes it's refreshing to sit in a darkened theatre and just have fun watching a movie.I have no doubt ABBA fans will love this film. But others should enjoy it as well because it actually is a surprisingly engaging piece of entertainment. True, it's silly popcorn entertainment. But given how much mediocre stuff Hollywood puts out yearly, it is nice to have some truly entertaining, goofy fluff. Frankly, the last time I had this much fun watching a movie was Shane Black's ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" (2005).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"More of a chick-flic than ""Sex and the City""","My first thought upon leaving the movie was, ""Can I get the last two hours of my life back?"" Turns out, I can't - so I wrote this review instead to tell others what the movie's faults (and qualities) are so maybe you won't make the same mistake as I did.The movie starts out like a teen summer romance with upbeat musical numbers, but quickly descends from there. The teen-aspect is almost immediately dominated by a group of 50's+ old women acting like bratty 15+ teenie-boppers, talking about how much sex they're having (or not having). Between the over-acting of Julie Walters and main character Amanda Seyfried (who does manage to be cute in the rare moments when she isn't straight up annoying) to the unconvincing acting of Meryl Streep, there just aren't any characters lovable enough to make the viewer care what happens next.On the positive side, the movie did manage to be funny (twice, at least). Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to make up for the uninspired plot. The singing (which is ubiquitous) ranges from Pierce Brosnan and Meryl Streep's mediocre notes (which are flat almost as often as they're on pitch) to downright bad for much of the rest of the cast. And just where is this movie supposed to take place? At one point they suggest that Sophie is Greek, but the title and the location are given Italian names, and most of the cast is given Irish accents, with a few American and British accents thrown in. One is tempted to guess (for this and other reasons) that the director slept through most of this production.So, the bottom line: should you see it? Maybe, if you're a fifty-something cougar of an old woman who wants to relive the 60's with other crones from that generation who refuse to act their age. But if you're a guy, make sure your cell phone has plenty of games on it before you let your girlfriend drag you to this one.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great actors do some questionable singing,"Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is getting marry, and she wants to invite her father. So she invites 3 possibles from her mother's (Meryl Streep) past loves. The actors are all great The story is rom-com cheese, but that's not the problem.The biggest problem is the singing from these actors. Many of them are not natural singers. Luckily Seyfried is actually a sweet pretty singer. I wouldn't say the same for Streep. Although Streep puts it all out there, and the spectacle of her doing a musical is enough to get me to watch. She just needs to burn that ugly pair of overalls.There is a varying degree of singing talents among Stellan Skarsgård, Colin Firth, and Pierce Brosnan. Colin has to be the best, and Stellan is surprisingly good. However Pierce stands out with his talk-singing. It's the most embarrassing performance until Russell Crowe in 'Les Misérables'. Of all the actors, the best singer has to be Christine Baranski. She's a natural in a musical.I like ABBA just not my favorite band. I like the ABBA song 'The Winner Takes It All' the most because it's actually about something personal. And this song occurs at a crucial time dramatically. But Streep does too much on-the-nose gesturing, and Brosnan can't do much other than just stand there. It's a small hiccup in what could have been amazing.This would have always had a certain amount of cheese factor. Pierce Brosnan didn't help any. Meryl Streep is the greatest actor ever, but there is a lot to be desired about her musical theater work.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
And The Winner of Worst Film Ever Is...,"Without trying to sound too much like a rant, this film, everything about it, was terrible. From start to finish...The first half an hour of the film was loud girly screeching noises which (this could just be my preference, i don't know) does NOT make for good cinema.Maybe i just didn't understand the film...People were in hysterics? I had no idea a one and a half hour Abba tribute music video could be funny? It wasn't...Call me a bore, a killjoy whatever, but this film was neither entertaining, fun, good or any of the above. The acting was poor, but what else could it be? They were given five minutes a piece to try and inject some emotion into an emotionless story before bursting into a random and meaningless song. An example of this is when the husband/fiancée, no idea what his name was as he was that forgettable, questioned whether he really wanted the weddings, yet after a song and dance routine and no discussion he suddenly has a change of heart. Hardly the Shawshank Redemption for thoroughness is it...And the entire point of the story, apart from the shameless Abba tribute, an original idea itself (note: sarcastic tone), is to find the identity of her father. Here's a better way...""Hi, i think you might be my dad, would you mind joining me in a DNA test?"" Instead of ""Hi, you might be my dad, come to a wedding on a remote Greek island, sing and dance like an idiot for 90 minutes"" Awful, awful film...Begin slating me...",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
It made me want to vomit.,"I'm afraid I have to rate this as one of the greatest pieces of crap I have ever witnessed. I hated this film so much that I registered with IMDb just to say how awful it was.You would be better off watching paint dry, far more entertaining.The story is non existent, the plot is non existent.I realise this is meant to be a girly flick but I cannot for the life of me, imagine how anyone over 10 years old actually likes this thing.And yet it has quite a good IMDb rating so go figure. Mind you, Bush was made president of the US and K.Rudd was made prime minister of Australia, so anything really is possible - no matter how stupid.In summary, I found this film an insult to one's intelligence.",,Anonymous,Romance
Musi-can,"I'm not a big Musical fan myself. But I have to admit, this was kind of well made. One of the main things that works here, that didn't work in ""Walking on Sunshine"" for example, is the acting. You have some pretty great actors in this and they make you forget about all the clichés that are in this.Even so, the clichés never reach the level the other mentioned movie had. But let's not talk about failures (even if the soundtrack of the other movie was great too, though not fitting half the time), but about this and the really nice location it has too. The light mood, the direction and the suave this has, elevate it to a level that even people who are not into musicals might enjoy ... those who like them will anyway",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Marvellous, fun and a 'must see'","I took an Abba fan to see this movie and found that I am probably a latent Abba fan too! I never thought much about the group except for 'Dancing Queen' which has certain pleasant personal memories for me, but I realised last night that the music is probably present in all of us and just waiting for this movie to come along and remind us of all sorts of forgotten good times.We have all been to some part of this movie and be aware that all of this movie is definite 'feel good', 'good times', 'holiday', 'holiday romance' and everything that sadly some of us forget.Who cares if certain people can't sing! I can't sing but I was singing last night. I was singing all night, even words I didn't know I knew!!Photography, colour, scenery all get to the soul and leave you feeling good about life.

How Can I Resist You?,"It's really weird how the inner-workings of my brain function. Sometimes I'll be completely turned off by cheesy musicals (or cheesy films in general). Other times, I get a real joy out of watching something cheesy with earnest and intended heartfelt emotion. It's a case by case basis and depends on my mood I guess. 'Mamma Mia!' falls somewhere in between. The musical based off the broadway play, which is in turn based off music from ABBA, is outrageously silly and really lacks coherence in most parts. But it also contains endlessly catchy ABBA music and some performances that you absolutely cannot miss. And not necessarily great performances, more like actors you can't miss doing stupid-cheesy-musical stuff.The last paragraph is hardly written well, and that tends to fit the tone of the film. Sporadic, unexplainably and questionably sensual, colorful, with some (perhaps unintentionally) laugh out loud moments. It's not like this movie acts like it's an awards contender, although Streep was inexplicably nominated for a Globe that year (not like the Globes are the end-all be-all of award shows anyway). However, the cast is an impressive ensemble. Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Julie Walters, Stellan Skarsgard, and Christine Baranski among others.There are some undeniably cringe worthy moments, most of which include actors or actresses who aren't musically inclined and attempt to perform a musical number. I hate to say it, but it reminded me of some cringey Disney Channel Original Movies. Which is why this movie can be a pain to watch but possibly a joy to re-watch. However, it can't be overstated how much of a soft-spot I have for ABBA's music, especially with this cheese-ball acting behind it. For that alone, I'm looking forward to the second film this summer.6.0/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Magical Movie,"Mamma Mia is the most magical movie of the spring and summer. What charm - what happiness. ""Dancing Queen"" was so spectacular that I had tears in my eyes. I haven't felt that way since I saw John Travolta sing and dance the number ""Welcome To The Sixties"" from HAIRSPRAY. The duet between Meryl Streep and Sophie was exquisite and poignant. I found creative cleverness with the use of the chorus; reminiscent of a a ""Greek Chorus"" commenting in a tragedy. Most of the songs work well within the framework of the story line, while the scenery of the Greek Isle only added to the joy of the movie. So Pierce didn't sing so well, it certainly didn't spoil the movie. I can't wait to see it again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stupefyingly bad,"A flat-footed movie musical that is in the same league as Darling Lili, The Wiz, Xanadu and Sgt. Peppers' Lonely Hearts Club Band; being so bad that it's just plain bad. OK, maybe it's less annoying than Godspell(73), but that's about the best to be said for it. What appears to be home movie vacation footage has been directed without rhythm or purpose by one Phyllida Lloyd. Mamma Mia is a pointless reworking of the plot of Buona Sera Mrs. Campbell(68) which merely serves as an excuse for the cast to break into ABBA songs and cavort about sans proper lighting, direction, and vocal endowments, making unappealing and amateurish asses of themselves. Pierce Brosnon especially should leave this one off of his resume; his singing is painful. The sense of larkish fun in the film seems forced, and the characters are too old for their antics to be charming; they seem to be suffering from arrested development. Though the cast may be having a good time, the audience isn't. Can't Stop the Music, The Apple, and The Cool Ones are at least campy fun.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty bad,"Mamma Mia will go down in film history as 2008's Lost Horizon. www.imdb.com/title/tt0070337 It was badly cast, badly filmed, badly lit and badly written. This should have been a celebration, but it is really nothing more than a dud. It is proof, yet again, that the person who directed it on stage should not be allowed to transfer it to screen. Susan Stroman's horrible film version of The Producers should have been a lesson to all, but then this mess of a movie is made and makes the same mistakes all over again. If anyone can believe any of the relationships in this film, then it is a mystery to me how, as nothing about it rang true. Even on a whimsical level, it was a bad effort. and this is from someone who grew up loving Abba and enjoyed the stage show for the bit of lighthearted fun it was. But this movie never reaches that either. It has no idea what it is meant to be, and fails on every level. And if you never thought Meryl Streep could give a bad performance, take a look at this and she achieves that feat here.",,Anonymous,Romance
"A funny, feel-good movie. Great adaptation","Of course it won't win any oscars. I agree that some of the actors' singing voices aren't the best.

Good fun,"Straight off the bat - I have never been to the cinema and had such an enjoyable time. I don't know if it was just because it was a Friday night and people were hyper, but all the way through people were laughing, dancing in their chairs and generally having fun. It was such a great experience. My friends and I left the screen literally dancing - and we weren't the only ones! Onto the movie - I adored it. It was bright and colourful, some gorgeous cinematography. I now want to move to Greece in a run down hotel. Some of the dance sequences were wonderful (Dancing Queen, Lay all your love on me), it was a struggle not to get up and dance! Meryl Streep was fabulous, I had no idea she could sing so well. She was so energetic and she bounced off Julie Walters and Christine Baranski like they really had been friends for years. I wouldn't say anyone in the film had an absolutely stunning voice, they weren't technically perfect, but the amount of emotion and enthusiasm that was put into the film as whole made that irrelevant.Go see it.

Mamma Mia! It is really good!,"The musical is a genre that I have to confess I do quite enjoy. The older musicals such as Sound of Music, Grease, Annie don't interest me in the slightest, but then again my mum killed Sound of Music with endless repeats many years ago. However the more recent musicals have really been quite brilliant. Starting off with Moulin Rouge really, sure it wasn't a stage show before hand, sure it was odd, but my god it was brilliant. Chicago followed suit, although this time being adapted from a screen show. And in the past year two of my all time favourite musicals, Hairspray and Sweeney Todd, have all been made and been amazing. However two previously stage show musicals that did not do so well had to be The Producers (enjoyable but uninspired), and the dismal Phantom of the Opera that had me crawling at the walls. So I was unsure how good Mamma Mia would be, take out the songs would it be lame and uninspired, or would the story hold together. Thankfully Mamma Mia is a truly brilliant musicals and also the feel good film of the summer! The film features an extremely strong cast, brilliant songs, and a story which while unoriginal does hold together and works quite well. But what makes the movie work so damned well has to be the certain level of charm, you can't help but smile for some reason. Perhaps it is ABBA's infectious songs, perhaps its Meryl Streep giving a superb performance, either way it still makes for a brilliant movie.So onto the cast and of course their singing voice. When Meryl Streep was announced as the lead Donna I was unsure how she would work, but after seeing the movie I have no idea why I doubted her. Her performance here reinforces the fact that she really is one of the greatest actresses of our time. And by god does she have a good singing voice as well. Its her brilliant rendition of Mamma Mia and Dancing Queen that really livens the film up. Right up until then the movie does seem to drag a tiny bit. Amanda Seyfried is surprisingly brilliant as Amanda, the girl the wedding all revolves around. We'll hopefully be seeing a lot more of her after this movie. Pierce Brosnan does well in the talking moments, yet not so well in the singing department. He starts off terribly but does seem to improve. Colin Firth is pretty good and much like St Trinian's proves he doesn't take himself too seriously. Stellen Skarsgard is decent in a pretty limited role to be honest. Julie Walters is a hoot as the brilliant aunt, her final scene being truly priceless.Mamma Mia of course is mostly all about the songs, and while a few of the songs weren't as recognisable to me as others, the main songs, Dancing Queen, Mamma Mia, Money, Money, Money etc, are all there and are all done to absolutely perfection. But the very best song comes courtesy of Meryle Streep on top of a mountain singing The Winner Takes It All, its the emotional height of the movie and it is just amazing. Definitely one of the best scenes of the year so far. But thankfully the story does work very well. You're kept guessing right up to the very end who the actual father is, and there are a few twists and turns along the way as well that make the movie a more interesting ride. The direction and script are also done pretty well. The only reason this fall short of being as good as Hairspray to be honest is the movie does hit a snag ten minutes in and roughly twenty minutes before the end. The movie doesn't have as many songs and it seems a tiny bit dull without them. Still the minute the songs start up again the movie is great and lively.Overall Mamma Mia isn't the best scripted, directed movie of all time, but its something light, fluffy and downright entertaining. If you don't like ABBA then avoid this like the plague, but if you find the songs infectious (even if you don't like to admit it as I do) the movie is quite brilliant and worth seeing for Meryl Streep mighty impressive performance alone.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This was fun!,"ABBA is still alive and well, and will always be. Their harmonious melodies are eternal, and will linger still millennia from now. BUT, if you're a die-hard ABBA fan, you might not like the renditions of their popular songs by the actual actors. Or the storyline might add a different perspective to the lyrics...If - like me - you enjoy ABBA music no matter what, then you will love 'Mamma Mia!'. I love the film's premise: Sophie (Amanda Seyfriend) is getting married and wants her Dad to give her away. Sounds simple? Not if you don't know who your Dad is! While this may sound like her Mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) was a loose lass in her day, it is actually really a sweet and kind of romantic story. Having gone through her Mother's diary, Sophie realizes their are three very strong possible Dad candidates, so she invited them all - without her Mother's knowledge.Needless to say, this allows for many hilarious moments. With uncertainty comes responsibility and complications as well, and the film does dish up a good dose of drama elements as well, but never too serious since this is a musical comedy. All the great ABBA songs we know so well, are given new meaning here in the context of the film. The musical segments and choreography blending with excellent cinematography makes for an unforgettable musical spectacle. The setting on the island is picturesque. The stellar cast does a wonderful job, and Meryl Streep can sing!! She's just awesome.I so enjoyed the the mature characters being portrayed as funky and adventurous - especially Donna's friends Tanya and Rosie - beautifully portrayed by Christine Baranski and Julie Walters. Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard and Colin Firth as the potential Dads were charming and likable. For the younger demographic - or the young at heart - Dominic Cooper provided eye candy as Sky, the groom to be.The film doesn't quite end the way you'd expect, but it's all good and a wonderfully entertaining movie. I absolutely love it! (DON'T watch the sequel if you're curious to see what happens next, as the sequel will ruin some of the magic of the original film. I didn't like the sequel 'Mamma Mia: Here we go again' at all.)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Messy and plodding theatre adaptation,"Musical theatre and theater have a symbiotic relationship since the dawn of sound. Movies have been adapted for theatre and staged across the nation and across the world. On the flipside, Hollywood has been taking inspiration for just as long, as seemingly every Broadway success had received a permanent place on the screen.""Mamma Mia!"" is a member of the latter club, being a famous, successful play based upon the songs of disco-transcenders ABBA for years before getting the big-budget, big-setting, big-star permanence here in 2008. But what works on the stage, where there is live action, audience participation, interactive vibes (and most importantly, an intermission), doesn't necessary work on the silver screen. It's closest cinematic relative would be last year's luscious, hate-it-or-love-it Julie Taymor concoction, but ABBA isn't the Beatles, and ""Mamma Mia!"" sure as hell ain't ""Across the Universe"".Where that film also had a flimsy excuse for a plot on which to hang a bunch of famous songs, it succeeded thanks to an absolutely breathtaking visual sensibility, as every scene was a feast for the eyes as well as the ears, and if you didn't necessarily come to care for the characters, it was probably for the best as you almost didn't have time, and another layer may have been sensory overlord. Well, you don't have to worry about that in ""Mamma Mia!"", as the film's visuals are blaaand. The closest director Phyllida Lloyd comes is some crane shots and a few scenes in slow-motion.The film, as stated, a flimsy excuse to sing some songs, is as basic sitcom hijinks plot, a girl is getting married, and wants her long-lost father to come. She finds her mom's diary, and finds that she has three possible fathers, so she secretly invites them all. Hilarity ensues.Unfortunately, it appears that that was as far as they got. Its' Greek setting is pretty, but it does very little, and resembles nothing more than a play...set outside. The sea may be everpresent in the background, but it never feels OPEN, you never smell the air, feel the surf, the sort of things a film is supposed to make you feel. The lighting is garish and looks like the sort of lights you would see in a high school auditorium, lame fills just randomly placed. But the most egregious and downright baffling problem, considering the fact that IT'S BASED ON A SUCCESSFUL PLAY, is the choreography, which is simplistic and unimaginative that it looked like something my podunk college choreographer might have devised...on short notice. A couple steps to the left and right, a couple waves of the arms, and you're done. My grandmother would probably be able to not only memorize but perform this choreography in a matter of hours, and she just had both knees replaced.Speaking of that, another problem. The entire enterprise looks ragged and ugly, and while perhaps they thought that casting old ladies and not letting anyone wear makeup would be sort of endearing or charming or something, but instead, it just comes off like an absence of effort, like they all just called each other up on a Thursday and said ""Hey, wanna do a movie?"" and had the reel in the can by Sunday morning. The fact that the film seems to have no idea about its timeframe only strengthens this suspicion. The three men are referred to and shown as a hippie, a '70s rocker and a punk ""headbanger"", and are said that they all knew Streep biblically within a few weeks of each other, and of course, the daughter is twenty, which goes with none of them. It doesn't matter if they were trying to jokingly play with time, the way it comes off, It just seems sloppy.The one thing that should have worked, regardless of whether or not anything else worked, was the music, and even THAT was tough here. The title track was easily the only song to get any energy behind it, while the most famous ABBA song, ""Dancing Queen"", that should have been an emotional centerpiece, is handled in such a stunningly awkward and embarrassing fashion that it's impossible to enjoy in any sense.The cast does their best to enliven the material, and several of them are too talented to give a bad performance. Amanda Seyfried, who should be the headliner, but apparently someone is unwilling to give her the push, is absolutely adorable, and I was surprised a woman directed the film, because while every other actor in the film is made to look at haggard as possible, the camera seemingly oggles her body at every opportunity. Meryl Streep is equally adorable, loose and funny in spurts, and the three-headed dad monster of Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgaard have a good chemistry between them and are pretty much the entire joy of the film. As for the rest of the cast, though...ugh. Dominic Cooper is empty eye candy for the ladies, Julie Walters is shrill and annoying, and Christine Baranski is a cipher who had no rhythm and is so uncoordinated and wound so tightly that her attempts to dance are as cringeworthy as the fact that they keep putting her in dance scenes.I am absolutely, positively gobsmacked that this film is as short as it is (1:48) The film was on its way to earning itself an extra half-point for a rousing wedding finale...before revealing that it's not actually the finale, and wasted upwards of TWENTY MINUTES unnecessarily tying up lose ends that don't need to be tied up. It just feels so overlong, messy, lacking inspiration and lacking enjoyment. Maybe the play is a bit of harmless fun, but as a film, ""Mamma Mia!"" feels loose when it needs to be resigned, restrained when it needs to be fluid, and just ends up feeling like a waste of time.{Grade: 5/10 (C) / #32 (of 56) of 2008}",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Hollywire's Film Critic Suffers Terribly Through Intolerably Sappy Musical  'Mamma Mia' Review,"It was a very unique and specific kind of torture for me to sit through Mamma Mia, one of the most unendurable pieces of cinematic confection that I can remember ever having experienced ever since I was about ten years old and my mother used to punish my brother and I by making us watch Peggy Sue Got Married. I haven't seen that movie in nearly 20 years and there's a good chance I might enjoy it today, but as a kid it became synonymous with the worst movie ever made.Mamma Mia is not the worst movie ever made. It's not even a bad movie, it's actually pretty good, for what it is. But in order to enjoy it you have to be a fan of the musical and by God, you had better be an ABBA fan.Myself, I can't stand ABBA and I am notorious for hating musicals. There is nothing more distracting than an emotional love scene that is suddenly disrupted as the characters break into song. YAWN.There are a lot of people that will love Mamma Mia, and it is a well-presented adaptation of the successful Broadway play. The locations are stunningly beautiful, the story is well-told and the performances, despite an over-abundance of cartoonish over-acting (mostly on the part of Amanda Seyfried as the afflicted Sophie), are wonderful in their own way.Unfortunately, I happen to agree unequivocally on the subject of musicals with the late Pauline Kael, who wondered about even The Sound of Music, one of the most enduring of musical classics (and the Best Picture of 1965) if there wasn't at least one Von Trapp child who didn't feel like bursting into song and singing his head off along with everyone else. My thoughts exactly about Mamma Mia, and any other musical in which the characters break into song at no other provocation than the gradual rise of the orchestra. It just makes no sense to me.According to Kael, musicals are about ""a freshness that is so mechanically engineered and so shrewdly calculated that the background music rises, the already soft focus blurs and melts, and, upon the instant, you can hear all those noses blowing in the theater.""""Whom could this operetta offend,"" Kael asks? ""Only those of us who, despite the fact that we may respond, loathe being manipulated in this way and are aware of how cheap and ready- made are the responses we are made to feel. We may become even more aware of the way we have been turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs.""Amen to that!The story of Mamma Mia, despite being shrouded in ridiculous sing-a-longs, is about a young lady who has never known her father. She discovers her mother's diary that names three possible, ah, suitors, and she secretly invites them to her wedding in Grece, believing that she will instantly know her real father on sight and can finally bring him into her life.Meryl Streep plays the part of the mother, now living a comfortable single life in an astonishingly beautiful little Greek villa overlooking the Aegean Sea, who has long since moved on from what can only be described as her flagrantly promiscuous youth. Through a series of misunderstandings, the three men who arrive at the wedding all simultaneously come to believe that they are Sophie's father, and each confides in Sophie, before she has a chance to argue, mind you, that it will remain their little secret until they can make the big announcement at the wedding ceremony.If you're wondering how she could manage to get three different men to think that they are her father and those three different men to engage in such one-way conversations with her that they could make exactly the same plans before she could argue with them, then you are wondering about one of the great many preposterous absurdities of the movie's plot.I will admit that I feel like a stick in the mud criticizing what is obviously a popular movie, but it seems pretty accurate to say that you can assume your opinion of the movie will hinge entirely on your opinion of ABBA's sing-writing repertoire, which I find insufferably cheesy and cloying. And the convenience of the ending, in which all loose ends miraculously fit together like jigsaw puzzle pieces, doesn't help.Note: I understand that this review is a bit of a rant, but please understand that this is a movie with a very specific audience in mind, and there won't be many fans of it outside that audience. I'm outside it. Also, I watched the movie with one of my gay friends, and he gleefully sang every song word-for-word in my ear throughout the entire movie. This also did not enhance the experience",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Fantastic!,"An excellent cast, beautiful location, and absolutely fantastic singing and dancing! When I went to see this movie the movie theater was full. All the way through people were laughing and clapping. Meryl Streep was perfect for the role as was Amanda Seyfried. Julie Walters playing Rosie stole the show! In my opinion she was the best character. Her jokes and personality got most of the laughs.The singing and choreography was amazing. Their adaption of the songs from Abba was spot on and sounded wonderful! The main theme of the movie fitted perfectly with all of the songs.I would recommend this movie to everyone!

Streep is Masterful in this Musical Joyride,"MAMMA MIA! is a joyous musical romp, the film version of the long running Broadway musical based on the music of 70's pop group Abba. The film stars Meryl Streep as Donna, the lusty and free spirited innkeeper who runs a broken down hotel in the Greek Islands, who is rocked by the arrival of three former suitors (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard)in Greece for the wedding of Donna's daughter, Sophie, not knowing that one of them is really Sophie's father, though Donna is not sure which one is the real Daddy. This paper-thin plot line serves as the basis for an amusing and spirited musical journey exploring Donna's regrets about her past and Sophie's search for a future identity through knowing who her real father is. Filmed on location in the Greek Islands, the film is visually stunning and should really be experienced on a big screen. Streep, as always, commands the screen as Donna, giving a rich performance that almost makes you forget you're watching a musical. Amanda Seyfried is charming as Sophie offering an impressive turn in her first real leading role. There are also a pair of razor sharp supporting performances from Christine Baranski and Julie Walters as Donna's best friends, also in town for the wedding. The film features beautiful location photography and some very inventive staging of musical numbers, which include ""Dancing Queen"", "" In a Rich Man's World"", ""The Winner Takes it All"", ""Our Last Summer"", ""Take a Chance on Me"", and of course, the title tune. Not for all tastes, but for fans of musicals and Streep, a must.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
There's Nothing In This Film For Guys Like Me,"I consider ""Mamma Mia"" to be the most painful movie experience of my life considering the movie received decent reviews. It's really very simple; there is nothing in the movie that can be enjoyed by a middle-aged heterosexual male, literally nothing. That isn't true with the typical chick flick such as ""Sleepless in Seattle"" or ""Ghost"". There was something there for an adult guy; a decent song, good jokes or humorous situations. None of that is there in ""Mamma Mia"". So among my friends the movie has become a running joke on how I can be tortured. Just pry my eyes open and force me to watch Mamma Mia. The good part is that my opinion is so well known on the movie that no one dares to suggest I watch the sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Ridiculous, glittery, silly...and totally worth it,","The first thing you need to know going into this movie is that it is not serious, and is intended solely to provide unrestricted amusement to the audience. After the first number or so, it becomes really easy to just relax and join in on the joke which all of the actors are so obviously aware of. Everyone in this knows that it is campy and silly, which is what adds to the film's overall enjoyment. You feel as though you should be uncomfortable as Pierce Brosnan sings a rock-starry, amusingly affected version of ""SOS,"" but as he, and the rest of the cast, don't take themselves seriously at all, you don't get embarrassed, and feel free to laugh and enjoy it. This movie is a ton of fun for a hot summer afternoon, and will really brighten anyone's day.That said, a few warnings first: 1) do not see it alone, because your enjoyment will be exponentially increased if you can laugh and sing with other people, and 2) you really cannot enjoy this movie half as much if you don't know the actors. You won't really appreciate Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth in glittery spandex if you don't have a prior knowledge of their suave, tough guy roles, and you won't understand that Meryl Streep is allowed to relax and be dramatically silly if you don't know how great an actress she really is. But, since most people do know them, it will be enjoyed by most who see it. If you like Abba, or really just music, and you like (or even just know) the main actors, you will have a lot of fun with this, and I recommend it. I gave it 9 out of 10 stars, but for what it is--silly and fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good film,"Good film. Starting with the good, Amanda Seyfried was lovely beyond words as Sophie. She had allure and acted with real charm, and her vocals were very lightweight and tuneful. Meryl Streep, I actually liked her. I did worry that her singing was too low in ""Money Money Money"" but she really emotes in ""The Winner Takes it All"" and she looks gorgeous in the sunlight. However, I have to concur with those who didn't like Pierce Brosnan's singing, it had a decent tone at times but it was flat and lacked support particularly in the infamously bad rendition of ""S. O. S"". Julie Walters was also a disappointment. I don't hate Walters, far from it, I think she is amazing, however she isn't given as much to do, and her singing I found on the shouty side.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mainly disappointing,"Having seen & thoroughly enjoyed it on stage several times, most comments (pro & con) are based on the comparison to this. (I would give anything to have the first stage performance I saw on DVD!)Pros:The casting of everyone except Meryl Streep (including Pierce Brosnan), and particularly Amanda Seyfried - she was cute and enthusiastic, and her singing was fresh and nicely in character.The setting and the scenery - gorgeous!The music and the book (not unique to the movie, of course, but a huge part of what made this musical the success that it is!)Cons:Didn't like Meryl Streep's acting OR singing. (The singing could have been acceptable, but I've never seen a seasoned pro over-act so much = see ""Winner Takes it All"" or numerous other scenes). To some extent, in musicals, you need to let the music do the talking.Pierce Brosnan's singing. Sometimes it's a GOOD thing to either dub the stars, or select stars that can sing. Actually, while on the subject of the singing in general, whether you are an ABBA fan or not, nobody can deny that Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad could belt it out. One of the pleasures of the stage play was that they were great SINGERS. The closing mini-concert in the stage play was a treat - a chance to see some of the cast really cutting loose in a flashy performance. The analogous scene in the movie was a parody of that, at best.Continuity - the screen version didn't flow as nicely as the stage play. Maybe it's because they didn't have to pace it to a live audience, or maybe it's because the editing chopped it up too much, or maybe they just screwed up.I didn't think the ""Take a Chance"" or ""Does Your Mother Know"" scenes were nearly as funny as they should have been (or maybe I was just disappointed with the whole thing by then).Overall, you can probably tell, I was disappointed.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Won me over by the end,"I'm a Meryl Streep fan. I remember ABBA songs from my middle school days. So I had to go see this movie. I did, however, go in with some fear and trepidation as I can be a bit of a snob when it comes to movie viewing (according to my husband who likes it all).It took about half an hour before I didn't start to cringe at the beginning of a song. I wondered about the choreography in certain parts (didn't seem to fit). It was painfully obvious that the story-line was an often times awkward attempt to fit a bunch of ABBA songs together. The editing seemed odd at times. Some of the acting was a bit over-the-top.All that said, I ended up liking the movie. A lot. Much to my own surprise. Maybe it's because I enjoy Meryl Streep, Christine Baranski, and Julie Waters so much. The ""Dancing Queen"" number by itself was reason to see the film.It was refreshing to see a lead actress (Streep) actually look her age (over 50). One would normally expect Hollywood to go for the leading lady with the most plastic surgery and not the most talent. Meryl Streep gets big kudos for having the guts to do this movie, even if it fails in some instances.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Critics be damned!  I liked ""Mamma Mia!"" even better the second time around!","First, let's get the disclosures out of the way. The first album I ever bought was the ""Xanadu"" soundtrack, and the second one was ""Super Trouper"" by ABBA. Even at 11 years old, I loved the song ""The Winner Takes It All"" at wanted to own that record. Unfortunately, I discovered ABBA at a time when their career had peaked, the band had dissolved, and it was pretty uncool to like them.Fast forward to 1999, and the stage version of ""Mamma Mia!"" opens in London. ABBA Gold is a certified worldwide best-seller, and the group was enjoying a resurgence, as well as receiving critical acclaim for their music which they had never really had before. I saw the play in London, and since then, I've seen it in Chicago, on Broadway after September 11 (a truly magical experience I will never forget!), in Los Angeles, and 6 times here in Las Vegas. Needless to say, I was thrilled to hear a movie version of the musical was being made! I had read many of the critics' reviews and was really disappointed at some of the venomous and harsh words some critics had to say. When I saw the movie opening night, I was afraid I was going to be let down.I needn't have worried. The storyline of the movie follows fairly closely to the stage play, but more importantly, the spirit and heart of the play (and the songs) remain in tact. I did feel the movie was a bit rushed and some parts felt really cut down, but enjoyed it nonetheless.Then I went to see it a second time, to watch it with a more critical eye, and I ended up enjoying the movie even more.First the bad news: Four songs are deleted from the movie (""Under Attack,"" ""One of Us,"" ""The Name of the Game,"" and ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"") ""Thank You for the Music"" is sung over the end credits, and ""I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do"" is featured in a shortened version. Actually, with the exception losing of ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"" I think these changes suit the movie just fine. A lot has been made of Pierce Brosnan's singing voice. Okay, it isn't the greatest, but he doesn't sing any song by himself, and it's good that he has help. I actually think the new version of ""When All Is Said and Done"" is very touching. You do have to pay close attention to the dialog and every scene, because the editing of the movie is VERY fast paced. I wish some of the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more.Now for the good stuff: Meryl Streep is magnificent. She can speak volumes with just an expression on her face. I loved her rendition of ""Mamma Mia."" In an instant, she goes from horrified (at finding her three former lovers in her goat house) to filled with glee at the prospect of seeing them again. Listen to the lyrics of the song ""Mamma Mia,"" and you will appreciate how Meryl brings them to life. She also does fine with ""Money, Money, Money"" and ""The Winner Takes It All"" (still a showstopper!).Amanda Seyfried is wonderful as Sophie, the bride-to-be. Her singing voice is very good, and she does a great job on ""Honey, Honey"" (especially the last line, which sets up the whole movie) and ""Lay All Your Love On Me."" Seyfried lights up the screen whenever she's on, and the chemistry between her and Meryl is beautiful. I have to admit that I welled up during ""Slipping Through My Fingers."" Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are hilarious. I especially loved Walters on ""Take a Chance on Me."" They steal practically every scene they're in.The three possible dads, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgard are all fine in their respective roles. They really aren't given much to do, but they make the most of it. There is a very funny bit with Skarsgard on a boat in a towel. I won't say more than that. The audience roared with laughter both times I saw it.The on-location scenery in Greece is absolutely gorgeous. The sun-lit seas and mountain retreats are breathtaking.The crowning moment of the film, though, has to be the ""Dancing Queen"" number. The crowd erupted in applause both times I saw the movie, and how can you blame them? It is one of the most joyous moments ever captured on screen. How can you help but tap your toes and sing along? And I can't forget the grand finale. Stick around for the end credits. The movie mirrors the play in every way. Again, it is a crowd pleasing finale, met with cheers and laughter.I realize the film isn't perfect; it's corny, campy, and not everyone is the greatest singer, but I'm giving it a 10 for the sheer joy that it brings and the performances of Streep and Seyfried. I can't wait to see it again!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

In my top 2 worst films ever made . . .,"Virtually every film that is made has some merit, but I am struggling to find any in Mamma Mia! I was going to place this film alongside SHOWGIRLS and POWER RANGERS: THE MOVIE as films that should not have been made, but actually the latter film probably did work for its target audience, so MAMMA MIA! takes its place with SHOWGIRLS on my very short list of dreadful films. As an open-minded movie viewer and a very positive person, I can normally find something to like, but right from the start I felt concerned. I did watch the entire film, including the embarrassing end credits, and was constantly willing myself to engage with the narrative or the characters, and towards the end hoping for the 'emotional moment' that all film-makers can conjure from the flimsiest of scripts and lightweight of characters . . . but . . . nothing! Except astonishment. ABBA - great songs. Meryl Streep - great actress. Julie Walters - great actress and comic. Colin Firth - great actor. Amanda Seyfried - attractive enough. And by all accounts the stage production works well - so MAMMA MIA! - great potential . . . But . . . completely lacking any truth, cohesion, musicality, emotion, fun, purpose. Many other reviewers have effectively dissected and analysed, and I can only agree with all the negative comments made whilst wondering why I have invested even more time in writing my first review.

"Cute, bubbly. Lacking substance.","Mamma Mia! - Based on the hit Broadway musical, Mamma Mia! Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) invites three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgard) her mother slept with 20 years ago to try and find which one is her dad. Why a paternity test or even just a sit down talk to with them and her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) could not have resolved this issue is completely ridiculous *obviously*. Your tolerance of Mamma Mia! is conditional on your liking musicals, acceptance of ABBA, and stamina for cheeriness.First off, Meryl Streep can sing quite well and does ""The Winner Takes it All"" quite well. Amanda Seyfried can also sing well. Julie Walters and Christine Baranski can sing but very few of these actresses are given songs that show their voices at their best. Consequently the musical numbers are uneven, if catchy. Some are decent. Some are quite fun in fact, but some fall flat through poor staging. I'm fine with people singing in a film, though it is a little insipid when villagers pipe in here and there with no clue as to what's going on. It's far too cornball.Several actors are given songs where there's no way they should be singing them. I often felt really bad for Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan. Neither has any talent for singing, yet Brosnan given 5 songs. You can see them giving it their best shot and trying to have fun. All the guys here look terribly uncomfortable, not unlike guys pulled into the women's wear at a JCPenney by their girlfriends. It's a hens party through and through.I think America has a real musical phobia going on. We seem repulsed by Broadway, and the only way musicals get to the silver screen is if the music was done by some known band. In Across the Universe it was The Beatles. Now it's ABBA. The double edged sword is that the songs, as was the case in Across the Universe, often have very little to do with the proceedings. In most musicals the music is there to advance the plot and tie in with what is happening. In Mamma Mia!, Characters do not actually get to have discussions, but merely have brief interactions until the next unrelated musical number comes in.When the movie doesn't try so damn hard, it's fun. Alas, everyone runs around too much, laughs too hard, and it sometimes feels forced. I don't even have to have seen the stage show to know it was better. The film is cute and often fun, but it's like a cloud. It's light and wispy and completely lacking in substance. In many respects it's a fine holiday film for when you're stranded in your house with nowhere to go. Just don't go in asking for anything solid. Mama Mia! gets a B-",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't take a ch-k-ch-chance on this one,"I'm a die-hard Abba fan from the mid-70s, so I loved the music. Always have. And the cast did a reasonable job of singing the songs. They don't hold a candle to Anna and Frida, but it would be wrong to expect them to. But I did expect the movie to add something to the music. It didn't. I came out of the cinema thinking I should have just stayed at home and listened to Abba Gold. My 3-star rating is for the music alone.The plot was worse than corny. It was lazy. Not even the slightest attempt to make a plausible link between SOS and Gimme Gimme Gimme. They could have played all the Abba film clips one after the other and the resultant plot would have been more coherent than this tosh.Finally, although I've always admired Julie Walters, I'd like to wring her bloody neck for her performance here.

Buy the Original Cast recording and use your imagination...,"Let me preface this by stating that I am both a fan of the original musical play and ABBA in general. In addition, I am a fan of musicals in general. I also would like to add that in normal circumstances I am a fan of Meryl Streep. I believe that she is very talented actress.The plot line is fairly simple (most musicals are): Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), the daughter of Donna (Meryl Streep), is about the get married. The only thing missing is her father. So, she invites her three possible dads in the hopes of finding her one true father.The acting is decent all around. I think that Colin Firth and Julie Walters shine in their comedic roles. And, Christine Baranski and Amanda Seyfried give both solid acting and vocal performances.However, not everyone was meant to sing and dance, and our two leads are prime examples. Meryl Streep, who is far too old to be the 38 year-old Donna of the stage show, overacts in every song, flailing about with some odd interpretive dance moves. And, her singing can be described as amateur at best. Pierce Brosnan should have stayed the strong, silent type. His acting is uneven at best, and his singing is cringe-worthy. One patron in my theater could not stop laughing during Streep and Brosnan's mini duet during ""SOS."" Brosnan's usually debonair voice becomes high and airy during his songs. Every time he opened his mouth, I prayed Streep's own mediocre pipes would take over.If you enjoy the original musical and ABBA, then check it out. However, if you are unfamiliar with the show and songs, I would stay away. Unless that is, if you want to laugh at Streep and Brosnan showcasing their aging bodies and talentless singing.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stunningly bad,"I'm not sure how they managed to have a great cast, great fun songs, and still turn out such an awful film. Bad storyline, woeful direction, dreadful choreography (have they even seen any musical film to see how that such films should be done?), and just about everything in the film is wrong.The worst sin however is the complete misuse of the songs. Why on earth for example did Meryl suddenly started singing Winner Takes It All in her scene with Piers Brosnan when he says he wants to give Sophie away? The scriptwriter seems to be completely oblivious to the lyrics of the song (""You've come the shake my hands""? Huh? Piers didn't come to shake your hand), and can't write a scene so that the song may fit in. It's a breakup song with the singer acknowledging she herself being the loser in a love triangle, and you can't have a breakup when there is no relationship between them for years. The same can be said about nearly all the songs in the film. Quite staggering really. They just simply drop the songs into the film with no attempt to fit them into the proper context.The only good thing is the songs despite their misuse, otherwise it'll get a 1.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Don't get me wrong the movie was not bad and was good, however not something I would see again.I have the soundtrack from the Broadway production, but thought the film not as good.The above was intended to be realistic.

At Least the Singing Is Great!,"I am not the biggest ABBA fan in the world, although I do like the songs ""Dancing Queen"" and ""Mamma Mia."" This is the film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical, and I think it is a product of mixed results. The story is paper thin and poorly executed, and that is evident during the non-singing scenes. However on the flip side, there is no denying how campy and fun the film can be. The singing is actually not bad, and there are powerful renditions of the hit ABBA songs to be had, especially ""Dancing Queen.""Phyllis Lloyd's film is about a girl named Sophie who lives on a Greek island and is about to be married. However before the ceremony, she offers invites to three possible fathers that she may have never met, much to the chagrin of her mother, Donna. Now it's up to Sophie to find out who is her real father and try to improve relations between her mother and these men.This film does have an incredibly stocked cast. Meryl Streep is the goddess of all actresses, and she can do anything. She even has a good singing voice. She also looks very good for her age as of 2008. Amanda Seyfreid also does a good job and just like in Les Miserables, she delivers a strong singing performance. Whoever thought Pierce Brosnan would star in a film like this and do well. I think he was able to hold his own. We also have good performances by Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgaard. Finally, I did not like Julie Walter's performance. She was just so annoying.Overall, Mamma Mia! could have and should have been a much worse adaptation that we got. I was pleasantly surprised, but the film is still a little mediocre. The story itself has big issues, but the songs and the characters are above average and everyone seems like they are having a good time. To be honest, this movie could have been much worse if we did not have Meryl Streep. Not a great film, nor a bad film. But it's entertaining enough. I rate this film 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is also the worst I've ever seen of Meryl Streep, someone else should have been better. But Amanda Seyfried is charming and a reasonable singer and the Dynamos are hilarious by times. And it's exactly this kind of enthusiasm that saves the movie. Don't complain and go with the flow of enthusiasm on screen and the great ABBA melodies. Then you will have a fun night. Nothing more, but surely nothing less.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Could've been better,"I can see why so many people adore this movie as it's a feel good musical but honestly wasn't for me. The story isn't actually that bad and if it wasn't a musical I would rate it much higher; overall musicals aren't for me. I think the casting was great and I don't have any critiques about it. It was cheesy at times but I mean that's what you're gonna get with these types of movies. If you're looking for a sit down movie that you don't want to pay much attention to, this is definitely it. I also haven't been a big fan of ABBA but after watching this I will say their music has definitely grown on me. Overall 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fun movie--interesting casting decisions,"This was a fun movie to watch, and entertaining for anybody who is an ABBA fan. The casting, however, left me lacking. Meryl Streep, as much as I love her as an actress, was MUCH too old to play this role. This was a story about a teenage fling that ended in a pregnancy. When turned out by her mother, the teen stays on the island where the fling occurred. Twenty years later, she faces a ""crisis"" when her now 20 year old daughter wants to get married. The actress playing Streep's role, then, should be at most 40 years old. Streep does not pull it off, and in my opinion it detracted from the movie to see her try. The same could be said for her costars, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""I read Mom's diary, and I have three possible fathers""","When I think of Mamma Mia on reflection the first thing that comes to my mind is what a load of fun! I don't tend to watch many family-friendly or comedy films; I'm usually trapped between horror, suspense and psychological thrillers most of the time, so this was a nice, relaxing change of pace.Where do I even start here? I thoroughly enjoyed Mamma Mia although it took me a few attempts to get through it to the very end due to constantly falling asleep between songs while watching late at night. The storyline is basic and been told before which doesn't help, and I can be very picky when it comes to my movie selections, which is why it took me so long to finally get around to seeing this film.I think it's all about being in the right mood. A lot of the time, a romantic comedy doesn't usually go to the top of my list of priorities. But when you finally get the chance to see a film on your wish list, albeit fifteen years later, it holds a bit of bearing on you. For starters, the cast all performing the songs made it feel like you could sing along yourself, and that effect washes over you like ocean waves.Mamma Mia is a feel-good musical film based on the popular stage musical of the same name, which features the music of Swedish pop group ABBA. Set on a picturesque Greek island, the story follows Sophie Sheridan, a young woman who is about to get married and dreams of having her father walk her down the aisle. The twist? She's not entirely sure who her father is, as her mother, Donna, had three romantic encounters around the time of Sophie's conception. Determined to find out, Sophie invites all three men to her wedding without her mother's knowledge, setting the stage for a series of comedic and heartwarming moments, old flames are rekindled, and love conquers all against the backdrop of sun-drenched landscapes and infectious ABBA hits.Pierce Brosnan will forever be known to me as ""James Bond"", but also fits the bill as a corporate businessman, and a fatherly figure. Colin Firth, remembered fondly for his role in Bridget Jones's Diary, has the same pompous British attitude, but damn, for some reason he makes himself intriguingly likeable, and Stellan Skarsgaard was so naturally carefree and lives for the moment. Importantly for Mamma Mia each of the male leads set themselves apart notably which makes them all the more interesting.Amanda Seyfried took her moment and shone with musical ability and natural acting. Meryl Streep is iconic for many roles and manages her natural freedom and diversity throughout this film effortlessly, and finally Dominic Cooper, who looks like a young teenager makes you think deeply and then go, ""I know him from somewhere!"" Overall, it seemed like everyone involved, from the cast to the production team, had a blast, and to get the original ABBA members Benny and Bjorn to help conduct the music just puts it into perspective how the small things in the film made the world of difference.Each member brought their own charm and talent to the table, making the film a delightful ensemble experience. And the story, while simple and straightforward, serves as a perfect backdrop for the core element being the musical numbers and character interactions
Mamma Mia is a delightful romp filled with catchy tunes, charismatic performances, and a sunny island atmosphere that's hard to resist. Whether you're a fan of musicals or not, this film is sure to leave you with a smile on your face.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Abba meets Shakespeare!,"Abba meets Shakespeare in this movie. The shifts of the scenes, the structure, the approach - everything is in the style of Shakespearian comedy!This movie is not laugh-out-loud as much as make-you-cringe. Initially you are flabbergasted from these acclaimed actors breaking into happy 70's songs and dancing in outrageous outfits. But then you realize that that i s the point. It's taking the embarrassment you felt as a child when your parents dared dance or give speeches only doubled because you are not embarrassed for yourself but for Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth etc.!But they, the actors, have obviously been having a hoot making this film and dare to take the pi** out of themselves. It works! (Colin Firth even, quite subtly, makes another wet shirt scene in way that make you cringe! How 'bout that!)Perhaps this movie has been pushed forward wrong.

"A Great, Big Budget Home Movie.","OK, so this film is unlikely to win any awards for direction - not even from a partisan British Academy - but I suspect that is part of what makes it work. Mama Mia is a great big home movie with a cast, sound track and location to die for. Adding to the home movie feel, and I suspect to the charm of the film for many,is seeing superstars stripped of the Hollywood trappings and at times looking more than a touch vulnerable. On this showing, perhaps we could all do it! Certainly my husband can sing better than Pierce Brosnan - though he may be lacking in other areas! If Julie Walters' performance had been her first, surely it would also have been her last, and why producers go on casting Colin Firth is beyond me. But who cares, this movie is fun, totally harmless fun and such a pleasant change to the social comment dirges or gratuitously violent bloodbaths that fill our screens.

"Amiable Pop Musical, Short on Story, Big on Cheer","Mamma Mia!, the film adaptation of the popular stage musical, packs no surprises, no new insights, no real emotions, but it never had to. Like the popular Broadway play, Mamma Mia! is a sweet, summery tonic of wholesome good cheer. The kind of which that women and families will drink up, even if the nutritional content is low.The plot, (you know, that thing in between the ABBA music) is about bride-to-be Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) and her quest to discover the identity of her real father by inviting the three possible candidates to her mother's beautiful Greek villa, in hopes that she will ""just know"". Things aren't so simple in practice however, as Donna (Meryl Streep) rekindles flames she thought were lost forever. It's not a horrible idea for a story, it's not a great idea, but it's cute. The three suitors, played by Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgård, are instantly appealing. Put a less likable actor in any of their shoes and you would have yourself a far less tolerable film.Most of the leads are charming, with Pierce Brosnan and Meryl Streep standing out. One could criticize both their singing voices, if one were so inclined, but I enjoyed Streep's airy vocals and Brosnan's deep, hard rock style. The ABBA songs are hit or miss, with some lethargic early songs, and a few vivacious tunes to close the film. The music is what you would expect. Every musical has some duds, but Mamma Mia! has enough good stuff to justify them. The film pulls a nice balancing act when it comes to the songs, not too many, (ABBA overkill never fully sets in), and the best stuff is saved for last. Pretty good formula, if you ask me.I'm not the best audience for Mamma Mia! I've never seen the play, I don't particularly like ABBA, and I'm not a woman. For those who fit into any of those categories, Mamma Mia! will be a joy. I wasn't impressed with some of the formulaic chick flick fluff, but beyond that, I liked Mamma Mia! It's what your grandmother might call a ""nice"" picture. Wholesome, charming, and sugary sweet.66/100",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Don't Lie! You Love It,"First, I would like to address the main criticism I have heard for this movie. That is Meryl Streep's age. In what world, does this mother need to be 40. She could have had a long life and then gotten pregnant on accident later. Also, who in their right minds thought that Meryl Streep looked 60 like she wasAnyway, I love Mamma Mia and so does everyone else. This jukebox musical is so much fun and has only ever been described as such. A story where no one is meant to be taken seriously and everyone can be embarrassed, but life is so much more fun if you take this movie at face value.Secondly, ABBA is amazing and their songs in this context are just great.

Mamma Mia - the Movie,"Let's face it, with out the music of Benny Andersonn and Bjorn Ulvaeus, this musical wouldn't have made it past the concept stage. I became an absolute ABBA nut rather late in life and think this trivial plot became something more when written around ABBA's music. I was well past the ""teenie bopper"" phase when ABBA first came on the scene and liked their music well enough but I wasn't really listening to pop music then. When the music resurfaced after the opening of Mamma Mia the musical, I heard the radio and TV commercials and thought, ""You know these folks were really very good"". We went to see the show on Broadway and were instantly hooked. Singing along with all the songs, we watched joyfully as people ACTUALLY DID start dancing in the aisles!! We have seen it twice more since and enjoyed it then too. The folks we sat next to were also repeaters (Three times!!) When the movie was announced, we awaited it anxiously and saw it the second day after release. Somewhere on this site a previous reviewer said that an inherent flaw was that Frida and Agnetha's marvelous voices were missing and that was right on. How the producers of this movie could cast Merryl Streep , Pierce Brosnan and a cast of non singers to do this is beyond me. That said, they were OK, and the setting in the Greek Isles is beautiful, but it's still the songs and arrangements that are top notch.

The Greek Island Location, The wonderful ABBA music and Merril streep.Merril's voice is so good, especially with ""the winner takes it all"" one just can easily ignore the obvious point that she simply looks to old for the part. At the end of the stage performance, the audience was dancing in the aisles. This after standing ovations after each number. Just didn't happen with the movie. And Pierce Brosnan, come on. Go back to being James Bond. This is worth seeing if only for ABBA's music. In checking out the trivia in IMDb, I was amazed that Mz Streep did the winner takes it all in one take. Hard to believe.

There is a reason however my opinions have dipped. I now(in my personal opinion)prefer musicals with original music as it is a fresh and new set of music and lyrics to get stuck in your head, these are (I think) mostly pre-existing songs, I say I think because I haven't watched this movie in ages and I can't even remember if there were any original songs or not in the mix-",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

My favourite thing about the film, apart from the songs, is the excellent casting of the 3 dads (Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan & Stellan Skarsgard).

"Finally, a movie made for morons...","Every moron should enjoy this flick, this movie is specially dedicated to all the morons in the world. I think everyone in the film forgot while shooting, that they had to make a movie. They just went on to having a good time and made a complete mess out of a film. I was astounded to see Meryl Streep to work in such a stridently stupid film. I can't blame her for poor acting, the script of the film demanded her to do so.Not only Meryl, but Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth, such fine actors are completely wasted in this garbage. It was a shock to see that t the daughter is happy after knowing that her mother had three lovers at the same time and her own mother doesn't know who the father of her kid is, but strangely the daughter is happy to know that one out of three men is her father.Songs in the film are not at all according to the situations. In the end, it was agonizing to see Meryl Streep singing 'The winner takes it all'. Even Pierce Brosnan must be laughing his ass off when the camera faced Meryl and showed his back. Another drawback of the film is that is tries to make sing people who can't sing and it can be vouched by people unanimously.I hope it was a mistake by these fine actors to work in such a film, and they won't make such mistake again.

Gimme Gimme Gimme...a one way ticket to this place,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the romantic comedy musical Mamma Mia!

Unknown to Donna her bride to be daughter Sophie, secretly invites three men from her mother's past in hope of meeting her real father with the hope of having her life complete. I won't give away the plot lines and the review will be short. This is one of those flicks which I had no interest to really watch due to being a romcom however after the first 10 minutes I slowly began to enjoy it which may be due to the songs or to the amazing scenery or just the plain cheesy scenes. This is a movie I didn't love nor did not hate. The energy of the cast along with the ABBA songs throughout the movie was enjoyable and fun. Yes, there are interesting crude jokes throughout the film and yes there were many cringy moments but the location of where this film was shot is amazing.

Moreover, Donna's stern mother refused to take her pregnant daughter back so Donna stuck around in the Greece and had Sophie. The mystery that everybody tries to resolve for the rest of the action is the identity of Sophie's dad.""Mamma Mia!"" radiates rainbows of infectious energy, in part owing to its array of ABBA songs. The champagne frothy, transcendental music of ABBA imbues this innocuous movie with lighter-than-helium buoyancy. Indeed, audiences could literally dance in the aisles for the movie seems like a concert with a plot. Director Phyllida Lloyd keeps those few quiet, introspective moments of intimacy to a minimum.

They can't sing at all!,I've seen the Broadway show which was energetic and enjoyable. The movie version was much much worse - totally amateurish.Casting: What were they thinking using a cast that totally couldn't sing except for Dominic Cooper. The grownups were all 10 years too old for their roles. Meryl Streep cannot sing at all. She looked too fat. Must she take every role? Even those she is not suitable for. Branski was frightful as usual. Pierce Brosnan's voice was too weak. Stellan was too unattractive to be in this movie. The whole thing looked like an amateur playhouse version of the Broadway musical. Why didn't they chose actors in their forties not sixties. Amanda Seyfried with her bulgy eyes just isn't pretty enough for one of the leads - she is a supporting actress at best.The pretty scenery didn't even help because the singing was just so bad.

One of those,"I was shocked to find out that Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, the sequel was much better rated than this.
Mamma Mia! Changed my life and introduced me to the fantastic and talented universe of Meryl Streep's movies.
I have to say, and I'm not afraid to afirm it, that this is the best musical of the XXI century. Which means, CLEARLY, that it can be superated by musicals like The Rocky Horror Picture Show. But to my eyes, this movie has a great script-songs balance (which is rare to find in MOVIE musicals), an excellent cast, very well chosen photography and colours, the coreographies are super musicalesques(?) and selection of time for each song is perfectly well selected as to the chronology of the story. Besides, and this is a SUPER extra beautiful point, anyone who ever heard at least ONE ABBA song, will feel extremely touch by the interpretation of all the songs that are carefully edited to last less than the original with the aim of not being boring or exhausting.
I HAVE TO SAY, that I can understand people don't appretiate this film very much and I strongly believe it's because of the plot.
The female characters are not ""special"" or ""sexier"" enough and he male characters are not ""deep"" or ""strong"" enough. It's just a romantic comedy made into a musical, with a story that can be recognized as very common.
But I think anyone with just a slight taste for the Feeling Good Cinema will FOR SURE enjoy this beautiful and thrilling piece of art!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was OK.....,"In short, if you are not allergic to Abba, book your tickets now. If you are, why would you be reading this? At a pinch, it is worth seeing for Meryl Streep alone, who not only throws herself headlong into every refrain with unashamed gusto, but adds a touch of class and nuance to what otherwise could be a one-dimensional adaptation. Streep vacillates engagingly between playing herself and not taking herself too seriously. Pierce Brosnan just about keeps up, and manages more expressions than he ever did as James Bond. Colin Firth and Julie Waters trail behind somewhat. Yet Mama Mia! is a roller coaster of emotion, careering colourfully from the blue waters of the Adriatic, bursting 'like Aphrodite's Fountain' into the lives of Donna (Meryl) , her lovers and friends, and her soon-to-be-wed daughter. It is the party spirit that says kick your shoes off and sing silly cheesy songs. Altogether now.And yes – there's a story. Donna's daughter Sophie is getting married. To the buff-looking Sky. Only – where's her dad? She's never met him. A sneak-peek at Mom's diary shows Mom had three lovers before Sophie was born and Sophie secretly invites all of them. This is a film of threesomes. Three past lovers (Sam, Bill and Harry). Three close friends (Donna and two best pals). And, not to be outdone, Sophie meets up with two other young girls at the start of the film.The breakneck pace still allows for brilliantly put together shots. Like Streep doing a 'Titanic' with drapes blowing in the wind. Or a pier-load of young hunky stag night crew doing a dance in trunks and deep-dive flippers. Moonlit boats and beaches to ""I Have a Dream."" Filmed on location, the views won't disappoint. And like a favourite song whose ending we know, the drama is in the details and execution.As with many adapted-from-stage musicals, two young leads are played by talented singers, and the older parts by serious actors can sing well enough. Streep manages extremely well. Her performance is so professional and assured it leaves others standing. Fortunately, it is perhaps easy to paper over any cracks in musical comedy. Sweeney Todd relied heavily on Depp's charisma and stunning cinematography. Across the Universe, too heavily on the songs. Mamma Mia!, on the other hand, simply tailors everything to its joyous headlong rush. The songs fit naturally to the action. Streep even manages to sing them with her tongue firmly in cheek. She confesses to having been a ""stupid reckless little slut"" but then says she ""grew up"". (To which her pals chime in, ""Well grow back down again!"") The film is not without faults. There is a notable lack of chemistry between the people that throw themselves rapturously against each others' faces. Even Streep looks less than convincing in a brief lips-mash. And the men are a bit croaky in the singing department (Hugh Grant might even have been a preferable casting choice). And some of the time-line is wobbly. For instance, strange as it may seem, music from more than twenty years ago does not all come from the same era. So reminiscing about flower power (early sixties) in the same breath as a Johnny Rotten t-shirt (Sex Pistols, mid-late seventies) is either anachronistic or wishful thinking.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just HORRIBLE!,"Just goes to show that quality has nothing to do with success. This was a huge hit in the cinema but both me and my girlfriend found it absolutely horrible.It's not funny or romantic. Everyone is frantically doing their best to try to make it work and have it be fun but fail horribly. I wanted to throw something heavy at my TV screen.And i work in a videostore and see about two films a day. Also, i have nothing against musicals, or ABBA. In fact i have their greatest hits cd and liked ""hairspray"" very much.I just found it very poorly written, shot, staged and acted. It tried so hard to be fun(ny) but tried way too hard. I still can't understand it. To mess it up with THIS cast? How is that possible? After this debacle we watched Disney's ""Enchanted"".

Rocky start but recovers; Streep and Baranski are great.,"Okay. It's not the 1936 Show Boat, it's not Footlight Parade, it's not Yankee Doodle Dandy, it's not Stormy Weather, it's not Carmen Jones, it's not Oklahoma, it's not West Side Story, it's not Zorba the Greek, it's not Oliver!, it's not Grease, it's not Chicago, it's not Idlewild - all great Hollywood movie musicals - but after a rocky start, with a story that at first seems hokey to the extreme and brings the movie to the brink of cinematic oblivion, it recovers to become a good, if not great, movie. How does that happen? Almost miraculously, Meryl Streep's performance, which at first is incredibly stale and flat, undergoes a remarkable transformation and becomes great! It is as if someone interceded with her in the middle of the movie, injected her with a large dose of spirit, got her to turn around her performance and saved the movie from taking a cinematic dive. Along with Christine Baranski, Ms. Streep sings, dances, laughs, romps with gusto, and carries the movie. She becomes the star and makes this movie a Meryl Streep vehicle where she gives one of her stronger performances which transcends the corny story, improbable setting, and an ensemble of male actors who are almost laughingly miscast (Pierce Brosnan in a musical? C'mon! This is a movie that needed Anthony Quinn, Howard Keel and Rosanno Brazzi). After struggling to establish itself, the movie becomes an entertaining cinematic experience with catchy songs, snappy dancing, and dynamic performances by the female leads, led by the great, fabulous, beautiful and talented Meryl Streep.This movie is proof that making a good musical is a daunting task and one best not done if it's not done right. Just like Les Grossman interceding with the director in Tropic Thunder, someone in the front office of this movie must have pulled the director aside and told her ""Look, turn this movie around or this production is history!"" Otherwise, how did this movie make such a dramatic recovery?The first section of this movie is so bad that it causes one to wonder: why me? The mushy, wishy-washy dialog, the contrived conflicts, the unimpressive Greek scenery (why not set this movie in Long Island?), and dumb characters makes this movie a classic in how not to begin a movie. But a movie can survive a bad start just as long as it has a strong finish, and this movie finishes strong.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Songs are forced into plot,This movie was surprisingly bad.I am surprised to see big names who had accepted to be in this movie.Some of the voices are not fit for broadcast and is better for the bathroom showingThey forced the story into songs (or vice versa). No connection with the personage .. what a pity..The start of the movie is disappointing and it continues that way. Some of the ocean shots are beautiful and I preferred they just showed the boat and water and none of the actors nor their songs.

much ado about nothing,"I bought this movie because somebody recommended it to me. Then, on seeing the cast, that is, Meryl Streep, Stellan Skarsgard and Colin Firth, i said to my self wow this must be good! I was disappointed to learn that great actors can make quite a poor show of themselves. Not that the script had allowed them to do any better; it was sketchy, ridiculous, sloppy, slapdash work, as if written hastily at a party by a bunch of amateurs after smoking a few joints.The acting was accordingly. Meryl is no merry peach and all her dancing and singing was so out of place I wanted to scream. But she did it all for me. Halfway through the movie her voice sounds as if somebody was strangling her. Unlike Amanda Seyfried, who has some talent in this respect. She was the only one not scratching my ears with her vocal performance.Another thing that I found greatly irritating was all that joyful yelling whenever 'the girls'(both young and old generation) met. It sounded simply hysterical. Real people don't scream with joy like they're drunk or something when meeting again, even if it's after a long time. I'm convinced the intention was to convey youthfulness and fun but it all failed lamentably to do so.Given these and other negative remarks I won't add here out of boredom, I'll give this so called musical a 2 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Romance
Mamma Mia,"How can anyone not like this? Phyllida Lloyd has managed to convince half a dozen serious A-list stars to take part in this Mediterranean musical extravaganza. Meryl Streep and Christine Baranksi are cracking and Julie Walters - when the three together sing ""Chiquitita"" is glorious. Sure, it's not a wonderful piece of classic cinema; but it must bring a smile to your face (even if - as Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård or Colin Firth break into song, it's more of a grimace). Dominic Cooper makes a valiant effort as ""Sky"" who is to wed the orchestrator of this whole predicament ""Sophie"" (Amanda Seyfried) who has invited the three men to her wedding in the hope that she might find out which of them might be her father.

Streep makes it worth Watching,"MAMMA MIA! is a joyous musical romp, the film version of the long running Broadway musical based on the music of 70's pop group Abba. The film stars Meryl Streep as Donna, the lusty and free spirited innkeeper who runs a broken down hotel in the Greek Islands, who is rocked by the arrival of three former suitors (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard)in Greece for the wedding of Donna's daughter, Sophie, not knowing that one of them is really Sophie's father, though Donna is not sure which one is the real Daddy.This paper-thin plot line serves as the basis for an amusing and spirited musical journey exploring Donna's regrets about her past and Sophie's search for a future identity through knowing who her real father is.Filmed on location in the Greek Islands, the film is visually stunning and should really be experienced on a big screen. Streep, as always, commands the screen as Donna, giving a rich performance that almost makes you forget you're watching a musical. Amanda Seyfried is charming as Sophie offering an impressive turn in her first real leading role. There are also a pair of razor sharp supporting performances from Christine Baranski and Julie Walters as Donna's best friends, also in town for the wedding.The film features beautiful location photography and some very inventive staging of musical numbers, which include ""Dancing Queen"", "" In a Rich Man's World"", ""The Winner Takes it All"", ""Our Last Summer"", ""Take a Chance on Me"", and of course, the title tune. Not for all tastes, but for fans of musicals and Streep, a must.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
What's going on?,"This movies title was misleading, I thought it was going to be a documentary on the Super Mario Brothers but no. There was no Mario nor was there Luigi, Princess, or those little mushroom things you jump on. In fact, I don't even know what this was about. I remember walking in paying for my ticket getting a vat of popcorn expecting to see a Mario documentary, I took my seat. About ten minutes later the movie started and five or ten minutes after that(Yeah I'm surprised I lasted that long too) I blacked out. Well I was in a big void with some swirling colors and dancing bananas for a while and when I came to I was in an ambulance. Apparently I had a seizure and hurt myself when some college student who apparently liked the movie tried to hold me still while I was flopping around. Who taught her first aid!

The joy of ABBA's music,"Whenever the time comes for me to re watch this wonderful movie, the feeling that most resonates with myself is joy and the great melodies from ABBA's music that made us basically just enjoy the songs with a smile in our faces. This movie takes their lyrics and turns it into a musical story about family, romance and the everlasting mark of youth power.So our plot begins with Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) sending 3 wedding invitations to three men, from which she thinks one might be her father. As soon as these men arrive on the island, trouble will ensue as Sophie's mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) tries to figure out why they are there and ultimately keep them away from Sophie. Sophie on the other hand tries to figure out which one of the three, Bill (Skarsgaard), Sam (Brosnan) and Harry (Firth), is her dad. Add in secondary characters like Donna's old friends and Sophie's fiancée, and you have the stage set for great comedic situations.Overall I consider this movie to be a success in terms of the performances, granted there were a few amateur mistakes, but given that some of these actors hadn't done a musical yet and the fact that they actually tried, one can look past them. However a key player in this movie is Amanda Seyfried, as she steals the show with heavenly voice. In the end, Mamma Mia! will always be a movie I enjoy based purely on its entertainment value, as it isn't exactly a storytelling masterpiece, but it delivers laughs and a splendid time.Rating: 9,5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Don't Think it Really Holds Up,"I saw this when I was around 7 and loved it, it instantly became my favourite musical and gave me a love for ABBA music which I hadn't heard up till that point. I hadn't watched it for a good few years so I was really looking forward to watching it again last night and I've got to say, I was underwhelmed. The music is great the problem, I think, is the singers. When I watched this originally I had never heard ABBA before so I just appreciated the lyricism, now that I have heard all these songs sung by the actual band the Mamma Mia versions just didn't really hold up for me. I like the majority of the cast, Meryl Streep, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski all have great chemistry and so do Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgad, I don't think that the main characters have that same energy though, Amanda Seyfried and her fiancée and friends just annoyed me. The cinematography is mediocre and the film felt dated. I don't know, it's a decent musical and you can't deny the songs are some of the greatest ever but it just doesn't hold up in my eyes.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ugh.,"3 reasons why ""Mamma Mia!"" is one of the worst movies of 2008:1) Many good ABBA songs are unmercifully killed by performers who have no business singing ABBA songs.2) Everyone acts like they are in a stage production, so facial expressions are over the top and lines are read at full volume.3)The film's comic relief consists of people falling over, or falling down, or being pushed over, or being pushed into water. The inevitable wacky reactions by the other cast members were almost enough to make my regurgitate my popcorn.I hope I haven't made it sound too impressive.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

What Happens When You Give a Stage Director a Movie Camera,"This colossal misfire of a film should be re-named ""Oy!"", and its advertising poster should feature Amanda Seyfried slapping her forehead instead of beaming like a starry-eyed bride. Let's be honest - the stage version of ""Mamma Mia"" wasn't exactly Pulitzer material, but it worked because of enthusiastic performances, great choreography, and inspired staging that got audiences on their feet.Director Phyllida Lloyd fails to transfer any of this to the big screen. She miscasts virtually every character, she pulls off the nearly impossible feat of making Kastani Beach in Greece look bland, dull, and fuzzy, and she robs the film of the potential for some terrific, infectious musical numbers by incorporating spastic, nausea-inducing camera cuts.Meryl Streep, God love her, does her best with what she's been given. To her credit, she looks like she's having a blast from beginning to end, even as Lloyd photographs her in the most unflattering light possible, then makes her hop on beds, skulk across rooftops, and jump into the sea. Streep does shine, however, during her rendition of ""The Winner Takes it All."" Her voice is powerful and moving, and she manages to make us feel for her character for about three minutes.The other actors don't fare nearly as well. Pierce Brosnan should never, ever be allowed to sing on film again. Stellan Skaarsgard, Colin Firth, Christine Baranski, and Julie Walters appear to be drunk on ouzo in most of their scenes, and Amanda Seyfried, while a competent vocalist (she almost saves the ""Lay All Your Love on Me"" number), seems to have attended an acting class in which she was taught that screaming while burying your head in your hands equals emoting.If anything positive can be said about ""Mamma Mia,"" it's that it's nice to see a Hollywood film featuring mostly middle-aged actors. Too bad this is the mess that showcases them.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Always a classic!,"From the radio, to stage, to film the pop group ABBA has made history with their recognizable songs included in the jukebox musical Mamma Mia!. The 2008 movie would go on to form a large fan base that has even prompted a sequel. The original musical saw similar great success. The movie is full of a star-studded cast but the vocals fell short. It is clear, especially with the male actors, that there is a lack of vocal experience. I even recall an interview of one of the leading men admitting they had no singing experience. I do not think that this ruined the movie, but I believe some casting choices could be better seeing the show was running on Broadway for years before.However, in the costume and set department, you could really understand the concept and color palette. The bright blues, whites, and pink really make the film feel unified and thought out. Of course, the setting of Greece gives viewers a chance to look at the beautiful scenery and the water scenes were especially gorgeous to look at. With the upbeat music and fun energy, you could see the pure enjoyment of the cast which makes the film worth watching even with the lacking vocals. ABBA's music is hard to get out of your head, and after watching this movie, you will be stuck humming ""Dancing Queen"" for the next couple of days!If you enjoy light-hearted, fun musicals, then Mamma Mia!

What a let down!I can only think it became so popular because of the hype of having so many 'celebrities' acting in it.The acting is ridiculously over the top and in fact plain bad desperately trying to be funny (and in my opinion failing), the plot is weak as well as pretty immoral and depressing (woman sleeps with 3 men in one week - doesn't know who fathered her child - but never mind hey, all 3 men in the end don't care and agree to all be her fathers - not exactly my idea of the happy family film I was told about) but worse, much much worse is the total massacre of Abba's beautiful songs which were just ridiculed and distorted throughout.

Amanda Seyfried, and beautiful Meryl Streep are the leads in this story along with Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård, and Colin Firth.The acting between musical numbers is just like background music to setup the song and dance. For lovers of pure musicals they will rejoice since good music triumphs drama.The criticism from many is the lack of story. If there were more story there would be less music. The movie is a celebration of music, and movement. The story is really secondary. If you are expecting a strong story reminicent West Side Story musical, you will be disappointed.

BUT when the movie started they were so quite i can hear pin fall on the CARPET!! they were so engrossed that they do not relieased they are singing along with the movie!!This is the first time all the audiences in the cinema singing along the movie not knowing it.they even sang louder than the show itself. I'm not making it up, REALLY!! esp the ending song""i have a dream"" everyone were singing along just as if they were Sofie. OMG OMG!!better still, no one left during the credits, they just stay back and enjoy the music and the fuuny acting on the screen. First time, man..... First time!!!The acting was fanstatic, esp on some part of the show where i could just feel how Donna felt when she sang that song ""Slipping through my fingers"" how worried a parents will be as though i'm Sophie's parent. And also how frustrated was Donna when she sang ""The winner takes it all"" i almost shed some tears over her frustration. She captivated me, the acting was very pure and beautiful.About Pierce Brosnan singing....... well , one thing for sure he can't hit high notes. But his Baritone (if i'm correct) was almost prefect. abit scrachy and rough but OK for a man in his 50's singing. he is good not bad. he is getting a 6/10 from me esp for the part he sang ""SOS"". but for the ""our last summer"".... eeekkkk. need practise..... a lot..... But we can be sure why he was once voted sexiest man alive, he is just too cool and sexy.one more thing the ending a abit shaky. not really stable, as though they are just going to simply end this show. (i mean the part before Sophie sang ""i have a dream.""overall : i'm giving 9/10 -the reason was the show managed to captive the heart of the audience which is the most important for all movies.You must watch it, don't miss out on this.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Mamma Mia Review,"I've watched many musicals throughout my lifetime , and I remember never liking any. The dances are too choreographed and make the film seem so unrealistic , characters that break out into songs at the weirdest moments , and a movie filled with terrible music that I just want to turn off. Im 15 and at this point of my life all my friends and schoolmates , were or are still at some point in their lives , obsessed with highschool musical. Me though , I hate it , always have. The newest all the rage musical , The Greatest Showman , that everyone was so head of heels for , I've watched it , and I couldn't tell you what everyone was so crazy about this movie for.But I have never loved something quite like ""Mamma Mia"". I've watched this film over 6 times and each time I love it more. When character bust in song , I'm likely to bust into song too. With an amazing soundtrack and thrilling storyline is a need to see for musical romance lovers everywhere.Donna, an independent hotelier in the Greek islands, is preparing for her daughter's wedding with the help of two old friends. Meanwhile Sophie, the spirited bride, and daughter of Donna , has a plan. She secretly invites three men from her mother's past in hope of meeting her real father and having him escort her down the aisle on her big day. When the three men arrive on the island and Sophie not sure what to do next , will put the audience through a thrilling roller coaster. WIll sophie ever find her biological father? And who will walk her down the aisle on her big day?The Mamma Mia movie soundtrack , being a major success, peaked at #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and was a certified platinum. It also topped the U.S. Billboard Top Soundtracks Chart. The album was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. Over all the music in this film just makes you want to dance and sing. When Sophie is explaining to her friends that she invited three potential dad candidates through the song , ""honey , honey"" , not only is this song upbeat and makes one want to dance and sing but , through this song sophie completely tells her friends what she's done.This thrilling storyline and great soundtrack will leave you begging for more-

"Mamma mia, I won't be going again .","I entered the movie theater with high hopes - the idea of Meryl Streep playing the charismatic, bohemian Donna, and mother of the bride, was enough to make me think this movie was going to be an instant hit. With the added bonus' of seeing Peirce Brosman in a musical, Colin Firth singing his heart out and Julie Walters doing what she does best, I was almost certain that this movie was going to be the biggest hit of the year.Oh, Mamma Mia! Was I wrong.Not only was I beyond disappointed with the over-the-top and in-your-face acting, but the vocals from some of the worlds biggest actors and actresses left a lot to the imagination. I have always been an avid Streep fan, but she let her fans down completely by slaughtering some of Abba's most famous songs. Though, her bumpy and octave-jumping voice was nothing in comparison to the torture I felt when Peirce Brosman took center stage. With every syllable I sunk deeper into my chair, wanting to curl up into a ball and imagine my happy place. Yes, it was really that bad.I was pleasantly surprised with Amanda Seyfried, who played the beautiful, soon-to-be-married Sophie. Her beautiful voice ricashaded through the cinema, and not in the same way that Brosman or Streep's had. Although, her talent was not enough to redeem this film from its unending woes.Julie Walters and Christine Baranski were the small, dull lights somewhere in the back of the set. Perhaps the most talented vocalists in the movie, with the exception of Amanda Seyfriend, their energetic portrayals of Rosie and Tanya made me laugh endlessly. I was most impressed with Walter's solo at the end of the film - adapting Abba's timeless classic, Take a Chance on me.Needless to say, I won't be taking another chance on this movie.I left the cinema in disappointment - a movie that had so much potential was ruined by bad casting and terrible vocals. Perhaps the next adaptation of the hit stage show will not leave me wanting a refund for my ticket.I give this film a 3 out of 10, and even that might be generous.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fun Movie, Great Music, Excellent Cast","I like ABBA-- a blast from my past, singable pop classics. I love musicals. When I heard they were making a musical around ABBA songs, I questioned it. Usually music is written around a plot, not vice-versa. This is certainly a weak point. but this movie isn't about plot. It's a celebration of ABBA, a girlfriend movie, and I really enjoyed, despite approaching skeptical. The main reason for this is the cast. With an all-star cast, led my MERYL STREEP! leads an all-star cast. Amanda Seyfried is perfect as her daughter. The supporting cast, all recognizable, are also having a blast. They never take the film to seriously, but they are surprisingly good in their roles, much mores than I expected. It's a unescape from the world.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst film on Earth,"This is the worst film imaginable. I can't imagine how they could make a worse film. I would recommend it to people who want to go to sleep in a cinema. Worst film ever. Sorry, but I'm telling the truth. My sister didn't even like it and she is really girly. I apparently need to fill 10 lines in the review so here's some more. The only part of the film I liked was when the actress with dark hair got on a little boat on the river and couldn't get her balance, she ran backwards and then fall off. If that part of the film wasn't included, it would be 0 out of 10. the 0.5 is due to the fact there was a wedding and therefore the film wasn't made to make people to go to sleep.

A young bride-to-be discovers that one of three men from her mother's past is her father and plots to get them to her wedding so that she can find out which one it is.,"MAMA MIA! Donna (Meryl Streep) is a single mom raising her daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) on a beautiful Greek Island. Sophie is planning for her wedding to Sky (Dominic Cooper) and comes across an old diary that belonged to her Donna during the time she became pregnant with Sophie. Sophie discovers from the diary that there are three possible men that could be her father, Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth), and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) and more than anything she wants her dad at her wedding. Unfortunately for Sophie, more than anything Donna wants none of them to be at the wedding.And the fun begins!! Donna has never divulged any information to Sophie about her father, except that he was not an option that needed to be in their lives. But now, Sophie is all consumed with her dad and what it would mean to her to know him and have him at her wedding. So she secretly invites all three men to her wedding under the pretense that Donna wants each of them there. Donna used to be in girls singing group called Donna and the Dynamos, with her best friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) and so naturally she invites them to the wedding and it becomes a wonderful reunion for the three of them that brings back old memories, heartaches, secrets and a lot of fun.As the guests are arriving, so do the three possible dads, and low and behold, they meet each other on the boat ride to the island, not realizing that they are all there on a false pretense and for the same reason.During the process of discovery for the bride-to-be, many old feelings resurface for Donna and the men. When she first learns that they are on the island and Sophie knows that one of them is her father, Donna is outraged. She goes through every emotion from anger, fear, sadness, elation, paranoia, and confusion and she does it so well.Every fiber of this movie is told with music and singing. One of the things that I enjoyed the most was the way the camera caught so many different angles of the character's movements. Angles that add depth to the film, such as the scene where the three best friends are singing ""Dancing Queen."" The trio is all over the place, acting out the lyrics of the song, helping to relate Donna's current mood to lyrics that are universally familiar. And the musicit's the reason I watched this film the first time.The entire movie is a celebration of ABBA's greatest hits and it feels like the screenplay was created around the music...the two fit like a glove. This film is a wonderful combination of young love, old flames, emerging secrets and a warm, lighthearted story about finding yourself, no matter what how young or how old, and no matter at what price. Once Sophie has set the ball in motion, there is no stopping the laughs, tears, and fun! This is a wonderful movie and I give it a 10; I highly recommend it for anyone who is young at heart, a romantic and loves emotion in song.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I don't know, honestly, why this movie exists","To start, I've been forced to seeing this movie 4 times. That may justify some hard insults. I love musicals when they're actually well made. In my top list of movies is School of Rock, Pick of Destiny and had the wonderful opportunity of seeing a Queen dedicated live musical in London and loved it!This one is just awful.I dislike all the music present in the movie. I mean, I absolutely despise ABBA. It all seems like the same song. All the songs. That might help in building a 1 rated review on this movie.I know it's a musical, but despite not enjoying the music, it could at least be a good performance from the actors and have pleasant photography.It didn't. Amanda Seyfried is such a talented actress yet you see her performance in Mamma Mia and you feel awkward. I don't think she's even enjoying what she's doing. It all seems fake. Overacting is common in musicals and in theater but this pushing the line.I hate this movie and will never allow myself to be forced to watch it again.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad excuse for a musical,"The whole point of making a musical is to enjoy the music. As it, Mamma Mia fails miserably. What could have been a wonderful musical movie is a bad excuse for an ego trip of an old woman who should know better trying to live a pop star teen dream. The bad casting resulting from Mrs. Streep age range hits an all time low with Pierce Brosnan, who can't sing a three note melody without falling out of tune, with a voice that has no place singing any lead role.The Greek locations and the younger casting are marvelous, too bad nobody told the producers that there are actually fine actresses and actors who can sing, and at least, 15 years younger than the average of Mammma Mia's stars.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nothing could save this...,"I resisted for so long, but I figured it only fair to give ""Mamma Mia"" a fair hearing, and tried very hard to go in with an open mind. It is fair to say I'm no Abba fan, but I am a fan of some of the players in this film, and so thought there could be an element of watch-ability to this adaption of what I understand to be a popular musical. With that in mind, and understanding it was only supposed to be a light romp, I was ready to give it a fair go.I was wrong, there was barely anything close to watchable about this attempt at a film. I say barely, because I did get a kick from watching those members of the cast who clearly treated this as a holiday, Julie Walters and Colin Firth, for example, having a great deal of fun on a Greek Island, generally messing about, singing Abba songs badly, and in Walters' case, I believe genuinely being at various stages of inebriation whilst filming.....throughout the entire production! We have Meryl Streep taking the whole thing far too seriously (I love Meryl's acting abilities, but here is not the place to be doing it like this), Colin Firth looking decidedly uncomfortable with every passing scene (the gradual realisation that he has signed up to make a piece of crap?), and everyone else (barring Julie Wlaters, as previously mentioned) giving a hugely forgettable, unfunny, and for the most part stupid performance.This does not, however, include Pierce Brosnan. When I was told his singing is awful, I thought people were exaggerating, and even his performance of ""S.O.S."" is passable for a man who ""can't sing"". Of course, little did I know that he performs one of the closing numbers; did nobody, at any point, realise this was ear-bleedingly atrocious and think to overdub with....someone else?? It really IS that bad, and for this reason, I fear HIS performance will never be forgotten....sadly.As musicals go (I would point out that I have no problem with, and even like a good musical), this is a disgrace to the genre. The idea is stupid, plot points created purely to crowbar more Abba songs in, and the story rapidly goes out the window anyway, the film quickly becoming a pastiche of a load of pretty good actors prancing about. Its colourfulness and playfulness become spirit-crushing and headache- inducing, and even for the most ardent Abba fan, I find it hard to believe the songs come through and save the day.I am aware this review marks me out to be a grumpy, egotistical geek, and perhaps that is so, but make no mistake, I can do fun! I like fun, jolly romps, but I could not enjoy this film on any level, even an ironic ""isn't this funny"" one. No, it is not funny, I am getting bored, and TIRED! Jesus, this film drags! People moaned about the ending of ""Return Of The King"" being ""too many endings"", but at least the idea was to tie up all the characters' stories and actually close the film. ""Mamma Mia"" ends...then it ends...and then it seems to end again! I kid you not, I'm sure it must be close to ten minutes, waiting for the credits to roll. And all because we need more songs, apparently. I have never been this close to clawing my eyes out.You couldn't pay me to put myself through this torture again.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Mamma Mia, Help Me Get Through This Movie","This was one of the worst attempts of a musical I have ever seen. I don't know if it follows that actually play to the tee, but if it does, then I can tell that people who rave about it don't know what a great musical is. The only saving grace was that the music all came from Abba, which is one of my favorite groups of all time.It's about a girl who finds her mother's diary, and invites three men, who might be her father, to her wedding. Meryl Streep, Colin Firth (I LOVE HIM), and Pierce Bronson are part of the cast to this ill-fated musical, and I must say that I am shocked that they signed on to be in it. The acting was not bad, but they didn't finish a sentence before they were singing another tune. What's worse is that their voices were not up to par. I cringed a few times and decided to just fast forward whenever they jumped into song. The plot was campy, and that is a nice way of putting it. Additionally, the movie was way too long for my taste. 90 minutes isn't a bad number. I'm tired of this movies that want to extend over two hours.Aside from Abba, the only good thing about the movie was the scenery. It was in Greece, which is where I want to go for my honeymoon. If it weren't for those two things, I would have just returned it without watching it. Don't waste your time. If you want to listen to Abba, get their greatest hits cd. If you want to see the Greek isles, get a documentary. If you want to see these fine actors, then go see another movie of theirs. I am trying to save you the pain.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mamma Mia,"Mamma Mia! Is an incredibly enjoyable movie, one that sticks with you long after you've seen it. I watched it years ago, and revisiting it today reminded me why it left such a lasting impression. While it may not be the most surprising or groundbreaking film, there's something undeniably captivating about its charm, humor, and heartwarming story.The narrative is beautifully engaging, centered on the bond between Sophie and her mother, Donna, and the layers of mystery and nostalgia woven into Donna's past. The film strikes a perfect balance between comedy and sentimentality, making you laugh and tugging at your heartstrings in equal measure. The premise itself-a young woman trying to figure out which of three men is her father on the eve of her wedding-is not only unique but feels like it could easily be expanded into a series or even a trilogy. There's so much depth to the characters and their relationships that you find yourself wanting more.One of the standout aspects of the film is the way it seamlessly ties its narrative to the timeless music of ABBA. The songs feel like they were written specifically for these moments, elevating every scene they're in. From energetic numbers like Dancing Queen to heartfelt tracks like Slipping Through My Fingers, the soundtrack works as an emotional backbone for the story, bringing the characters' joys and struggles to life in a way that words alone couldn't.The exploration of Donna's past, from her free-spirited youth to her resilience as a single mother, adds so much depth to the film. It's fascinating to see how each of Sophie's potential fathers reflects a different chapter of Donna's life, and the way these elements are gradually revealed keeps the audience fully invested. Moments like Sophie saying, ""My daughter will have a father, which is the most important thing,"" are deeply touching, speaking to her longing for connection while honoring her mother's sacrifices.What makes Mamma Mia! Truly unforgettable, though, is its energy. It's one of those rare movies that's simply fun to watch-lighthearted without feeling shallow, emotional without being overly heavy. The Greek island setting adds to the film's charm, creating a vibrant, idyllic backdrop for the story to unfold. The film's ability to make you feel like you're part of this larger-than-life celebration is what makes it so memorable.There's something about Mamma Mia! That's hard to put into words-it's a movie that leaves a mark on your memory, not because it's perfect but because of its sincerity and heart. It's a feel-good experience, and even after rewatching it, I found myself humming the songs and reflecting on its themes of love, family, and the stories that shape who we are.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Yeah it's silly but exhilarating!,"Musical adaptation of the hit play with Abba songs. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is going to marry handsome Sky (Dominic Cooper) on a Greek island. She lives there with her single mom Donna (Meryl Streep). Sophie wants to find her father to give her away at the wedding. She finds out her mom slept with three different men at the time she was conceived and any one of them can be her dad! They are Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard). She invites them all to her wedding WITHOUT telling her mom.The plot is, to be nice, simplistic and predictable (it's just like the play) but who cares? It's just an excuse to bring in a huge amount of Abba songs belted out full blast by the cast members. Now I LOVE Abba so this movie just had me from the beginning. It was beautifully shot in Greece--some of the scenery takes your breath away. With one exception everyone can sing and the songs are worked seamlessly into the story. All the numbers are good but three stand out for me: Streep letting lose with ""The Winner Takes It All"" and ""Dancing Queen"" (which is turned into a women empowerment song) and Christine Baranski singing ""Does Your Mother Know"" to a beach full of young hunky guys. The dancing is energetic and all the extras are young and attractive (especially the men) and are just great. There's young hunky guys all over the movie. There are some confusing dance numbers (I'm STILL trying to figure out what all those guys are doing during ""Lay All Your Love On Me"") but the energy they have pulls them through. The acting is as good as it can be. Really--this is no great acting challenge but everybody seems to realize this is a slight story and play along with it. A few minor quibbles--the dancing is cut into quick shots here and there. I call it MTV style editing. It's TOO quick! I wanted it to stay put so we can see the dancing. Cooper is handsome and engaging but the character of Sky is supposed to be tall and muscular. Cooper is neither--but he CAN sing. On the other hand Pierce Brosnan can't. Hs singing is terrible! When he started singing ""S.O.S."" my audience broke out laughing! It doesn't ruin the movie but it brings a lot of unintentional laughter.The stage show ends with the cast members coming out and doing two more songs for the audience. The movie ends with Streep, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters singing full blast. At my theatre TONS of paper came out flying from two large ""cannons"" hidden on each side of the screen! The paper went swirling around all through the theatre and REALLY set the audience off! Then Streep asks the audience ""Do you want another one?"" My audience roared ""Yes!"" and ""Waterloo"" came barreling out. I walked out of the theatre laughing and exhausted but full of energy! Even without all the confetti flying around it would have worked.Beautiful fun musical full of energy and color. If you hate Abba don't see it but Abba fans (like me) will LOVE it! A 10 all the way! ADDENDUM: I saw this THREE times at a theatre! I paid FULL PRICE each time!! That must tell you how much I love this.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst movie since remake of Lost Horizon,"One would like to say something good about this film, since it has done so well on the stage. But this travesty of a musical is about as bad as it can be. The casting is lame. The film editing is deplorable. Pierce Brosnan cannot carry a tune in a water bucket. Given their appearance, none of the men could possibly be the girl's father. Halfway through, I was wishing I was somewhere else and hoping the camera would malfunction. Meryl Streep, a fine actress, should fire her agent for getting her into this mess. There is just no continuity in the story, and some of the ABBA songs don't even fit the situations that have been contrived to squeeze them into the production. Buy the soundtrack if you must have something of this to remember.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mama Mia! Exuberance in the Air ***1/2,"I loved the exuberance depicted in this wonderfully entertaining and engaging film.We've come along way from 1968's Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell. The plot remains basically the same but the story line has to be updated to keep abreast of today's living standards.Meryl Streep is great here. Am surprised by her lovely singing voice. Ms. Streep is such a versatile actress. The close ups reveal a much older lady and after all, Streep is approaching 60 or so.The dancing is lively and full of life. The music by abba is rendered in a wonderful pulsating mood.Christine Baranski, though uglier than ever, is memorable here as well as the wonderful Julie Walters, they both sing and dance up a storm here.The guys taken on their roles as the possible fathers with precision. Skarsgaard is older looking, but shifty-eyed to a point. Colin Firth also shows versatility, but it is Brosnan who really captures his part as the guy who really loved the Streep character.This is really a very, very feel good movie.

Feel Good Movie of the Decade,"I've seen some of the stinging comments and completely disagree. This is one of the most fun and feel good movies of the decade. Perhaps the last 30 years. To bad Hollywood and other studios have not caught on to what entertainment is supposed to be. Aren't you supposed to escape real life for a couple of hours and be transported to some feel great place to forget the real and sometimes hectic lives we live. I did that with this movie and left feeling happy and ready for the next day of life. I think this is why ABBA music has survived for so long and I'm happy to see another generation exposed to great lyrics and music. May someone see this that is in influence in Hollywood and attempt to pick up the gauntlet and continue to make fun, feel good movies. Musicals are a way to do this. With our economy in the tank we need to be inspired and have somewhere to forget the trials ahead and be uplifted and left feeling good.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Old Age,"I actually enjoyed the play. Worked great on the stage.However, I could not help but be struck by the fact that according to the premise of the plot, Meryl Streep was old enough to be the girl's Grandmother.

Since singing was not a big criterion for the lead parts, how about Mariska Hargitay, Gillian Anderson, or Jennifer Anniston? Want singers? Jennifer Lopez or Vanessa Williams.

Yes sleeping in this movie was hard but i had to do it, i really dunno, maybe i have issues, but this so called uplifting movie did a good job of depressing me.. i dunno why, everything seemed fake and not sincere.. bad acting from the junior actors, so so from the seniors (and bad singing).I guess faking happiness is turning out to be harder and harder, and they showed that. The story was pure cliché, and if you want to talk Abba in movies, go and check out Priscilla the Queen of the Desert..I went to see this with my family, they enjoyed it, and as we all know, tastes can not be the subject of discussion. I loved Moulin Rouge, and also bought the sound track.. but, this one i could not swallow. Maybe this has to do with maturity, or at least, movie watching maturity..

I needed counselling after watching this film!,"The only reason I stayed the whole way through this film was that I was working when I went to see it (I'm a support worker and the person I was working with wanted to see it). I love ABBA and love musicals so was fairly optimistic when I went in. What passes for a plot is completely ludicrous. Each actor seems to be working for a different director (judging by the variation in styles). Also, Meryl Streep may be a great actress but the age gap was just too big. For her to have had a 'fling' with the three men would have meant it was a mid-life crisis rather than a youthful indiscretion to have given birth to the young girl playing her daughter. I just wanted to give Pierce Brosnan a hug when he started singing to reassure him that people will forget this film eventually.The rest of the singing and dancing wouldn't have passed muster in our old school productions. The film seemed to go on for half a lifetime and I spent part of it writing my shopping list so my time wasn't totally wasted.

Great songs and positive energy,"Consider it a guilty pleasure, but I was caught up in the charm and high spirits of Mamma Mia! For those who have been asleep, this is the film version of the hit Broadway musical, a movie incidentally that has now surpassed Titanic as the biggest box office hit in UK history. Culled from the jukebox tunes of the Swedish pop group Abba that roll around in your head forever, the film stars the ubiquitous Meryl Streep and the ever charming Pierce Brosnan, two enormously popular Hollywood stars, as the romantic leads with some strong supporting help.Set on a remote Greek island, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is about to be married to Sky (Dominic Harper) but wishes her dad was there to give her away. Seems like she doesn't really know who her father is so she invites to the wedding the three men her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) has written about in her diary: Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) who writes travel books, Harry (Colin Firth) a banker, and Sam (Pierce Brosnan) a businessman. Donna, who runs a crumbling hotel on the island, is naturally quite taken aback when she sees her ex-boyfriends and it is left up to Sophie and friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) to sort everything out. None of the men realize, however, why they have been invited but when things sink in, each claims to be Sophie's father and is ready to walk her down the aisle.Ultimately, the three wise men do everything in their power to make the wedding a success which leads to some silly moments and some that are genuinely moving. Amanda Seyfried has a purity and innocence about her that is quite captivating and Meryl Streep, though not blessed with a great singing voice, more than makes up for it with her passion and versatility. Her singing is more than adequate, however, especially in Slipping Through My Fingers, The Winner Takes It All, Money, Money, Money, Voulez-Vous, and Does Your Mother Know? With stunning photography and timeless Abba hits of the 1970s such as Dancing Queen, Take a Chance on Me, Mamma Mia, SOS, Super Trooper and many others, the film is pure entertainment. If the director had included some real singers and dancers and fewer manic production numbers, it might have even been memorable. Barring that, one settles for great songs and positive energy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The perfect example of a Marmite Movie,"The typical elements in horror movies are suspense, physical and psychological threat, gore and death and maybe malevolent reanimation. You know the sort of thing, creepy visuals or a loony on the rampage, armed with something sharp. A common enough feature in contemporary horror is the jump scare, something that is as much aural as it is visual. Some horror movies basically rely upon loud jolts. But it's important to remember that sound is as potent a weapon (I accidentally wrote 'as potent a woman'; Freudian slip?) as anything heavy or stabby or spooky. Sound weapons are used by the military. Loud noises are used in - what was the euphemism - enhanced interrogation techniques. Many an army has marched onto the battlefield beating drums and hollering the war cry to intimidate the opponents. On the domestic front, an angry partner screaming in your ear, piercing and shrill, such is not merely an expression of emotion, it is a form of aggression, of intimidation, intended to quell.So, why all that preamble about sound weaponry? Well, so you won't bridle (pun intended) when I say that wedding comedy musical Mamma Mia! Is a horror movie. For yea, I say unto you, it is thusly, a pelicula terror! Remember Bill Burr's rant about Titanic not being a great romantic movie but rather a horror (""All the guys died!). He ain't lying, and neither am I. The difference between Titantic and Mamma Mia is that all the guys/music lovers die in the audience at a screening of this musical hellscape. The actors on screen merely die in a musical sense.Mamma Mia! Is a great example of the Marmite Movie, meaning it is an either/or experience, one either loves or loathes it. There's no inbetween ground, no purgatory. This is hell or heaven. The adaptation of a stage 'dukebox' musical, a glorified karaoke party for the movie stars who appear in it, and twelve rounds of musical murder for one out of every two viewers. I never saw the stage version but one must presume that musical theatre professionals were hired, whereas the producers of this movie evidently thought it would be funny to hire actors who either couldn't sing, or dance, or maybe both. The male performers are allegedly the worse, but for me it was the sound of actress Christine Baranski piping up that sent me running in panic.I wonder if hiring this bunch - when I called it karaoke I wasn't kidding - was a decision inspired by Woody Allen's use of non-musical theatre actors 'sing' and 'dance' through his own dukeboxer, Everyone Says I Love You.This movie is a violation, and not a moving violation. It borrows songs from the ABBA songbook and attempts, clumsily, to shoehorn them into a feelgood movie set in Greece, where a young bride seeks to discover which of three men is her long lost father. Even the plot is borrowed, according to the Guardian's film critic, from an old Gina Lollobrigida movie, so there's literally nothing original in this movie. Visually it is so overbright as to do violence to one's eyeballs. Forget 3D glasses, you'll need shades and suncream, not forgetting earplugs, possibly a straitjacket, to stick it.So, to summarize, the visuals hurt the eyes, the story hurts the brain, the appropriation of ABBA's songs hurts the heart and their woeful execution damages the soul. British film critic Mark ""Dr K."" Kermode never recovered from seeing Mamma Mia! You can observe his PTSD in the Youtube video of his review for 5 Live. He's never been the same since. According to him, you literally have to adopt the crash position to make it through a full screening of this movie. Or you, could do what i did and perform an act of self preservation, fight or flight, and simply run away.Unquestionably the worst movie I have ever seen. So bad I had to flee. Approach cautiously and agree upon a safe word before pressing START.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I think this is the best movie of the last few years,"I think this is the best movie of the last few years. I'm not a particular ABBA fan, but I like their music, and this movie makes it shine again after all those years. I'm 28 and my parents were listening to this music when I was a little boy, so there is a melancholic side of the movie for me. But the way the music is embedded in the story it is just fantastic. And when you think that everything is sang by actors so authentic and beautiful ... this film is the perfect entertainment for young and old, for single and family ...Best movie for me, hope it will get some Oscar's next year.PS: Happy new year!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mamma Rules,"For over a year, as a huge Abba fan, I have been horrified by the mere notion of this movie, and terrified by the idea of Meryl Streep starring. I really hated the musical with a vengeance. Went to see it twice, thinking I might have misunderstood it the first time.After having seen the really bland trailers, heard the shrill Streep and the piercing Brosnan on You Tube, seen the atrocious costumes, the lovely dance Meryl did with Agnetha and Frida on the Stockholm carpet, well, I was electrified, welcome to you here I am my arms are open wide (as in 'I am the city') to go watch the resulting movie with my better half and our friends.First impression: it probably was bit like Ocean 12 for them: a total guilty pleasure and the fun these post-midlife crisis folks had in the making of, splatters off screen. Meryl's wild arms' gestures in Mamma Mia made me fear I might have to vomit. But, as soon as her Donna character meets her exes (which is fairly at the beginning), everything turned for me. I must say, I love all three actors (bravo to them for taking up these roles! The horrible singing at least is natural), and what a fun trio they made up, those guys. But the real discovery is Streep. Not only does she pull it off, diving into the Abba classics with merry self-deprecating mockery, she makes the songs her own. My highlights were Slipping Through My Fingers, which is one of Agnetha's signature songs, SOS and, yes, The Winner Takes It All -to cover that song is sacrilegious. She made it beautifully. The Dancing Queen reprise is spectacular, better than the first performance. Fair enough, I do want the 'real thing' after having watched this, but I'm sure that may have been the whole purpose. Special mention for Julie Walters, the spunky kid, and Amanda Seyfried, who's a lovely songstress. Minuses: the direction, the art direction and the story. Too bad about The name of the game, One of Us, I wonder and many more (My love my life, My Mama Said, Like an Angel Passing..., Tiger)?Abba rules forever, and Ms. Streep seemingly has endlessly deep running talents. We knew that already and can now look forward to her next projects, Doubt and Julie & Julia.This is a movie you safely can take your grandmother and children to see.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A bit like watching your grandma get drunk at a wedding trying to get it on with all the young men,"This film is the biggest UK box office success of all time. Forget Star Wars, forget Jaws, forget Titanic. This is the one. On that basis, i had to see for myself what all the fuss was for. I have to say i was amazed at how shoddy and painful this film was. It's a bit like watching your grandma drunk at a wedding trying to get it on with all the young men on the dancefloor. Im sure if you are female and fall in to the age category of 45-66 then you would find this film endearing but for everyone else its like pulling teeth. Even the music is badly reproduced and even though the actors sing in tune, they do nothing with the songs that makes you sit up and take notice. I was heavily disappointed with Mamma Mia,it felt forced and had nothing other than a great location to recommend it to anyone.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fun, funny, and flirty","The wildly popular stage success Mamma Mia! finally took its place on the big screen ten years after Broadway showcased ABBA's most beloved songs. Even if you don't like ABBA-like my mom-you're going to eventually rent this movie. You'll probably end up owning it, like my mom does. It's just so cute! Yes, most of the songs don't have anything to do with the surrounding scenes and are just an excuse to prance around and sing another ABBA tune, but it's fun and funny and flirty. There are a few songs that are very well placed, towards the end, and those moments where the sing-a-long movie turns into a real musical are worth the wait.If you've seen Postcards from the Edge, you know Meryl Streep can sing the pants off a country song. But she has other styles, too! Taking the leading role, she gets to belt out, ""The Winner Takes It All,"" as well as softly croon, ""Slipping Through My Fingers."" And, since she's Meryl Streep, she doesn't play this as a silly musical comedy. She finds the human aspect in the struggling single mother and shows the audience that the primary motivation of her life has been her daughter. Yes, she prances around during the random ""Dancing Queen"" number, but whenever she's anywhere near her daughter, she's kissing and hugging and wiping away sentimental tears. The point of the movie is not one giant excuse to sing disco songs. It's a daughter's attempt to find herself by meeting her father, unaware that she has such a strong bond with her mother, the rest doesn't really matter. If the mother character doesn't act like a mother, the story doesn't work. No one can play Mother like Meryl Streep can, and when she gazes at her daughter, memories of her childhood are so vivid, the audience can practically see them.Not many people know this, because the original 1968 screenplay doesn't get any credit, but Mamma Mia! is a musical version of the adorable Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell. I like the original story infinitely better, so if you like the idea of a single mother with three potential fathers to her child, check out Gina Lollobrigida's comedy.Feel free to laugh at me, but every time I watch Mamma Mia!, I bawl my eyes out. I have two favorite songs in the movie, and one of them was unfortunately cut from the final print. I always make sure to watch ""The Name of the Game"" included in the deleted scenes of my DVD, because it's a wonderfully fitting moment between Amanda Seyfried and one of her potential fathers, Stellan Skarsgard. ""Slipping Through My Fingers"" was not cut from the film, and it never fails to make me cry. As Amanda gets ready for her wedding, Meryl sings a touching tribute to her childhood. Amanda cuts her leg while shaving, and Meryl kisses it better with a Band-Aid. She's still a little girl who needs her mother, and getting married won't ever change that.Filmed on location in Greece, the sparkling blue waters, beautiful beaches and cliffs will make you want to plan your next vacation. This movie is a lot of fun, and although it's not as good as its predecessor, it's a great choice when you want to relax and watch a bunch of actors and actresses having a blast. It's so obvious that Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard, and Colin Firth enjoy every bit of screen time singing, and dancing, and Amanda Seyfried has just as much fun with her two bridesmaids as Meryl Streep has with her two girlfriends, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters. Whether you watch it for the first or hundredth time, with your mom, your girlfriends, or by yourself, you know you're in for a great evening when you pop in Mamma Mia!DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Meryl Streep goes up on the roof during ""Mamma Mia,"" there's a huge upside-down camera swirl. There's another swirl at the beginning of ""Chiquitita"". And during ""Voulez-Vous"" there are both fluid camera movements and flashing lights that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Theater to Film Troubles,"This adaptation is getting the full brunt of my annoyance with films that were once musicals yet don't hire theatrical actors. It's a totally different style of acting, particularly with musicals where you need to sing and dance and be aware of your whole body every second of the song. I say sing but really they ridiculously lip-synch and dance, another annoyance. If actors and musicians can do it every night on stage why can't a film actor do it for a few scenes a few times a day! Stagger the filming so no one is singing too much at once, know what your doing physically so it's only a couple takes. I'd rather see little cutting bloopers than the weird mouth movements and missed dance steps of fake singing! This is a romantic comedy cast and what looks like random Greek locals who accidentally stumbled into a musical and tried to make the best of it. I'm blaming the director for the uncontrolled mess they made of it, because I'm blaming him also for the choppy cutting between pretty Greek locations and crappy CGI backgrounds- again, plan ahead in your filming!Other than several tiny points which drive me crazy this is just the fun, silly musical it advertises itself to be and on which people based their recommendation to me. Good for a light evening or weekend afternoon viewing. Make sure you like ABBA first, this is a full-fledged musical.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

TV Sitcom quality if that...,"Meryl Steep was the only reason I wanted to see this film. As usual she's very good - but far from Oscar nominee consideration. I suppose it's a ""happy"" film. I was bored to death - even when Ms. Streep overwhelmed the (my HDTV-HBO) silver screen. Contrived story/plot line contributed to my overall chagrin. In fact - in all fairness - I had to turn it off after 90 minutes - so I might have done myself a great injustice? I simply could not take another minute of someone breaking out in disco melody.Okay, take the plot: young girl (overplayed by Ms. Amanda Seyfried) wants her father - a man she's never met to give her away at her wedding. Sitcom plot intervenes - she's got three fathers. I should've stopped there - but I subjected myself - only because Meryl must continue through this trash and I was compelled to be her audience. While she was good - even Meryl could not rise above the poor direction, writing and casting. Pierce Bronson can not act his way out of a paper bag and is uncomfortably miscast as one of the fathers. Julie Walters, another great talent wasted as Meryl's long ago singing partner. Christine Baranski completes the supreme singing trio and phones in her lackluster performance.The backdrop of the Greek isle (I read it was filmed on location) looked like something off a studio backlot.I guess I did not like this film. I'll give it another try someday.The ""Abba"" soundtrack was poorly mixed in some silly attempt to make it more contemporary. It was 70/80's pop trash and is equally - if not worse - for the film version.3/10 only for Ms. Streep's attempt to make this sitcom reject palatable.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect Bullseye for A Summer Movie,"Fantastic, fun, and entertaining. If you like Abba songs, you'll love the movie, and maybe you'll like it for the humor and just plain fun and silliness even if you don't like the music so much, though this truly is a musical with a lot of songs crammed in it. I don't usually care for musicals, but this somehow hit the spot. I wish more movies were shot in the beautiful Mediterranean islands, because the setting was absolutely gorgeous. Watching the movie was like being on vacation without having to travel anywhere. I still remember watching Abba win the Eurovision Song Contest with ""Waterloo.""

Love It!,"I'm a huge fan of musicals anyway but still I'm pretty hard to please. ""Mamma Mia!""was excellent! The only reason that I didn't give it a 10 is... well, in my mind a 10 equals perfection and no movie is perfect. All the vocalists were at least competent and able to carry a tune. Who knew Meryl Streep had a decent singing voice? Go figure. The songs tied in neatly to the storyline and there were plenty of laugh-out-loud scenes, some of which left me in tears and gasping for breath. This film is pure camp, all the actors know it's pure camp and they are inviting us along for the ride. Don't come to this one looking for anything profound - just come expecting a good time.

"Splash yourself with Mama Mia, this summer's most refreshing feel good movie!","The last movie I had seen was The Dark Knight. I thought it was a masterpiece but it turned me off from movies in theater for a while, because what movie could top that? It was pretty powerful to me. But than I heard those rave reviews for Mama Mia-which is very different movie; I'm not comparing the two at all! At least three people I know and respect in opinions of movies have seen this movie twice in theaters, and yes they are all woman but my dad went with me and LOVED it too. (and he's 60's years old) so it's a movie for everyone.I wanted to see it because I remember my 14 year old self singing along to Mama Mia and Dancing Queen and as the movie progressed I remembered the lyrics and mouthed with them. I am still singing them in my head ""Mama Mia, here we go again. My, my how did we let you go?"" ""Dancing Queen, young and sweet and only sevevteennnn."" This is a film that never takes itself seriously. The supporting cast was hilarious and very talented. It had been one of the best audience reactions I've had in a long time. All around us people were shrieking with laughter and clapping at the end of the songs and of course with the end of the movie. You can't help but get into the movie when you have an audience like that.I have enjoyed Meryle's work, and respect her great as an actress. But her voice blew me away! And I was shocked at how good Pierce Brosnan was too. As soon as I saw him I wanted him to sing and he did, more than once mind you! This is not a serious movie like the Dark Knight or other dramas. This is a feel good movie to see with your family and friends, if they like musicals. By the end of the movie I was wanting to sing and dance like they were on the screen and take a dive in that refreshing looking water around them.And let's not forget the story. The music was great but so was the story. This was not only a great coming of age movie but a great movie for older woman about regrets and letting go and moving on from the past and looking into the future. A great mother daughter film, if you ask me. All ages will enjoy this one. I know my Grandmother will when she finally see it.Go and experience it in the theater while you still can! If not, rent it as soon as it comes out. I'm going to buy it. And the soundtrack too. You won't regret seeing one of the best movies of the year. It's sure to win a couple of academy awards, for the music and costumes along. It is truly a refreshing summer treat!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I felt ashamed of being Swedish,"As a Swede, one is somehow supposed to be proud of ABBA:s success - almost to feel like you are part of it. But I have never felt like that; on the contrary. I think the music is too simple and the texts too naive. It is alright to dance to in a disco, when you are a bit tipsy, I suppose - but I have never understood the big ""hype"" about ABBA.Also, when you have seen Agneta and Annifrid try to pursue solo careers after ABBA split up, it became so obvious that they did not have much of a talent or voice or charm or anything. The ABBA phenomena was a result of extremely clever PR and the right timing - nothing more.Therefore, I did not expect much of this movie either. Still, it was even worse than my expectations! I really cannot understand how they persuaded big celebrities like Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan to take part in it..??? The way they have striven to make the plot fit in with the songs is very contrived. Every time someone started singing, I wanted to hide behind a pillow for shame...Also, I hate the way the movie portrays women - both the young and the middle-aged. Giggling, drinking, teasing each other, thinking only about sex, weddings, guys, how to find a rich man etc.. Me and my woman-friends have certainly never been behaving that silly when we have been seeing each other, and I do not want men to think that all women do...Still - Greek islands and the blue Mediterranean are always beautiful to watch.

My big fat dumb Greek wedding.,"I don't know where to begin. Terrible music, poorly arranged. Dance routines that look like a high school musical.

I wish I had listened to her. The audience seemed to love it. They laughed and laughed each time one of the characters fell into the water. This was the worst movie I have seen in a theater since ""Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band"" starring Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees. The Greek Chorus! Impressive.

And this was a hit Broadway play?,"I can't believe I watched the entire movie. If my friend hadn't bought my ticket I think I would have left the theater half way through the movie. The plot line was rather simplistic, character development nearly non-existent, and the emotion was forced.The inner workings of the characters' minds is only scratched at and viewers are left to fill in the blanks. As far as singing is concerned I think I heard better vocals with more emotional depth in Moulin Rouge or Hairspray. Also the integration of the songs was not seamless. It felt like the actors were told at certain points to break from the film reality, do a song number,and then resume. And the fact that the chorus kept popping up out of nowhere to join in the songs was distracting and a little creepy. In a well done musical the songs seem to evolve effortlessly from the moment. Not so in this movie. The film is silly and yet I rarely laughed. If a film is going to be silly I at least expect some gut busting laughs. Didn't happen. There were two tender moments in the film, Donna's song to Sophia as she helps her prepare for the wedding and Donna singing ""Winner Takes All"". On the bright side the colors were dazzling and the scenery was beautiful. Also the Dynamos were quite humorous especially with their performance of ""Dancing Queen"".

Great fun,"Loved it! A great adaptation of the stage show. Why shouldn't it be, with the creators of the stage show at the helm. As for Benny and Bjorn's songs, how amazing to think the the fabulous arrangements of 30 years ago still sound joyful and infectious. Catherine Johnson does a neat job of constructing a story round the songs. So when Meryl (brilliant!) starts MONEY,MONEY,MONEY, it makes sense - Donna has been struggling for years. Of course, having Meryl, Christine and Julie as a singing group (Donna and the Dynamos) meant songs like SUPER TROUPER and DANCING QUEEN didn't need a story context. I liked the use of the Greek villagers as chorus. And the imaginative staging of each number was very good. My only quibble (as with CHICAGO and MOULIN ROUGE)was the over editing of dance scenes. Cutting every 5 or 10 seco0nds is ridiculous. Let's see the dancing! Wonder why the soundtrack cd doesn't have the wonderful finale of DANCING QUEEN and WATERLOO. I hope the DVD has lots of extras! My favorite song is THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL, sung so passionately by Meryl. I don't suppose Meryl would do any concerts but if she did and she came to my home town Glasgow, we have a lovely Royal Concert Hall. I can imagine the reception she would get if she sang SUPER TROUPER and got to that line: ""..When I called you last night from Glasgow..""!

"Very disappointed - total ""feel bad"" factor","I heard some of the reviews and music, so off I went with wife and son to enjoy it. The ABBA music was really catchy and no-one mentioned ""global warming,"" which was a real 'plus.' This was a film that accurately reflects what goes on in society: it contains liberal profanity and sexual innuendo, infidelity, fornication and homosexuality.Why, oh why could the writer not have made a film that celebrated all this good music but enjoyed the decency of good relationships, happy endings and better language? I shall see nothing from this writer again.This film is said to give one ""a feel good factor,"" too. Well, I think it does, but only for those that indulge in such practices and who wish to justify their proclivities and feel they are not alone in their self indulgence. One feels less guilty about it by watching films such as this one.The principal actors could have done better for themselves in a better film but sang as well as I would have expected them to - as actors. Why should they be considered poor?Summarizing: so much hype, so little content and less enjoyment. PG? I wouldn't want my 18 year old to see this.

She's an actress of many faces and this was one delightful Walters. Christine Baranski's legs still stretch to her neck and she looks fabulous.The mendespite their middle years, are sexy buggers one and all, with their individual appeal shining through.The songs are as danceable now as they were when Abba made them famous all over the world.

Quickly Loses Steam and becomes Exhausting to Watch,"I'm not opposed to musicals, as long as they are done well, like 'La La Land.' And though I would not call myself a huge fan of ABBA, I do enjoy a handful of their songs, many of which were used in the movie. Still, this is certainly not a movie made for me.If you love musicals and ABBA and cheesy romances, you'll probably love this movie too. If your tolerance for an absurd storyline and endless decadent musical numbers is low, you should avoid this one.At first, I didn't have to try-I just liked it. Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried exude such bubbly energy and joy that it's all easy to enjoy. The plot is somewhat believable-a soon-to-be-married girl invites three strangers to her wedding, anyone of whom may be her father. She hopes to meet her father and have him walk her down the aisle. Her mother, who hasn't seen any of the men in 20 years, has no idea what her daughter has planned.One thing leads to the next, and one song leads to the next, and try as I did, I couldn't manage to keep liking the movie. The whimsy wears thin before long. Eventually, it all builds to a ridiculous bit of inconceivable nonsense. Then more reckless decisions are made and celebrated. The next sound you'll hear isn't music. It's the slap of countless palms hitting foreheads throughout the audience.Even before the troublesome ending, the movie just runs out of steam. Then it carries on for another hour. Evidently, it's difficult to construct a cohesive and compelling movie plot around a bunch of ABBA songs (no kidding!). And to anyone who isn't an ABBA superfan, the songs become exhausting.

The Music Wins This One,"Sophie (Seyfried) is about to get married and she wants to surprise her unmarried mother, Donna (Streep), by inviting three men who have courted her mother and one of which is Sophie's father.The music wins this one as the cast performed ABBA music. I am such a fan of ABBA that even though the cast performed the music I heard only the real ABBA sing. Oh, the cast was okay and if you never heard ABBA music, you could immediately fall in love with it. But, once you hear the real ABBA perform the music, everything else pales no matter how old you grow. Yes, there must have been times when lip syncing was done due to the seaside nature of some shots, but still it was okay. I only heard ABBA perform.The story was okay but if it weren't for the ABBA music it would have been an ""Oh Hum"" made for TV movie. And, hard to believe that Pierce Brosnan can carry a tune. He did good.The director let the cast get away with overacting. Yes, a lot of the acting was over-the-top, but maybe they had so much fun with everything that the director let it go. ABBA music can have that effect so they are forgiven. ABBA music can make you go a little crazy. It is that good. For me, you can have your Beatles, Rolling Stones and any other group that you think is the best you have ever heard. Go listen to ABBA and get back to me. There was no group better. Well, Fleetwood Mac and the Bee Gees were pretty good too. Yes, I know there is no accounting for taste(or the lack of it) Got it out of your system? (I think so)And, you know, I think this would have been a lot better if the music from the real ABBA was in here. The lip syncing would not have been noticed (too much). And, I would have been okay with that.FYI: I did hear a rumor that ABBA was offered $1-Billion to perform again. They turned it down because they knew they could never, now, sound as good as they did back in the day. Talk about class.I only heard ABBA perform.Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Sexual Content: Yes.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Those who can't do...critique?,"I think this film is amazing. It's just all kinds of fun. Forget that Pierce Brosnan can't really sing (incidentally, the second time I saw this, and the numerous times I've listened to the soundtrack, he's kind of grown on me), and that the cinematography is horrid. It shouldn't matter. It's a fun movie with a fabulous cast of characters, and dazzling Greek scenery. For a great escapist film, ""Mamma Mia"" is the one to rent! I think everyone can relate to Sophie, wanting to know who her father is, thinking that's where her future lies. Or with Donna, whose past comes back to haunt her in the form of three flings from back in the day. But lucky for both of them, they each have two supportive best friends (who are carbon copies of each other. Donna=Sophie, Rosie/Tanya=Lisa/Ali), and for Donna, an entire Greek Chorus telling her what she wants is right in front of her face. It's a nice throwback to classic theater that way.

Quite Charming,"I thought this movie was great. The writer did a fantastic job adapting it for the big screen and her love of ABBA came through loud and clear. I know it's a stretch to think that Meryl Streep and Pierce Bosnan can sing but they did a passable job. However, if you are expecting Broadway type singers you'll be disappointed but the acting was very good and the plot was charming. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) was fantastic both as a singer and an actor. Colin Firth is always good and Christine Baranski was funny as ever. There are quite a few songs that I didn't recognize but most of the popular ABBA songs were there and the audience was humming and toe-tapping along. There was one song that was a little long and drawn out in the middle of the show but some tunes were just background music. I also noted that everyone (young and old) came out of the theater smiling and some singing so that's my indication that it's an excellent feel-good movie. Go see it with a date.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tapping your toe won't make this musical adaptation get much better,"""Mamma Mia!"" is one of those movies that looks like it was more fun for the cast than it was for the audience. The actors look like they're having a blast dancing on the shores and piers of various Greek islands, while in the meantime we sit in a theater trying to hum our way through another poor conversion of a stage musical to the silver screen.The musical, based on music by Swedish pop group ABBA, was written for the stage by Catherine Johnson, who also writes the screenplay. Bringing her vision to life is fellow Brit theatre director Phyllida Lloyd. Between them, the two haven't a lick of real movie-making experience and it shows. Stage minds should never be put in charge of a movie, something proved many a time, most recently Susan Stroman's ""The Producers"" movie, the Mel Brooks musical she directed on stage. The thinking of theatre minds does not grasp the scope of film and so ""Mamma Mia!"" looks more like a scrapbook of music montages, cheesy dances and bad MTV videos.The hit Broadway show takes some narrative suggestions in the lyrics of several ABBA songs and dreams up a way to thread them together, really quite genius. A young girl named Sophie (Amanda Seyfried, most notably the ditzy Karen from ""Mean Girls"") is getting married on a Greek island where her former pop singer mother (Streep) runs a hotel. Unsure of who her father is but curious, she invites the only three possible candidates in hopes she'll find out which one it is. The men are older English hunks Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and not-so- much-hunk Stellan SkarsgardThe musical is diluted on the screen by a feeling that all the songs need to be included, that the show can naturally translate when in fact it's more of a showy feel-good musical and not a very visual story. Numbers are forced and the camera feels lost because it doesn't know what to focus on. When it runs out of ideas, terrible things happen like an image of Meryl Streep's face in a roulette wheel singing about money. Johnson and Lloyd between them have no creative answers and settle with stage direction.Even as talented as Streep is, some of the things she's asked to do in this movie have me convinced she just took the money and said ""I'll at least have fun with this."" Her talents help most in the drama between mother and daughter and perhaps she rubs off on Seyfried who is really quite nice too. Both have the best singing voices in the movie too, though Streep does have to stylize her singing a bit more to make up for her vocal shortcomings. On the opposite of that spectrum is Brosnan, who must've worked tirelessly with a vocal coach to no avail. Clearly star power was valued more than musical talent in much of the casting.Most of the cast has great chemistry, but I would too if I were out there wining and dining in Greece with all these notable actors when the camera wasn't rolling. Fun is easy to capture on camera -- a stage musical is not. Truthfully, it's worth the higher admission price to see the show again or even just listen to its soundtrack than waste time with this movie version. It's all about the music anyway.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
so much fun!,"Sure, the plot's silly, Pierce Brosnan can't sing, and there is WAY too much screeching in the first 1/2 hour of the film. But that doesn't matter, because it is so much FUN!If you go to the cinema with an open mind, you will LOVE this movie. It's not pretending to be a serious film with deep characters, it's there to lift your spirits and have a good time. It was the most fun I've had in ages and I think what it is is it's so bad it's good and now I still can't get ABBA songs out of my head!I went to the cinema expecting there to only be a couple of people in there as it's been out a couple of weeks now, but the cinema was full, and a lot of the people had even seen it before. I think that's what made the film so much fun as people were laughing a lot, clapping at the end of good songs and even singing along at the end. At one point, people even started shouting at the screen (I can't tell you where, it'll ruin the plot) and I think all of this made the film even better as I could see everyone else was enjoying it too and having a great time. I have been to the cinema a lot and this was the first ever film where there was an applause at the end, showing the audience's appreciation of the film.So, what's good about Mamma Mia!? It doesn't take itself seriously and has lots of funny moments. I thought the random villagers that pop up as the backing singers for each song were good too! The songs were really catchy and make you want to sing along, and even if you don't like ABBA it's worth going to see as it's just a feel-good musical that happens to have ABBA songs in it (I don't even like ABBA that much). Meryl Streep is very good at singing and portrays strong emotion in The Winner Takes It All, and her daughter is a good actress too. Donna's two friends are very good and Julie Walters almost steals the show at some points! I think that the three men chosen for the Dads were good for their roles, especially Colin Firth (""I'm Spontaneous""!). The film never dragged and the 1 3/4 hours flew by. When it ended, we all wanted more, and make sure that you stay to see the singing in the credits. They even managed to shoe Waterloo in there!So, in conclusion, if you haven't seen it yet, GO!Also, a note for any man who's unsure: My Dad's the most heterosexual man I know, and he really enjoyed the film as well!

"Great Songs, Atrocious Direction and Cinematography","While the premise and the Abba songs make for a great stage musical (the rest of the songs are like listening to chalk squeaking on a blackboard and the words about as memorable), and while Phillida Lloyd may be a great stage director, film is definitely not her forte.

Oh, it's a great chick flick cum Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants or Little Miss Sunshine with music, but West Side Story it ain't.

"More than ""putting lipstick on a pig""","I must admit, when I first agreed to watch ""Mama Mia!"" with my wife, I felt I was doing penance for some terrible slight that I didn't remember. I've always considered ABBA to be a ""guilty pleasure,"" songs too inconsequential for me to change the FM station, but nothing I'd even consider having in my collection. I honestly believe ABBA represents the 70s at its worst, conspiring perfectly with the dreadful clothing styles and visual elements of the time.

"Wrong director, and the cast?  Not so sure","Meryl Streep as always is a consummate actress. She pulls off a strong performance. Most of the main cast, also good, however there are problems with the cast, problems with the choreography and definitely problems with the director. It needed someone with a real motion picture vision, who can take a mediocre script and plot, with songs most everyone knows, and really make it work. It just didn't do it for me. Camera angles were disturbing, the constant thump thump throb of music with same type of dancing was boring and Meryl is asked to jump up and down all over the place, which works on stage, but the film limits everyone.Too bad! I was hoping for something stronger. I saw the show and enjoyed it. Let's face it, the show is an international phenomenon, which one cannot explain, except for the obvious, ABBA is so very popular. And the music is interjected in the right places. The film doesn't work as well as the stage performance. You can of course just sit back and enjoy the music if you want, even if the arrangements are a bit dull.Meryl S has a lovely voice - and has been professionally trained. It shows! Too bad she didn't do more musicals when she was younger.I am sure many will enjoy the film. The big problem as mentioned before, the director is poor and she had no control over the motion picture. Too bad!",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meh is all I can say,"Mama Mia! is really a film made exclusively for Abba fans, it lacks much depth, the songs work, but the film's plot ultimately fits in to the category of a loosely constructed plot around the music. There have been many other films to do a similar thing much better (Moulin Rouge, for instance). Mama Mia has a few great lines and some funny moments, but ultimately gets lost in it's own rediculousness. The film really felt like an extended youtube lip syncing video with ludicrous choreography.

Doesn't work as well as it should do,"Who doesn't like ABBA music? There's no doubt that the infectious songs are the best and cheeriest part of Mamma Mia! Unfortunately the rest of the film can't live up to it. The story has potential but its payoffs are weak. The cast feel out of tune with each other and the music. They're either too comfortable and it's cringeworthy drunken karaoke or too uncomfortable and difficult to watch. Perhaps it's due to the lack of charisma from Amanda Seyfried, who usually has a personality, but here she couldn't be less interesting. I imagine it's something that works way better on stage because all you need is a pretty young thing but film demands more, at least a more visionary director. The production design is otherwise underwhelming and unconvincing, not having the colour that it needs, although it may have the sunlight. Catchy songs sure, but I can't help but not be convinced by the conviction, even if there's a touch of passion there.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Eh,"Having never seen Mamma Mia! Before, it was kind of what I was expecting/dreading it would be.ABBA = good, but ABBA presented like this? Not nearly as good.The reports of Pierce Brosnan being bad at singing have been greatly exaggerated. He's not good, but he's not as unbearably bad as most people say. Russell Crowe also got Pierce Brosnan-ed when he had a particularly distinct way of singing in Les Miserables, too. I don't think Crowe was even the closest thing to the worst part of that movie. Then again, this could all just be showing that I'm not very good at assessing what's good or bad when it comes to singing.Visually, this movie looks weird. I don't think the direction is good, but it kind of works, just barely, here and there. Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried do well, considering they're not given much. There is a relaxed atmosphere and very summery feel to this movie that I can understand might be appealing to many people. The only aspect of this I hated was Donna's former bandmates/friends.

I thought Colin Firth sounded a bit like a Bee Gee. All in all it was a fun movie. I went a couple of times to see it with different people and everyone enjoyed watching the movie.

It's no Chicago,"The main problems with this movie is that they didn't take advantage of the transition to the big screen and the songs are sung in a dull manner, the direction is lousy, the actors themselves are singing and not professional singers.

There are no colorful lights here or captivating direction.This movie is nothing like Chicago, which was professionally made. Instead we get a lousy movie that butchers ABBA.If you want to see the songs of ABBA being sung in a boring way, go see this movie.

A Nutshell Review: Mamma Mia!,"I grew up to the songs of Swedish group ABBA (yeah, I was born in the 70s, can?), and yes I'm fan enough to have bought their definitive collection CD and DVD years ago to add to my library, and have it all in my iPod so that I can listen to the evergreens that never fail to put a smile on my face, although some songs actually have really heartbreaking moments in them if you listen carefully.Hollywood continues to plunder past musicals on stage and previously on screen, to come up with an updated version for celluloid, and it's actually no surprise that they roped in director Phyllida Lloyd, who directed the original Broadway play, to helm the cinematic version of Mamma Mia! which in itself is quite genius to have been able to design a narrative around the songs already published by the pop band. And the result of course is nothing less than a crowd pleaser, especially for a fan like myself.I guess the trailers would already put in enough hints on what the storyline is about, that plays out like a Greek comedy with a bride to be Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) in wanting to know who her real father is, invited all the potentials from her mother Donna's (Meryl Streep) colorful free loving, hippie past, to attend her wedding with the ultimate aim of course to give her away during the ceremony. So the three of them - Bull Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard), Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan) and Harry Bright (Colin Firth) all turn up, leading to a comedy of errors, of reminiscence of a time gone by, of relationships turned sour, or what could have beens.Playing out over 24 hours at a Greek island where Donna runs a small crumbling hotel, you can tell that everyone of the star studded cast had a field day on set, especially when hamming up their respective characters - you can't get enough of Donna's posse in Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) - and there are enough ABBA songs to go around either for individuals to showcase their singing prowess (or lack thereof!) or to come together as an ensemble group to just let their hair down and have a lot of fun. Some would have deemed Meryl Streep not being able to deliver, but I thought she did well enough, and Amanda Seyfried at certain angles bore some uncanny resemblance to add some believability as her daughter.Pierce Brosnan on the other hand, you can tell was having a tough time trying to sound and sing convincingly. But that aside, I chuckled at plenty of moments when the hotel employees / Greek island inhabitants join in the chorus, and some infectious dance choreography when everyone chips in just makes this one heck of a pre-wedding celebrations.And if you need some reaffirmation of why you need to watch a musical in the cinemas, look no further than Mamma Mia!. At first I frowned at the distributors for delaying its premiere here for so long, then now perhaps realized it was a shrewd move on their part (as always), probably to help enhance the cinema going experience. Prints after late August come with lyrics at the bottom of the screen, so yep, we get the Sing Along Edition over here. And boy, the hall I was in - I think I was the only (*ahem* inconsiderate) one initially lending my vocals, whistling and humming to each song - by the time the last few songs came around, EVERYONE was singing along, kickstarted by the very moving song that happened to be my favourite of them all.So you know what to do, when you hit the cinemas for this. Lead and sing along, since the lyrics are there for all and sundry. And you'll get that fuzzy feeling when everyone else does the same thing. I heart Mamma Mia! and you'll be hard pressed not to too!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Women have no soul,"This is the reason women can't be taken seriously; fear of not feeling happy during every single second of their bourgeois lives.The level of sophistication, realism & creativity is at an all time low. Every 'chick flick' cliché is used over & over with absolutely NO context or affiliation with the songs purloined from the Abba estate. Every situation is lived out in 3-year old perspective where bad things can never happen.Middle aged women renounce all vestige of their hobbies, interests & pursuits in order to fall in line to do exactly what is expected of them. Any deviation would require character, conviction & confidence! Ha ha I know right?! So by the time they reach this default subservient stage in their life, they hinge all happiness on looking back. They can hardly look at the present because that would be tantamount for self-examination; & they can hardly look to the future when they've forfeited all freedom of choice in order to blend into the background. This leaves one thing that they all have in common - nostalgia.Nostalgia is irrational, & this predilection with everything ancient hinders the ability to judge your tastes in a non-bias fashion. Abba is the epitome of nostalgia!! They're even worse than the Beatles themselves! At least their songs didn't all just sound like a string of one hit wonders.This film is a disastrous instance of the formulaic juke box musical with clichéd jokes, paper thin narrative, typical throw away characters, lazy writing, & everything that happens is from a vain female perspective. It's like women who are in denial need to keep feeding their delusion by piling up pseudo laughs in a constant flurry to distract themselves from the more valuable things in life.It's sad that many air heads gave this film a 10 star rating.

Feel Good Factor of 10,"As an Avid suspense thriller fan, it was the dutiful husband who was dragged along to see a Musical with ABBA songs which had sent my preconceived opinions and ideas into overdrive. 1 tub of Popcorn, 1 ½ hours later and some of the worst singing you'll hear in a musical and I was totally hooked.The plot is simple, yet not wholly predictable. The interpretation of the ABBA sounds to a particular scene or Scenario was brilliant and at times very sensitive. I'm not sure it was intentional, but Pierce Brosnan's slightly off Key singing (I'm Kind) gave the film an authenticity that Hollywood does not usually allow. It made you picture yourself at your daughters wedding, you Know your singing voice is awful  yet you go for it because the occasion led you there. I'm sure they could have dubbed or enhanced the singing, but that would have put a gloss on the film which would have been to its detriment.The Greek Locations and the rustic setting just made you want to be there. The production showed Phyllida Lloyd's experience within the Theatre, and I was also impressed with the lighting Technicians, as they carefully balanced the fill in light to counter the strong Mediterranean Shadows.On the Whole, The acting, the lack of big names in the younger set, the dancing & singing scenes, not unlike Grease, were totally uplifting, and you walked out of the Cinema singing ABBA songs.It's a long time since I've experienced the Audience (including me) clapping at the end of a Film  that says it all  If you want a feel good factor film, this is for you.Vaughan from Leeds",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

What an enjoyable film!,"Leaving aside that Meryl Streep is the kind of actress that elevates the level of any film she is in, ""Mamma Mia"" is the ideal movie you need when you're down.Its rhythm, its light (curiously, a Greek photography director for shooting in Greece), its freshness, everything... makes this film a celebration of life.It was about time to have a movie with no special effects or similar tricks. Just plain cinema.Specially indicated for those who want to leave the cinema with a smile.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amanda was the only good singer in this movie,"I really fought back the yawns at this farce of a musical. First off somebody please tell Meryl Streep that she's not that sexy and pretty as she thinks she is. Secondly she has barely passable singing skill that should be in a second rate bar, rather than a major motion picture. And Pierce Bronsan, what a terrible singer. He sounded on the same level as two angry cats breeding. What a terrible voice. He must have paid the producers a lot of money to make a fool of himself on the screen. Horrible; I will have nightmares for years. It was terrible on anyone who has good hearing. Take a chance on this movie? NOT! Even though I watched it for free, I feel I was ripped off. Do yourself a favor and rent Rain Man. Better entertainment and I HATED that movie!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Get  Up & Dance (or at least sing along!),"Wow what a fun ride! First of all, when I was a kid growing up the popular groups were Rush, Kiss, Styxx, Kansas, J Giles Band, Blondie, Pink Floyd, etc. - and I loved them all, just like everyone else, but, having a German father, I had spent some time in Europe with my cousins and ABBA was all the rage. I loved ABBA, too - and still do to this day (have an iTunes playlist titled ABBA-mania) - but nobody else did (except for a nerdy girl). So all these years (I graduated in '81) I've held onto my love of ABBA, and, until the play Mamma Mia!, I was pretty much the only one I knew who even knew the music at all well.Sitting in the theater yesternight (opening night, OF COURSE!) with my wife, having never seen the play (of course I have the soundtrack) I knew the general story from the previews - girl getting married/doesn't know who her dad is/invites all three possible candidates/ABBA music throughout. But I was unprepared for the emotional thrill-ride I was about to experience...From the opening notes to the closing credits, the show was pure entertainment. Seeing the very-slightly-adapted ABBA songs in ""video/story"" form was amazing. The writers cleverly worked the lyrics into the plot of the story. Meryl Streep - perhaps a bit old for her role - was pretty much perfect as the mother of the bride; her voice was surprisingly delicious, but even better: her acting like a teenager (the character never grew out of it) was SUPERB.The bride herself had the best voice of all, and ALL of the characters added emotion, passion, meaning and depth to the lyrics as the songs were sung.I was moved to dance, sing along, weep, LAUGH, rejoice, clap, and otherwise SMILE ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE. In a sense, I felt my childhood love for ABBA vindicated as I saw so many audience members - young and old alike - experiencing the same. The renditions, though familiar, were fresh and performed excellently (mostly, see below).My only complaints are these: 1 - The story ended too abruptly; not much follow-through on anything; seemed like a play rather than a movie - I feel the transition from play to movie should've been a bit deeper; 2 - Most critics I heard lampooned Pierce Brosnan's voice but that misses the mark - his voice was fine (not like a professional singer, but absolutely adequate for the part); the problem is: his facial expressions while he sings were distractingly uncomfortable; he looked like he had just swallowed a few spiders every time he sang - and the director should've given some more direction there,IMHO; 3 - The VERY FEW adult-oriented site-gags and bits of dialogue could've been toned down so that this could have been a more family/teenager-friendly movie; and 4 - It was over too fast; they could've fit a few more of my favorites into the script somehow (am I the only one who loves Dum Dum Diddle, The Piper, Knowing Me - Knowing You and The Visitor?); but hey, it wasn't MY show to create.Cameos by Benny Andersson were also fun.THANK YOU FOR THE MUSIC and the MOVIE to all involved.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Utter torture, but at least you can say you've seen it","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAny plot that is simply an excuse for a bunch of overpaid actors to sing bloody Abba songs really doesn't deserve any great detail off me but here's mine...twenty year old Sophie (Amanda Syfried) is about to get married and wants her real father to give her away and so sends letters off to three different men, including Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard.) Going on Jeremy Kyle and getting a DNA test would have saved everyone (especially the audience!) a lot of bother but instead they travel from Sweden, London and New York to the home of Sophie's mother Donna (Meryl Streep) on a Greek/cypriot? island and catch up on old times, all to a medley of none stop Abba tunes.I had no intention of seeing Mamma Mia! From the outset, I could see it wouldn't be my type of film, as would be expected from one that appears to be aimed at women. But hey, guess what, it's gone and become the most successful film of the year and it's never nice to feel the odd one out. It's been very manipulative, drawing in a largely older audience with a strong affinity for Abba and their music, knocking far more deserving films (i.e. The Dark Knight) from their rightful box office top spot. But there you go. At times it got on my nerves so much I just wished Sweeney Todd would come along and slash all their smiley, sappy throats (""...think you can do musicals, huh? Well here's your old friend Sweeeney!!!"") another film that's had attention diverted from it as top musical of the year.But maybe I'm just in a grumpy mood. There is an undeniable feel good factor to it, as well as the (unintentional?) hilarity of 007 himself Brosnan (easily the most out of place performer here) giving his rendition of SOS. And surely the sing along version's even better? **",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

I LOVED this movie!,"I have not seen a funnier movie in the last 10 years. The entire audience laughed through the whole movie. I have read the reviews of the singing and they are wrong. Pierce Brosnan did OK, but Meryl Streep blew me away. Who new she could sing like that? WOW! The movie was especially enjoyable for ABBA fans. The music was wonderful! If you didn't laugh during this movie, your funny bone must have been broken. The two back-up singers (Donna's friends) were hilarious. I don't normally watch musicals, but this was awesome and I will be seeing it again. I even saw the movie with a 5 year old and she loved it. She sat still and was entertained through the entire movie. The scenery didn't hurt the film either. During the scene with Streep and Brosnan the background of the ocean and cliffs was beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mama Mia Mama Can't Sing,"I saw the free preview on Thursday 6/26, I'm glad I didn't pay for tickets. The acting was pathetic and the singing was miserable. Meryl Streep was too old for her part and she could not sing. Then when Pierce Brosnan broke into song we cringed! This movie seemed like a low-budget film with rookie actors, it was so corny. The 20 year old daughter acted like she was 12. Cristine Baransky tried to sing, she was the best of them and that's not saying much. It got to the point that we were laughing at this movie because it was so bad. We sarcastically wondered if we could purchase the movie soundtrack in the lobby. We also decided that this definitely ended Pierce's ""James Bond"" machismo. I saw Mama Mia on stage in Chicago and it was terrific and fun. I decided that this does not translate well to screen especially with actors who have no business singing.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
