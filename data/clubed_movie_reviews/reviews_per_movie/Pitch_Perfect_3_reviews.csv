Pitch Perfect 3 - Because Why Not?,"The Barden Bellas are back once again for one more chance at acappella glory. This time, the film begins with the women singing Britney Spears's ""Toxic"" on a yacht in front of a group of severe looking men. After the song reaches its coda, Fat Amy (Wilson) the heretofore unseen member of the group, crashes through a window ceiling, opens up a spray of fire extinguisher foam, then yells at the group to ""get out"". They all do only moments before the yacht unexpectedly blows up.Why not? Why the f**k not. This series already jumped the shark back in 2015 so why not have a movie entirely based on taking the shark and repeatedly kicking it? So sit back and enjoy the now mid-to-late-20's Bellas finding some contrived way to sing again then find some contrived way to compete again and then finally find some contrived way to have Anna Kendrick have her cake and eat it too.The Pitch Perfect series as a whole is an interesting beast to say the least. The first was a sleeper hit that depended on little more than it being a good movie to get butts in the seats. And wouldn't you know it the movie actually reached its target audience, making a cool $115 million against a $17 million budget. Who knew there was such an eager audience for a female-centric comedy? Next you're going to tell me water is wet.Thing is, I doubt the makers of Pitch Perfect themselves thought it'd be as successful as it was, thus the existence of its hastily made and forgettable sequel. Now we're on its second sequel, and if you want a comparison for the trajectory of this series, know that the Bellas have gone full Goldmember (2002) featuring much of the same stale jokes and completely ignoring overall thematic progression.The impetus behind this latest reunion has the group singing their hearts out for a USO tour set up by Chloe's (Snow) absent father. Once they arrive they soon realize it's more than just fun and games. DJ Khaled it seems is there hunting for a new opening act and the girls will be pitted against bands with actual instruments for the top slot. As the gals gear up for competition (again), Fat Amy bumps into her father (Lithgow) for a reunion that winds up being less than ideal for her and the group.Of course most everyone apart from Jessica (Jakle) and Ashley (Regner) get subplots that are setup and knocked down with less than ten lines each. Kendrick's involves the flirtations of a music producer (Burnet) while Anna Camp has her own paramour waiting in the flies. The one follow-through between everyone? the undeniable fact that life is never quite what you expect and my, isn't that disappointing.In that regard, Pitch Perfect 3 may actually be the darkest of the series, offering everyone only a small reprieve from their humdrum life of anonymity, to once again capture ""the glory days"". The film doesn't resolve this thread nor give us an alternative worth reaching for. Instead it merely establishes as a point of fact that life after college sucks. Oh well, might as well sing about it.But of course anyone who's been with the Pitch Perfect franchise so far knows it's not about the messaging, it's about the music and the characters. In both regards the film succeeds about 50% of the time. Despite little screen time Hailee Steinfeld and Anna Camp do fairly well in growing their respective roles. The songs, specifically the melded ""sing-off"" between The Bellas and girl-punk band Evermoist does have its charm once you get over the tonal whiplash.Yet there's so precious little connecting the songs with the characters or for that matter the songs with the characters lips. The direction, especially during the singing sequences is so slapdash and lazy with no attempt being made this time around to make it seem like their actually singing live.I'd be embarrassed for the actresses on the screen if I wasn't so convinced they were having a ball up there - an attitude that ultimately saves this movie from being an absolute waste. Nothing is taken seriously other than the friendship these characters (and by this point, these actresses) have. Every broad comedic stroke and patently ridiculous action sequence is done with such congeniality that it's hard not to at least muster a warm smile.Pitch Perfect 3 is ultimately a one-and-done disappointment. In a year full of female-centric comedies that managed to be incredibly entertaining, it's sad to see a series that arguably kick-started everything to be this lazy and uninspired. Still, if you're looking for mild entertainment and have grown with these characters and you really, really want to see this one, you may just get your money's worth. After all many movie theaters now sell alcohol right?",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Average...,"""Pitch Perfect 3"" is a Comedy - Music and third movie of the ""Pitch Perfect"" franchise in which we watch The Bellas reunite after winning the world competition. The group faces some other groups that they are using instruments and not only their voices.I had already watched the two previous movies so, I knew what I was about to watch. After watching it I have to say that the ""Pitch Perfect"" franchise should have ended with the second movie, I believe that ""Pitch Perfect 3"" was too much for the franchise. Unfortunately, the interpretation of Rebel Wilson who played for one more time as Fat Amy was not enough to save the movie as she did in the previous one. The other interpretations of Anna Kendrick who played as Beca, Brittany Snow who played as Chloe and Anna Camp who played as Aubrey was average without adding something special in the movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Pitch Perfect 3"" is an average comedy movie and I believe that if you have already watched the two previous movies then I suggest you to skip this one because it does not worth your time.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Quite a lot of fun actually! - Film Review By Niall Maggs (http://ateenstakeonfilm.com),"Pitch Perfect 3 is your typical musical for teenage girls, not a particularly good film, but a most definitely enjoyable one filled with silly but humorous jokes, and witty dialogue.The plot of Pitch Perfect 3 is so ridiculous and boring, but the comedy factor manages to make up for it, supplying the audience with constant laughs, particularly from Fat Amy played hilariously by Rebel Wilson, who can be irritating at some points, which is where the film suffers, however most scenes involving her are usually the best moments.The lead character Beca, played wonderfully by the excellent Anna Kendrick, is also a high point in the film. Kendrick manages to carry the rest of the cast, mostly filled with mediocre performances, and stand out above them all due to the sassy, smart but adorably innocent character she plays. She's someone the audience can root for, and is easily likeable. However, a lot of the supporting characters aren't quite as pleasant or loveable...Kay Cannon's script is of average quality but entertainingly witty. Some lines of dialogue are more cringe worthy than Anakin and Padme's romance in 'Attack of the Clones' (and that's saying something!) but you can't help but forgive such embarrassing dialogue and love it, because that's what makes it fun!The direction is, again, average but the pacing is surprisingly flawless. There isn't one point that feels dragged or rushed, and the flow stays very consistent throughout. With a minimal runtime of just 93 minutes, there isn't much time for slow story building and development like Blade Runner 2049, but you couldn't expect much more from a film like this.Like I said, the performances from the supporting cast are mediocre at best, but, once again, you wouldn't expect Oscar worthy portrayals in a teen musical like this one! The cast work well with what they've got, but what they've got isn't much. However, you can tell they have great chemistry, and enjoy working together.The cinematography is unnoticeable, which would make it average, and just blends in. No IMAX mind-blowing wide shots or expert special effects, but maybe that's a good thing. There aren't any mind-numbing distractions, so you can just enjoy the bare bones simplistic structure, and there's nothing wrong with that at all!Because it's a musical, it's going to contain music and dance. Was it good? Well I'm no singing expert, but it seemed alright to me... Some of the songs were embarrassing and plain cringe worthy, but you can't bash the effort the actors put into the routine, which displays their dedication, and just proves they want to make sure the audience have an exciting time.There is also a stereotypical, unnecessary villain played by John Lithgow, who fits all the criteria for a clich√© mastermind bad guy. There really was no reason for him to be there, and literally doesn't develop the plot in any way, and only has some relevance in the last fifteen minutes.This is one of those movies that would be considered a guilty pleasure. You know it's not a great film, or the best of the year, nor does it try to be, however there is so much fun to be had with Pitch Perfect 3, filled to the brim with light-hearted humour which is simple, laid back and clean. A perfect family friendly movie and one that can be enjoyed by everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Weak storyline but I enjoyed the music,"8 January 2018
First Film of the year and first Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Pitch Perfect 3. So I hadn't seen the first two, I thought I better catch up, one mega acapella binge watching session later I'm fully caught up and ready for the third instalment. It didn't really matter much about the plot which was probably just as well, as long as the music entertained........and I reckon they didn't do too bad. This instalment sees the Bellas all grown up and beginning to make their way in the world, only it seems they can't make it without their acapella sisters. A little regret on parts of each of the girls makes them jump at the chance to take part in entertaining troops on the USO European tour. It's all the old crew with Beca and Fat Amy leading the way, add some competition in the form of a lean mean girl band, a rock/country group and put them slap bang among aircraft and helicopters on a selection of US naval bases and you have a fun light-hearted film which is guaranteed to keep your feet tapping throughout. Rebel Wilson is gloriously unfazed by all she says, sings and does and the whole film is once more led graciously by Anna Kendrick from disaster to singing magnificence as the film reaches its crescendo. You can almost keep your eyes closed throughout as the music is bouncy and easy to listen to, and ever so slightly leaves you wanting more. Aca-enjoyable.",,Anonymous,Music
Doesn't quite have the magic this time around,"I'm a surprisingly big fan of the 'Pitch Perfect' series. I even enjoyed the first sequel more than the original. This time around though I don't think they got it quite right. There's a giant glaring hole in the middle of the film and that is an almost complete lack of a plot. Sure, one is kind of thrown in there near the end as an after-thought, but by that stage it's too late. The whole thing just feels like an excuse for these guys to perform more songs. Now, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but when you can have both it's disappointing for it not to be there.Otherwise though all the things that made the first two great are still present. 'Fat Amy' is still in terrific form. Apart from the two commentators she really is 95% of the comic relief the film has, but she manages to carry it no problem. The character works really well and I'd have no problem seeing a spin-off for her. The songs were also good for the most part, but perhaps there weren't quite as many bangers as in the original two films. Not having the boys acapella band this time around I think quite hurt the film.'Pitch Perfect 3' isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, I just don't think it can live up to the high standards set by the first two. If this is the last edition in the series though I think they can hold their heads very high, with a fine trilogy having been produced.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Last Call Pitches!,"Pitch Perfect 3, possibly the last installment in the Pitch Perfect Franchise is a beautiful goodbye to the fans of the movies and a twist on the series. In this installment the Bellas are reunited and get an opportunity to sing together one last time on the USO tour to support the troops in Europe. This installment brings more characters, laughs, and a twist. The movie does show the Bellas trying to prove themselves to the world that they are not just women who sing covers of other people songs. Though there was not as much music as the first two, the movie does lose focus in its plot, however the movie ties things up in the end with a goodbye performance as the Bellas go on to separate and live their lives.""Alright, ladies, pick up your stuff. We're going to show them that we are not a joke.""-Emily, Pitch Perfect 3",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Pitch Perfect 3,"Anna Kendrick and the girls go on a USO tour and enter the usual competitions.A tight, witty script, laugh out loud scenes, fine performances including a standout turn by John Lithgow - this has none of these. The script must have taken a whole afternoon to write and quite what Lithgow thinks he was doing is bewildering. Nothing approaching a plot happens and I didn't even smile once. The music is nice, but otherwise a truly dreadful film.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

An improvement on the 2nd one,"I wasn't expecting too much so I went to the cinema with an open mind. However, I was only about 3 minutes into this film and I could feel the quality and feel of it was a whole lot better than the last.There should not be any confusion about what this film is. Lots of cheap laughs and a little feel good music. Thats it. But that is all it has ever been. So the measure is how good it makes you feel.The story, whilst very predictable and normal, did flow okay and the pace was good. There didn't feel like there was that much singing in this one but it was enough for me. All the pitches looked great and the visuals were all done well. I've not heard of this director before but I liked her work. The humour and 'action' were all well executed and I had a good few giggles throughout. I was expecting a bigger ending with more of a punch but it never quite came. It was okay but I expected a big hitting finale.Overall I came away a little happier having had the chance to laugh at a few cheap gags. It is what it is and it made me laugh. So I have to be positive about this film. It was a lot better than I expected. I do recommend you go and see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Horrible- waste of time,"I thoroughly enjoyed PP1 and PP2. Like overly enjoyed it. This movie was so stupid its unbelievable. Don't waste your time.

BEST PP YET: AMY SAVES THE DAY !,"I got tired of the Fat Amy jokes real quick in the first two flicks, so I had low expectations going into this one. Can't anybody figure out what to do with Rebel Wilson's talent instead of relying on her weight as a, well, ""fallback"" strategy ? Finally, at lest they tried to get beyond the Fat Girl jokes and physical ""humor."" There's less music, but more ""substance"" to the plot. Silly, yes, but a plot nonetheless, that has nothing to do with music competitions. And when the Bellas are facing Certain Death, it's Fat Amy that comes to the rescue, and in a way that makes her weight an advantage instead of a handicap. I do wish there'd'a been more music, but at least there was less Fat Girl nonsense.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Meaningless story - this one better be the last,The story has hardly and substance whatsoever. The appealing cast can't help by singing snipets of hit songs. All they seem to do is put on different outfits and sing a few bars of hit songs. John Lithgow with his fake Aussie accent is so ludicrous. Brittney Snow's romance with Matt Lanter's soldier character could have been developed more.Don't bother. This better be the last of them.,2.0,Anonymous,Music

"Of All Three, The Worst","Clearly so - Pitch Perfect 3 is the worst of all three parts of the series. Why? Lazy writing, no new ideas at all, lazy script, endless repeating of the same tired cliches and beaten paths. Anna Kendrick is extremely sweet and nice, Rebel Wilson is funny and loud, John Lithgow is a funny little trifle, too. Apart from that, all the virtually same scenes are rotated nonstop for ever. Vocals, competition, evil rivals, love lost and found, and surely, the final singing scene is a sickly sweet honey toffee sugary treacle idiocy, but for good music, it'd been a total mess.

the cast deserves much better than this,"Some years have passed, and the Bellas have graduated from college and moved on with their lives, or at least tried to until they reunite and realize that none of them are entirely satisfied with where they are. Attempting to rekindle their past magic they bound together, join a USO tour, and-while the rest is really left for the viewer to discover, the third time is definitely not the charm as this mediocre sequel throws out lots of unfunny lines, contrived scenarios, underwhelming musical numbers, and inane supporting characters, including Lithgow (seemingly trying to do a sendup of Crocodile Dundee) who looks like he belongs in a different film altogether. Padded and forgettable, this is a waste of good talent and definitely not the ending that this series deserves. *¬Ω",,Anonymous,Music

Even so, I've been gracious and rated it 6 stars because the other cast members act well with the material they've been given.

Brain off entertainment,"This film tells the story of a group of female singers, who go on a European tour to entertain the American troops.The story is pure brain off entertainment. There are lots of popular songs in the film, and basically nothing is serious in the film. I find Rebel Wilson's character annoying though, as she constantly delivers lines with sexual innuendo.",,Anonymous,Music
Pitch Perfect 3 (2017),"I am an Anna Kendrick maniac, so it goes without saying I'm always going to watch anything she's in. I did quite like the first Pitch Perfect. The music and a capella were good and the film was entertaining. The sequel wasn't very memorable, few moments here and there but not enough to be considered a good film. The trailer for the third film didn't look amazing but I was interested in seeing how the film series would end. The addition of Ruby Rose caught my eye as well. Overall, the film has good music and performances but does little to give the series a good send off.The Bellas are now older all with jobs they hate. They relish the opportunity to sing together once again. So, they decide to go on a USO tour where other rival bands use instruments instead of just harmonizing with their voices. Becca also must decide if she wants to pursue her dream of a musical career without the Bellas. Of course, there are also other sideplots. This film is pretty much billed as the last Pitch Perfect and yet its actually a really weak ending; one that goes out on a whimper.The writing for this one is unfocused. The competitive nature of the series is present at first but fades away as it mixes with a villainous ransom plot. It becomes a real mess when the film tries to over plot it self. The Fat Amy jokes never worked and they don't here either. Its actually probably the weakest film in the trilogy and is further proof that we only needed one Pitch Perfect. The music and singing is top notch as usual and is unsurprisingly the best the film has to offer.I couldn't help but feel that the film was just unnecessary and tired. Ideas were short and the film seems to exist just to complete a trilogy. Much like the second the musical performances are great but its hard to find anything else to really praise. The first half of the film is failed by the poor writing in the second. Also, no one ever needs that much DJ Khaled. In the case of this series, I really hope this is it and Pitch Perfect is done.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music

This is another excellent movie that has been produced and honestly I don't know why they would stop other than the fact that they would have to change characters but these series of movies are different from any other and I love everything about them.

A preposterous (and fun) adventure in the grand tradition of Sequels,"I love the pointedly outrageous cold open, and the fact that the same tremendously talented primary cast returns for this second sequel. I love the immediate zest and strong themes that present in the dialogue and scene writing, providing ample humor right off the bat and establishing plentiful narrative potential; returning screenwriter Kay Cannon, alongside co-writer Mike White, has whipped up a deliciously sharp screenplay. The film editing of Craig Alpert and Colin Patton, like Trish Sie's direction, rather lean into the decidedly bombastic (arguably eclectic) energy that characterizes the picture. One could reasonably argue that there's maybe a bit too much zip in the feature's clip - very handily and snappily getting all exposition out of the way, but also throwing a great deal at us in what one may perceive to be an a substitution of style over substance. Also, in introducing a distinctly far-flung narrative thrust to continue the series, I can't help but note a certain similarity in other established franchises; remember when little orphan Annie had an adventure in England, or when the Brave Little Toaster went to Mars? Yet seeing as how the 'Pitch perfect' series has from the start been built off of familiar themes and broad strokes, it's kind of appropriate that the amplified vigor and zaniness also has roots extending to other titles. When all is said and done 'Pitch perfect 3' is maybe not an essential smash, but it's still a delight through and through, and a fairly strong finish to the trilogy.This movie is filled with odd and wide-ranging flavors, touches that in fairness are very over the top (and purposefully so). Just as 'Pitch perfect 2' slightly deemphasized music in favor of more plot and character development, 'Pitch perfect 3' does the same to center a wild adventure abroad and associated shenanigans. For all that, though - if in a different way, it's still a lot of fun. And the core remains the same: a brilliant cast, all greatly talented, with Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Hailee Steinfeld, Brittany Snow, Anna Camp, Hana Mae lee, Ester Dean, Chrissie Fit, and more showing off how very good they are as actors and singers. An excellent supporting cast. Terrific music. New this time around: the stunts, effects, and action sequences, but those also are pretty swell. And even still, all this is tied together with a prominent overarching theme of found family, and connection, and affirmation of the same.Now, look. The 2012 progenitor is excellent, a modern classic that takes a standard college comedy/musical vibe and twists it into a dazzlingly rich, vibrant viewing experience. The first sequel, in 2015, is maybe not as outright electrifying, but is still solidly written and enjoyable, with a capella remaining the tent pole of the picture. 'Pitch perfect 3' technically fits within the same mold, but there's no questioning that it consciously goes off the rails to have a blast with one last hurrah, throwing caution to the wind in the process. It's thoroughly entertaining on its own merits as it does so, but it's not wrong to assume that audiences who watch with earnest anticipation of More Of The Same are going to be bewildered, and maybe disappointed. As much as I like this raucous finale, if I'm being honest I too would have preferred a more genuine, heartfelt celebration of music, more in line with its antecedents. It's fun - only, a discretely divergent type of fun.I enthusiastically send all my love to the writers, directors, cast, and crew who worked on the three movies, including this one. I deeply appreciate the journey they took viewers on, the daring to try something out of the ordinary with both sequels, and all the care and passion that went into them all. Though 'Pitch perfect 3' is, strictly speaking, the weakest of the three, it's nevertheless worthwhile. I would simply say that if the first movie is a must-see, and the second slightly less so, this third is much more of an acquired taste. Flaws and all, it earns my recommendation; just think hard about what it is you're expecting before you sit for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"A Fun and Entertaining Sequel, but It's Not the Best in the Series","Pitch Perfect 3 is a fun and entertaining sequel, but it's not the best in the series. The film is full of catchy songs, hilarious moments, and heartwarming friendships. However, the plot is a bit predictable and the characters don't develop as much as they could have.The film's biggest strength is its music. The Bellas perform a variety of songs, from classic pop hits to original tunes. The songs are well-choreographed and performed, and they will have you singing along.The film's humor is also on point. The Bellas are always getting into hilarious situations, and the film is full of quotable lines. The supporting cast is also great, with Rebel Wilson, Adam Devine, and Brittany Snow all giving memorable performances.However, the film's plot is a bit of a letdown. The Bellas' journey to compete in an a cappella competition is pretty straightforward, and the film doesn't really offer any surprises. The characters also don't develop as much as they could have. Beca (Anna Kendrick) is still struggling to find her place in the world, and Chloe (Brittany Snow) is still trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

With that said, there is somehow still narrowly enough there to stop it becoming bad - just. The shorter run time helps, while the musical numbers are a step up on 'Pitch Perfect 2' in my opinion; the Toxic end is fun.Anna Kendrick (Beca) and Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) remain the pick of the onscreen talent. None of the other regulars stand out, nor do any of the newcomers - though it's always cool to see John Lithgow (Fergus), albeit with a dodgy accent, while 'Timeless' star Matt Lanter (Chicago) also appears.The plot is very lame, yet I honestly didn't dislike it - almost, but not quite.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Not so perfect,"The Pitch Perfect films shows the contempt Hollywood shows to its female audiences. The original was a fun frothy film aimed at women and enjoyed by men as well. A serviceable if flawed date movie.Since then it has been a case of diminishing returns as each sequel gets worse. In the third instalment the script seems to be made up as it goes along.The Bellas have gone their separate ways after the previous film. Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) is leading a new version of Bellas and asks the girls to attend a reunion which they take to mean that the original Bellas will reunite. It seems the original girls are not happy with their jobs and would love to sing together again.Aubrey (Anna Camp) uses her dad's military connections to get into the USO and perform in Europe where they get a chance to compete to be the opening act for DJ Khaled who seems to be impressed by Beca's (Anna Kendrick) vocals.Television hosts Gail (Elizabeth Banks) and John (John Michael Higgins) pop up again making abysmal catty comments about the Bella's and later follow them to make a documentary on the group, an idea so messily added into the plot, that is forgotten part way through.The main plot involves Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) who reunites with her estranged father (John Lithgow) but he is more interested in her overseas bank account that contains a lot of money.Well at least the singing is nice but the story is awful, at least the cast spent a few days in Nice. John Lithgow has a nice stab at an Australian accent but it seems no actual Australian actors were available.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

They use this opportunity for the chance to open for DJ Khaled and to perform one last time as a family.

PP3 revives the franchise--please let it end here for the moment,"After a failed attempt to get younger and go in a different direction in PP2, PP3 happily develops a plot line that makes sense for the aging singers. To me, this is way better than PP2. It has villains with talent (the Zombie performance was exceptional, loved the soldiers, etc.). It has boffo performances. They needed to do something different while going back to their roots. Happily, Steinfeld was marginalized as well. Overall, to me this worked well and the PP3 riff-off was a great one. Sure, nothing will match #1, but that's life.What's next? Hopefully, nothing for awhile. The performers are longer in tooth. As cute as Anna Kendrick is, she doesn't look like a recent college grad any more. It's hard to keep finding ways to bring them back. The discussions in the movie of getting on with life made sense and imparted an air of finality.If there's a PP4, it can be in 2030 with the stars mentoring a new cast and showing us where they wound up.

Aca-bysmal.,"Why I ask you? Why oh why oh why oh why oh why do the scriptwriters of Pitch Perfect 3 - Kay Cannon (the original PP screenwriter) and Mike White (""The Emoji Movie"") - think that this dreadfully lazy set of loosely connected scenes represent a viable basis for a movie? Is the view from the guys who green-lit this thing that the crowd that loved ""Pitch Perfect"" and the pretty dreadful sequal ""Pitch Perfect 2"" will pay their box office money regardless? Let's advertise the hell out of it and cash in our chips before word of mouth gets out!?In this 'adventure' the Bellas go on a US Forces overseas tour (though this is not really explained until they suddenly appear in Spain - what? how?). The really really annoying commentators John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks, ""Love and Mercy"") tag along, filming some lame half-arsed documentary about them until even the scriptwriters get fed up of that tedious plot-line and it quietly withers on the vine.
Fat Amy (is this still an acceptable nickname in 2017?) also runs into her nefarious father again after many years (John Lithgow, ""Interstellar"", ""Daddy's Home 2""). Lithgow - sporting a wonderful Australian accent - is about the best thing in the film. The ""plot"" (sorry, I can barely bring myself to use that word) revolves around Daddy trying to get something of Amy's that he needs, for reasons - given the yacht he sails - that makes no sense whatsoever. Will he succeed? Will the Bellas get selected to headline with DJ Khaled (who is apparently a thing, but I've never heard him on BBC Radio 2)? Does anyone really care?As my wife pointed out, it's a bit unfortunate that the only Bellas who are not stick-thin size zeroes are the obese loud one, the black lesbian one and two that nobody knows why they are there. The message to the target female teen audience is clear: if you want to be ""in"" you'd better diet... hard. Nice.What can I say that's vaguely nice about this film?Some of the acapella song and dance numbers are fun enough, particularly ""Toxic"" that opens the film;The closing number by Anna Kendrick (""Table 19"") is quite appealing;There are also about 5 funny lines that made me smile: not laugh... smile;It's also a relif John and Gail, unlike in ""Pitch Perfect 2"", only come out with one xenophobic/racist comment in the film (and that's about the French, so that hardly counts ).And I'm out...There will be no doubt die-hard teenage fans who will love this one too. But my wife was a great fan of the first film (as indeed was I); she tolerated the second one; but even she declared this to be ""Aca-Awful"". It's not as toxically dreadful as ""Dirty Grandpa""... what could be?

Pitch Perfect 3 cranks up the crazy for a hilarious send-off that also knows how to appreciate its characters and what made the franchise so fun.,"The Pitch Perfect movies are all over the top goofy, but that goofiness reaches new heights - and I loved it! The same outrageous zaniness of all these colorful characters continues, but this time, their circumstances are even more ridiculous than before! There are riff-offs, yes, but also action sequences, animal attacks, explosions, and more, all wrapped in a heartfelt story of friendship and a loving send-off of these lovable misfits. The Pitch Perfect movies became a fantastic way to disconnect and laugh at the nonsense for an hour and a half.

Gave me an empty feeling,"Pitch Perfect 3 (2017) is the third installment, hopefully the last of the Pitch Perfect series. Only reason that I say I hope it's the last is because once you go as low in quality as this film, it is time to stop. I am a fan of the first Pitch Perfect, I gave that film an 8, admittedly I have not seen the second installment, but I don't feel like I needed to to get this one. This film gave me a very hollow, empty feeling from start to finish. The comedy has stopped working for the most part, yes there are a few laughs, but not a lot. Also, the plot isn't that interesting and the plot delves into absolute insanity. Like it goes from regular Pitch Perfect stuff to an action/spy movie and I don't feel like it worked. If they could do this well, then I say sure go for it, but they just didn't. The characters are the same, but they've just been placed in a bad film, and that's sad because you want the final film in a series to be good.

Back to Bellas,"If you were a fan of the first Pitch Perfect movie and were disappointed by the bloated sequel, you'll find Pitch Perfect 3 to be acc-awesome. I saw all three movies back-to-back-to-back at the Pitch Perfect Treble feature so I was able to put them into fresh context.The third chapter gets back to basics and focuses squarely on the core cast, along with Hailee Steinfeld and Chrissie Fit from PP2.Pitch Perfect always worked best as a ""small movie"". PP2 made the usual mistake of going big, rather than going deep. The result was needless plot distractions like the Green Bay Packers and Snoop Dogg. Sure, those elements were fun, but they didn't add much. Also gone is the weirdness of PP2, like the Teutonic Das Sound Machine, the Riff Off Host, and jokes about illegal immigrants.What's left is a much tighter plot featuring the Bellas doing what they do best. My favorite scene in PP3 is the riff off where the group effortlessly segues from song to song. I'm sure it was heavily choreographed and rehearsed, but it seems so natural and reflects a chemistry developed from doing three movies together.PP3 also avoids the third chapter mistake of trying to cram in everyone who appeared in the earlier features. A lot of the main characters are gone, and the roles of some of the remaining ones - most notably Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins - are diminished to give the Bellas more time. Even the finale, arguably, goes small to focus on the Bellas and their sisterhood.In the end, this franchise finale is ""pitch perfect"". To paraphrase Jesse, if you like watching a bunch of girls doing covers of songs one last time, you'll love this movie.As a final note - PP3 does a nice job closing this chapter of women's lives and also in paying homage to the past movies. Look for references and scenes from the past and enjoy how far these women have come.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The worst of the 3 but fine nonetheless,"*It's a good enough movie to enjoy for the sake of finishing the trilogy but nothing special about it*I don't think there's a whole lot to say about this movie. It's just fine. It doesn't reach the highs the first two does and stoops lower at times than either. It's not particularly memorable and the plot itself is the weakest of the three. It takes the Cars 2 route of doing something completely unnecessary within the universe the movie exists in, and like Cars 2 its the weakest of the trilogy. Why stray from making the final act a competition which worked so well for the first two films? And speaking of competitions, the one going on for most of the film feels so irrelevant. The movie spends too much time setting up the unnecessary Fat Amy's dad plot that it cares too little for the rest.DJ Khalid is in it and he's funny because he's not even acting. He just does what he normally does and weirdly enough makes his character feel authentic yet out of place.Besides the big negatives, the other aspects of the movie stay on brand. The cast does what they usually do. The music is still good and the film has a happy ending.Overall, the movie is enjoyable enough to be worth a watch if you enjoyed the first two. If not, I don't particularly recommend this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

PP3,"Pitch Perfect 3 was a fun and mostly enjoyable movie like the previous two. This was the weakest of the trilogy. I love Anna Kendrick but the rest of the cast is nothing to get excited about.

Fitting finale,"'Pitch Perfect 3' is quite similar to the first two films, revolving around the ""Bellas"" a cappella group - although this time they're out of college and dealing with being grown-ups. So when the chance to reunite for one last set of shows arises, playing to US troops in Europe, they all jump at it. Not much more to the plot than that, except for a slight detour with Amy's Dad (Lithgow), which doesn't add a whole lot, except him doing a horrible Aussie accent.There's some crap songs and a few decent ones, but they always make them interesting to watch/listen to and the film always has plenty to keep it's momentum up - Beca (Kendrick) obviously getting the most screen time and a satisfying conclusion. Amy (Wilson) has a good number of funny lines and Chloe (Snow) has a bit more to do, and the other seven each get a few moments to shine.I still wish there was more of Elizabeth Banks & John Michael Higgins as the commentators/documentary-makers, but they're still great in every scene they're in. It's all predictable, but nonetheless uplifting and all about being there for your friends and following your dreams, while still being fun enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
I really wish they would have stopped after 2!,"'PITCH PERFECT 3': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third film in the comedy/musical trilogy about a young women a cappella group, called the Barden Bellas (from Barden University). In this (supposedly) final installment, the girls reunite (years after they graduated) for one final singing competition, at a USO tour overseas. Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Hailee Steinfeld, Hana Mae Lee, Ester Dean, Alexis Knapp, Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins all reprise their roles from earlier films. While Ruby Rose, John Lithgow, Andy Allo, Matt Lanter and DJ Khaled join the cast. It was directed by Trish Sie (who also helmed the 2014 musical/dance flick 'STEP UP ALL IN'), and it was written by Kay Cannon (who also wrote the first two movies) and Mike White (who also wrote the 2003 musical/comedy flick 'SCHOOL OF ROCK'). The film has received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's performed modestly at the Box Office. I found it to be mostly a bore, and unamusing, but I did highly enjoy the first two movies.Years after graduating from Barden University, and winning the world championship, the Bellas get back together at their friend's, and former Bella (Steinfeld), show. There they reminisce, and talk about how they miss singing, and that each of their lives have not turned out the way they had hoped. The girls then decide to accept an invite to perform at the USO tour overseas, with other musical groups. Once there they find out that the show is also a competition, and the Bellas get very intensely involved in this competition once again.Every time a 'PITCH PERFECT' movie comes out, I'm never eager to see it, because I don't think I'll really like it that much. I was pleasantly surprised with the first two movies, and I actually gave them each 4.5 star ratings (because they're great 'feel-good' musicals actually). So I had higher hopes for this one, but the trailers still didn't sell me on it, and I was definitely not pleasantly surprised with it (when I did see it, on opening night). I really wish they would have stopped after 2!",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Fun though not as good as the first two,"Bellas are back for the third time and while the film is fun to watch, it does not bring anything different and original than the first two. The girls are still likeable, funny and portrayal of their characters is still on form. What you might miss is the wit, the level of good singing performances and some great song choices from the first two films. They are not bad in this one but they are not that great either.Nevertheless, Pitch Perfect 3 is in my opinion still a good choice for a nice relaxing, feel-good film where you can rest your brain a bit. The nice thing about all Pitch Perfect films is that they are what they are and are never trying to pretend to be something else.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Who ""pitched"" this?","""Pitch Perfect"" (2012) as well as ""Pitch Perfect 2"" (2015) were by no means revolutionary game-changers of cinema, but nevertheless enjoyable, well-crafted entertainment. The two films both knew what they had going: a talented ensemble cast with youthful energy, comedic plotlines built around relatable characters, and a unique focus point in a cappella singing. Both had loose narratives that made way for funny situations, but kept it just grounded enough for us to see traces of real life within these characters. I don't know who pitched the third film in the franchise, but this note absolutely destroys the group harmony and results into one tone-deaf film.Youth and fun were key aspects of ""Pitch Perfect"", and the third film makes the decision to grow up, or at least tries to do it at times. The Bellas of the first film have all graduated and have disappointing jobs. They long to sing together once more, and get an opportunity to go to Europe to entertain American troops. There is also a band contest, the winner of which gets to perform with DJ Khaled, who unfortunately is in the film. The contest however, much like everything else in the film, gets quickly forgotten.IMDb credits three writers for this film, and it feels like three films happening at once. There is the drama about growing up, which we start with, and then touch upon during the last 10 minutes. Then there is the contest plot-line, which is a throwback to the first two films, and at this point such a narrative clich√©, that the characters constantly break the 4th wall by joking about it. The third plot-line, which hijacks the film, is about Fat Amy's absent father Fergus (John Lithgow), who returns into his daughter's life in order to steal a huge fortune, that Amy has inherited. None of the plot-lines flow together, and two of them destroy the inner realism of the franchise. We are now meant to believe that Fat Amy is a master ninja, just because the writers of the newest film decided that she is. Lithgow is hammy, and as a villain, he is not interested about a cappella singing (this film has very little of that), but instead only cares about money. A fitting metaphor for the film, if there ever was one.This sequel forgets everything that made the first two films good. It is not youthful and fun, but in a constant state of post-graduation depression. It doesn't work as a drama about growing up, because of the other narratives and a yacht named ""Fat Dingo B-tch"". The great ensemble cast gets broken apart, because they have their own plot-lines now. They are not a group anymore. The love-interests from the first two films are all completely forgotten, and the ones introduced in this film slip in and out of the film without making any lasting impression.All in all, this is an encore that ruins the set, an addition that leaves no-one wanting more.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

The Final Performance of the Bellas,"As the third part of this musical comedy movie, I could not help but to compare this with the first and second movie. Just what I suspected, the movie's story was not as good as the second one, let alone the first one. To me personally (and my wife shared the same sentiment as I did), the first one was the best. That one was truly honoring the a cappella style of music with the competition to be the best at university level and we get to see the earlier problems a big group would have in real life. The second one despite the movie expanded their universe to a world competition, the story itself was probably a bit less good, but the competitors of the Bellas were still a cappella singers. Whereas this time, the competition comes from a real band which I think was not really apple to apple, plus the story of this third one was a bit forced.The nice thing about this movie was still the performance of the Bellas were still as good as before and they also seemed to give more portion to other members of the group (except Jessica and Ashley characters. LOL). And the jokes were still quite similar to the earlier movies. My favorite character in this film (and the 1st & 2nd ones) was definitely Fat Amy who was very funny, plus she gave a surprisingly cool scenes in the boat towards the end of the movie. Oh, Lily's character was also very fun. This time, the characters of John and Gail were not as much as the previous movies, but they still gave crazy fun commentaries as usual. 1 other thing, I still think that the movie might not be suitable for children whom I noticed were there when I saw this in the cinema today.The songs this time were quite up to date and seeing this movie, you should expect to see a lot of songs wonderfully sung in a cappella style. My favorite song scene was the very cool brief riff-off between the Bellas and other groups. Basically the movie was having a similar formula with the earlier movies, like the competition, the crazy stuff they always managed to do, some relationships, and funny moments. The best thing about this movie to my personal opinion was the last song which would bring out lot of emotions for fans of the Bellas (like my wife). Plus the end credit scene was also fun to see as it served as reminder of the journey these girls had all the years.Overall, if you are fans of the group and also love to see songs sung in a cappella style, or any other style, plus some fun jokes, then this movie is definitely for you. This is a light movie that should not be over thought and just to be enjoyed as pure entertainment. However, if you must have a logical story in a movie, then this might not be to your liking. My advice for you to forget all your logic and just go enjoy the movie, maybe sing in your own heart. Do not forget to watch the Pitch Perfect 1 and 2 first before watching this one so you could be familiar and understand the characters (and some of the jokes) better.for my complete review pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Since when did this become a ""Rebel Wilson"" movie!!!!","I really loved the first two Pitch Perfect movies and was really looking forward to this but..... while I appreciate the story line, there were two things that really annoyed me. First, since when did this become a Rebel Wilson movie? It was all about her. I don't mind Rebel Wilson in small doses but I'm not a huge fan and frankly, as much as I love the movies, I don't particularly enjoy her part in them. I am Australian and I actually find her sense of humour distasteful. She's not funny. Second, I did not like the way that Rebel Wilson's character, Amy, belittled Haillee Steinfeld's character, Emily. Quite simply, it showed to the world that it's okay to bully someone. And it wasn't just once, it was quite a few times. This is not a criticism of Rebel Wilson but a huge criticism of the writers/director as it leaves me wondering what on earth was going through their minds when they okayed those lines in the movie. Anyway, apart from that, it wasn't too bad but definitely not as good as the first two. I will say that the ending was was great and so was the song they chose, Freedom.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Sadly though, despite protests, attempts at compromise and pleas that I hadn't seen the others so it wouldn't make sense, I was dragged, kicking and screaming, into Screen 4 and told to be quiet and enjoy it. Enjoy it I did not, but at the very least I did stay quiet... Quieter than one should be in a comedy, without a single laugh emanating from my cringing face. I can only pray I won't be dragged to a mess like this again. Unfunny, embarrassing and incoherent, it baffles me that any film of this calibre can make it to a trilogy.The story is absolutely incoherent and not engaging in the slightest. It's akin to an X-Factor documentary more than a musical film. Giving up on their careers for a competition isn't the sort of message Hollywood should be giving to millennials struggling to get to grips with adulthood and heading to Europe is the most cliched move you can imagine - naturally every American franchise heads to Europe as soon as they run out of ideas. The competition itself means very little to the overall plot, with the writers having to shove in plot lines like Beca's romance and Amy's daddy issues to fatten up an otherwise depressingly thin and unengaging plot. Though it may be strange that the most boring story is the central one that the film revolves around, the really sad irony is that the side-stories are in fact the more interesting parts of the film. It's as though this film can't decide what genre it is or even what story it should be telling. This results in the film being even more infuriating.'Perhaps the music can save it,' I hoped. Sadly, unless you like subpar cover groups, this is unlikely to be the case. It's problematic when other groups are more talented and entertaining than the central one you're supposed to care about. If you were ever unsure about a cappella, this will not make you a fan. At times you'd be forgiven for assuming they were some sort of Alvin and the Chipmunks tribute band instead. At the very least the dancing is choreographed and performed well, allowing the dancing to be the best element to the movie - it's just disappointing the editing can't allow the camera to pause on one shot long enough to let us appreciate it.It's recently been said that modern American comedies are not what they used to be; this film is simple proof to back up that claim. The characters should be charming, funny and enjoyable to spend time with. As it happens, the cast of The Bellas are a strange bunch, but not in that charming, quirky way so many coming-of-age teen movies are. They're not particularly endearing, although at least they do work well together and come across as good friends - largely in the way they speak over each other, constantly cheer each other on, have group hugs... This can't fail to make you in the audience feel like an outsider, not welcome to join in and be part of The Bellas. Not that this is a bad thing; with a group of characters who are so similar, ditzy and brainless, I think I'd rather spend an hour and a half with one of the other groups. The main spokespeople for The Bellas is mainly confined to three main characters; namely Anna Kendrick's Beca, Hailee Steinfeld's Emily and Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy. I'm still confident that Anna Kendrick has the ability to broaden her range of characters - she's been playing the same sort of person for years. Still, despite her wasted potential in this film, she's fortunately likeable nevertheless and it's a relief that she's the central character as opposed to one of the others. Similarly, Hailee Steinfeld showed excellent promise years back when she got an Oscar nomination for her role in True Grit. How the mighty have fallen; it's noticeable that no other Oscar nominations have come her way since. If she were to distance herself from films like this and apply her likeable personality and brilliant talent, she'd be fighting the awards off with a golden stick. Sadly the third main character we see far too much of is Rebel Wilson. How she seems to be moderately successful I'll never understand. The polar opposite to Kendrick and Steinfeld, Wilson's not at all likeable, nor is she anywhere near as funny as her character was intended to be. With desperate, pathetic jokes and crass humour which shows an utter lack of wit, I can only hope that her lines were improvised and not written; such an embarrassment couldn't fail to end the careers of the writers (assuming there were any writers, I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't). The only saving grace in terms of comedy are Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins. Although not all their jokes hit the mark, their lines are the only sections of the film that bare any resemblance to comedy and they really do deserve more.Without seeing the previous two I can't comment on them, but I'm sure they can't possibly be worse than this. Perhaps one of the worst films I've seen in a while. It makes other disappointments in 2017 seem wonderful in comparison. Good dance choreography and occasional enjoyable music, can't save a film drowning in irritating noise from The Bellas, an incoherent central story consistently distracted by side-plots, ditzy and annoying characters talking nonsense over each other and unfunny, crass and embarrassing attempts at comedy that fall flat on their face, with most of them coming from one character in particular...

"I wish this was Pitch Perfect 2 so I could title this review ""Pitch Perfect 2/10""","This was the first movie I saw in theaters in the New Year, and if it's a sign to come for 2018, I am deeply afraid. It's a cash-grab disasterpiece, and I feel it's quite a fine example to show how lazy corporate executives will get with popular franchise movies that are bonafide money-makers. They know the waters well. The fish bite without even checking the bait now! Why even bother putting something on the hook anymore? (I'm looking at you too, Star Wars). The best way to describe this movie is that it is half-assed in some of the worst ways possible. Lazy attempts at jokes in between sleepy dialogue. Most of the jokes were funnier in the sense of how pathetic and cringe-worthy they were than the actual set-up and punch line. I found myself as a turtle during this movie, slowing shrinking my head into my jacket-shell with each ""Fat Amy is fat. I like eat"" joke. And for how surprisingly random the plot seemed, somehow it managed to keep itself incredibly predictable and incredibly trite. And along with the random plot came randomized tone as well, just like way out left hook type biffs of sentimentality in a movie full of corporate greed, spliced with comedic bits that fall right on their face, and a James Bond-type sequence at the end (what?), this movie demonstrated the emotional and tonal maturity of a bad sitcom episode. And it became quickly obvious to the actresses involved that this movie was nowhere near the quality of the original because almost every performance here is phoned in. They were only there for the check, and DJ Khaled seemed likewise, leaving his natural energy and persona at home during his set days. And some characters seemed like they wouldn't damage their reputation being in such a movie and their characters ""got pregnant and couldn't tour"" or ""they broke up"" and I hold some respect for them. And aside from the laziness of this film, the crowd-pleasing and innocuous tone was extremely annoying as well. Let's add the military because you need to support your country and everyone knows that it's illegal to hate a patriotic movie! And let's go to all these foreign countries and give them shout-outs so our overseas box office sales are healthier. And let's throw in some really lazy female empowerment agenda because that's important now. And even though it includes all these shout-outs, I still can't imagine the person who would go out and enjoy sitting through this movie. The only redeeming quality I will give it are the song and dance sequences. Luckily the choreography and compositions were not lacking and were easily the most entertaining parts of this entire film. Idk, I'm getting even angrier at this film just writing all this out, so I'll leave with just two questions: was this movie really needed? And why did I spend ten dollars to see it?",2.0,Anonymous,Music

It was almost a distraction from the main storyline but it was very fun. The jokes wernt laugh out loud but many of them were funny. Its just a shame that the best joke in the movie was already given away in the trailers. But Beccas storyline with DJ Khaled was great and really added much more depth to the story.

Movie Review: Pitch Perfect 3,"What did I just watch? Seriously this movie is not at all what I expected. The first act is pretty entertaining and sets up an interesting premise where the Bella's have to compete with real bands using instruments. This plot is almost completely abandoned however when the movie decides to become an action movie with a hostage situation. There is a severe tonal problem with this movie but I can't say I didn't have fun with certain aspects and scenes. This movie will probably satisfy Pitch Perfect super fans but doesn't offer much other than ""what if Pitch Perfect was John Wick?"". This film has no where near the fun or heart of the previous instalments and I wouldn't seek it out but it's not without merit either.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

"""Satan has finally left my body!""","Well, they really struggled with this one.

I still find it hard to believe that there are people out there capable of having these ""Riff Battles""?The guy who played Chicago was cute and it was interesting to see Hollyoaks, Craig Dean, but none of the individual storylines had time to develop, except, sadly, Fat Amy's. She was fine in the first two, but she really did take over this one and too much can be a bad thing.I think there were better songs to choose for more impact, but they were trying too hard and wanted to be down with the kids by having DJ Khalid in it.

"Gotta love 'em, but these pitches have run out of steam","If ""Pitch Perfect 2"" was a care-free, money-making victory lap for the writers/producers who managed to strike comedy gold the first time they made a movie about collegiate a cappella, what does that make ""Pitch Perfect 3?"" Choreographed singing and dancing on the grave of what was once a funny, charming and original 2013 comedy, perhaps.As with any franchise three films deep, those who endeavor to watch ""Pitch Perfect 3"" have formed an attachment to the characters to the extent that satisfaction comes merely from seeing them again, or in this case, finding out what they've been up to since college. The Bellas are all struggling to adapt to post-college life with no jobs or cruddy ones, when Aubrey (Anna Camp) pulls a plot out of thin air and says she has a military connection that will allow the group to reunite for a brief USO tour.The storylines that develop on said tour are all recycled or preposterously fabricated, with the group feeling threatened by the other acts on the tour that ""use instruments"" and Fat Amy's father (John Lithgow, with a delightful Aussie accent) dropping in unannounced. The musical numbers-once again the bright spots of this series-get artificially inseminated into the story, including a head-scratching ""battle"" with the theme of ""artists you didn't know were Jewish.""Writer Kay Cannon had stayed involved with all three scripts, and she's kind of phoned it in on this one, even with the help of a solid collaborator in Mike White. If the story had stayed with these struggling post-college Millennials rather than swooping them off to Spain, France, etc. something good could've come of it. Instead, the ignorable plot puts more pressure on the humor, which like ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is hit or miss, with a lot of the same bits and tired jokes about each of the Bellas resurfacing.That said, Cannon has always kept the spirit of these films as fairly self-aware, even at their lowest points. Director Trish Sie, who made her name directing a few viral OK Go videos including the famous treadmill dance, recognizes that irreverent spirit, but doesn't add any creative ingenuity, opting instead to follow the template set before her. Considering the musical scenes generally stand alone, there's no reason there couldn't be a few knockout music video-esque concepts baked in as diversions from the poor story.The music is great, Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins could banter all film long and I'd eat it up, but the storylines and characters have been stretched as far they can go.

Suffers from sequel dimishing returns but worth it for DJ Khalid,"Movies not originally written as a multipart series struggle to avoid a natural decline in entertaining power. The Anna Kendrick series offers a textbook example of this cinematic principle. The nerdy acapella jokes which made the original refreshing feel stale, you've seen the song battle with unusual singing groups (e.g., the Green Bay Packers) before, the big movie-ending showdown is more ritual than riveting. To its credit the movie breaks the fourth wall to acknowledge some of these tropes most insightfully when Beca explains the impromptu sing-offs and then mentions that they always seem to lose them. Like the 2nd outing the movie could have used some editing particularly around a B plot involving John Litghow as Fat Amy's father. The gravity of sequel physics might have made #2 the bail out point if not for one man - the incomprarable DJ Khalid. The possibly genius / possibly raving idiot quote machine gets a hilarious scene where he spouts inpenetrable DJ Khalid philosphy why an assistant translates for the audience (""what DJ Khalid means here is you need to let go of the anchor of the past if you want to rise to your future."")

European PP,"The girls are struggling to do life after the Bellas. Gail (Elizabeth Banks) and John (John Michael Higgins) are making their documentary on the Bellas.

Desperate to sing together again, Aubrey (Anna Camp) uses her estranged father's military connection to get into the USO. They travel to Europe where they are in competition to be the opening act of DJ Khaled. Calamity (Ruby Rose) leads their main competitors. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) is pursued by her estranged Fergus (John Lithgow).At least, the gang is back and that's half the battle. Their group chemistry is the heart and soul of this franchise. Beca and Fat Amy have a great back and forth relationship. However, Fat Amy's ridiculous story is not funny and her gimmick gets less fun especially without Beca. This is a collapsing franchise. Like others before it, this one goes over to Europe to speed up the decline. The writing is clunky and a throwback to bad sequel writing. It's weak and cliche in a bad way.

The Vidiot Reviews....,"Pitch Perfect 3Sadly, if you want to sabotage an a cappella group you have to slit a member's throat.Or, you can do what the rivals in this musical comedy do and play instruments.Three years after their last performance, the dismantled Bellas (Brittany Snow, Anna Camp, Hailee Steinfeld) are reunified for a chance to perform in a USO show alongside DJ Khaled. But when he only wants Beca (Anna Kendrick) for his opening act, it divides the outfit.Meanwhile, Fat Amy's (Rebel Wilson) ex-con father (John Lithgow) lands the girls in hot water.With its reunion plotline dependent yet again on a singing competition, this third entry in the pointless musical pageant is the absolute worst in the series, and unwatchable. This claim is exemplified by the inclusion of organized crime, military adverts and DJ Khaled's acting to the mix.Moreover, singing without a guitar is like fighting without an M16.

A Severely Missed Opportunity,"""Pitch Perfect"" is a franchise that really shouldn't succeed even close to the levels it reaches. Yet, it manages to grab from just enough audiences to prove itself viable most of the time. It has the ""girl power"" audience, the audience that loves the raunchy humor/wisecracks, and of course the well-choreographed song/dance numbers. Throw in just enough of a story, and you've got something.The first ""Pitch Perfect"" film was all about the transition to college and branching out in the world. ""Pitch Perfect 2"" was about diving deeper into that experience and bonding with friends. Though never in line for an Oscar nomination, a story arc was indeed in play here. ""Pitch Perfect 3"" was supposed to be about coming together after college is over and being a bit lost in life (as many young people feel at this point in time). Sadly, that opportunity is wasted by a script that doesn't try nearly as hard as it should to continue the story arc. What results is a jumbled mess, punctuated by just enough musical numbers to keep it watchable for even the hard-core fans.For a basic plot summary, ""PP3"" sees Beca (Anna Kendrick) and the rest of the Bellas (Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Anna Camp, Hailee Steinfeld, Ester Dean, Hana Mae Lee, etc.) struggling to adapt to life outside of the group. They are presented an opportunity, however, to participate in a USO tour to ""support the troops"", (as well as perhaps prove themselves to be the opening act for DJ Khaled) and they all jump at the opportunity to sing again.Story-wise, this movie is a mess from start to finish. The USO doesn't really even make that much sense (and keeps changing in plot-device fashion to fit the narrative), no character development takes place, and a subplot involving Fat Amy's father (played by John Lithgow) is inanely stupid. There is even a confusion of tone, as the writers didn't seem to know what they wanted this movie to be. Is it about the Bellas reuniting and ""finding themselves"" again, or is it about acapella music vs. instrumental music? Unfortunately, neither path is definitively taken or resolved.To me, the saddest thing about ""PP3"" is that it missed a golden opportunity to ""go out on top"", so to speak, as this is a franchise that is not (despite its previous cash-cow status) going to live on forever. It has already lost a lot of that forward momentum. This could have been a great ""final reunion"" movie that brings everything back together and to a close. That doesn't happen here, though, as instead the tact was more to just create an average PP film and sort of leave the characters adrift at the conclusion. My guess is that the studio producing these films did not yet want to make an ""ending film"" in the series, but I think they will come to regret that decision (this one is not doing well at the box office at all).Overall, then, ""Pitch Perfect 3"" was a big disappointment to me. The song numbers are literally all this film has going for it. The rest is a mess, and potentially a long-term mess for this franchise as well. It's too bad that the studio wants to milk it dry, as that is exactly what seems to be happening here. Creatively-speaking, ""PP3"" is bone-dry.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

"Not as bad as I'd imagined, but my imagination is pretty vivid.","It's well documented that the musical is my least favourite of all genres, being the only one that I'll actively go out of my way to avoid, and so the prospects of me liking what is not only a full blown contemporary musical but a weak-chinned third entry into a stalling franchise of a full blown contemporary musical were slim to say the least. Nevertheless, I curled my toes, clenched my teeth and sat back on my newly tightened sphincter as I prepared for a cinematic death unlike any other and, to my surprise, I survived the experience essentially unscathed.

"Kind of enjoyed it, but...","This was a tough film to rate. The performers are clearly having a ball, and undoubtedly had even more fun off-screen as well. It does feel like we the audience are being invited along on an overseas vacation, a lark, an all-stops-out, almost drunken-silly reunion of friends, and that may be its central problem: it felt to me like the director and actors (and screenwriters) were having so much fun on location improvising and goofing (and singing and dancing) that they forgot to include an engaging plot or any attempt at coherence and effort to make a great comedy ""finale"" for the Pitch Perfect series. Even John Lithgow, one of my favorite actors (especially in comedies), seems to have dropped any pretense of effort at real acting or performance in favor of chewing the scenery, bugging out his eyes, and playing with a very odd-sounding Australian accent (this may be an inside joke that those from Australia WILL get a big laugh out of because it's so off, but it just sounded, well, like a bad attempt at an accent to me). Anna Kendrick and especially Rebel Wilson, and many of the returning players (Elizabeth Banks, I'm looking at you) clearly improvised much of the dialogue using the ""throw everything at the wall and see what sticks"" method of improv, but, unfortunately, the editor didn't take out the not-so-great moments. It's still fun to watch them all at times, and the musical numbers are slick and well-choreographed, as always in these ""Pitch Perfect"" films, but this Part 3 ""finale"" (I say that in quotes because it sure would not surprise me one bit if they are back for #4 if this one is a hit) is truly just OK, hence my settling on a middling 5-star (out of 10) rating. One thing, though, I sure do think Rebel Wilson deserves another shot at a major sitcom where her improv goofiness can shine (with the help of an editor and sharp-eyed director)--she won me over by film's end, yet again, especially during the final ""action-film"" section of scenes (without giving anything away).

"A Fine Conclusion, I Guess","Look, I'm not going to be the person who says that they love the original Pitch Perfect film and let that cloud my judgment into thinking its sequels are just as great because they're not. The release of Pitch Perfect back in 2012 was an anomaly. I quite enjoy watching that film and when Pitch Perfect 2 hit theatres, I found myself mildly enjoying it for the musical numbers but ultimately seeing it as a retread. Pitch Perfect 3 is now playing in theatres around the world and I can't say much more about this addition either if I'm being honest, but at least it tried to be different. If you're a fan of the first two, here are the elements that may intrigue you during your viewing of this third and probably final installment.Pitch Perfect 3 follows the Bellas after they've graduated University and moved on to the real world, trying to start careers. When they all realize their lives are miserable without being a part of this team, they form together one last time to travel the world, performing for the troops. This leads them on a journey that will have them realize where they belong in life and possibly even sprout lifelong careers for them. Although incredibly uneven, this film intends to give a solid swan song to these characters in order to conclude a trilogy, and the result is satisfying for fans, but it's not enough to dig itself out of familiar territory.As I mentioned, this is a film that tries to be very different, injecting family aspects and action sequences, but it feels like too much of a departure from the first two movies in terms of story. Many of the jokes are funny for fans of this trilogy, but many of them are sadly just repeats from past films. The best part about these two sequels are easily the musical numbers. I can replay certain scenes from Pitch Perfect 3 in my head and remember having a good time in the theatre, but I very soon realized the inconsistent premise when comparing it to its predecessors.I will say that the third act of this film definitely does a good job in taking care of its characters and truly making you feel like this is the end of a trilogy, but it was a little too late for me by that time. Yes, I enjoyed the musical aspect of the movie, but the heart of the first film just isn't there anymore. Watching characters interact, fall in love, and build chemistry was truly what made me enjoy the first movie so much. Sadly, with many of the cast members mysteriously absent from this installment, it just felt off to me. It makes very lazy attempts to explain why they're no longer around, making me just want to watch the first two again.In the end, I can't say that I disliked this movie, but I didn't like it that much as an overall product either. Yes, the musical numbers and mash-ups are awesome to hear and see performed, but the story itself, along with the interaction of the cast is what made the original as good as it is, and that is the main thing I couldn't seem to find here. I would recommend this movie to hardcore fans of the first two installments, but this movie is surely not for newcomers. I enjoyed the aspects of this film that called back to the first and second and certain characters are given their due, but I just can't truly recommend that a theatrical experience is necessary. Pitch Perfect 3 is a fine conclusion for fans, but not a very good movie overall.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Third Time's the Semi-Charm,"It started with a song that roped a group together, and it has blown up into one of the most popular comedies to serenade the stage. The movie is Pitch Perfect and the trilogy comes to a close tonight as the Bellas take center screen once more to sing their ""potential"" swan song. After copious media advertisements, does the third installment have the vocal chords to shatter our ear drums in delight? Or does it fall to bad singing in the shower. Robbie K here to once again give you his thoughts on a movie. Let's goLIKES:Back to its comedic rootsThe Character Development StoryThe Music-The ConclusionDISLIKES:The HostsThe Random Dropped CharactersThe Weak RivalsThe Other Parts Of The StorySummary:Pitch Perfect 3 is a fun, comedic adventure that is packed full of laughs that we all fell in love with in the first installment. While not as good as the original, this tale toned down the comedic prompts and overacting, to deliver a nice little wrap up to the series as a whole. Beca's story is touching and not only ties the rest of the crew in, but also gives you the emotional finesse that this series is famous for. The musical numbers, while not as impressive as previous installments in terms of showmanship, has the same toe tapping power we adore in this series, so get ready to buy another soundtrack. Yet the movie still has room for improvement, primarily in utilizing its characters and the story. Many of my favorite characters were diluted in the movie, and the rivals continue to pale in comparison to the Trebletones this time in their limited screen time. Overall though, it's certainly a fun trip down comedy lane that is certain to entertain the masses both at home and in theaters.My scores:Comedy/Music: 7.5

"Similar To Other Pitch Perfects But, Missing Something","The women of Pitch Perfect are in this movie, but some of the great things about the first two are missing. Anna Kendrick rocks the screen again with her fantastic smile. There are some good songs in it for, example the song ""Freedom"". But the great appeal of Pitch Perfect is missing somewhere. It is replaced by stories of women having difficulty dealing with being out of College.There is also a bad sub plot about Fat Amy effectively being...super girl when in a fight. This simply does not work and is hardly believable, entertaining or even interesting. As with the first two, the music still is the reason to watch this, but it is not a good as the music in the first two.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

disappointing,"I had heard it really wasn't that great a movie but I wanted ot see it anyway because I LOVED the first and liked the 2nd. But sometimes even though you expect something ot not be great its still a major nummer when its worse than you thought it might be. I think I laughed out loud maybe twice and both were lines by John Michael Higgins but even he and Gail couldnt save the movie. Its almost like they couldn't agree which storyline to go with so they threw a bunch at the wall and said lets see what sticks! And the ""action"" storyline with fat amy really fell flat for me. Even John Lithgow who pretty much can do no wrong in my mind wasn't making it work. I think Amy is better in small doses. and I really missed Jesse Bumper and Benji. I kind of had a feeling Benji wouldnt be in it due to Evan Hanson but still disappointing to not get the other two in at all and only a quick mention about them.

Not that Aca-Awful,"I enjoyed the reunion of the Bella's for one last singing adventure. I agree with other reviewers that this third version was the weakest of the three. The plot was silly as others have said. What I did enjoy were the musical numbers and the fun USO costumes. I particularly enjoyed their version of Toxic. Also, the James Bond style a capella arrangement in the opening of the movie was a great start.The misses include the ending of the movie including the closing musical number. The last number was my least favorite, and I wanted them to re-write the script for the ending.There were less laughs than the first two movies. I remember only laughing out loud twice, but I did still laugh twice! The duo of John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks unfortunately didn't amount to many laughs this time around. I love them both.I did appreciate how the movie made fun of themselves and the past movies. One example was when they asked why they keep doing those mash up challenges when they never win.This movie was all about getting together one last time and then moving on to the next phase of their lives. I was happy to get to experience the Bellas one last time. As I said in the title, it wasn't that Aca-Awful. It was still the Bellas, and the performances were memorable. I can say along with them that it's time to move on. I will enjoy replaying their performances. Toxic is still buzzing in my head like those bees in the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Perfectly fine,"Pitch Perfect doesn't manage to avoid the pitfall of many trilogies, which is the continual decline in quality. None of them are bad films, but this instalment is definitely the bottom of the pile.The songs aren't as good, the plot is a bit too outlandish and didn't hit the mark, and it lost some of the more detailed character focus of the previous two. Speaking of the plot, there wasn't particularly one in truth. They concocted some bizarre story which gave the Bellas an excuse to reunite and sing some songs, then we meander about a bit in the middle third before a very strange twist and shift in the final act. All a bit odd but not awful I suppose.Despite this, I still had a good time watching it. The characters and the interactions between them (aside from the songs) have always been the best parts of these films. From Anna Kendrick's facial expressions to Rebel Wilson's dialogue, it's always fun seeing these characters bounce off of each other and this is no exception in Pitch Perfect 3. There's lots to enjoy in this respect.I just wish there were more great songs! I don't think a single one stands out as memorable which is a shame as I love the soundtrack for the first film, so they obviously have it in them.A decent watch and fans of the franchise will find enough to enjoy with this, but it doesn't live up to either of its predecessors!",5.0,Anonymous,Music

"Fun acting, great performance, everlasting friendship","Dear readers, now I am going to show you why Pitch Perfect is the most well-known drama musical in Hollywood movies. First is about how Director connected all the girls to be together and make a group of acapella-dancing. This is not easy, but we can see the proof that they can make it. Second is about the plot. Pitch Perfect 1,2,3 have the same common story line: Beginning and ending with a competition. This philosophy coming from the real life that we always want to be the best in everything in our daily lives. So Pitch Perfect story line is all about competition, how people getting bullied, how to fight back, how to be honest, and how to be yourself. Some movie critics say that Pitch Perfect is just a slapstick movie, well, it is not true. By watching the characters of the plot, Pitch Perfect is more than just a comedy. This is a fun acting, great performance, and everlasting friendship. Every morning, the Pitch Perfect songs is like a mood-buster for me and wow, Anna Kendrick is such a great motivator. She has an unique personality. She loves herself, she is funny, awkward, and entertaining at the same time. I conclude that the movie Director in this Pitch Perfect 3 can still make the highlight of showing a life of acapella group in Hollywood industry. Pitch Perfect is part of my life and I can assume there will be Pitch Perfect 4 for reunion. Who knows, we can see those bitches again? :)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
3 stars for the 3rd installment,"Aca scuse me? Is this for real? Okay, so the first one is worthy of about a 7, it's just a light-hearted underdog comedy, not a masterpiece but it is entertaining nevertheless. And then it all went downhill from there... So the second one was pretty mediocre, I'd say it should be rated a 4 but this one is absolute garbage! I couldn't put spoilers in this review if I tried as there is no plot anyway! The characters are not developed whatsoever, the script is embarrassing (and that's a polite way of putting it) and it misses an important aspect that made the first one good - comedy! Rebel Wilson is mildly funny but the other characters couldn't be funny if they tried. The biggest joke in this is that DJ Khaled is hailed as some musical genius in this- for those unfamiliar with this pile of hot, steaming poop, his claim to fame is saying ""We the best music, DJ Khaled""-. This film is so predictable, it's infuriating. Fed up of hollywood thinking they can churn out rubbish like this.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"What can I say? It's Pitch Perfect 3. Fans of the series will like it fine, but it's just passable in my book","Looks like we've got another Pitch Perfect movie out. I might as well talk about them. I'll admit they've never been a favorite series of mine. I find them a tad annoying and perhaps full of themselves. That's not to say I don't understand why people get into them. They've made a lot of money, and I base that on the one element that's done well; the singing. Those that have been in a capella groups know how difficult it is to recreate instrumental sounds. It's the same thing as beatboxing. Don't tell me your impressed when someone can make guitar and electronic sounds all with their vocals.Do the Pitch Perfect movies do well for a capella groups in college? Probably. Can they translate out to movies? Sometimes. The previous movies have had their strengths, as I said in the singing department and even some laughs, but their not something I'd return to on my own. I've mentioned before that third movies in franchises tend to be the point in which the steam has run out. Has the steam run out for the Bellas? Well...lets look at Pitch Perfect 3 to see what we have.After graduating since Pitch Perfect 3, the majority of the Bellas are living in New York City as they try to make something of themselves. Beca (played by Anna Kendrick) is trying to make it as a music producer, but quits on principle. Her roommate ""Fat Amy"" played by Rebel Wilson is simply trying to make it as a celebrity. Both seem to be empty since graduating. Though she, Fat Amy, and the other Bellas get invited to a ""reunion"", all it was, was to simply watch the only Bella still in school, Emily (played by Haliee Steinfeld) and her group. She apologizes for misleading the group and treats them to a night out.While they talk about the good memories of school, former leader of the Bellas Chloe (played by Brittney Snow) tells them that they might be able to perform in the military USO show. Everyone loves the idea and they sign up. Upon arriving, the Bellas find out that not only is it a full competition, but they'll be competing against full bands that use instruments. While the Bellas keep trying to find a better tune and find out what's going to happen after this, Fat Amy's father Fergus (played by John Lithgow) is back after being absent and wants to become close with his daughter.The best way to describe Pitch Perfect 3 is that it is what it is; a Pitch Perfect sequel. Fans of the series get exactly what they'll be looking for; more singing, more the bellas, and of course, more of Fat Amy saying some offbeat jokes. There's not a lot that separates this from the previous movies other then that the girls are out in the real world. It's just that the majority of those parts are rushed in favor of getting to the main plot.The one element that feels out of place is a kidnapping subplot that feels out of place. Though I won't say what happens, let's just say that most audience members are going to be looking at their watches wondering how long this movie is. It tries to add on some character history, but who cares? People that love these movies aren't there for a spy thriller. Their there to watch the Bellas sing.As far as musical sequences are, their done well. It's also a scenario in which the songs and performances are good as before. I know their trying to make it bigger, but the problem is that not only are the Bellas at too much a disadvantage, but the final song feels like something that goes against what a capella groups would do. Maybe it's because the last song in Pitch Perfect 2 felt like a better send off then this does. This has been marketed as the final Pitch Perfect movie, though we'll see what the audience says.I'll give this five microphones out of ten. What can I say? It's Pitch Perfect 3. If you really liked the first two, then you'll get into this fine. Newcomers (I don't know why you'd start here) should watch the first ones before knowing if this is for them. I'll pass on watching these again, but don't let that stop the fans who love these.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Incredibly disappointing.,"PITCH PERFECT 3- 49%
The first two Movies in this franchise were cool, fun, hip, and inspiring. The first one had the incredible song ""Cups"" Which was a world wide hit, and the second movie had ""When tomorrow comes"" which gave everyone goosebumps. The stories in the past two movies were also quite relevant and had a nice structure.
Now this movie had a weird story, that wasn't nearly as interesting. 
The acting was beyond terrible. 
The first hour was boring to a degree that I paused the movie and watched other things to regain some energy to finish it. The last 30 minutes were funny and entertaining. 
I just wish they had a stronger song to finish this franchise with a much more inspiring tone to it. The hit song of this part isn't even memorable. 
It felt like a kids movie.

Just Disappointing,"This is the second movie I have attended in 2018, and, unfortunately, I am 0 for 2 on the year.
The movie was just, well how to I sum this up in one word, pointless is a good one. Don't get me wrong, the first movie in the trilogy was a great film. Something that hadn't been attempted, well attempted and succeeded before in my opinion. An entire movie about acapella. But, as we have seen, there is only so much you can do with that theme. The second movie was okay, nowhere near the level of the first. And the third seemed like a pure cash grab. The jokes fell flat for most of the movie, only making me laugh a couple times. For a comedy movie, it wasn't very funny. We lost most of the original cast from the first movie, including the entire male group the Trebelmakers, including the talents of Skylar Astin (Jesse) and Ben Platt (Benji). There were a big part of Beca's character arc in the first and second movie, and they weren't there for the final movie, or at least I hope this was the final move.
The usual redeeming quality about these movies is the music, and I was the most disappointed about that aspect in this. The songs they chose to sing were boring. There were no uptempo songs, no mash-ups (which the first movie was famous for), the riff off just didn't work. It was just bad really. There was only one good song in my mind, so I would suggest buying ""Freedom! '90"" only from iTunes if you are at all interested in the album and don't waste the rest of your money.
The one good song leads directly to one of the only positive things about this movie, and that is Anna Kendrick's performance as Beca. For the bad movie that this was, it finished out Beca's character arc very well. Due to the non-casting of her boyfriend in the first two films, they broke them up in the movie, but they didn't get her back together with another guy in the film, which was the right move. Beca's singing was on point, which I think is a real underrated aspect in Anna Kendrick's arsenal as an actor I might add. And they finished with her being in a perfect place for the character, so well done on that.
The movie I would compare this to is Star Wars: The Last Jedi if you can believe it, although a real difference in quality level. A very good main character arc, but very distracting with the rest of the plot line around it. If you take out all the scenes without Anna Kendrick in it, this would have been a much better movie.
My suggestion to anyone who hasn't seen this in theaters is don't unless you have a huge crush on this trilogy. I honestly, wouldn't even suggest renting it. I would wait until it comes out on Netflix, HBO, Hulu, whatever your preferred platform really. And as for buying the movie, I would only do it if you need it for your collection to finish out all three, and even then I would look for a bundle pack with the other two. This movie wasn't the worst in the year of 2017, but it certainly wasn't great.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"Cash Grab, But Still Fun?","I've now seen all the Pitch Perfect films which may be a surprise for a single 26-year-old guy, but I'll admit the first one was entertaining. It could be argued they should have stopped at one, but this one has its redeemable points. For example, I never thought I'd ever see John Litgow singing, but I'm thankful that is in the world now.The story was predictable and the sudden fighting sequence of the usually clumsy Fat Amy was just odd to watch and seemed out of place from the entire Pitch Perfect universe. Finally the fact that the main plot line is trying to impress DJ Khaled who is portrayed as the epitome of music is laughable. Looking forward to number four where Beca begins work on her first album and brings the Bellas back in to help with vocals... because that's how predictable these films have become, but Brittany Snow will continue to bring me back.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Trust me, it's a total waste of time and money. You're wasting your time watching this movie. It truly didn't deserve any rewards. So cheesy, boring, slow-paced, predictable, in a nutshell AWFUL.

If you liked Pitch Perfect 1 and Pitch Perfect 2, you will like Pitch Perfect 3. If you did not like the prior movies, you probably won't find this movie any better. If you like the A Capella singing sequences, Pitch Perfect 3 has plenty. If you like the irreverent humor, the movie does a great job with completely relying on old jokes from the first two movies. The characters maintain their quirkiness without being overdone, the plot is interesting and reasonable, and I actually found the ending better than Pitch Perfect 1 and 2.

"This is the Last Time Pitches, Last Time!","It seems that to make a third rendition, the geniuses behind the Pitch Perfect franchise abandoned any inclination of endearing, sensible narratives, and fully embraced the wacky and delirious. Unfortunate. Worse, this money-grubbing nuisance is compounded by screenplay whose concepts of entertainment, are poorly executed re-hashes of past gimmicks and snippets of DJ Khaled's hand-gestures. The brand-spanking new characters offer NO saving grace whatsoever, as they come with that physical charm & zero substance formula, annoying us with phony angst & pretty-boy mannerisms THAT BORE. So much so, that the screenwriters offered these forgettable personas non-existent character-arches, fading into obscurity FAST. Speaking of arches, Beca's continuous prodding for career-satisfaction was another burden, overplayed and seemingly selfish compared to her comrades' backdrops, reaching the point of blandness.Yes, Pitch Perfect 3 single-handedly effaced fond memories earned by its predecessors, where enjoyable rambles for recognition meets fascinating characters, meets song numbers that deserves Youtube replays.

A nice change,"I must admit I am a hardcore Pitch Perfect fan. I loved one and two equally, however, the first one will always hold special in my heart.I am not going to go into detail about the story line, just read the IMDB summary. What I loved about this movie:1) The story had more to it than the last one. You come to discover some things about some of the characters you didn't know. Also, there is more time to give the Blellas as individuals than in the other 2 movies because of the shortened singing time.2) Though some say the plot is predictable, I say there were many surprises for me. And plenty of laughs too.3) I love this franchise so much, that any sequel made would bring me enjoyment unless they did something so evil as to ""Remake"" it or even take out the characters we have come to know and love.I am not one to overly ridicule a sequel to any movie(s) I love based on a pre-determined of idea of what it should or will be. Have low expectations, and you will find much enjoyment in this movie. Expect it to be just like the first, and you will be searching for another hit of your drug choice without any luck. Know that this movie is for fans who love the other 2. Don't take it too seriously, but don't completely underestimate the privilege of getting to see another one.

Still this felt fresh and cool at the beginning, even when it touched upon some of the same themes the previous movies had, then seems to become ""boring"" - well for some I reckon, I would not count myself amongst them.The movie is fun - and apart from the strong beginning it also has a strong finish! The last song is ... well it may blow your mind (no not Blackstreet again - though I wouldn't have minded). Actually the song they choose appreciates the theme of the movie. Finding oneself - truly finding! Without needing anyone else - but still being there for everyone they love ... and cherish! It actually would make a great ending and would be a cool trilogy as it is ... but I will watch the next one! And probably way faster than I watched this one, when it comes out.Alexis Knapp or rather her character was sidelined here, I reckon she may have been pregnant and they may have put that in the story.
