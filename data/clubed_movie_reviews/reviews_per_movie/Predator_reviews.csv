They Don't Make Them Like This Anymore,"This movie is an absolute classic. This is the machoist movie ever made. Schwarzenegger in his prime, Carl Weathers, Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura and Bill Duke--I don't think the line up could have been any better except if they added Sly Stallone.""Predator"" is one of the rare movies from the 80's that I can watch again and again and not feel as though it's dated. The action was great, the lines were memorable and the predator was a beast.""Predator"" was a fresh addition to the action movie genre. No fighting gangs, or terrorists, or enemy nations--this was the toughest of the extraterrestrials versus the toughest on Earth. Man they don't make 'em like this anymore.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Must-See Sci-Fi Horror,"Predator is the perfect blend of 80's action and slasher style sci fi horror. Although it was coined ""alien in the jungle"" when the script was first floating around, Predator exceeded expectations and cemented itself as a sci-fi titan. Arguably Arnold's best role. The cast had outstanding chemistry and the characters traits and personalities were developed well through the action and what dialogue was there. Special nods to Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, and Jesse Ventura. Very well paced film and some of the best one liners of all time. Pairs together great with the explosive action and gruesome kills. The practical effects still hold up to this day, and the predator costume/design (RIP to the late Kevin Peter Hall who gave us an especially great predator performance) are ahead of it's time. An 80's sci fi gem and truly one of my favorite movies to watch, thank you to everyone who helped make this movie possible.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Arnie is at his best in this sci-fi classic!,"This film will always have special place for me, as aside from being one of the best horror/sci-fi films of the eighties; it's also a huge childhood favourite of mine. Despite the fact that I've seen it dozens of times as a kid, I have only seen it once during adulthood; and that single viewing was more than enough to remind me what it is that I love about this film! Predator works as a macho action film, gory horror and intriguing sci-fi, and despite it's short running time of just 100 minutes, it somehow manages to find room for all three. The fact that it stars action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger ensures that the film will always be favourably remembered. He's not a good actor, but Arnie always manages to bring that extra something to his movies. The plot is deliciously simple and follows a group of commandos that go off into the jungle on a secret mission. However, things go awry when it turns out that they aren't the only ones with weapons there. Finding the skinned bodies of the last group of men that entered the jungle is about to become the least of their worries...The jungle makes for a great setting for an action sci-fi flick such as this. These sorts of films tend to be set in space, so seeing the action down here on earth is different; and the fact that it's set in the jungle, with it's dense foliage, ensures that Die Hard-director John McTiernan is able to bump up the suspense, as just like in the Vietnam war; the soldiers are dealing with an unknown enemy. The atmosphere really is excellent, and the special effects help to create a futuristic tone, while the suspense builds and makes sure that the audience are on the edge of their seats at all times. Predator was released hot on the heels of the success of James Cameron's amazing 'Aliens' - but don't be thinking this film is merely a rip off following a trend, Predator has more than enough up it's sleeve to ensure that isn't the case. The action is great, and director McTiernan clearly knows what he's doing. It's fast and furious, and the amount of weapons on display ensures that the film is sure to delight fans of macho action films. The fact that the lead actor is a monster of a man doesn't exactly hurt the film either!Now, Arnold Schwarzenegger may well be a terrible actor; but it doesn't matter because it's his screen presence, not his acting ability, that makes his performances what they are. At times he's cringe-worthy, but it's hard to deny his prowess when it comes to the action sequences, and that is all a film of this nature needs. Arnie isn't the only big man in the film either, as an assortment of muscle men, including ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura, and Carl Weathers; Rocky's Apollo Creed, among other B-movie actors, join him. The man himself also finds himself a very worthy ally, in the form of the movie's central alien. The Predator may not be as beautiful as the creature from 'Alien', but it's just as inventive. Here we have an extra terrestrial that isn't merely trying to breed, or to 'phone home' - but one that is actually there to hunt humans for sport! Aside from being ingenious, the idea also borders on frightening. The gore here is gratuitous, but never goes over the top and on the whole, Predator is a film that never really got the credit it deserves. It's mindless fun - but its damn good mindless fun!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
They just don't make them like this anymore,"Predator is my favourite film, next to Rocky, and has always had a special place in my heart. Scaring me to death as a youngster, the film succeeds completely in merging different genres together. For the first part, a gung-ho action flick - for the second part, a nerve-jangling horror that develops into a tremendous adventure film.The film feels like a real team effort, much like the heroes of the film itself. Everyone involved in the production has brought something creative, unique or memorable to the table and has made Predator become a hugely popular film and franchise.Firstly, the scipt is chock-full of classic dialogue, making this one of the most quoted films in history, with so many cheesy one-liners that you've be forgiven for thinking the characters were being hunted by a hungry mouse. However, the script and the premise is genius - by simply pitting an alien hunter against Earth's finest prey, humans (commandos even), the situations write themselves; boy-scout traps, mud-camouflaged Arnie and the villain which imitates and toys with its prey. The sequel, which is OK but not a classic, managed to develop this idea even further with a wider arsenal and deeper understanding of the alien race, which gives this film a little something to separate it from other standard Alien-ripoffs.Secondly, director John McTiernan keeps the film zooming along at a sensible pace. When there's any danger of actual character development, we move straight on to the next scene and dispense with said character lol. There's a tremendous atmosphere as the commandos enter the jungle - it's like another world and straight away the audience is thrown out of its seat with a shocking discovery up in the trees. In fact, the massive outbursts of violence in Predator are still very savage today and despite more violence now getting through censors, we don't get to see anything quite so shocking as skinned corpses and spinal cords being ripped out! Eventually, the tension is cranked up to breaking point as it's left to Arnie to ""stick around"" and avenge his team, Tarzan-style.Next, the visual effects people should be congratulated. From amazing pyrotechnics to the legendary heat vision and camouflage which is part of Predator's unique quality. Even today, the image of a blurry silhouette running through the jungle gives me the shivers and when the final battle kicks in, sparks truly fly. The cameo-effect is one of the best special effects i've ever seen and feels like the discovery of bullet time or something just as classic.Thank the lord for Stan Winston, who practically saved the film by ditching the original dopey design of the Predator and coming up with the masked humanoid with some nice dreadlocks. Most people prefer Giger's Alien design over this, but I always prefer the Predator, largely thanks to Kevin Peter Hall's performance. Instead of a guy in a suit, which Alien eventually seemed like at the end, we get a nasty looking alien under a mask. Never do we think that it's just a bloke under there. The Predator swings from to tree to tree like a monkey and bounds great distances like Frankenstein's monster on steroids. Instead of a clumsy, fake alien, we get something that really does act and look intelligent enough to hunt a team of crack commandos. The appearance itself is truly memorable and it's debatable whether the Pred looks cooler with or without his metal mask.As I said before, it's a real ensemble effort and even the actors bring something to the film that stands out. We don't need character development for this type of film, we just need something that makes each guy different so that we know who's getting wasted - a problem which many monster flicks mess up by throwing in a bunch of blands. Here, every character is radically different; Dutch, the sensible team-leader (although Arnie doesn't exactly need to be distinguished), Dillon who has shades of Apollo Creed in trying to keep his cool and save face, Mac who starts off quite laid back and eventually goes mad, Blain who utters the best one-liners and carries a bleeding mini gun around(!), Billy the tracker who is just out-there and knows something's wrong from the off, Poncho who speaks Spanish and wields a grenade launcher and Hawkins who reads comics, works the radio and tells dirty jokes.Finally, the score needs mentioning as this is one of the most atmospheric soundtracks ever and adds to the films pounding tension. As soon as we enter the jungle, the music spells doom for all with subtle tones that soon explode to life. Considering how much hiking through jungle there is (and yeah, the locations people should be noted as well because this is some truly bad-ass bush), it's surprising we don't feel it because the whole time Alan Silvestri keeps us entertained with the film's classic theme tune.Spawning a decent sequel and countless other media, it goes to show the power of Predator. It all started here, when it was just considered an alien-ripoff but has since shrugged off those roots and claimed it's own slice of history. Everyone involved in the film has contributed something - it's as though their careers have all peaked at the same time and met up on this film. The result is just quality; remarkable, memorable and exhilarating.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An excellent Schwarzenegger classic that still attracts viewers and keeps people thrilled,"Predator is definitely one of the best alien thrillers ever made. It is one of my personal favorite movies. When I first saw just a brief part of Predator when I was about five, I was freaked out and scared to even watch the movie for many ages, but eventually, once getting older, came to like it. The Predator, played by Kevin Peter Hall, is a very realistic and believable creature for the 1980s, when this movie was created. I like how humanlike its form is, and how un-humanlike it is at the same time. The creature's four mandibles were a great idea for its distinct facial characteristics and the creature's roar is awesome, one of the best ever produced. This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Richard Chaves, Elipidi Carillo, Shane Black, and Sonny Landham and they are all believable in their roles and even add to the humor that this movie has. This is obviously the best of the Predator movies and still one of the most highly liked thrillers today. And let's all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall, who died a year after he had made Predator 2.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sci-fi classic,"One of the classic sci-fi movies and one of the most entertaining action movies ever made. Certainly one of the best Arnold movies, along with Terminator 1 and 2. Mix a simple but effective story, one cool alien, well directed action scenes, Arnold kicking ass and you get an top notch action movie. Sure, there are some exaggerated macho performances, but John knows how to do it with style.So if you're a young (but not too young) movie viewer who haven't yet seen Predator, be sure to do so to get a sample of action 80's style with Arnold at his peak.Rating: 8/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very Good Sci-Fi actioner,"One of Arnold´s best movies. Here he plays the leader for an elite army-unit who is given a mission to rescue south-american officials from left-wing terrorists in a south-american jungle. On their way to the terrorist compound one of the men sense something in the trees and they discover skinned corpses. What they don´t know is that an invisible alien creature is pursuing them. It has come to earth just to hunt for sport and Arnolds group makes a perfect target. The team reaches the terrorist´s camp and levels it to the ground in a very well filmed action-sequence. However they don´t manage to save the officials. When they return to rendez-vouz with the helicopter they are being hunted of the Predator who picks them off one by one. The Predator is a very well done film which catches you from the start. The location-filming is brilliant and so is the casting of tough characters in Arnolds team. I´m specially fond of Jesse Ventura. The script is un-pretentious and straight told. The monster is a kind of Rambo-Alien. Very awesome and very intelligent with the seven foot Kevin Peter Hall in the monster make-up. As always in Arnold´s films, the action scenes are of highest class. I consider this a winner and ranks it: 7 of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Very, very tense and murderously suspenseful","First of all, if you haven't seen this action, suspense and violence extravaganza, you most certainly are not a true action movie afficionado. The immediate grabbing feature of this movie is its score, very imaginatively composed and created by Alan Silvestri whose other credits include the Back to the Future series and other gems like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The tempo and build up which the score lends to the film engage its viewers with feelings of fear and nerve wracking suspense for what lurks within the thick of the forest.  Take note of Sonny Landham's comment;""there's something out there,and it ain't no man.The action is fast, furious and merciless. The commandos are killed off one by one, leaving Arnie, Carl Weathers and the surviving members extremely terrified and on the verge of breaking down.  Note the heated arguments that some of the commandos get into with each other.  There is very animated and fiery action in the beginning (assault on the terrorist camp) but as we are introduced to the true terror of the jungle (or should I say, outer space), the action takes a turn for the more insane eg.Arnie running away armed only with a knife and trembling in fear, almost drowning in a waterfall and thereafter, continually pursued by the Predator).   All this followed by a half hour long jungle battle mano a mano with spears, rocks and fists and hall deafening yells by both warriors.  Very, very fierce and macho stuff I assure you all.I shall not go into the other intricacies of the film and will leave it to the curiosity of potential/virgin viewers to find out for themselves. ""Predator"" is essentially one of the few action movies that truly lives up to its name and delivers the thrills and spills in no small amount and at breakneck speed.  True connoisseurs of hard action.....YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!! 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Lean, Mean Action With Arnold","Watching `Predator', which is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action movies, it becomes obvious why Arnold's recent return to action (`End of Days', `The Sixth Day) have all tanked at the box office.  For some reason, Arnold's chosen to play men with a dark past in his recent films, men with a complex background . . . men with laughably bad backstories.  His great characters - such as Dutch Schaeffer in `Predator' - have no background. It's not necessary.  The second Arnold steps onscreen, you know it's time for blood and bullets, plain and simple.  Not every moviegoers' cup of tea, to be sure, but it works.  Unlike `End of Days' or `The Sixth Day', classic Schwarzenegger action films like `Predator' never insult the audience by attempting to explain the often threadbare plot.  Predator is kind of a Zen-philosophy action film - the violence and cheesy one-liners just happen.`Predator' is a fairly simple story; it's essentially a sci-fi version of `The Most Dangerous Game.'  A group of American soldiers, led by Dutch (Schwarzenegger) and his rival Dillon (Carl Weathers), lead a full-blown assault on a group of South American revolutionaries.  Carnage ensues. After wiping out said revolutionaries, an alien creature armed to the teeth with high-powered weaponry - the Predator - assaults the American soldiers. More carnage ensues.Hey, it's not exactly Shakespeare, but thoughtful, well-written action movies aren't exactly common.  `Predator' works as an action movie - and as a darn good one - because it's kept simple (thus minimizing the plot holes and the head-scratching moments), it maintains a high level of excitement, action, and tension, and it's cool.  Schwarzenegger is larger than life as Dutch, pure swaggering testosterone at its best.  Jesse `The Body' rules as Blaine, Carl Weathers is icily cool as Dillon. . . and so on and so on. Enough sarcastic, macho one-liners and brutal firepower fill the movie to make it a male adolescent snapshot of tough-guy heaven.  The Predator looks wicked as well - Stan Winston outdid himself, as the Predator does look and move like a vicious being from another world, and not just some stunt guy in a rubber suit.  The direction by John McTiernan adds the final piece to the puzzle; the cinematography of the jungle is appropriately hot, steamy, and claustrophobic, and the quick pacing of the film moves rapid fire between all-out action and the tension of hunting one's prey . . . or being hunted. Everything adds up to a simple, streamlined, first-rate action movie.Again, not the most intelligent film ever made, but `Predator' is still quite good - it's probably Schwarzenegger's best pure action movie.  (Not his best movie overall, though; that honor belongs to the excellent `Kindergarten Cop'.)  `Predator' is a lean, mean, intense action flick from start to finish.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It Hunts For Pleasure, It Kills For Sport...................","""Predator"" is a genuine Classic. Action, Horror, Sci-Fi it's all there. Lets see for starters we have Arnold Schwarzenegger, on top form riding to the peak of his action status, leading a team of tough Commandos. Made up of a great cast including Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura and Bill Duke. They're on a mission to rescue Hostages from Gorilla forces but are double crossed by the C.I.A, stop there and you already have a great action movie.But oh no, this film also has an Intergalactic Alien Big Game hunter equipped with plasma cannons, Stealth Invisibility and Thermal Vision. It would be so easy to imagine this film going nowhere if it where to have fallen into the wrong hands. You could really imagine a plot of an Alien hunting Commandos in the jungle coming off a bit lame but no, Fox thankfully had faith and McTierman had a vision. Fox's faith may have been down to there two previous unexpected big hits ""Aliens"" and ""Commando"" which you could possibly say this film is a hybrid of.Film also benefits from being made in that 80s early 90s era where your action film could take its self seriously yet still not too seriously. One minute we see a fairly realistic use of of weapons and tactics the next Arnie throws a truck down a hill equipped with C4 and Jesse Ventura pulls out his M-134 Mini Gun and shreds some Gorillas.The Predator it's self is a classic design, thanks to the genius Stan Winston, and in my opinion never looked better than in this movie. It looked slightly fake in Pred 2(Not a bad film too) and don't get me started on the travesty that is AvP. It could have been a different story if they had stuck to the big rubber turtle they had shot scenes with thank god Arnold himself suggested Winston.I won't spoil the plot for anyone who's not yet seen it I just urge you to see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Still Fun,"The very definition of '80's action cinema, there are of course things about this that haven't aged well, especially when you rewatch this in the light of the excellent Prey. But John McTiernan knew what he was about, and it's still efficient, fun and doesn't mess around. It's inventively staged and I'd forgotten that there are lines in this which were the literal inspiration for the execrable The Expendables films. It's hard not to smile, though, and throw back to a simpler time in my life whilst doing so. I'm not a fan of the way slow-motion is used, and I don't think there's been many films more in love with guns than this. But try telling 15-year old me that.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Underwhelming,"Looks like the only people inspired enough to comment on this movie are the people who love it, so I guess I'll be the voice of dissent-- I watched this for the first time after seeing the entire Alien series, as a way to prep for Alien vs Predator. I didn't expect much, especially after seeing the trailer, but I was surprised by how BORING this film is. The characters are completely two dimensional caricatures/stereotypes with no development whatsoever, the plot drags along, the only ""action"" is lots of shooting and marching around in the jungle, and the Predator doesn't even show up until an hour into the film. The lines are cliché and there isn't an ounce of tension or investment into the characters--by the time the first twenty minutes were over, I was actually waiting (eagerly) for them to be killed.If you're into clichés, this movie is for you. If you'd prefer something with a bit more depth, stick with Alien (the original, NOT the sequel).",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made.,"""Predator"" is a exciting action/horror film of 1987. ""Predator"" has a great plot to it, which is a group of United States army fighters are sent to a place to retrieve some hostages, later to find out that a ""Predator"" is after them one-by-one. The story is great except for a few things that don't make sense, these are toward's the film's climax. The acting in ""Predator"" is superb, ""Arnold Schwarzenegger"" as always puts 100% into his roles. ""Carl Weathers"" is perfect in this film as well. The music in ""Predator"" is perfect, it's very suspenseful and fits in perfectly with the scenes. The film is shot great, the camera man did a great job filming this movie. For a film that was made in 1987, ""Predator"" has special effects that still look realistic to this day. I highly recommend you watch ""Predator"" as it is a superb and exciting action/horror film of 1987.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Welcome to the jungle, baby","Consider that so many of the roles that Arnold Schwarzenegger takes on are so similar, including Predator, and yet this film is so much better than most of the others. I enjoy watching his movies just because he's such a watch-able guy, even in his bad movies (which are many), but I think the thing that really makes Predator stand out is its simplicity. The movie starts, the guys get dropped in the jungle, lots of blood and carnage flies across the screen, and the movie simply ends. No romance, no complex back story, no soldier struggling with problems in his past or even trauma caused by the horrible things he experiences during the movie. This is one of the things that made First Blood so good. It may turn out to be a movie about a lot of muscle-bound meatheads in the woods, but it doesn't insult the audience or try to apply complexity to a story that can't support it.Interestingly, the movie features two eventual governors. Jesse Ventura even wrote a book which was released while he was the governor of Minnesota and he used his favorite line in this movie as the title. And the book's actually pretty interesting; there are some funny stories in it about things that went on while they were filming this movie. Arnold, on the other hand, is actually (and thankfully) given a relatively small amount of stupid one-liners, which are an idiotic byproduct of hard action movies that I've never really understood the necessity for. They don't reveal anything about the characters who say them, they don't add to the story or further the plot, and with rare exceptions, they're not funny. But I guess comic relief has to come from somewhere, and since complexity is not a requisite for movies like this, I can't really expect a lot of thought being put into the comedic content either.I watched Predator having never seen it from beginning to end and having just re-watched the original Alien. I am currently in the process of re-watching both series', for obvious reasons. One thing that I notice about both of them is the way they take their time in introducing the enemies which, in both films, are aliens. Predator doesn't waste much time dwelling on the origin of the alien, we pretty much assume it came from a space ship that flashed across the screen at the opening of the movie. Alien, on the other hand, went into remarkable detail about where its alien came from. What Predator does do, very effectively, I think, is that it has the guys fighting some very human enemies, which allows the movie to later take its sweet time in having them realize that the new enemy is not human at all. This is also, incidentally, weakly rehashed in the sequel, using the secrecy of this mission and team as an excuse to have more guys who don't know what's going on.The death scenes are actually pretty tasteful, given the genre. They are just gory enough to illustrate the violence of the enemy without being gratuitous. Just enough is shown to show how vicious the alien is, and there are some strange things done to and with the bodies that make you wonder about the alien's intentions or needs. The first deaths suggest vengeance if not some sort of ritual, but later ones suggest that the alien may be feeding off of his (or her) victims. Oddly enough, it is not until the awful Predator 2 that we learn that it kills for sport.Yes, the movie occasionally gets embarrassingly macho, but the skill with which it is put together far overshadows any tough-guy goofiness. Consider, for example, the ease with which the movie switches from showing the guys hunting the alien to their realization that they are the ones being hunted. In some cases, this transition takes place during a single shot and with virtually no movement in the shot at all except a change in someone's expression. It is truly a fight between a group of predators, which we understand because they are human like us, and a single predator whose powers and weaknesses are unknown. It's not Oscar material, needless to say, but it's a great action movie in part because it already knows that.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ball busting Vietnam allegory McTiernan style delivers wholesale.,"I will start this by giving my ratings, yes plural because to me as a sci-fi/action film fan the film has few peers, it is 100% pure suspense testo explosive fun that along side John McTiernan's other action template Die Hard, stands the test of time to the point that it will be thrilling viewers long after we have left this earth. So with that I give it a personal rating of 10/10, it's faultless for my needs in a genre I indulge and lose myself in on a frequent roster. For any other movie fan aware of the genre's traits and peccadilloes without being a fan of sorts, then I rate the film easily at 7 or 8 out of 10, what's not to like here?The film is without a shadow of a doubt another allegory of Vietnam, a crack unit of soldiers are stuck in a central American jungle being killed off by an invisible enemy, the soldiers are there after being lied to by the powers that be, tactics are paramount but the enemy that stalks them holds all the aces. This crack special rescue team are a testosterone fuelled band of beef, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Sonny Landham, Bill Duke & Jesse Ventura, these five alone have a combined muscle weight heavy enough to have sunk the Titanic, and McTiernan uses the beefcakes to the max in a series of joyous ball busting sequences.The dialogue is sharp and funny with Schwarzenegger quipping his way thru the first reel, and the score from Alan Silvestri pumps the blood at just the right time, whilst the effects crew have done sterling work to bring this ""hardest man in the world versus bad ass alien predator"" to life, none more so than when viewing POV heat seeking infa-red shots as our deadly alien killer. The end throws up some interesting thoughts, that have for better or worse? Been fleshed out with further films involving the predator of the title, but one should judge this film as a single entry because it sits at the top of the tree as one of the best of it's kind; so truly this is a benchmark for the genre that will take some beating as far as I'm concerned.Enjoy 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the most effortlessly enjoyable action movies of the 80s,"31 years after its original release, it's hard to believe that there was once a time when John McTiernan's Predator wasn't revered as one of the best action movies of the modern era. Critics savaged the film, although now even the stuffiest of critics cannot deny its shamelessly muscly, bullet-spraying, blood-spattering charm. Predator is now held in as equally high regard as McTiernan's other action classic Die Hard - released the following year - and featured Arnold Schwarzenegger at the very top of his game. This was long before the Austrian hulk made a swerve into politics and became the self-parody he is today. The premise is almost offensively simple, but the execution makes this one of the most effortlessly enjoyable action movies of the 1980s. McTiernan knows exactly how to tear a jungle apart with gunfire, and set up his disposable supporting characters for a grisly death.Special Forces major Dutch Schaefer (Schwarzenegger) is ""choppahed"" into South America, where is he given a mission to rescue an official who has fallen into the hands of some insurgents. Schaefer and his team - played by Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Sonny Landham, Richard Chaves and Shane Black - are met by Schaefer's old Army buddy Dillon (Carl Weathers), and the two greet each other in the most 80s way possible by flexing their oiled and oversized muscles in a manly handshake. As the team venture further into the jungle, it becomes clear that Dillon isn't telling the whole story, and the mission becomes even more difficult when they capture a female hostage named Anna (Elpidia Carrillo). Yet this is far from their biggest problem, as on their tail is an alien with the ability to camouflage itself and see with thermal imaging, backed by an arsenal of powerful extra-terrestrial gadgets and a healthy appetite for the hunt. With the group being picked off one by one by this formidable enemy, Schaefer must get to the extraction point before he becomes another skull in the beast's growing collection of trophies.The plot can be compared to countless B-movies throughout the years, but what worked for Alien also works for Predator. Take a simple premise, add some budget, bind it together with some good old-fashioned decent film-making, and the result is a timeless classic. Yes, the special effects have dated and most of the actors' stars have somewhat dimmed in the decades since, but Predator is even more of a blast now than it was when I stole my brother's VHS twenty-odd years ago. The sequels, spin-offs and comic-books have gone to great length to explain and develop the Predator's mythology, but McTiernan simply lets the monster do its thing. Played by the 7 ft 2 in Kevin Peter Hall, the Predator's formidable armour, weaponry, stealth and sheer repulsiveness has made it a sci-fi/horror icon. Like the Alien franchise, subsequent movies have felt the need to explain the creature's backstory, damaging their otherworldly mystery in the process, but Predator simply throws him into the mix and lets him loose on our world's finest warriors. With star Shane Black's reboot The Predator set to arrive shortly, now is the perfect time to revisit what drew audiences to the series in the first place, in spite of how your attitude may have soured after those terrible Alien cross-overs and the forgettable third entry from 2010.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Predator (1987) Fantastic Classic,"Predator is certainly a film that marked the end of the 80s and even today impresses with its visuals. The antagonist's look is so striking and well done that many other monsters created today do not surpass him. Its look is grotesque and frightening, commanding great respect. The way the scenario is used is very interesting, since it matches the way the monster acts. The scenes where we are placed in the Predator's vision and we don't know what he looks like are perfect. It's amazing how the film builds him up without even showing his face. It's fun, it's charming and still manages to be scary for the look, this movie is still very good today.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Mindless Entertainment,"This film has no depth. In fact there isn't any depth to virtually any of the characters. Sure it has great effects for it's time but besides thousands of bullets being shot everywhere, the characters don't have much to them. I understand that this predator concept is cool, and possibly before it's time. But the execution is lazy and just another throw away Schwarzenegger film.I enjoy Schwarzenegger in basically everything he does, because of the incredible amount of charisma he brings to the screen. And its because of his last 25 minutes with the Predator that this movie even gets a 4. To me the film is unwatchable with the other characters on screen. Not only are they cliché, but none of them even seem real. You can tell each of them are just acting, even Carl Weathers.Once again with these monster/alien movies, you have to wait until basically the half way point to even see the Alien. I know that it's suppose to build up the suspense but look at the Dark Knight for example. The Joker is on screen before Batman or Bruce Wayne is. In my opinion you get us all thrilled in one of the opening scenes with the bad guy, show us his skills, and then throughout the whole movie we are wondering what the next thing he/she will do. That way the build up doesn't beat the reward. The Predator looks stupid, and it's easily a man with a mask. So I don't think this is an all time Sci-Fi classic, but at least some entertainment can be found with Arnold in the last 20 minutes or so.+end+Every Arnold scene-Lazy characters, no depth-stop trying to build up the Alien/Monster reveal-Predator is just a man in a suit with a mask4.9/10",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Science Fiction Perfection,"I was 12 when I first saw Predator and it has been a firm sci-fi favorite ingrained in my psyche ever since. Predator, now 23 years old, hasn't aged and still feels current - if you can excuse the 80's testosterone. It just goes to show that expensive CGI is no match for a good story with a colourful and competent cast.The story follows Dutch (Schwarzenegger) the leader of a specialized group of bad-ass soldiers who run rescue missions in areas Chuck Norris would be scared to go. He is duped into a supposed rescue mission in South America by an old college, Dillon (Carl Weathers) who now works for the CIA.Once in the Jungle, Dillon's true reason for using Dutch becomes apparent when the team comes across the mutilated remains of a previous special ops team sent in by Dillon. The team is not there to rescue anyone, but stop an arms deal. Someone begins picking off the team one by one and and to quote Billy (Sonny Landham) who provides the spiritual insight ""There is something out there, and it ain't no man"". The action begins...Alien hunters on safari, CIA operatives, professional black ops soldiers, South American rebels and a whole lot of hot steamy jungle in the mix and you have one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made.The 80's style testosterone fueled acting gives great insight into the period and muscle-bound cast perform well and this must be Arnie's finest performance. Thankfully there isn't much of the of cheesy 80's dialog, like that painfully delivered by Bill Paxton in Aliens and Predator 2.Like Ridley Scott's Alien, the franchise has only gone downhill since and fans have eagerly been waiting for Robert Rodriguez and Nimród Antal to restore the franchise to it's former glory with the release of Predators.A timeless classic and sci-fi masterpiece. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Everything a sci-fi/action fan could ever want.,"With the release of Alien Vs Predator i decided to watch the original Predator movie today. I've seen Predator many many times since i first watched it back in 1989 and i love it each and every time. I think Predator 2 has a slight edge over this but Predator has a slight edge over Aliens BUT i think they are all extremely excellent films.Just in case you don't know, it's about a big alien whose race lives to hunt worthy prey and Arnold Schwarzenegger's team of commandos are that such prey. The commandos are sent into a South American jungle to find some missing airmen who are being held by guerrilla's. They do what they got to do which attracts the attention of the predator who is hunting in the area. So the predator goes and hunts the commandos with the aid of his kick ass weapons and cloaking device. The commandos also have a female prisoner.I think the whole sub-plot about the so called missing airmen isn't too important to the viewer but makes it possible for the commandos to be there. The entire concept of Predator is really clever and it certainly made me sit on the edge of my seat while watching it the first time. It is kind of spooky in a terrifying way as we don't see the predator properly for ages but see through his eyes which adds to the tension.The effects are great, the acting is OK and the story is cool too. I really like the music and especially the spooky twisted jungle sounds that we hear when we see through the eyes of the predator. This is a sci-fi action movie that isn't just full of cheap explosions. It really does have great atmosphere. Everyone who likes sci-fi and/or action movies should like this. If you don't then your taste in movies suck! This in my humble opinion is probably the second best sci-fi movie of all time.Alien Vs Predator has little of what made this so excellent so if you haven't seen Predator and thought AVP sucked don't think that this will. Predator is absolutely fantastic viewing. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Pushing too many pencils! Best film ever!,"If I had to recommend one film to a stranger, it would have to be Predator. It has some of the best acting, directing, effects and sound-track ever produced.>This is Arnold's best acting roll in his career. But, we must not forget every other actor who produced spine-tingling performances! >The effects are simple, yet will last the test of time >The weaponry is huge! And will remain huge in my heart!If you like 'war type' action you should love this. From the title screen the action begins, and does not end until the credits.The sheer brute force of the story leaves one feeling truly satisfied, and even spiritually fulfilled by the end.Without Predator my life would be incomplete.

Welcome to the jungle...,"Being a 12 year old back in 1987 and loving action movies, then ""Predator"" was a movie that was hard to miss, especially since Arnold Schwarzenegger was really one of the biggest action hero names back then.Who isn't familiar with the ""Predator"" franchise by now? And if you are not familiar with it, seriously? Where have you been since 1987? The whole ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" franchise and universe is just great, be it in movie, game, comic book format or any other possible format.The storyline in the 1987 classic action Sci-Fi is a group of commandos are brought into the Central American jungle in order to find and retrieve the personnel of a downed helicopter. But it is not just the heat and the jungle that is a threat to the commandos; they find themselves being hunted by a deadly extraterrestrial hunter.The ensemble of actors in the movie was quite good for an action Sci-Fi movie, and people were well-cast. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers really carried the movie quite well. And there was a great line up of support actors as well. And lets not forget the memorable predator itself, portrayed by Kevin Peter Hall.There is a really good mood to the movie, and you feel like you are right there in the humid, dense jungle with the commandos and having to look over your shoulder all the time because of the predator.For a late 1980's action Sci-Fi movie, then the entire movie is just crawling with one-liners, and of course the most epic of all being Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""get to the chopper"".The effects in ""Predator"" were quite good and did help the movie along quite nicely. Special effects and creature effects are essential to a movie such as ""Predator"", and the special effects team really outdid themselves with this movie. I love the design of the predator, it is just a timeless piece of work.""Predator"" is an action Sci-Fi movie that you can watch again and again.

I Found It Tedious,"There are guns and other weapons a-blazing in this sci-fi ""thriller"" about an alien creature who's single-handedly wiping out an elite military team sent into the jungles of Central America to rescue some hostages. With all that, it sounds strange, but I found this tedious viewing all the way through. To me, it's most noteworthy for having two future US Governors in the cast. Jesse Ventura (future governor of Minnesota) played a small part, and Arnold Schwarzenegger (future governor of California) was the star. The story itself was repetitious all the way through, a traipse through the jungle while being stalked by a monster and the dialogue (as one might expect with this kind of movie) was weak. Schwarzenegger really was called upon to do very little except look tough - which, admittedly, he does well, and I wondered (as any thinking person would do) why the creature didn't just kill Dutch (Schwarzenegger) when it had him by the throat pinned against the tree? I suppose because that would have taken away the chance to have the really cool ending with a huge explosion and then Arnold standing victoriously in a macho pose as he looks around at the carnage. Tedious sums up all I need to say about this from my perspective.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Great Action Film,"Back in a time when the term ""popcorn movies"" actually meant something, Predator stands out especially today, mostly due to its high quality writting and top notch action.  This movie never gets boring, as we watch the characters interact with each other, it brings to mind the feeling I got when watching the Marines from Aliens; a great feeling of comradary and gruff friendship.  The special effects, while dated, in my humble opinion look better then the snazzy ""futuristic"" effects we are seeing today.  The Govenator is perfect for the lead role in this film, he commands a certain respect both from the characters and audience alike.The title character of the film is still cool and frightening by todays standards.  The filmakers knew how to use the Predator makeup, they shadow it in as much darkness as possible, cover it in mudd and grime, which hides what could have been very obvious makeup ""guy in a suit"" effects.  The guy who plays Predator did everything he could to add some life to the creature, to make people think he could stand up against Arnold in the end.  Its really alot of fun to watch the Predator hunt these hapless soldiers, when just a while ago they were kicking ass everywhere they went.As we watch the downfall of summer ""popcorn"" movies, its good to know we can still go back and watch something great like this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Deserves a higher score...,7.8? Seriously? Predator is a masterpiece. It's in my top five of the best movies ever made. I recall watching it for the first time when I was very young and my brother trying to convince me that glow in the dark stuff was made out of Predators blood. I fell for it.I've watched this movie more times than I can recall. Each time is like watching it for the first time. It's epic. Atmospheric. Engaging. Enthralling. Everything about it is just perfection.There was no-one better for the title role than Arnie. He really makes this movie whilst being supported by his fellow cast.I'll always cherish the helicopter scene and Long Tall Sally.Get to the chopper indeed folks.....,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A B-movie creature feature given the A treatment by a great action director,"A team of commandos are sent into a central American jungle to extradite US airmen that are being held by terrorists.  During the rescue attempt the airmen and the terrorists are killed and the commandos being to return to their pickup location.  However as they travel back across the jungle they are picked off one by one by an unseen assassin.  With his teams' numbers dwindling, Dutch decides to take a stand.This ranks as one of Schwarzenegger's best films, mainly because he doesn't ham up the one-liners etc and just plays it straight.  The story is pretty straight forward.  Once the issue of the airmen rescue is forgotten it is a straight hunt or be hunted affair.  The film manages to create a great sense of tension by not revealing the predator until near the end, this means we, like the commandos, are not quite sure what's doing the hunting.  If the tension was so good then this could have been a slasher style film with each character being bumped off in a series of gory ways.  However McTiernan makes sure that it never feels that basic.The action is good throughout.  But the film benefits from a strong male cast - not great actors but they all fit the parts well.  Schwarzenegger isn't wearing his star power on his sleeve like he does in other films and is good here.  The rest of the cast are filled out by what could be kindly described as B list stars (except maybe Bill Duke), but Carl Weathers and ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura do well.Overall this is a B movie creature feature, but it's carried out with such style and aplomb that it's hugely enjoyable throughout.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pure Escapism,"Yeah, I know this is a low-grade simple story, one of those action flicks that oozes with too much testosterone.....but so what.? Every once in a while, it's a nice release to sit back and get lost in a scary movie set in the jungle. I don't know anyone who ever dozed asleep watching this, so it's not all bad. It's actually a fun movie.Despite the moronic and unlikeable characters who uttered some stupid dialog, the movie gets you very involved and is one of the better pure-action movies I've ever seen. The jungle scenery is outstanding to view on DVD. This is a pretty movie for such low-grade material, story-wise. I watched it a second time just for the visuals.The ending, with Arnold Schwarzenegger battling the alien, goes on too long. Had this film been cut to 80 minutes, it would have much better. Still, if you want a fairly short movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat with great suspense, without having to tax your braincells, this is highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great, underrated action film","Some will tell you ""Predator"" is another dumb '80s action flick. It's not. It's very different from anything else Arnold Schwarzenegger has starred in. First of all it begins as a standard Military war film, setting up the plot for about 45 minutes! It then morphs into a suspense-thriller/sci-fi film: Like some sort of Agatha Christie novel meeting ""Rambo"" via ""Aliens."" It's quite intelligent and thrilling, not revealing the Predator creature fully until the very end. Part of the reason this film works, and the sequel does not (as successfully anyway), is the level of suspense and mystery surrounding the Predator.Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers one of his best performances as Dutch. Granted, he isn't required to do much more than shed his upper-body clothing and look ripped, but he _does_ do more than that - I felt sympathy for Dutch, he seemed like a realistic character, and I forgot that I was watching Arnold Schwarzenegger. He has a few good one-liners (""Stick around!"" being the cream of the crop along with ""Knock knock!"") but especially later in the film, his confidence stumbles and he turns into the flip-side of the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger action hero.The sequel worked as a comic-book-style creature feature but the original ""Predator"" is a much better film than most people give it credit for, being the rare smart action film that is solidly constructed and worth watching far more than just once.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Baby, you got a stew going","By strange coincidence this slid into my eyes just days before the great Weathers bicep-handshaked his way into the deep beyond. I saw fabled foundational Pred many decades ago but was struck on a more modern viewing by how gloriously straightforward it is to start and how compelling it's brawntacular ensemble is despite the unquavering silliness of the action premise. By the time we get down to Arnie v the beast though, a stealthy bagginess creeps into the structure of the film and the momentum trips up considerably. Quite rightly the strongest part of this very muscular work remains the work of the Winston workshop.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Well done action/ scifi/ horror hybrid,"Quite a different role for Schwartzenegger here, he is not the focal point of this action/ sci-fi/ horror hybrid. Film initially doesn't favour any one character over another. All six men have nearly equal presence felt in the first half, as they find themselves hunted by unknown individuals in a Central American wilderness. Their number is slowly whittled down, one by one, as is their arms and weaponry, by an unseen enemy using the jungle as camouflage, using the treetops to move undetected. When revealed, the most formidable enemy is an eight-foot tall alien, trophy hunting on Earth. In the final act, Schwartzenegger is left alone to ... face the creature, or to run from it? Kill it, or escape from it, if that's even possible?One of the most memorable villains ever put on film, in a clever and unique, original story, mixing several genres quite well together.Clever joke at the end, after we've heard the Predator mimicking or repeating a couple lines of dialogue spoken by Schwartzenegger and his men during the film, Ahnuld takes one last look at the fatally(?) injured Predator and says, ""What the hell are you?"", only to hear the Predator immediately throw those exact same words back at Ahnuld. I've always thought that was just the Predator mimicking the sounds coming from his potential prey, without even comprehending language and what those sounds and words meant.But, could the Predator ever have been killed, if it had not basically committed suicide by blast? Or was there nothing on Earth which could ever have stopped it?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Totally overrated in retrospect.,"Looking back at this film, it is obvious now that it is just another campy sack of garabaggio!! Ok first of all, it is an '80's action movie, so of course you're gonna have Arnold, Sonny Landham, Jessie Ventura, that Sven Thurston guy who's in all Arnold movies, Chubbs Peterson - the only person missing is Rae Dawn Chong, right? Anyway, so the special effects are cheesy at best. The absolute worst thing about this movie is the music!! The music just grinds against your ears in the worst way. It isn't suspenseful, it makes you wonder when it will all end!! Another thing is that the violence is really just gratuitous and made me uncomfortable. The Predator is sufficiently menacing. The only really tying force for this movie, as in Predator 2, is the interaction of the characters and how their losses affect them. This was a particularly binding force for this movie. Another funny thing were the joke-telling scenes, where a character shares some very adult jokes to his buddy!!! The mission scene was no good, even by '80s standards!!! No Special Forces (sic) teams that I know have a guy carrying a helicopter mounted gatling gun. It would be near impossible to handle. (BTW - they weren't special 'forces', they were Special Ops, there's a huge difference in reality. Spec. Ops do really hard tactical missions like rescues and sabotage and assassinations; Special Forces were the pussies who tried to teach the ARVN to fight in Vietnam, and we all know that ended well!!!). The end fight might be the worst of all. There's no way Arnold could have taken those grenade launchers apart and used them in the arrows - they would not explode without a primer and after you tear them apart they are no good!! Also, for a guy like him, even though he IS Arnold, still could not have made such an elaborate labyrinth of traps during his last stand fight. I thought Predator 2 was about 20x better, it was much more menacing, much more dramatic. I know alot of people will disagree with me, but I like it better.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
In a time of practical effects,"""Predator"" is one of the classics of the 80s, a film that knows how to command action scenes and enhance its characters, with a great art direction and incredible makeup, full of sensational practical effects the film still has a lot of fun, its script engages and his mysterious first act still works very well. And of course, we have problems, many plots are created and simply forgotten, unbelievable situations and a text formed by phrases of effect, but that still sound much more natural than in the ""new predator"". ""Predator"" is still a very fun movie, in addition to being a classic Schwarzenegger (which actually does very well in the movie). Grade 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An 80s classic,"As a child, I loved Predator. I thought it was fun, likable and efficient above other things. I revisited it again some time ago again, and was waiting for the opportunity to say that it has quickly become a favourite of mine. As far as John McTiernan's movies go, I think Die Hard is his best movie but Predator is for me definitely up there with his best. It is everything I thought it to be as a child and more.The action is exhilarating and kept at a snappy pace with enough suspense to thrill, while the special effects are truly excellent, they are memorable, look great and enhance rather than distract. The characterisation is also good, the story is gripping, Alan Silvestri's score is terrific, the pace is snappy, McTiernan's direction is efficient and the dialogue is quotable. The acting I have no problems with either, Arnold Schwarznegger gives one of his most charismatic, efficient and likable performances here.Overall, a great film and a classic of its decade. It may be a little too long perhaps, but it is great fun and works on all levels. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Greatest Action Film Ever Made,"This film for me ranks as Arnold's best. The main reason is due to the excellent directing from John McTiernan. Not a single shot is wasted. I love the way he uses different camera angles and frames, to create an intense, claustrophobic environment. A lesser director might have been hamstrung by the relatively low budget and limited jungle set. But he only adds to it. He also gets a career best perfomance from Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is entirely credible, convincing and vulnerable as Major Dutch Schaeffer. The pacing of this film is always on point. And it contains a brilliant score from Alan Silvestri. But the greatest creation is the Predator. What an amazing creature creation
from Stan Winston. His creatures in Aliens were amazing but I think he has done one better here. I dont Schwarzenegger has ever been upstaged by a character with more screen presence, except by this awesome seven foot tall alien being!Countless films have tried to imitate this film from it's own sequels to the Expendables but no film has since come close. The special effects are also well ahead of it's time and even better then the video game like CGI of current day.This film is a masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A true classic,Arnold Schwarzenegger portraits his character as a macho marine perfectly in this movie and his costars that range from his fellow marines to the antagonist of the movie do the same. This movie encapsulated me from the beginning and only got better over time. Using the CGI that was available at the time they created a very memorable antagonist that strikes fear in to watchers and makes you glad that they are not real or that we haven't encountered them yet. In reality this film is an amazing 80s movies and one of Arnold's best and to top it off it gave us the iconic bro arm clasp moment that has been memed for the last couple years.,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Up there with the greatest of 80s action movies !,"Schwarznegger movies in the 80's saw Arnie taking on allcomers - whether camp commandos, evil barbarians or the mafia no one stood a chance against his one liners and big guns. Since no bad guys on earth could stop him, in 1987 a logical choice was made- let Arnie do battle with an alien. The result is predator- one of the best action movies of the 80s.From the very beginning the machismo and hard boiled dialouge comes thick and fast and things escalate, getting more intense and action packed as the movie progresses. There's serious air of tension and mystery too as the script wisely keeps the predators appearance secret until the films thrilling climax.The well assembled cast (consisting of real life tough guys) play their bad ass roles brilliantly and Arnold schwarznegger handles his part with his unique charisma- he has a screen presence strong enough to hold the movie when every other character has been killed by the predator. And speaking of which, the titular predator looks awesome to this day- very few computer animated creatures can hold a candle to the human hunting extra terrestrial bad ass.Preadator is awesome- its a tough talking, exciting action packed thrill ride from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
RAMBO meets ALIEN.,"My Take: Flawed yet exciting variation of ALIEN crossed with RAMBO.I really love this sci-fi/action thriller, definitely one of this best of its kind(next to ""Alien"" and its sequel ""Aliens""). Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect for the role, the special-effects are awesome and Stan Winston's terrifically designed creature combine to make it an all-time favorite in the genre. Schwarzenegger leads a group of commandos in the Central American jungle, only to get hunted by an intelligent and cunning alien, with weapons unlike ours. The Predator should really astound inventors with its advance technology. The film also has much of the qualities of commando movies like ""Rambo:First Blood"" and sci-fi terror of ""Alien"" (hence my review title). Schwarzenegger uses much of the weapons he has, but he's still quite heroic like Stallone was in ""Rambo"". The Predator looks and acts quite like an ""Alien"" from the said 1979 film. Slick, unpredictable and fast. The sequel ""Predator 2"" is also good, but the showdown ""Alien vs. Predator"" is truly awful. But the original is still a great film, even on today's standards.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

One of the most testosterone-fuelled 1980s classics!,"Predator became an accidentally iconic movie because of the titular monster giving the movie a life of its own and soon becoming a franchise inseparable from Fox's own Alien. Both monsters came to be sci-fi-horror's defining icons on the big screen; and since 1979 for Alien, they BOTH still have the moniker of cinema's greatest 'space monsters'. And Predator showed that he could take on humanity's finest American soldiers in a tropical jungle, showing just how formidable this space hunter truly was!A lot of movies have great ideas but struggle to have an equally strong story complementing the concept; Predator was a case where the cliched 1980s action-adventure trappings played perfectly into the set up for the monster, and how he was eons ahead of the competition set before him.This film is just pure 1980s action cinema at its finest, and one of the most cleverly stealthy science-fiction films of all time. Predator lay the groundwork for a multimedia empire that's still wowing new fans today, and will continue to do so in the years to come.Predator gets 9/10 IMDbs. 4.5/5 stars. Great stuff indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"I realize more or less why it's loved, yet I cannot seem to get into this","Why, you ask? At least that's the question I assume is on your mind, since you decided to read this, instead of skipping it. I'm not entirely certain. Let me assure you, I am a fan of the creature. The same goes for Arnie(no, I wasn't calling *him* a... never mind). In fact, claiming that I am one of the director, as well, wouldn't be stretching it even a little. *And* I dig tension, horror and thrillers(not to mention the genre The Governator commonly stars in, and science fiction). So by all means, I should be of the same opinion about this as the majority seems to. Maybe I was spoiled by the first AvP game, and/or seeing the sequel to this. Perhaps I just don't buy McTiernan's attempts at suspense. It isn't impossible that it's how the first couple of scenes of this set it up to be the typical Schwarzenegger flick to such an extent that if it had been cut immediately after, it would simply be known as the shortest of such ever, with a few brief things that have nothing to do with the rest(you'll know them if you ever do view it, or have). In the end, I don't really know. Could be all, maybe only one, heck, doesn't have to be any of 'em. With that said... there are good things herein. Hall did very nice(R.I.P.). The acting is mostly great(with only a handful of exceptions), and the characters are cool. The special effects hold up fairly well, and there are some nice moments in them. Cinematography and editing tend to be quality stuff. Like Alien, this works well to introduce the title being. I recommend this to fans of the people involved in making it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
B-O-R-I-N-G!!,"1987's ""Predator"" is one of those ruthlessly sadistic movies that (as a cheap ploy to build suspense) doesn't clearly show this creature-in-question (in the plain light of day) until well into the story.And, I have to tell ya - When this particular ""predator"" does finally step out of its visual obscurity (with its wormy hair and its ""Porky Pig"" roadkill face) - I, literally, burst out laughing. I really did. (Ha! What a hoot!) Talk about anti-climatic!This utterly moronic-looking predator (with fingernails so long that it couldn't even manipulate its own high-tech gadgetry properly) was one of the most laughably cheesy creatures ever designed by famed make-up effects artist, Stan Winston.And, speaking about Predator's soundtrack music - Man-oh-man - It was so irritatingly loud far too often and it kept inexplicably building in intensity as a sorry attempt to hopefully create some much-needed suspense in this SyFy clunker.Oh, yeah - By the way - ""Predator"" stars the Austrian Oak (aka. Arnold ""What's-His-Name"").",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Outstanding sci fi horror,Arnie does a great job in this classic and outstanding science fiction horror film. Predator really pioneered the whole disaster film genre along with classics like Alien. It's a well-acted and suspenseful sci fi horror thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time.The special effects and cinematography are pretty good for the time. The writing is a bit uninspired but that's partly because the focus is on the horror/suspense moments. Arnie does a great job as always- his timing with his lines is perfection and he's clearly very well suited to action-packed films like this one.,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Crowning Achievement of 1980s Action,"In a word - awesome! On the surface this is the stereotypical 1980s action movie: an elite team of massive steakheads with even bigger guns goes on a covert mission to grease an army of communist guerrillas, but a bigger danger awaits! Just under the surface, however, is a script that's deceptively smart and wryly funny. The spare dialogue is eminently quotable and the effects still hold up. The pace is incredible: there's an efficiency to each scene that keeps things moving briskly without ever feeling rushed. Predator moves seamlessly from action to sci-fi to survival horror, all within the confines of an ostensibly simplistic plot.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

In a jungle. With guns blazing. Muscles flexing. Sweat dripping at a faster rate than the empty shell casings hitting the leach laden jungle floor. Okay thats an exaggeration. But you get the idea.Everybody in this movie is so flawlessly cast, you forget you are watching actors, so I'll just use the character names.

The best movie ever!,"Now how do I start out reviewing the best movie ever??? Predator is not just the best sci-fi movie ever, but the best movie ever.  It is Arnolds best movie.  I voted 10 on this because it really is a 10 movie.  It is more sci-fi then it is action.  With phenomonal special effects, it got screwed at the Oscars when Innerspace beat it for best special effects!  It is a must have movie!  It is the best Arnold movie ever by far.Predator is a story of  7 Special Forces troops out of the Delta Force recruited by the CIA to rescue hostages from the clutches of Central American Guerillas.  And once they rescue one hostage a woman named Anna played by Elpidia Carrillo, one by one Dutch's (Arnold Schwarzenegger)  men are hunted by an alien hunter called a Predator.

An Oddly Appealing Sci-Fi Horror Film,"What is it about this sci-fi horror film that's so appealing? All I know is that every time I come across it on cable, I almost have to stop what I'm doing and watch it.Governor Arnold leads a platoon of commandos into the jungle to face off against a malicious alien. There's your plot. It's an even more uber-macho version of the previous year's ""Aliens"", the only difference being the location and the particular characteristics of the alien. This one has dred locks and can make itself invisible -- all you can see is a sort of ripple in the air when it wants to make itself unseen. It picks off the platoon members one by one in increasingly grisly fashion, until Arnie flexes his pecs and nukes the place.To be followed by numerous sequels, none of which I've seen, and all of which I'm sure were unnecessary.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Rambo Meets Alien...Sort of,"Arnold Swarzenegger, the master of the one-liner, action sequences requiring huge budgets, and the acting skill of a dead snake, brings a rag-tag commando group into the South(or Central) American jungle to find a cabinet member.  At least that is the story told to him by superior officer(and another ""great"" actor) Carl Weathers.  The first half of the film(actually 40 some odd minutes) shows Arnold, Carl, and this crack commando group, which by the way is populated with the various stereotypical kind of guys like the nerdy guy with glasses making sexual jokes, the Indian that can smell danger before it happens, the rugged outdoors type(Jesse Ventura) with guts for brains, and so on)walking through the jungle, finding a group of men earlier sent in stripped to the skin, and then firing and capturing an enemy camp.  Okay...pretty boring up to here, but then things get interesting as the group plus one hostage girl are preyed upon by an alien hunter ala The Most Dangerous Game.  It seems the alien enjoys hunting for sport.  He is an impressive alien, and mucho credit goes to the genius of Stan Winston for its creation.  The alien has green, phospherescent blood, a surgical kit imbedded in its arm, and an ability to cloak itself and blend in with the jungle.  You know what is going to happen every step of the way, but the film is fun and entertaining if not taken too seriously.  Just don't look for great acting or some rich subtext here.  You won't find it.  Just some good old-fashioned man versus alien, good versus bad stuff here.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good nasty fun.,"""Apocalypse Now"" meets ""Alien"". ""Predator"" is now considered a sci-fi classic and is even mentioned in the same breath as the original ""Thing from Another World"" and it had, in director John McTiernan, a man who knew how to handle action on the screen. The plot could be written on a pinhead as Arnie leads his crack team of commandos into enemy territory on a rescue mission only to encounter another Stan Winston designed alien instead. It's gruesome and exciting in equal measure and it spawned several sequels but this is the one to go for it you like your thrills down and dirty as only McTiernan and Schwarzenegger can give them to you.

Generic action flick with a killer villain,"I actually find this to be a rather generic action movie and, if not for the Predator, I probably wouldn't even enjoy it. There's not a lot to this film other than big explosions and lots of shooting. Now, while that may be all there is, it is very well-done. It never lets up with the action and it's always entertaining. But the characters are paper-thin, the story is very weak, and the dialogue barely consists of more than grunts and yells. The Predator itself is an ingenious creation, though, and that's what makes this film good. All the amazing technology it possesses, combined with its monstrous exterior and angry demeanour - makes for a great movie creature. I love its laugh just as its about to self-destruct.

In fact, looking a some older critic reviews, that's how it was received when it was initially released. Only a number of years after later did this film start receiving such rave reviews, and I can't see why.Even for a so-called action film, there's too much waiting around, too much stumbling around in the jungle and not enough actually happening. There's nothing wrong with the action scenes, they are well made and some of the infra-red footage is cool, especially for its time.

The Predator....Right Up There With Alien,"Alright. Growing up, Muscle Men action stars were awesome! Stallone, Arnold, Dolph, Jean-Claude and so many more. I really can't remember what age I was when I saw this movie for the first time but when I did, I thought it was so super cool. Little did I know that this movie would become a major icon in the sci fi genre. These days everybody and their uncle knows what ""the predator creature"" is. They do. It is iconic. There is nothing like it. It can't be copied, or replicated. It is rock solid in movie history. Just like the xenomorph in Alien. But that is a different story line. Look this movie was so impressionable on me growing up. I wish I could give it 11 stars. They even have Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura in this movie and Carl Weathers too! It is the ultimate muscle man movie of the 80's. The predator creature is amazing! Its look, concept, and everything else about it is true sci fi all the way. If you have never seen this movie then move the rock you are living under, climb out, and watch this movie! Forget critics, and technical reviews and such. Just watch it. Then you will understand where this whole ""predator"" and even the ""alien"" world came from and why so much is based off of this franchise and the ""alien"" franchise when it comes to sci fi alien based movies.

"If it bleeds, we can kill it!","As a veteran, I'm drawn to films that capture the essence of combat and the challenges faced by soldiers. ""Predator"" is a movie that not only entertains with its intense action and sci-fi elements but also resonates with its portrayal of the physical and psychological toll of warfare.Directed by John McTiernan and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, ""Predator"" takes us on a harrowing journey alongside a team of elite commandos as they face an unimaginable threat in the heart of the jungle. The film's portrayal of the camaraderie and brotherhood among soldiers struck a chord with me, as it highlighted the importance of trust and reliance on one another in challenging situations.The action sequences in ""Predator"" are nothing short of explosive. The relentless battles, gunfights, and hand-to-hand combat scenes are a testament to the skills and training of the soldiers. As a veteran, I appreciated the attention to detail and the realistic portrayal of combat tactics employed by the characters.Arnold Schwarzenegger's portrayal of Dutch, the team's leader, is commendable. His commanding presence and determination reflect the qualities I admire in military leaders. The film also explores the psychological impact of war through the experiences of the characters, reminding us of the toll it takes on soldiers both during and after battle.The design and execution of the Predator itself are remarkable. The creature's advanced technology, stealth abilities, and relentless pursuit create a sense of genuine threat. This resonated with me as a veteran, as it reminded me of the constant need for vigilance and adaptability in the face of danger.""Predator"" excels in portraying the harsh realities of combat, but it also delves into the bonds formed between soldiers. The film depicts the sacrifices made by these brave individuals and the lengths they would go to protect one another. This resonated deeply with me, as it reflects the unbreakable brotherhood forged in the crucible of war.While ""Predator"" may not delve deeply into character development for every member of the commando team, it effectively captures the essence of the military experience. The film's visuals, despite their age, still manage to create a believable and immersive atmosphere, transporting viewers into the heart of the conflict.However, it is worth noting that ""Predator"" occasionally relies on certain tropes and clichés commonly associated with action movies. While they may not be entirely representative of the real-life experiences of veterans, they contribute to the film's entertainment value and the overall excitement.In conclusion, ""Predator"" stands as a thrilling and thought-provoking film that resonates with veterans due to its portrayal of the bonds formed in combat and the challenges faced by soldiers. With its intense action, memorable characters, and exploration of the psychological toll of warfare, ""Predator"" remains a must-watch for those seeking a gritty an immersive military experience on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

One of the best films on Netflix 2020,"Obviously this is the best Predator film and one of the greatest sci-fi/action flicks in history. Having just rewatched it, I'm amazed how well it still holds up against ANY film of its genre today. The acting isn't ""great"" theatrically speaking, but it's perfect for this film. Most of the special effects are more convincing than the CGI of today... Also, so refreshing not to have to sit through an hour-long exposition: seriously, the entire ""exposition"" lasts a few minutes, and everything is crystal clear - this should be a masterclass for action directors and writers of today, because - guess what? Nobody cares about the personal/domestic life of a character in a Predator film! It's not Shawshank Redemption. Schwarzenegger's one-liners are iconic as ever, and the other cast members are also cool and unique personalities. This film is like the perfect burger recipe - seemingly easy, but has the perfect ratio of ingredients. Action, violence, tension being built, colorful characters - all in perfect proportion to the storyline and runtime. Plus one of the most iconic creatures/villains of all time.

Fun Mix of Action and Sci-Fi,"Predator (1987)*** (out of 4)Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) leads his commando unit into the jungles where they think they're on a simple rescue mission. Pretty soon they realize something strange is going on and one by one they're getting picked off by an invisible figure.John McTiernan's PREDATOR was a smash hit when it was released and has spawned several sequels as well as a reboot but there's no question that it remains one of the best films of its type. The 80's were full of action movies and one could argue that the entire decade was made up of some of the best action films out there and this one here remains a favorite to many fans of the genre.There's a lot of very good things here but to me the greatest thing is the final twenty-minutes when we get Schwarzenegger going up against the predator. I'm certainly not going to ruin anything but there's no question that the entire film is leading up to this final battle and I really loved the way the film just dragged it out. Both of the hunters were getting their options ready and I loved the slow build up to the battle. Of course, once the battle starts it has some terrific action pieces. The action throughout the entire movie is rather exciting and we get some rather graphic kills that are quite memorable.Stan Winston's creature effects are certainly the highlight of the picture and I really loved the look of the predator once its mask is off. THe design alone is some of the best work of Winston's career and it certainly makes for a lot of fun. Even better are the macho cast members with Schwarzenegger leading the way but there's also strong support from Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke and Shane Black among others.PREDATOR is just a graphic and at times gory action picture full of macho guys doing battle with a terrific creature. While it's certainly not flawless there's no question that it's a lot of fun.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Predator - where do I even begin? Well, my account name might give you a hint about my sentiments, but let's dive into the love for this iconic 1987 gem.In the pantheon of sci-fi action films from the '80s, Predator stands tall alongside Aliens and The Terminator. Smartly written, expertly directed, and featuring a cast oozing with 100% unadulterated badassery, it's a blast in every sense of the word!The brilliance starts with the ensemble cast. Each character gets a satisfying amount of development, a rarity in action films. Schwarzenegger and Weathers own the screen, but the comedic charm of Ventura and the intense presence of Landham add layers to the camaraderie.And then there's the Predator itself. A masterpiece of practical creature design and visual effects, it stands proudly alongside the Xenomorph from Aliens as my favorite creature design. It's a perfect blend of hidden menace and jaw-dropping revelation.Now, let's talk action. If you don't find yourself grinning from ear to ear as Mac and the team mow down half a forest, we might need to have a serious chat. The intensity, the explosions, the one-liners - it's action cinema at its absolute best.Predator is not just a film; it's a classic. It's a relentless thrill ride that has aged brilliantly. With every rewatch, it reaffirms its status as an icon in the realm of cinematic greatness. So, if you haven't experienced the adrenaline-pumping joy of Predator, it's time to rectify that mistake. It's an experience that defines the essence of '80s action cinema.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

What are you?,"Predator. What are you? A great start to the Skull Hunter franchise. Starting as a typical Vietnam film with Sylvester Stallone (Mistake) and his friend Arnold Schwarzenegger, after half an hour this film turns into a race to the bottom that will be as hard as possible to survive. The Predator look was done superbly, it's not a terribly funny costume or a very disgusting one, it's the image of a real cruel space hunter. Music and endless trees and jungle foliage will keep you in suspense for just an hour of chasing and hiding from the alien.

This movie is one of my favorites.,"This movie is one of my favorites. From a time I watched this movie for 3 straight months, for every day. Some days I watched it more then once. I had this on a terrible VHS tape. But for some reason having to rewind it and in the rewinding time span I wanted to watch it again and again. This movie is full of everything from blood/guts/bullets/knifes/aliens/war/soldiers/death. All those mix to make the true ""Guy Movie"". Granted this movie has it's flaws but come on, this is one of those ultimate badass movies where none of that crap matters. There have been tons of movies to try to duplicate this movie and all fail. I can't urge people enough to just watch this for what it is. The ultimate what the hell else could go wrong for a special elite team lead by Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger). That has already been tricked into doing a job, also in 115+ degree heat, and then to top it off a out of this world galactic hunter wants there bones for collectors pieces. From the attack on the base camp that they completely demolish, to the destruction of a square block of jungle with the mini gun scene. But this movie true message is the fact that Dutch is left to fight the Predator without the use of military weapons, but has to make his own out of the supplies and natural surroundings around him, which completely throw the Predator for a complete loop, or does it!After screening this movie to many times to count I have come up with a conclusion about the end. I believe that Poncho (Richard Chaves) the soldier with the automatic grenade launcher, Survived at the end. Well I believe he was in the lap of Anna (Elpidia Carrillo) in the helicopter at the end. Because you can see the hair of someone laying down but no face. And the only one with that short of hair at the time was Poncho, and heck I think Anna came back for him, granted he did get hit by a huge log, but who the hell else could it be. Also on another note in ""Predator 2"" they talk about only two special mission force members survived and I don't know what this means to you, but Anna is no special forces member! This is truly something that has bothered me for some time. But this movie had given me days of satisfaction and a must watch for anyone who likes Sci-fi/Horror/Action.

One of my fav action film of all time. I grew up watching this n the vhs tape got fatigued.,"I still remember the billboard poster when it first released in a theatre in India. I was ten years old n didn't got the chance to see it on a big screen then.Later saw this for the first time in the late 80s on a vhs which i used to own, then multiple times in the 90s. Once with a bunch of pals at one of our friend's house cos i placed a bet with my skool pals that the alien is played by Van Damme cos i had read it in a newspaper's Ripley's believe it or not column.
I lost the bet cos Van Damme's name never got the credit.
Missed it again when the movie re-released in a theater in the late 90s.
Theater experience wud have been totally different man.
Revisited it recently.This movi is full of adrenaline action that it doesn't leave you room to breathe. The pacing is taut n the tension throughout.
John McTiernan's direction is terrific.
This is a high octane thriller with lots of violent n gory moments.
Action/horror/sci-fi fans will enjoy this.
The jungle photography by Don McAlpine is itself a character.
The cast is amazing n the music heart pounding.
Stan Winston's creature effects r noteworthy n the film is helped greatly by Alan Silvestri's score.It has one of the earliest head exploding like a watermelon scene.
It also has one of the earliest scene to show a spine being removed.Surprisingly, this movie still rocks.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An sci-fi action flick with a special feel to it.,"I'm not sure what it is, but this tale of an alien hunter has a special something that makes it highly enjoyable. The actors have been cast well, and the effects are magnificent, there's a certain tensity about it and it keeps interest throughout. If you haven't seen it before, my suggestion is to run down to the video shop and grab a copy.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ridiculously Over-rated,"A team of commandos, on a mission in a Central American jungle, find themselves hunted by an extra-terrestrial warrior.Initial critical reaction to Predator was negative, with criticism focusing on the thin plot. Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times described it as ""grisly and dull, with few surprises. However, in subsequent years critics' attitudes toward the film warmed, and it has appeared on a number of ""best of"" lists. This reversal is just plain sad.On top of the thin plot, there is a lot of sitting around, and the ""predator vision"" has not held up over the years. A bit of editing, maybe cutting out twenty seconds here or there, would do wonders. While Stan Winston and crew deserve credit for creating an iconic monster, the film itself never really takes off until well over an hour.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Innovative, suspenseful, believable action","When I first saw this film I had the feeling something completely new was achieved by the film maker. An Action Sci-fi movie with action scenes that are believable (humanly possible) but still with a mysterious, powerful alien that is slowly developed from a computer generated wispy creature to a real and frightening being. Yes, the alien has superhuman strength, abilities and equipment but remains believable. Yes, Arnold rolls his muscles but not too explicitly as in some of his other movies, besides he needs them all in the physical fight against the alien who is very clearly a size too big for Ernie. In summary, a fast, innovative Action Sci-fi movie so full with small detail that you can see it time after time and still discover something new.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You may not like my review ...,"Film was not that great. Was so much stretched. Acting was not good and film's emotions are also weak. Even though they did a great job with what they had, you'll be seeing some weird CGI. Overall, you may enjoy it but not for so long....",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Gets better with Age.,"With all the latest crap coming out of Hollywood like Prey, prequel of sorts to the excellent Predator this just gets better and better the more garbage like Prey is put on screen.This had a diverse cast even then and showed how with good actors of any race, gendor or background as long as the actors are great and there is a good script and story then a good film can be made. Nowadays we have virtual signalling and rubbish actors put in lead roles to tick the preverbial Hollywood box. In Prey we are supposed to believe that a tiny woman can take out an army of men with guns and Predator when in the 1987 Preditor it made mince meat of a crew of Elite fighters with enough fire power to take down a City. In Prey one woman does it with a axe and a piece of string.So as I say this gets better with age. An all time classic without the rubbish we all have to put up with in all our films today.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Loud and macho with some memorable moments,"An enjoyable macho romp through the shrubbery.A crack squad of US military are despatched to the jungle on a special mission, only to get much more than they bargained for. The main characters are ridiculously macho - all biceps and big weapons - but it works.The film follows a fairly predictable formula but does so with some style and memorable moments. For a good while you are watching a 'conventional' war film, with no obvious sign of anything 'other worldly' involved, but gradually it appears that our band of brothers are to face an enemy not of this earth. The introduction of that foe leads the film into a new and rewarding avenue.Arnie is of course perfectly cast as the leader of the troop, and gives a convincing performance in his fight for survival. A few cheesy lines are mixed with some memorable ones, and the main enemy is well imagined and presented.If you like loud shoot-em-up films with a dash of sci-fi and exaggerated characters, this could be for you. Be prepared to suspend belief a little, overlook a few flaws and enjoy the ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
extremely over rated,"If this came out today so no one can hold on tight to their rose tinted glasses and nostalgia I think this movie would have flopped or done really poorly. Sure they used the best of visual effects and so forth they were given and this movie was extremely influential for sci-fi and similar genres but on todays standards this movie was a slog through very thick mud it feels like. It was almost as dull to watch as the first Jason Voorheese movie Friday The Thirteenth.The movie stars Carl Weathers who as we know is Apollo Creed in most of the Rocky movies. Jesse Ventura the wrestler from WWF and Jean Claude Van Damme was supposed to be in it as the predator but turned it down because his face bump wouldn't get any time on the silver screen and of course Arnold is in it.The movie starts off with an unnecessary amount of people coming out of a helicopter. They are so cool they don't say a word! Wow.. I can't help but wonder if Dutch is a reference to a character name in the tv series Archer. The opening with the helicopter reminds me of a very early scene in Saints Row 4 with the same or a very similar song. As usual Arnold is the best"" and teams up with Dillon. The jokes in this movie are awful but I imagine intentionally bad like a Tommy Wiseau film made after 2004. Arnold's acting slightly improved I'll give him that. This is before every director wanted him to do those silly Arnold screams such as in Jingle All The Way or Total Recall.The gore looks good for its time. Arms dismembered, skinned corpses. Lots of blood. The weapons were diverse. There is quite a lot of explosions in the first half where you known darn well that is where the movies budget went. However the CGI gets dull fast especially those thermal shots they seem overly proud of. What kills me about it is how Dutch becomes invisible to thermal vision being covered in mud. How does that make any sense. The stealth the predator uses is just awful. It reminds me of Goosebumps or some late 90s tv series. I felt they could have done a better job on it.The first shoot out makes no sense. You go into this place knowing there is hostages with satchel charges (Explosives), a mini gun and a bunch of other guns. I know it tries to be an action movie but still. It makes no sense. Here James Bond, take this extra loud shotgun and a 44 magnum, this is a covert mission. Don't get caught. You'd think the second they hear loud bangs and know there is an attack the hostages would be executed. Of course a somewhat pretty Spanish woman has to be the hostage they rescue.Most of the thermal vision shots look like someone is on a bad acid trip or some college art film of some sort. They become tedious and lose their unique appeal fast.The movies score seems out of place , the shots of the jungle look so dull and faded. We really take color correction for granted.I love how after they escape from the enemy fortress or whatever you want to call it they forget about any other team of soldiers. The part where they first spot a predator and they blow a big chunk out of the forest was such an unnecessary scene. However I just hope the actors had a blast shooting off the guns as it's one of the only fun parts of the movie I can imagine any of them had.The characters are written so stiff like the trees in that South American jungle. They are so uninspired and unoriginal. The person who wrote the script had no idea how to write dialogue between characters.This movie slowly becomes Home Alone in some jungle with a bunch of filthy soldiers who have a mid life crises. The movie is so padded with pointless scenes that they could have edited out. At least Dutch wasn't invincible like many action stars of that era.This movie just reminds me of in the tv series Happy Days The Fonz when people back then thought he was cool where as now no one would give him the time of day.How did anyone have careers after this, why didn't this bomb? I guess it came out at the right time is why. The laugh the predator does at the end was awful.This movie may have been extremely influential and clearly todays movies aren't better but seeing this with no hype this was an awful movie I couldn't wait for it to be over. It was too long, poorly paced. I've seen better B horror movies.Skip it, don't even bother streaming it. If you've been thinking of watching it don't. There are far better movies out there with or without Arnold.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Classic,"This movie is an absolute classic. The guns, the muscles, the jungle, the jokes and of course, the predator: Pure testosterone. Even though thats great, my favourite part of this film is just how intense the sheer paranoia and the mystery is. Each scene you get the sense that an invisible force is present. Even on the first watch, you KNOW the predator is THERE. The hatmosphere is immaculate during the entire film. That is mainly due to suble details in the cinematography, music and acting. Speaking of which, the camera is so well handled. The cuts are smart and efficient, all to inspire fear. Just like the actors' facial expression. Every actor gives a great performance here. Another thing I want to point out is how good John McTiernan is at showing us the landscape in which the scenes take place. That makes the viewers ten times more paranoid. I think its interresting because how paranoia usually works in horror movies is that you dont know where the creature is and you fear its going to come. But in this movie, you KNOW the predator is likely super close but you dont know when its going to attack. This is not necessarily a better method but its certainly original. Anyway, this movie is a classic, I think it's extremely good for a ton of reasons so I recommend watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A great 80's action from start to finish.,"If someone argues that Arnold never had any good movies than Terminator, Show them Predator! This is Arnold in his prime showing us what a great action star he is. The film is brooding with cliche's but somehow it just works. Predator is great at making the audience feel claustrophobic while set in a great big jungle. the realism of the predator will have you baffled when you consider that they made this creature in 1987. This movie does have it's flaws, but it can be forgiven when you put it in the right context. If you are in the mood for a great action shooter, with bodybuilding soldiers firing weapons (that normal men can't even lift) at one of the most iconic creatures ever put on film, then this one is for you.

Great USE of special effects, this movie did not have to have them, they were great icing to this cake, unlike other movies where they are so based upon special effects and visuals the dialogue and characters are really hindered (example: Titanic,1997). I do recommend renting if you haven't, I own it because I love it. Even if you don't like Arnold Schwarzenegger and hate action flicks, give this one a try, it's definitely worth the price.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
McTiernan shows his directing skills,"John McTiernan directed this alien gore fest starring the legend Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch, a hard boiled military officer who gets a job to go with his men to somewhere in South America's jungles and hunt down some platoon that has disappeared strangely. They get there only to find some horribly mutilated bodies and some angry enemies (humans) which they have to fight first. Soon, the real terror in the jungle is revealed and as the trailer said, it is something that never before has been on Earth. Let me introduce you a PREDATOR!This film is brainless, but in pretty enjoyable way so I definitely didn't feel myself bored after this second viewing. There are many shootings and explosions only to show people some action and entertainment, and they really make no sense. There are some irritating moments like to horrible patriotic music playing background during one soldier missing his dead friend who was also a soldier. The characters are as thin as possible, but at least they act decently and pretty believably, but not in all cases. This film cannot be enjoyed if viewed with too much criticism, and I try to concentrate on the merits this film has. Trash or not, a film may still have some merits and cinematic achievements.The cinematography is stunning and creates great atmosphere in many cases and segments. The director really knows how to direct action thrillers, as Die Hard proves, too. There are two totally great little details and scenes in Predator, and I definitely want to tell about them. The first, and greatest, is when Predator fixes himself/itself and uses his tools with agony as ""he"" is wounded. As he shouts, there is one image/angle that lasts perhaps one second, but catches the sun very effectively from one little hole in tree and it shines very brightly through that hole and looks totally fantastic. As I mentioned, this image is only one part of the ""fixing"" scene and that image is very brief and I think it's left for viewers to spot. This little detail really blew me away with this second viewing, it is that inventive and effective. The other detail spoils a little, so I won't tell too much about it, but it deals with a camera angle which is used after Predator has shot one of its victims in the head. The angle and tension is very great before and after that killing, and it would've been much less effective in the hands of not so talented director. There are also other great examples of cinematography and visual talent of the director, so this is one important element and achievement in this film, and due to this, I appreciate this film pretty much, despite the film being pretty stupid.The effects are plenty and gory as Predator kills and shoots its victims with bloody results. This is pretty violent film and it is interesting to see this got an R rating at the time without any cuts. Still, this is a mainstream film so it is no use in expecting some over-the-top splatter film, but as a film from a big studio, this is pretty gruesome, but also cartoonish. The effects about the monster itself and its ability to change colors and copy its environment are very fantastic and even more convincing than the make up effects. Also, the monster itself is pretty damn ugly and disgusting and created with care by Stan Winston.Predator is great film for lovers of big budget action and (unintentional) trash cinema and of course a must for those who love Arnold's charisma on screen. This is a great example about this genre's abilities and McTiernan can be proud of this film, too. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Predator-terrifying Sci-Fi Classic,"Predator a Sci-Fi Movie released in 1987, became an instant classic. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as ""Dutch"" a tough army Major who is leading a special Black Ops Mission to assist ""Dillon"" (Carl Weathers) who is from CIA to rescue some survivors in South American Jungle. As they arrive Dutch realizes that they have been sent there by supplying false information. But this information is their least problem because there is someone or something in the jungle who is hunting his team one by one.After giving great action flicks in 1984 as The Terminator, Conan and Commando in 85 Arnold returns as the hardcore angry army major, he is not afraid of killing anyone or anything. The supporting cast works well too except some scenes involving Elpidia Carrillo Mexican actress.The Director John McTiernan is able to create an atmosphere which helps convert this action science fiction movie into horror movie in second act. The shooting location inside the jungle is well chosen and helps to add in the terror spread by the creature out to hunt-Predator.Watching hardcore commandos turn into panicky prey with Alan Silvestri's Classical soundtrack again amplifies the horror quality of the movie. As the climax is reached the viewer is so pumped up that he forgets about other characters and the girl. The final act is full on one to one fight between man and predator portrayed brilliantly by McTiernan.One of the best thing about the Predator was its practical effects and special effects. The Predator's vision is well made which lends into the suspense of what is hunting them. While this movie may not be for everyone and faint hearted as the movie get a little bit too graphic at some points. But the effects still holds strong after 28 long years.A survival-horror-suspense-action-scifi-thriller with Arnold and directed by McTiernan.

"""If it bleeds, we can kill.""","This is one of those pictures where Schwarzenegger actually got lucky.  The film's strength is that it can stand on its own without him.  Of course, he gives a good performance in all but how demanding could the role really be?This film is great on so many levels.  First, director John McTiernan does a phenomenal job here.  As far as I'm concerned, this is his best work.  Next, you've got an amazing score by Alan Silvestri - a musician who needs no introduction.  Lastly, there's the creature itself.  However, the thanks for that is a somewhat vague mixture of the Thomas screenwriters and the horde of special effects designers brought into the project.   Apparently, there was some trouble with the ""look"" of the creature once production started. Nevertheless, the result was the true star of the film - a real marvel of science fiction and horror.Although this film may solely be for action fans (there's a number of one-liners), I argue that it achieves much more in credibility.  This is actually a well-crafted suspenseful adrenaline rush of horror.  Easily, one of the best films of all time.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...""There's something out there waiting for us. And it ain't no man. We're all gonna die.""""Predator"" (1987) starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, and directed by John McTiernan, is a feast for the eyes and an adrenalin-pumping creature feature that caters to all action enthusiasts everywhere. I'm tired of hearing about, or reading, that this movie is a B-Movie with a B-Horror Creature in it. Far from it! This is Grade A Stuff here. If you want to see a B-Creature Feature, then go watch ""The Blob"", ""Sleepwalkers"", or ""Lake Placid"". THIS movie is the real deal. It is one of the best of its kind.When Major 'Dutch' Schaefer (Schwarzenegger) and his elite paramilitary rescue team are brought in to locate and rescue hostages being held in a guerrilla camp in the rain forests of Central America, they soon find out that there is much more cooking under the surface than they were originally led to believe. After wiping out the camp, they are tasked with reaching the safety of their chopper's pick-up location. However, they find themselves the unwitting prey of an unearthly predator, a hunter from another world that is technologically advanced and is a master of using the surrounding forest as camouflage - and it begins to pick them off, one by one. Dutch knows that if the predator isn't defeated, nobody will leave the forest alive.You know the type of movie that when you walk into a room and you find it playing, and no matter what you are doing, you stop and watch it? ""Predator"" is that movie. Just the other day, I was watching it, and someone who was visiting from out of town came over, saw that I was watching it, and immediately sat down and we watched it right to the end together. The attraction to this classic Schwarzenegger action film is undeniable. Bolstered by great special effects and an instantly recognizable soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, it was a huge stepping stone for director, John McTiernan who went on to direct some other awesome films, including ""Die Hard"" which would follow a year later.This is hands down one of my personal favorite Schwarzenegger movies of all-time, actually, just one of my personal favorite movies PERIOD of all-time. I can honestly say that I couldn't tell you how many times I've watched it over the years, but it is more than the average, that is for sure. It is a classic, and a near-perfect movie at a very strong 9 stars out of 10. If you've never seen it, seriously never seen it, then stop what you are doing right now, and watch it.

"My overall feel for the movie, Predator","Hi Guys,I'll start by saying there is some legendary comments by everyone on the other threads. Great stuff! I am a huge fan of the film & have been looking for a site dedicated to the film. There doesn't seem to be one.I have seen the commandofan.com one. It's good. Anyway just wanted to say I was 15 when Predator first came out & I didn't go the cinema to see it, think was 15/16 when it came out on video. Loved it & sh*t myself. Like most teenagers I loved action films, but even then felt much of the stuff hitting the big screen was kind of crap. This film stood apart & has stood the test of time. I have probably watched it 20-30 times over the years & still love it.The atmosphere created, the music, the brilliance of the predator (still unbeaten for me) to the acting. I know it was cheesy at times & sometimes plain funny, but it worked. All the other comments about the great one liners & scary moments have been fantastic by others so I won't touch on them . My favourite characters are Dutch (Arnie), Mac (Bill Duke) & Billy (Sonny Landham). I felt all the characters played their roles perfectly & ran their course apart from Billy. I felt he was killed too easily. Maybe that was intentional to scare us more. I dunno I loved Billy. (not like that!) Incidentally his website is okay. sonnylandham.com It's worth visiting it just for one thing. Make sure your speakers are turned on quite loud when you visit. I will agree the really scary thing is being watched though & being deep in that south American rainforest is enough in itself, seeing your mates being picked off & being relentlessly chased. I might have to watch it again soon. Would love to hear others views on a few things they could have added, or other routes the script could have took for certain characters. Although don't get me wrong I love this movie the way it is & is right up there. Why did they even attempt a follow up. Hated the Alien v Predator. Watched 40 mins. Same as Highlander. Great, great film. Second film, trash. Anyway good luck chaps.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
PREDATOR,"""PREDATOR"" (1987, McTiernan) is definitely no 10/10 masterpiece. The Predator itself is fabulous. I Can't fault it.But the film is no more than a tongue in cheek sci-fi action farce. It isn't genius, it's actually mind numbingly silly as a bunch of muscle-mounds, each a cliche, is hunted down in the jungle.It's the ""TOP GUN"" (1986, Scott) of sci-fi/action films (however subversive it might be with the inclusion of a murderous alien) that outstays its welcome towards the end.Fun acting, heel-thumping soundtrack, great monster and an influential idea make it a must watch but it ain't a flawless classic.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Stick around""!!","Arnold Schwarzenegger leads an elite squad of U. S. Army commandos to a remote region of South American jungle, where they've been assigned to search for South American officials who've been kidnapped by terrorists. Instead they find a bunch of skinned corpses hanging from the trees and realize that they're now facing a mysterious and much deadlier threat. As the squad is picked off one by one, Arnold finds himself pitted against a hideous alien creature that's heavily armed and wearing a spacesuit enabling the creature to render itself invisible.This is a a violent, ultra-violent masterpiece which starts out like a typical Commando style film where Arnie and his team head into the South American Jungle on a mission and get into a rousing gunfight. Arnie tells a guy to stick around when throwing a knife that pins him to the door, but it's not long before he and his team ""stick around"" with an unearthly creature in the jungles knocking them out, making their innards droop over the trees like noodles. At this point, a serious tone takes over, though still keeping a comic book sheen to the ghastly, yet exciting proceedings - Predator is an action-packed, tension filled and heart pounding sci-fi horror blockbuster which features a really terrifying and seemingly indestructible force. It can see you, but you can't see him.Arnie is on top form here, who tries to keep his team from cracking while alien creature cuts down his team one by one - the showdown between Arnie and the predator is the one of the most climatic scenes I have seen in a film.

I see you,"No pun intended - and not just meant to say that I see the Predator (the improved version - apparently there was one that did not work at all - and halted the production)! But the movie in general - the actors, the action, the good stuff ... but also te bad stuff! Yes I see the flaws and despite those (or because of them?), I think this is a great movie.There I said it. The change in not just in the costume, but also the actor who was in it - don't feel bad for the first Dude ... Jean Claude van Damme did good, he does not need your pity. It is a high concept - it is a weird concept! But a great one - a warrior from outer space ... technically the movie may have taken on more than it was able to deliver. Or that could stand the test of time. Some things did not age very good - but overall the war effects are good, the acting is more than decent and the tension is phenomenal.We get thrown into a world that we are not familiar with. The producers tried to get veteran who could also act. Which made for some odd, but great casting choices. And then they Shane Black in it too. The guy who likely rewrote the script - or added some dialog. I don't think he is credited - and maybe that got the screenwriting fire in him going.Things/puns like ""stick around"" (you'll understand with the visual) or I ain't got time to bleed do sound like him. We also have a knock knock joke ... well just the knock knock without the punchline, but a fireline. I reckon that is a pun(chline) by me then.The movie is quite brutal, violent and bloody. Also one of the biggest lines almost sounded like a throwaway line - If it bleeds we can kill it ... surely another Shane Black moment. Also get to the chopper is being said a few times. I mean that is one of the objectives - which sounds kind of ... well weird when Arnold is saying it. Yes his accent never faded away, but it is quite thick in this movie.Great cast assembled and I can't wait to rewatch the second movie. This was a mixture between war, action and horror movie. With a few Science Fiction elements to it. And talking of the cast, Arnold has another line that seems prophetic: my men are not expendable ... ah well, if you only knew! And not talking about this movie necessarily, but of course another series he started and starred in with Sylvester Stallone.That all aside, we have a great movie here ... amovie that is amazing as it is.

Predator (1987),"A US military rescue team is hunted by an unseen assassin in a Central American jungle.Predator is a mainstream B-movie. The plot is simple, the characters are generic, and the setting is basic. If that's true, then why has this movie been so popular for almost 40 years?My opinion is that the movie does so much right that it makes up for its flaws.One of Predator's biggest strengths is its pacing. After we meet our characters, director John McTiernan throws the audience into the jungle right away. As dread begins to build with the discovery of quartered and skinned human corpses, the film is well balanced with a huge gun fight between the rescue team and a local militia. The movie continues this balance of terror and over-the-top action throughout the duration of the run time, and it works very well; there isn't a dull moment in the film.The movie's characters are extremely memorable, despite surface level character traits and spotty acting. Those flaws are masked by charisma and some of the most muscle bound bodies you'll ever see, in this testosterone dripping sausage fest of a film. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as rescue team leader Dutch, and his performance is wooden by even his standards; he basically lets his muscles do the acting. This movie is serious in nature, but Arnie's character has a ton of random one liners that don't land (ironically, the serious line of ""get to the chopper!"" is a pop culture staple nearly four decades later).Fortunately Carl Weathers is also in this film to add some legitimacy to the performances. I actually find Weathers' Dillon character to be the main character for most of the movie. Though Dutch is the group leader, Dillon has the most backstory and clearest character motivations, and we spend a lot of time with him in the jungle and see a lot of things through his eyes. Dillion is actually the first character to see the Predator without its stealth camouflage.Speaking of the the Predator, the creature is amazing. I think we somewhat take it for granted now because its been tattooed in our minds for the past few decades. It is and was a great horror villain, with an iconic look and unique character traits. The movie famously almost went with an earlier design that looked more like a lizard, which I think would have hurt it considerably. Additional shooting was required after Stan Winston finalized the character as we know him now.Finally, the music by Alan Silvestri is great. 20th Century Fox continue to use the score of this film in sequels to this day; it's iconic.Add it all up and you get a movie that has no business being as good as it is, but will probably still be enjoyed by audiences 100 years from now.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""The jungle is alive...""","Predator is about as testosterone supercharged as you could possibly get in a movie. Every actor is pumped up. It has tough dialogue, big guns, and lots of macho action. Throw in a cool alien with amazing special effects and you have pure guy movie nirvana. It doesn't hurt matters that it was the film that John McTiernan directed right before making Die Hard. It established that he could really handle action. The storyline is enthralling and certainly creates interest.The cast of this film was perfect. It was a real ensemble piece with Schwarzenegger in the lead. In fact, I think Arnold was helped tremendously by the additional cast. He didn't have to carry the whole movie on his shoulders and they helped elevate the level of acting and characterization. You had Carl Weathers as the CIA agent. He seems more than a physical match for Schwarzenegger and he definitely acts better. You also had Bill Duke as Sgt. 'Mac' Eliot. His quiet, intense gaze said more than anything else he did. You had Jesse Ventura playing the tough, tobacco chewing, gun toting guy who ain't got time to bleed"".Now the Predator himself is amazing: he's tall, silent, tough and armed to the teeth with some incredible otherworldly technology. He's more than a worthy opponent for Dutch and his crew, and every aspect of the Predator is interesting, terrifying and awe-inspiring. The attention to detail on the Predator character is simply phenomenal, and we actually learn a lot about this violent yet intelligent invader through this film. McTiernan has developed and presented believable and interesting, multi-dimensional, complex characters; and the Predator is certainly unsurpassed as a character in the genre of Sci-Fi.

Before long, his team discovers that it is being hunted by a mysterious alien--a being that has travelled to this planet to kill for sport.Pros: Gorgeous photography (helped in no small part by the beautiful Mexican locations); A brilliant creature design by Stan Winston; Nifty ""cloak"" effects; Thermo-vision; Tight, energetic direction by McTiernan; and a great score by the underrated Alan Silvestri.Cons: Highly irritating, overly macho commandos, entirely too convinced of their own ""bad-assness""; Poor dialogue; Merely average acting; Jesse Ventura; Jesse Ventura; Some dated effects; Jesse Ventura.7/10  Good fun, but no match for the superior Alien series",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"High energy violence, guns, aliens and rock n' roll in the Vietnam jungle, Predator is a movie which never takes itself too seriously","High energy violence, guns, aliens and rock n' roll in the Vietnam jungle, Predator is a movie which never takes itself seriously and seeks to please the audience and gives them everything they ask could ask for from an action movie. Arnie comes out guns blazing in his shouty-est, bicep-iest and shoot-the-alien-in-the-face-iest role as Dutch, an american commander dropped into the wildernest under false pretences to recover a lost heli-crew but the search quickly turns into a hunt, for the Predator, a highly specialised Alien with thermo-vision whose only motivation seemingly is to hunt humans for sport. The movie ultimately has very little substance compared to its contempory Alien but the action sequences are just so unappolgetically fun that its hard to hold this against it and the POV sequences of the thermal vision are iconic and terrifying.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
classic Shawrzenegger action!,This is one of arnolds classic action movie and is one of the best for sure. Arny can not really act but this movie he is not saying overly much he does what he does best and stands around looking menacing. This movie is intense action from pretty much the start to finish and it was really ahead of its time.This movie is about a group of special ops soldiers who go to south America to go on a mission. While on the mission they start going missing one by one and soon discover they are being hunter by something not of this world.This is a great classic action movie and its one of Arnies best for sure.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
sigh,"This movie delivers exactly what is promised to ACTION ACTION ACTION and it does action well. The infra red scenes were good for the time and ahigh point in the movie. It also had good music considering but where this movie fails is in the acting. True you don't go to this sort of film to see great acting, you go to see explosions so big that if you tried to do that you'd end up in a loony bin. And in a movie like this as long as the acting doesn't subtract from the action you don't care. In this film however the acting is so dismally that it's worthy of MST3K. That is what removed the excitement of a former governor firing a mini gun all over the place.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pure action bliss.,"The year before he turned Bruce Willis into a bona fide movie star with his hugely successful and highly influential hit Die Hard, director John McTiernan gave Arnold Schwarzeneggar's film career a huge boost with sci-fi flavoured blockbuster Predator, an explosive, testosterone fuelled piece of gung-ho action packed with extreme violence, macho posturing, memorable dialogue, cool one-liners, big guns, and even bigger muscles.In what is arguably his finest film, the Austrian bodybuilder plays Dutch, leader of a group of highly trained commandos who specialise in rescuing hostages. After the team are duped by shady CIA agent Dillon (Carl Weathers) into taking part in a seek and destroy mission in a Central American jungle, they find themselves being stalked by an unseen enemy: an extraterrestrial hunter visiting Earth with the intention of adding a few more human skulls to his trophy cabinet.Aided by a high-tech cloaking device, heat vision, and a shoulder mounted laser cannon, the creature kills the men one-by-one, until only Dutch is left standing, and the scene is set for an unforgettable final showdown.With taut, no-nonsense direction from McTiernan (hard to believe this is the same guy who gave us the abysmal Rollerball remake), a rousing score from Alan Silvestri that perfectly complements the breath-taking action, and amazing visual effects that are way ahead of their time, Predator is a blast from start to finish (quite literally!).The film also benefits immensely from the cool-as-f@%k cast who play Dutch's impossibly tough team (which includes director Bill Duke, ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura, screenwriter Shane Black, and Native American Sonny Landham), the gratuitous glorification of high-powered weaponry (let's hear it for the mini-gun!), plus one of sci-fi cinemas's most memorable monsters, designed by FX genius Stan Winston and played by 7' 2½"" tall Kevin Peter Hall (both of whom are sadly no longer with us).Put simply, as far as action films go, it doesn't get much better than Predator.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the best Arnold Schwarzenegger's films,"This one of those good old Arnold Schwarzenegger's action movies. If you haven't seen it yet, you definitely got to do it. The action was pretty good for that time's action movie. The plot is pretty simple, but what's original about this film is Predator - probably one of the most unique fictional creatures. It looked like a very dangerous creature and there was some heart-stopping moments when it was attacking US soldiers and it looked like that they are totally helpless in those situations. There also was some original deaths, lots of blood and explosions. It's a very original action/Sci-Fi film and it's a must see for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the greatest kick-ass sci-fi action movies of all time my personal favorite number 1 action film,"Predator (1987) stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers and it is directed by John McTiernan. Predator is one of the greatest action films of all time, it is my personal number 1 favorite Schwarzenegger movie in the sci-fi action genre. It is also my favorite action film of all time. This movie is a perfect 10 it is the finest action movie of all time! I grew up with the film it was my first ""Predator"" film I saw as a kid in the trilogy. We can say it is the best one in the franchise it is people's favorite movie in trilogy.I agree it is still the best one today and I love, love, love, love this movie to death!!! It is the best of the best ever it has balls. There are so many explosives weapons and automatic weapons used in this movie and they are used well with thousands of bullets fired.In the remote jungle of a Central American country team of soldiers lead by General Jim Hopper goes missing in the jungle of Central America. So Major Dutch Schaeffer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his elite group of commandos are called in a rescue mission for cabinet minister and his scantiest men who are out in a guerrilla stronghold held by their will.. Once commando team are there they start to investigate what happened to Jim Hopper and the rest of his team. When Major Dutch Schaeffer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team go there they realize there are some secrets going on and Jim Hopper and his men are skinned alive. Something is rotten definitely. The hunters become the hunted when a highly intelligent, being slowly and methodically starts killing off members of Dutch's team.When Predator come out Arnold Schwarzenegger was at top of his game, the guy couldn't miss. Every time he put an action movie people run in to the theaters to see it because he was large men and he looked like a real life superhero. The only actor who come close to him was Sylvester Stallone ""Rambo"" and he looked like 50 pounds less than Arnold Schwarzenegger. He done Commando before but Predator was really the movie that set him to super star. He carry's the movie like an leading A list actor.Really cool about ""Predator"" is it is the mixed of genre it is not just an action movie it is also an science fiction movie, it is also a horror ""slasher"" movie. The first third act of the movie is where you get the action and his team go there are explosions real practical effects, guns blazing and you get M134 Minigun with Duke. When Dutch, Billy, Duke with Minigun and automatic weapons are shooting in the jungle on unseen creature you can see thousands of bullets fired in the movie real guns everything was done for real. Creature for Predator was designed by Stan Winston who was played by Kevin Peter Hall R.I.P. who is no longer with us anymore. The second third is where the horror elements kicks in, it is like a slasher flick. Predator starts picking off Dutch's team one by one off. The last third it is better than anything before it is men VS alien ""the Predator"" in this movie was a horrible villain. Predator is the most iconic villains in the history ever. He is so great that you actually feel for Arnold's character you feel Arnold might not be able to stand up to this guy.Predator stars: Arnold Schwarzenegger Carl Weathers, Elpidia Carrillo, Bill Duke, Richard Chaves, Jesse Ventura, Sonny Landham , Shane Black, R. G. Armstrong , Kevin Peter Hall , Sven-Ole Thorsen they are all believable. Sonny Landham also started in 48 hrs. , Southern Comfort and Lock Up also passed away and it is no longer with us anymore.I love the third act in this movie because Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't use his mussels, he uses his wisdom to take down Predator he sets booby traps a long the way in the jungle and I love the part in where he figure is out, how too hide him self from Predator he falls in the water and he has to wipe a mud on him to cover him self and that scene is just so nail bidding and tension, it truly feels a horror movie on the end. Arnold's team every character in this movie has a persona on their own, they are all extremely interesting and way different from each other. I got to hand down that too the writers: Jim Thomas and John Thomas, they both did an amazing job flashing out each one of these characters. It is great sense of paranoia since they all start losing their minds each one of them gets picked off. Alan Silvestri made a wonderful music score for the film which I am listening every time on YouTube.Predator come out the same year as RoboCop, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors the 80's were the years for action movies. John McTiernan also later directed Die Hard another action movie that become famous and of the greatest action movies of all time with Predator. The movie is Rated R it is bloody and it feel at time like a slasher film. It was a box office success it made $98,235,548 that time of it is release.Predator is one of the greatest sci-fi action horror slasher films of all time it is my favorite action film off all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Aged better than wine,"This movie will never be topped, EVERY SINGLE LINE OF DIALOGUE IS QUOTABLE!!This movie is just awesome, some people might think it is a no brainer action movie but it actually has depth.In order to defeat the Predator, the ultimate killing machine, Arnold had to give up all his ""man made"" equipment and go back to his roots, barbarian style. He had to seek out the ""caveman"" inside to defeat the Predator. He gave up his machine guns and grenades for a homemade spear, bow and arrow, and traps. There is an ""art"" to that. It just shows that we as a society rely too much on man-made machines that we forget how to live when we don't have those machines anymore. This movie is a masterpiece. Also I love the end when Predator tells Arnold ""what the HELL are you?"" Basically, Predator is shocked at being defeated by Arnold ""It"" is even asking Arnold ""what the HELL are you?"" back at him. Like, Predator is shocked that a mortal man defeated it. Also the Predator, has become THE PREY! Listen, this movie is not a B brainless action movie, it is an S film. A brilliant masterpiece that perfectly combines cheesy 80's action comedy that suddenly transforms into a HORROR film that ends as a deep thought provoking PHILOSOPHICAL masterpiece. That is some amazing script writing.What can I say guys, it was 10/10 back then, it is still 10/10 today and forever. Forever man, Forever.I will always love this movie and you should too. This movie will turn you into a sexual Tyrannosaurus, just like me.10/10By the way, Predator 2, Predators, and Prey are also good. Alien VS Predator 1 sucks, Aliens vs Predator Requiem is probably THE WORST THING EVER, and The Predator also sucks too.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More than a great action flick,"I managed to avoid seeing Predator for at least 10 years after its release. I figured, ""Another Die-Hard but with Arnold instead of Bruce"", so why waste my time?  Then one night I caught the last half of the film on cable and began to realize there was more going on than just great special effects.Arnold and his band of commandos seem a bit hokey at the beginning, although the tension between A. and Carl Weathers (Rocky) builds nicely.  But the whole opening act is merely build-up for the main event:  we see this elite ""black ops"" group take down a much larger rebel group in fine style, only to discover something really ugly and a bit scary.  Then, one by one, each member of the team is picked off by something they can't quite see, until only Arnold is left.  Anyone who's seen the final 30 minutes of this film can tell you that it's worth the wait, but I've discovered that getting there really is half the fun.The alien Predator is a sort of ""big game"" hunter who apparently sees our little planet as the best game preserve in the galaxy.  ""He"" has all the advantages, both physical and technological, and he's even more arrogant than the humans he's hunting.  That's the real hook to this story:  the Predator is super-macho personified, and by all rights no human should stand a chance.  Arnold's character only survives by using stealth and trickery, something rarely seen in most AS flicks.  Even at the end, when he has the Predator seemingly at his mercy, the creature turns the tables on him one last time.This is an action flick with a heart and some real intelligence behind the special effects and explosions.  Even today, having seen it many times, I still get drawn into the story when it shows up on late-night cable. Definitely worth having in your library.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Rescue team encounter a deadly alien,"This is the first installment of the saga that still continues to this day.Six agents are sent into the jungle of Guatemala on a rescue mission. Unbeknownst to them, a deadly alien also chose the same spot to go out on a hunting season - for humans. Rather young Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in this horror/sci-fi/action drama. Stan Winston studio designed Predator also makes it's debut in this movie. The movie has a real feel to it and has become the favorite of the fans of this series.Also in this movie is the young future governor Jessie Ventura. His motto was ""Do like Arnold to succeed"" and switched from professional wrestling to the big screen. Maybe Arnold thought ""Do like Jessie to succeed"" when he ran for the California state governor's seat.The mission was actually a con sprung by Dillon (Carl Weathers) to infiltrate the guerrillas and collect information. Dillon thinks he's got one on Dutch (Arnold), but he's the one who stepped into a big dudu not knowing the danger that awaits him. It's fight to the end for all of them once the hunt begins.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

One of my favorite nightcaps.,"I watched this movie for the fourth time yesterday, and it is now one of my ""personal classics"".My personal classics doesn't have to be great or classic, they just have to mean something to me, and the first time I saw it has got to me memorable.PREDATOR is such a movie. I always watch it late at night, since the first time I saw it I was 7 years old at 11 p.m (I was scared as hell).In action-terms, PREDATOR is a classic, compared to other movies in the genre it ranks high, and as an actionmovie it is a 10/10. But the rating can't be based on the fact that it is an actionmovie.If you love actionfilms this is your call. It's entertaining, trigger-happy and violent packed in a suspensful and mysterious enviroment. It has got special effects and Arnold. Now I'm not the hugest action-fan, but I still liked this movie and my rating is 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Predator 9/10,"Films that teeter the line of brutal horror and all-out action are hard to come by but Predator is an exception. Predator is absolutely my favorite alien horror film made over the likes of Alien, The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. I can't say that Predator is better because those are some rock-solid classics but Predator does get criminally overlooked and probably isn't looked in that category to most. Special effects for the late eighties were risky but it worked perfectly, the camouflaged movements of the Predator were original and powerful on screen. Predator itself, seems unbeatable and a worthy villain to be remembered in the horror genre. The kill scenes were all graphic, not showing mercy to anyone, and definitely unpredictable not knowing who the next victim would be until their character came to contact. The characters were strong and defined thanks to an incredible cast that made this seem like an actual deadly in combat rescue team. Jesse Ventura, Sonny Landham and Arnold had their hoaky one-liners but they were often funny and quotable. Definitely check out Predator for a great theme song, well thought out storyline and special effects, and relentless gory action.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Combat, mano a pseudopod.","As action flicks go, this one's pretty typical. Arnold leads the usual band of expert musclemen into some tropical country on a mercy mission, or was it a mercenary mission, picks up a pretty young Latina (Elpidia Carillo) after a furious battle with well-armed swarthy guerrillas who make easy targets, and encounters a -- well, an alien, while on his way back to meet the chopper at the rendezvous.As Arnold pointed out at the time of release, you really get two movies for one. A regular excursion action flick and a science-fiction action flick.Boy, are these guys macho. (One of them is one of those North American Indians with an intuitive, spiritual collective unconscious who senses when the thing is nearby.) And they carry the ugliest guns ever seen on screen.It's the kind of ""lost patrol"" movie in which the characters get picked off one by one by an unseen enemy until, in this example, only Arnold and Carillo are left alive to hop on the chopper. The major difference between most examples of the genre and this one is that the other examples ordinarily take breathers and give the characters a chance to chat, so we get to know them a little. Not much time for that here. A coffee break would mean one less opportunity for the group to shred the banana plants with their slugs and grenades.The alien gave me a bit of a problem, I have to say. Here he is, all decked out in high-tech equipment including a helmet that gives his vision infra-red capabilities. (He presses Arnold's head up against a tree and examines it carefully through this heat-registering device and you can tell what great shape Arnold is in because his nose is cold.) He's also got some kind of rocket launchers built into his arms and carries some strap ons that enable him to heal quickly or, failing that, to set off an atomic explosion.All of that high-tech stuff didn't bother me. But his organic evolution hasn't seem to have kept up with his technology. Okay, he's got opposable thumbs. Thank heaven for small favors. And he's bipedal. But that's about it. How do you design and build delicate equipment like that when your fingers end in claws? And when he removes his helmet we see that his mouth is surrounded by four maxillapods, crab-like claws that can serve no other purpose than to shovel food into his diminutive mouth. They've invented space travel but not the fork? Finally, his hair is made up into dreadful dreadlocks, which looks pretty retro from our perspective.What's this alien doing here anyway? ""He comes when the summer is hot,"" Elpidia intones. (A sissy after all.) He seems to be a trophy hunter. He skins the people he kills but then seems to do nothing with the body except burn it so he can add the skull to his collection. He fawns proudly over those skulls.Does he show any other values aside from the desire to kill other living beings and preserve their heads as trophies? What I mean is, does he have any NON-HUMAN traits? Well, actually no. While they are being pursued, Elpidia drops a weapon and Arnold stops her and says, ""No! He didn't gill you befawh because you vair unahmed."" Later on, though, he shows no such compunction about deciding to kill a wounded and unarmed Arnold. Then, too, when challenged directly by Arnold at the end, the alien unburdens himself of his technological accoutrements and faces Arnold hand to hand, raising the question of whether they have Roy Rogers movies on the place from whence the alien came.If you're a fan of action movies, Arnold, earth-bound science fiction, or any combination thereof, catch this one if you haven't seen it yet.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Whole New Level,"If you're gonna talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger's very best movies, there's no way 'Predator' can be left out of the conversation. Featuring a fantastic blend of sci-fi & action as directed by John McTiernan and a notable fun supporting cast. It also gave us one of the best creature villains who's popularity launched a franchise. This is a classic flick and for good reason.Major ""Dutch"" Schaefer (Schwarzenegger) and his team of highly skilled men are called in to rescue a foreign cabinet minister & his aides in the jungles of Central America. He's surprised to be briefed further on the ground by old war buddy Dillon (Carl Weathers) who's now CIA. Also dismayed to find he'll be accompanying his team in when they usually work alone. Things don't add up, one surprise after another and then horrified to find they're dealing with an extraterrestrial being. A huge 'Predator' (Kevin Peter Hall) with advanced tech who likes to hunt humans for sport.Arnold in his 80's prime physique is more than up to the task and the script is tailor made for him with the odd one liner. Weathers is a lot of fun, but also is every other member of Dutch's team. Bill Duke as Mac, Sonny Landham as Indian tracker Billy, Richard Chaves as ""Poncho"", Jessie ""The Body"" Ventura as Blain totting a minigun & Shane Black (writer/director) as Hawkins. The inclusion of a lone female role in Anna by Mexican actress Elpidia Carrillo is a nice twist to a very much macho story.The acting, action is first rate. The special effects, makeup work is cool. Great musical score by Alan Silvestri. There's also more than one legit scare and a light bit of gore. All this time later, I still watch 'Predator' regularly. It's a testament to mixing sci-fi, action & horror elements and having it come out this great.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Classic film. One of the best aliens created.,"As someone who grew up in the 1980s, I have a soft spot for the classic action movies of that era, and Predator is certainly no exception. This movie, directed by John McTiernan and released in 1987, is a thrilling and intense ride from start to finish, and it still holds up as a classic action movie to this day.One of the things that makes Predator so great is its cast. The movie features some of the biggest action stars of the 1980s, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, and Jesse Ventura, all of whom deliver strong performances. The chemistry between the characters is palpable, and you really feel like these guys are a team, which makes it all the more thrilling when they're picked off one by one by the titular Predator.Speaking of the Predator, this is one of the greatest movie monsters of all time. The creature's design is iconic, with its dreadlocks, mandibles, and glowing eyes, and the practical effects used to bring it to life are still impressive to this day. The Predator is a formidable foe for the human characters, and the tension builds throughout the movie as they try to figure out how to defeat it.But Predator isn't just a mindless action movie. It's also a great example of the science fiction genre, with its exploration of the Predator's technology and society. The movie hints at a larger universe beyond what we see on screen, and it's clear that the writers put a lot of thought into the Predator's backstory.Overall, Predator is a movie that holds a special place in the hearts of many who grew up in the 1980s, and it's easy to see why. It's a thrilling action movie with great performances, impressive practical effects, and a memorable monster. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend giving it a watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Hunters Become the Hunted,"This movie begins with a helicopter carrying a unit of 6 mercenaries into Guatemala for a meeting with an American general who wants to use this group to rescue a high ranking diplomat who has been kidnapped by revolutionaries and taken to a secret jungle hideout across the border. Although the leader of the group, ""Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger) doesn't particularly like the fact that an outsider by the name of ""George Dillon"" (Carl Weathers) is assigned as the leader of the team even though the two have worked together in the past. His suspicions are further raised when he learns that some of the things he was told during his initial briefing weren't necessarily accurate. However, his suspicion turns to shock when he discovers that someone-or something-is hunting his group and killing them one-by-one. Now rather than reveal too much of this movie I will just say that this was a decent science-fiction film for the most part with the action being definitely showcased above everything else. Admittedly, the suspense wasn't sharp as it could have been and the script was quite basic as well. But then, considering the cast I suppose this shouldn't come as a complete surprise. In any case, this movie was still enjoyable enough as far as action films are concerned and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why did I waste my time with this movie?,"When I was a kid Arnold Schwarzenegger was some kind of an icon to me. I loved the Terminator movies, I loved 'True Lies', I loved 'Commando'... You get the point. I loved nearly everything with Arnold in it. Even the movie where he was pregnant... How did I manage to miss one of his most iconic movies I will never know.Of course, I am talking about 'Predator'. A few years ago they aired it here on the TV but, sadly(luckily?) there was 'Rambo 2' on some of the other channels and I decided watching the Sly movie rather than the Arnold movie. I haven't watched TV for years.A few days ago I suddenly remembered that I wanted to see 'Predator' and, of course, I saw it immediately.I just shouldn't have done it. Sorry. It was very stupid, and, what is worse, it was the wrong kind of ""stupid"".Let me tell you what happened: The first five minutes looked promising. I really thought it was going to be a great movie. It had cool looking soldiers, cool tropic atmosphere, etc... During the first 30 minutes I had great fun with the movie. At the end of the first hour I still thought it was OK. But after that... By the time the final confrontation between The Arnold and The Predator happened I had started playing solos on my guitar using the movies' soundtrack as a backing track. Alan Silvestri did a great job, by the way... To sum it up - the movie went from great to very funny, from very funny to OK, from OK to ""Why the hell am I wasting my time with this bore-fest?!"" You may ask me why, and, of course, being the nice person that I am, I would respond to that question. As I already said, this movie was stupid. I don't have any problems with that. In fact, I love stupid action movies. They are funny. However even the dumbest action movie out there must have at least one character that I would root for. And that is the biggest problem of 'Predator'. There is NO such thing here. Sorry. 'Predator' is an example of how NOT to do character development. None of the characters was developed. We didn't know anything about their desires, nor we did know anything about their back story, nor we did know anything important about them - except the fact that The Black Dude was in love with Jesse Ventura's character and the Dude With The Glasses loved to talk about his girlfriends' private parts, and the Native American Dude was a native American. That is all. Really. Oh, and Jesse Ventura loved chewing tobacco. But really, there is pretty much NOTHING else. Now tell me, can an action movie be any good when its' main characters have less personality than action figures? The director and the actors should not be blamed - they did what they could with a script so utterly horrible it wouldn't be filmed even into a B-movie if the Universe was a better place than it is. The entire story of the movie can be summed up in ONE sentence and the characters are zero-dimensional. I will not spoil it here but you get the point.And you probably don't agree with me but that is fine. I am used to people thinking I am wrong.I was disappointed by this movie.

If you haven't seen this one, what the hell is wrong with you, this is amazing and pretty much the best performance you'll ever get out of Arnie... In a world where Michael Bay and Zack Snyder have their own respective movie franchises I have to keep wondering why no one gives McTiernan another chance... If you ever want to see awesome action movies (regardless of the time they were made) you have to see this, and the other movies McTiernan made (Die Hard, all I have to say...).

What makes Predator so insanely good is: 1.) Characters- They all act realistically(unlike marines in Aliens) and they work as a team really well together. Even though there isn't a lot of time in the movie for character development they are still very well distinguished and memorable. 2.) Soundtrack- Something else... Brilliantly composed by Alan Silvestri far more nuanced then Back to the Future only adds more layers of depth to the whole movie as it's perfectly captures the essence of the jungle and the whole action horror sci-fi themes. 3.) Cinematography- This movie is shot in real life jungle and Donald McAlpine perfectly captures the atmosphere with carefully placed imagery which only act to draw the viewer more into the movie. 4.) Direction- It's well established fact that John McTiernan is one of the best action directors of all time and it really shows in the movie. Perfect pacing and very well shot in general with a lot of clarity in the scenes as to what is happening on screen. 5.) Predator himself -There can barely be anything new said to just how well realized the creature is. Very believable scary and awesome. A perfect adversary for the commandos, maybe a little overpowered, but that only adds to the tension and the whole despair of the situation they are in as they try to survive.All of these work together perfectly to draw the viewer into the film and you will be finding yourself forgetting that you are indeed watching a movie. A very claustrophobic and tense atmosphere manifests itself into the movie and i at times felt anxiety because of it. When a movie induces anxiety in you you know it's a very good movie. The only other movies i remember that did that was Alien 1979 and The Thing 1982.There have been complaints about the thin plot of the movie, but that hardly diminishes the quality of the movie as Predator is more about situation the commandos found themselves in than it is about the plot. The only complaint i have is maybe the silly one-liners at the beginning of the movie and also editing lacking in some places, but those are quickly forgotten as the whole movie is just so good.In the end Predator is a masterpiece along with Alien 1979 and The Thing 1982. It takes the viewer brilliantly through the movie as you watch the noose getting tighter and tighter and the tension rising and rising all the way to it's brilliantly realized conclusion. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Classic Ah-nuld action !,"They really don't make movies like this any more. The end of the 80's was the golden era of big-screen macho violence. Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, Rambo, Predator, Terminator, you name it.

This is how an action film must be made.,"John Mctiernan's Predator is an amazing action sci-fi, the likes of which have never been remade again. Starring the Austrian oak Arnie who was at the height of his popularity Predator is an exhaustive thrill ride choc o bloc with amazing sequences and one liners which are popular to this day. The plot is basic: An alien spaceship lands in the forests of Peurto Rico and slaughters some US marines. A batch of elite military rescue team led by US Army special forces Dutch(Arnie) are sent to find out what happened. The film takes its time and we barely get any glimpse of the Predator but before you know it the action begins as the Predator starts dispatching Dutch's team one by one. Mctiernan is a massively capable filmmaker and the camera practically dances throughout the film. This is one unmissable movie and you owe it to yourself to see it.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"""If It Bleeds We Can Kill It...""","Predator finds Arnie in his prime taking on an alien in the jungle. The film is directed by John McTiernan who also directed Die Hard the following year. Arnie is surrounded by various 80's tough guys including Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham and Jesse Ventura. The action scenes are really well done, old school, no CGI here, and especially impressive is the initial assault by the team. The camaraderie between all the soldiers is great and we have a film packed with instantly quotable lines. The soundtrack adds to the atmosphere and the Predator is a genuinely fearsome adversary. The only complaint i have with the film is i feel the final 3rd drags slightly and loses some of the tension when we are down to just Arnie and the Predator. This is a mild gripe though. In summary, a genuine classic which has yet to be matched by any of the sequels.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Arnold, Action, Aliens and Armaments in a Classically '80s Military Throwdown","Having lost a chopper filled with political hot potatoes behind enemy lines, the US sends in a meathead commando unit to locate and, hopefully, extract them. Along the way, they just so happen to get caught in the crosshairs of an invisible extraterrestrial stalker, who gleefully hunts the entire team for sport.As an adrenaline-pumping, bullet-riddled 1980s action movie (starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, no less), one can accurately predict exactly what type of cinematic experience this is. And it doesn't disappoint: we're served a buffet of idiotic one-liners, baby-oiled biceps, dismembered limbs, explosive firestorms and cute personality traits. More surprisingly, we also get a fairly effective science fiction thriller, one that's become remarkably influential in the thirty years since its premiere.Filmed in an age before computer-rendered effects were the norm, Predator still looks convincing and impressive, especially in regards to the alien monster himself. His advanced arsenal is borderline revolutionary, a fantastic mix of high-tech and low that never quite breaks the illusion of reality, and his getup is both sleekly futuristic and functionally simple. He's a conundrum, hard to handle for a variety of reasons, which makes his lengthy final battle with Arnold (seriously did not remember how long those two went mano a mano) all the more interesting.An unusually fresh, consistent example of an era and genre mix that doesn't usually age very well. Too bad about the sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Its a big dumb film that is too light on the fun to make it enjoyable.,"John McTiernan's 107 minute salute to muscles is a huge cheesy mad monster movie. Everything you need to know about this movie is summed up in a hand clasp between Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers, biceps bulging and glistening with moisture.Schwarzenegger's team of covert soldiers (most of whom have bodybuilders physique) are dropped into a mission to rescue hostages. They do so by conspicuously blowing up every single building in the village. Imagine my surprise when the hostage turns up dead. Then maybe there's some CIA ulterior motives. They go into it, but they don't. A couple of hostile ""I used to trust yous"" are shouted. I don't consider these spoilers because they aren't - this is just the reason for having the team in the jungle so the Predator can attack.The Predator lacks the cool intimidation of the Terminator or the panic inducing presence of the Alien. He looks kind of like a Native American tribal leader mated with Darth Vader. The visuals are fairly dated too, especially plasma blasts. Throughout the film, the cast of Kings of Iron battles the unseen Predator, including one incredible sequence where the entire team hurles a tsunami of lead at the jungle without even stopping to ask what Mac is shooting at. The action sequences are OK, but nothing is particularly memorable. The cheesy dialogue offers a bunch of pearls that is the biggest asset of the film: - ""Stick around"" - ""Get to the chopper!"" - ""This stuff will make you a god damned sexual Tyrannosaurus, just like me - "" I ain't got time to bleed!""Did I mention that this is a salute to the male form? Boy is it. Schwarzenegger and co seem to strip down faster than the cast of Magic Mike. A couple of deliberately constructed scenes focus on Weather's rippling six pack or Schwarzenegger's huge arms.There wasn't anything particularly dull or insulting about Predator, but its a big dumb film that is too light on the fun to make it enjoyable.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"One of the best sci-fi, horror, action films ever made!","You know, I've heard all kind of things about this movie. Most people would call it one of the best action movies of all time. I thought to myself ""That might be slightly overexagerated"" since it had Arnold as the main lead and a couple of other half known actors. And honestly I was never a fan of Arnold or his acting capabilities. It didn't seemed like anything special to me. Until I watched it. And let me tell you 107 minutes after I was in my bed completely captivated and fascinated by what I just saw. Needles to say I won't be going through a plot analysis, but instead I'll be mentioning some of the things that this movie does incredibly well. Ready? Here we go!Firstly and foremost is the fantastic musical score. I haven't heard a more fitting, elevating and noticeable score in a horror movie since Jaws. Truly Alan Silvestri is a genius and all his other works are just as good. Shame he never got an oscar. The atmosphere of the movie was significantly increased by the musical score and by how it combined jungle-wondering motifs with hardcore action motifs. Truly a work of art!Flashed out characters: In a 5 minute scene we get to know all the characters in this movie and each and everyone seem flashed out and unique individuals. And all in one helicopter scene. Man, I miss characters like this in a movie nowadays.Brooding atmosphere: As I mentioned earlier when talking about the musical score, the atmosphere is fantastic especially because of the musical score but also because of the place where the movie was shot. The whole movie happens in a jungle and the sense that something is lurking there in the dark is what raises the tension higher as the movie progresses.Different genres that switch between each other in matter of scenes or minutes: We start off like a military extraction movie which takes place in a jungle with lots of action and then the movie changes to a dark acttion packed horror movie. The horror elements even intertwine with the military action type scenes somewhere in the first act. But nothing feels rushed or not enough flashed out. And that brings me along to the next point which is:The excellent pacing of the movie: The movie is only 107 minutes long. And while other action movies like T2 or Aliens or TDK are at least 2 hours and a half long this movie manages to that in 107 minutes which might seem crazy. But the pacing is pitch perfect. There's character time, there's action, there are crazy one liners, there is horror, humor and lots more. And all flows so well in this movie. Everything feels fully flashed out and developed and nothing appears as rushed or choppy.There are also clever characters that act like human beings and take rational, clever and logical decisions. Unlike recent movies where the entire movie is just a conglomerate of stupid decisions, this movie actually has clever characters that take smart decisions and are actually hard to kill. That's why when they do get killed it's gory, impactful and somewhat heartbreaking.Sparingly used creature. Just like in Jaws this movie uses the creature sparingly. Most of the horror scenes are filmed from the creature's perspective allowing the viewer to feel a sense of terrror and rising tension, not knowing what follows our leads and what could that creature be.Speaking of it, the creature design is awesome. All is done using a human dressed as a Predator. It's only when the creature is seen invisible that the CGI comes in play, but that is not much and it doesn't distract from the movie. Everything about the creature felt real and authentic, unlike modern movies where most of the things are done via CGI. It's nice to see some good old practical effects.Speaking of them, the effects, both practical and visual are fantastic for a movie from that time. From the quick space scene in the begining to the invisible creature, they are all used sparingly and with impact when they're needed.Good performances all across the board, especially Arnold who feels very diferent in this movie. It's obvious that he is playing a unique character, unlike anything we've seen in other movies like the Terminator franchise. Nice to see Arnold actually doing pretty good acting.The movie also cleverly subverst viewer's expectations, going from an action-adventure movie to an action-horror movie basically between act 1 and 2. Unlike newer movies, this movie actualy cleverly subverts viewer's expectations by rewarding his interest in a different way than what the viewer expected, while also not breaking the narative of the movie. Take notes your round-headed simpleton director of The Last Jedi!The movie also ends pretty short and quickly, which is always a good thing in horror-action movies.If I were to pick a flaw in the movie or a gripe I might have with it, it'll be that the motivations of the creature are somewhat not explored enough, or it seems pretty hard to figure out. Maybe that's just me. I did however understood something and it was enough for me to keep me invested in the movie and curious until the very end.So, to sum up Predator. This movie is a classic, belonging to a different era of filmmaking. An era in which writing was sharp, characters were flashed out and the story was logical and coherent. Sadly movies like this are not being made today anymore. What a shame! Anyway a 10/10 from me!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than many of today's movies of the same genre,"Despite being from the 1980s, this film holds up! The action, the tension, the fear and emotion are all palpable and authentic. It avoids (in most places) being overacted and overdone. It builds genuine suspense. I can only imagine attending ""Predator"" in theaters; what a blast it used to be to go to the movies!Arnold is really good in this movie. He plays his role practically perfectly, landing some unexpected jokes with great timing and alternating between brains and brawn. Carl Weathers also does a nice job and deserves credit for his performance.The more minimal effects were honestly refreshing after movies that are now compromised of so much green screen and CGI. I think moviegoers/watchers are pushing for more minimalist movies again. After watching ""Predator"" (for the first time), I am starting to lean that way myself.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I ain't got time to bleed.,"'Predator' is (alongside with Die Hard) one of the most important and best Hollywood action films of all times. It is a masterpiece. No one expects some thought provoking ideas from movie where Arnold Scwarzenegger fights with monster in the jungle. 'Predator' as one can expect doesn't rely on deep, but still well written (the humor and banter between characters is enjoyable) script, as much as the chemistry between characters and well orchestrated action scenes combined with fantastic score bu Alan Silvestri. The plot is very thin and honestly pretty poor B-movie material, and it all started with a joke about Rocky ran out of opponents on Earth so his next fight will be with an extra-terrestrial. Well, from that small joke one awesome action film grew out that any cinemaphile can enjoy and appreciate. Even if you find the plot thin as one layered toilet paper you can't over look John McTiernan's genius directing.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun,"This film is one of my favorite guilty pleasures.  A bunch of steroidal pro- wrestlers...I mean, a small group of special forces soldiers (and one pro- wrestler) are sent into the humid depths of the South American jungle on a top secret mission.  A bunch of cool explosions and one pretty prisoner later, the mission is accomplished...but the movie has just begun.  Something is stalking the unit through the green hell of the steamy jungle, something not human.Predator doesn't waste time with character development, or even much in the way of plot.  It's basically a chase film, but that's fine.  I don't always want a brainy, intellectual film...sometimes I want cinematic junk food, and this film fits the bill perfectly.  The self-camouflaging, tarantula-faced, green-dredlocked monster is really very cool, standing well over 7 feet tall and blasting the crap out of the overly confident and testosterone drenched soldiers with some pretty spiffy weapons.  Even Arnie gets the crap kicked out of him... a guilty pleasure in itself, considering the fact that I live in California and paid full ticket price to watch the crap-fest that was ""True Lies.""  Seriously though, this isn't a GREAT film, but it's good fun, a sort-of bare bones ""Alien.""  If you like nasty, scary monsters and sweaty soldiers getting slaughtered, have a few beers and watch ""Predator.""  You won't regret it in the morning.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
His skin must have looked fab after the mud therapy,"Aaah, the glorious 80s movies, of nil to no common sense, way out storylines and rip-roaring, adrenaline-pumping action scenes. Predator has all of this, even the alien makes sure of the wild hairdo input and of course, Arnie takes care of the thrilling action. For action speaks louder than words, and in Predator it also speaks much louder than logic.First saw this when I was a kid and quite frankly, I had no care for anything making sense, both in movies and real life, so Predator was a real blast for me to watch, as it was with all my friends. The action scenes, especially the final battle really blew me away back then and now, having seen it again, 37 years later, I still am very impressed with this movie.Unfortunately there has to be a 'however' moment or two here, as I am now 52 and have a slightly better comprehension of what makes sense and what doesn't. So yes, the action is fantastic, however, many things in Predator just don't make sense. I'm not going to drag the movie down, however, because Arnie lifts this movie to great heights, as does the camera work and incredible imagery, and as I say, the finale is brilliant.If you're looking for an action-packed movie with stone-faced characters, minimal dialogue and one ugly, scary creature, then Predator has to be included on movie night, with lots of popcorn.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A daily comment from Midget Emma: Predator (1987),"Its always been Alien vs Predator. I have never seen any of them at all. So i thought i would watch the original movies. I watched Alien and Aliens. Then i watched this. It was good but i would go with the Alien series.Predator was a good sci-fi action movie. But there was a problem. It was the same thing over and over. It gets old hearing the sound of twigs breaking and the actors saying ""what was that?"". But that isn't all that happens. There is plenty of action and gore to enjoy. Arnold Schwarzenegger is as good as he has ever been. The thing that makes a movie like this is the monster. The Predator was pretty cool. He has the mask on for most of the movie but when he takes it off you may say ""WOW"".Something that rarely happens in a movie is when you start watching it and it doesn't feel like something is going to happen. When i started watching this it didn't feel like there was going to be a monster in the jungle. This adds a lot of value.I recommend this if you are an Arnold fan or want to watch it because you are a fan of monster movies. I also recommend it if you have seen the Alien movies. Not a bad movie but it has some dull moments. Next on my list to watch Predator 2.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

What a pile of...,"First of all, Predator is NOT Ah-nuld's best film, not by a long stretch of the imagination. That honour belongs to Total Recall, one of the few Ah-nuld films that can be described as intelligent. In fact, Predator is one of Ah-nuld's most ordinary films, especially in light of the comparison between he and his co-stars' macho posing in this film and the real actors in the sequel.There is one highlight of the acting in this film - Carl Weathers. His acting raises the bar above pantomime during the sequences he is in, but the story and character development don't give him a lot to work with. Granted, this is supposed to be an action film, but the best action films develop their characters to some extent during their running time. The recent X-Men feature is a great example of this.What's even more appalling is that actors from this film are winning positions in America's government. I thought they learned the lesson from when Ronald Reagan became president - actors do not make good leaders. Macho posturing worked in the film industry of the 1980s, but it is not what I'd like to see in government at any era.Unfortunately, as time goes on, it gets less and less kind to this film. Ah-nuld's track record has certainly gotten worse in the last ten years, with him obviously forgetting that people don't go the theatre in order to have some right-wing Fundie agenda pushed at them (eg End Of Days and The Sixth Day). None of the other actors have done anything memorable since, and it's probably just as well.All in all, I'm giving Predator 3 out of 10. It's entertaining to watch once or twice, but that's about the extent of it.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Timeless,"Another one of my all-time favorites.A little context first: This is a movie that has always been a part of my life. I grew up with it. The Predator has always been my favorite movie monster. It was the first R-Rated film I ever watched. And the first horror film I ever watched. And it was the movie that got me interested in the horror and science fiction genres! And it introduced me to Arnold Schwarzenegger, who, after checking out more of his films, became one of my heroes.This movie, while suffering from some logistical issues, is just as awesome now as it was when I was a kid.It's so simple but it's so effective! It's built on an incredibly simple concept, and it just wrings all that it can out of it! (An apt way to describe the creature itself.) At the time of its release it received negative reviews because the plot was very thin. While that's true, it, as I just said, does the very best with everything at its disposal, rendering that issue, among other issues, forgivable.There are plenty of memorable lines, including a lot of classic Arnold one-liners.The movie is really well-shot! Except for in one sequence but I'll get to that. The way the camera pans along with the characters as they move through the jungle. Jon McTeirnan did an amazing job at making the jungle feel unsettling. And the creepy shots from the Predator's POV! And there are several shots in this movie that could serve as an awesome desktop wallpaper! Like the one at night where the Predator is just firing his plasma caster blindly into the trees.The score is absolutely fantastic! It's well-used, and does a great job at setting the tone and building the tension.Speaking of the tension, it's very palpable!You care about the characters! There's not much to them, but they feel like they're buddies, they work well together, and they're smart.The Predator is iconic for a reason! Not only is it intimidating, but the design is so original. (Thanks Stan Winston.) And Kevin Peter Hall really brought a creepy gracefulness to the creature's movements, thanks to his ballet experience. (May he Rest In Peace. If you look up 'Gentle Giant' in the dictionary you'll see a picture of him!) And how about those sounds it makes?The sound design is awesome!The practical effects hold up extraordinarily well! You could swear the Predator was made today! And the effects for the Predator's cloaking still look good! The rest of the digital effects certainly look dated and cheesy, but they're charming.Honestly, the movie as a whole feels timeless. There's plenty of movies from the 80s that feel like they're stuck in their time period, but Predator is not one of them.There's also something really funny to be found in this film's concept: These soldiers are played by these actors who are known for their brawn in previous movies, and for playing unbeatable characters in films like Commando, The Terminator, Rocky, or in Ventura's case, being a Pro-wrestler, are put up against the only thing that could possibly stop them: An alien with an arsenal of technologically advanced weapons, which includes a cloaking device. That's hilarious! Kind of satirical if you think about it! Was this intentional? Probably not, but even if it's just a happy accident, I'll take it!The acting is great! When these guys are supposed to look scared, they all looked terrified. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger! Yeah! Arnold was really convincing in this! Like when he shoots his gun at the Predator after kicking the gun from Anna's hands. Bill Duke really shined in this as well. Like when he was mourning the loss of Blaine, and when he was chasing after the Predator. And Carl Weathers is as intense as always. And when he was getting killed by the Predator, you really believed he was in pain.It's hard to blend multiple genres and make a good movie, but these filmmakers succeeded with flying colors!And holy crap this movie flies by!If I had to pick a favorite scene, it's a tie between the one where Dutch shouts ""Get to the choppa"". And when Dillon finally sees the Predator. He shows himself off to Dillon. You're cheeky, aren't you, Mister Predator?As I've said there are some things that don't make any sense. Like, how did nobody see them approaching the camp? I know why, because the terrorists weren't even looking where they should have been looking! Or why did Anna just decide to start speaking English? And Anna just basically went off into the jungle not knowing where to go.There were also some shots that were reused during the camp fight. They just cut them together really quick and zoomed in on them in the hopes that we wouldn't notice. But we did. There are also too many stunts and explosions and slow-motion. It was way too over-the-top. It honestly felt like it belonged in something like Commando. And all the constant static shots don't help that much either. When I saw this I thought to myself, ""McTiernan did this?"" As it turns out, he didn't. The second unit director did. However, the scene serves its purpose, which is to portray these soldiers as badasses. Then this alien arrives and shows them who's boss.There's also the line, ""There's something out there waiting for us. And it ain't no man."" And, ""That ain't no way for no soldier to die."" See the problems? I forget about these lines pretty quickly though. They're not terrible they just could've been better.There's some noticeable bad ADR.And how did that plasma shot not disintegrate Poncho's head?And ""Bad idea."" while funny, felt out of place.This movie is a science-fiction, horror, and action classic! Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Still Worth A Watch!,"Even after all these years, I still find Predator to be a movie I love to watch. Sure, the acting in places is corny, sure some one liners are bad on the ears, but you cannot take away the fact that when the fireworks start and the action starts, you forget everything and just get drawn into the movie. The double DVD collection is also well worth checking out as the Interviews on the second CD are very good, and do make you have a genuine chuckle or two.To the people who look upon movies to have reality and realism, come on!

Headache,"I watched this around when it first came out maybe 30 years ago. I thought it was pretty good.After this recent viewing I've concluded it's not watchable, at least not for me.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
The idea of the story is unique as it turns the primitive drive to hunt upside down. Coupled with
vastly superior high-tech weaponry and communications ... and it's a bit of a mismatch.But all that does not a film make. Nope. You need a well-developed story, not just parts that shine.The story is covered in and oozes cliche. It's a machco-man ""tough guy"" fest that probably appeals
to those who have diminished sense of quality storytelling.This is not storytelling. It's noise.ACTING:
When two of your central characters were showmen and governors (yep Reagan too), it's likely the acting
as a whole sucks. Well, for the parts they played they were appropriately picked, and delivered what was
asked for. (Frankly, I think Ventura had far better acting skills that ""Arnold."")The crew did fine, but again, the whole flick is wrapped in a blanket of noise, sweat and testosterone. These
are actors who have little (if any) character range, so I wouldn't watch much else they did. Note: ""Arnold""
was a perfect pick for the original terminator, and largely because he did not talk much.TEMPO:
Loud music, explosions, large biceps ... and they just keep on coming ... and that's a headacheCINEMATOGRAPHY:
Actually OK, except the dramatic action score is constant. This is normally a sign that something is
missing in the actual filming process. In this case it's two things: the story and acting.DIRECTING / WRITING:
The director clearly only had one gear: pandering to males on speed. Full disclosure: I actually enjoyed his
film ""The 13th Warrior"" ... yes, yes, many think it blew. That aside, his skills were extremely narrow.The writer was ""Mr. Predator,"" because it appears to have been both an obsession and ""cash cow"" for him. Oy.Is it a good film? No.Should you watch this once? No, unless you like noise and intestinesRating: 5.0.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hard to evaluate in context.,"Older sci-fi films are difficult to evaluate because we're comparing it to modern films with better technology. I evaluate films as objectively as I can, without any emotional bias. So nostalgia is a main factor that I need to overlook.First this film must be evaluated correctly in its time frame. In 1987, this film's special effects is exceptional. Also, the costume design was just amazing. The predator really does look like a real living entity rather than just cheap CGI or a man with a mask.2ndly, the story. Again, evaluating it correctly, this story is original and we must credit it for its originality rather than comparing it to later movies of the same genre that took its idea from this original premise. The story itself is every well written, keep you in suspense and in mystery, trying to find out what is this ""predator"" that is hunting them.The movie is often miscategorized as strictly sci-fi action, because it is also a horror genre and contains elements of a horror feature and again the film does it quite well. This the same as Alien, the 1st movie by Ridley Scott, which was a space sci-fi horror.Overall it is a very good film, that whole 80s macho man movie. The story set up is also well paced and well structured.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What's not to like?,"Of all Arnold movies, this is my favorite. Hell, I will easy put it into my top 10 list of all time. The score, from the get-go, is pure perfection. Including the jungle drums. And despite sequels that just got worse (I'm looking at YOU, The Predator), this havent deminished the pure quality of the 1st. Maybe it's because Arnold opted out for any sequel, keeping the faith of Dutch in the dark. It's hands on a MEN movie, which is overstated when Jessie Ventura holds the most redicilous speech ever. To think Shane Black, who co-starred as the only marine that looks like Joe Everybody, managed to destroy the franchise years later... shame on you, Shane. Most of all, it got the most iconic movie beast ever. Just like Jaws, we never really see it in it's full glory before the final showdown. For me, this is a perfect movie in every way. And I have to funny trivias. The Predator was supposed to be played by Van Damme, who refused the role when he found out his face was covered behind a mask. And Sonny Landham, playing Billy, had a bodyguard. Not to protect HIM. It was because Sonny had a tendency to randomly attack people on set.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Never gets old,"Predator was a thrilling , suspenseful macho action film that was aided by the tension building and anxiety inducing background music and the incredibly believable performance by the entire commando cast. It starts out as a generic 80s action flick with funny cheesy lines but after the team drops into the jungle , predator becomes a whole another monster. The nerve wracking music starts playing and everything suddenly becomes tense and claustrophobic. The writing though corny is memorable with several unforgettable one liners that still sound awesome. The predator , an 8 foot tall blood seeking , spine ripping translucent being that can't be talked or shot down was a very original and horrifying entity that made this movie a masterpiece. Very impressive acting , tense building music and a beast of a villain made this movie a phenomenally entertaining action flick.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Perfect Entertainment,"Continuing my plan to watch every Arnie movie in order, I come to his first multi million dollar pay day ($3,000,000) in Predator.Plot In A Laragraph: A special team of commandos on a mission in a Central American jungle are hunted by an extra terrestrial killer.Predator is quite simply one of the best action movies ever made. End of.It starts off like ""Rambo"" and ends up like ""Aliens"". It even has shades of ""Jaws"" thrown in, as the Predator is not actually shown on screen for about an hour, we see everything from then through it's eyes.The likable cast is headed by Arnie with steady support from Carl Weathers, Shane Black, Billy Duke, Sonny Ladham and Jesse Ventura.All the lead characters seem nice people to hang out and have a beer with, and an even better bunch of guys to go in to battle with. As they kick some serious ass in the first 30 minutes. I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here, as they all do an excellent job. Some of the cast were never as good before this movie, and never were again.Black is quite good in one of his rare spells in front of the camera, Ventura does what Ventura does,Ladham is effective as Billy and Weathers gives his best performance outside of the Rocky franchise, Although when he tells Arnie he is ""Expendable"" I couldn't help but think, if only those movies were as good as this.As for Arnie, who has contributed some tough fisted, hard as nails characters over the years. He'll never be a good dramatic actor, but he is a great action star and he has charisma in spades!! He is perfectly cast here. Behind ""Terminator 2"" this is his best movie ahead of True Lies.The score is another valuable asset to the movie, it's perfect.In his autobiography Total Recall, Arnie talks about how along with producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver he picked John McTiernan to direct (even though he only had one movie to his name) and when (following the success of this and Die Hard) they couldn't afford to hire him to direct the sequel, and he read the scrip (which Silver wouldn't change) he walked away from the franchise, and never worked with Silver again. He mentions Van Danme (the original Predator being a ""relentless complainer"" and calls the full experience ""an ordeal""Finishing the year, the 12th highest grossing movie of 1987, With a $59 million gross, Predator was a career high for Arnie, and his first movie to break the $50 million barrier at the domestic Box Office.To sum it up Predator is a highly professional piece of work, swift and suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for perfect entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Some of the best Practical Effects ever used!,"""Get To The Choppa""80's traditional cheese combined with wobbly (literally) computer graphics, corny acting, and a narrative with basically no depth; yeah that's pretty much what they had to offer. Now look, I know this is a cult classic for a lot of you out there and I do understand the affection and the nostalgia associated with the film; speaking for myself, I haven't grown up with these films and to be honest I never really was a 'Predator' fan in general so that plays its role as well!Although I would like to acknowledge the fact that I may have just witnessed some of the most well-curated stunt work and practical effects ever accomplished in a Hollywood title. Those were the times back then when makers used to have this principle to invest their time and resources into practical layouts rather than overly relying upon post-production work! And if you ask me, I would choose practical effects over CGI any day! There's no debate, practical effects almost always come out on top; if done properly!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
simple 80s action fun,"An alien pod lands on earth. Meanwhile, a special ops team is brought in to rescue a cabinet minister on a downed helicopter in a remote jungle rebel territory. CIA agent Dillon (Carl Weathers) calls in his friend Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Dutch's team usually works alone but Dillon insists on joining the group. As soon as they reach the crash site, it's obvious to Dutch that Dillon isn't giving them the whole truth. They find mutilated bodies of Green Berets hanging upside down. They attack the guerrilla compound and take Anna (Elpidia Carrillo) prisoner. However Russians with the guerrillas are the least of their problems.This is simple 80s action fun. It's got the prerequisite great campy lines but it's not only Arnold that gets to deliver those lines. Jesse Ventura has ""I ain't got time to bleed."" It's also a great start to the franchise. There is one thing that critics seem to miss at the time. The title of the movie is predator. The alien is a big game hunter. It's not a war or else the predator would just nuke the place. He skins the Green Berets like somebody on a safari. The plot is super simplistic. This is all fun and all action.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Solid but to a degree overrated,"Predator released in 1987 is seemingly considered one of Arnold's best films and one of his more prominent well know roles.Do not quite understand it's such high praise. A majority of the film is rather slow moving, lacks any real suspense or thrills and the action sequences aren't that spectacular either. Also far in and between. The supporting characters weren't exactly memorable and were simply one dimensional.Compared to what people are saying, this film is highly disappointing. Perhaps it's a product of its time and a lot of the charm is from its nostalgia factor.The film is definitely more engaging once we see more of the Predator after he takes out each member of Arnold's crew. Once both Arnold and the Predator engage face to face, there was a lot of awkward tension from the Predator, as he teasing killing Arnold too much. He had him right there to kill yet decided to continue teasing and ultimately letting him free.The overall design of the creature is great and menacing as it's easily the highlight but he seemed a little too silly.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
""" Billy!  You ain't afraid of no man!  There is something out there, . . and it ain't no man ""","The planet earth is home to a plethora of savage, vicious and lethal killers. However, they dim in comparison to the most dangerous hunter of them all, . . . . the Human animal. Thus it is incredible to discover, despite all of his creative weapons and intelligence, this Human Hunter itself has come to the attention of a new menace. The story itself was created by John and Jim Thomas who with director John McTiernan offer this incredible and fantastic film called "" Predator. "" It tells the tale of a planetary visitor who's ancestors have been visiting earth for generations hunting the most dangerous animals on Earth. It's challenge is to confront a special squad of professional soldiers in a duel to the death. R.G. Armstrong plays General Phillips who with C.I.A. Operative Dillion (Carl Weathers) invite the finest American team leader available lead by Major Dutch, (Arnold Schwarzenegger) their operation's commander to seek out and rescue a special cabinet minister from enemy hands. Taking the elite members like Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Shane Black, Richard Chaves and Sonny Landham as Billy, Dutch begins by dropping into a dense South American Jungle and discovers the gorilla rebels are low caliber soldiers and nothing compare with them or their real enemy. What begins as an exercise in jungle combat, the special Team suddenly realizes it's up against a sophisticated alien (Kevin Peter Hall) out to not only defeat, but to kill and display them as trophies. Elpidia Carrillo is Anna, who tries to explain, the strange killer has visited earth many years before. This movie is terrific in it's inception, violent in it's delivery and wonderfully graphic in it's confrontation between Earthmen and their Nemesis. Schwarzenegger will no doubt go on to make other great films, but this dramatic movie will nonetheless become a sci-fi Classic for all time. Superb!

"Cheesy lines, over the top and unbelievable action sequences, but this is why I loved it","""Predator"" is a classic and if you love action and science fiction, you have to watch it. There are tons of cheesy, but memorable lines and action scenes that are completely unbelievable. But this is exactly why I loved this piece of entertainment. The movie manages to create a lot of tension. We know that there is something hunting our heroes, but we don't know what is the threat. Halfway through, we understand what soldiers need to face. This push the audience to stick around (pun intended), and see what will happen. Even if the ending is pretty predictable, we see that the company struggles to defeat the Predator. They are not indestructible, they show their emotions and they are genuinely afraid. Even Schwarzenegger has issues to end the fight and you really wonder if he is gonna make it.The first installment of the Predator franchise is good, real good, and has all the right ingredients of a solid, adrenalinic action movie. The acting is overall nice, maybe in some parts a little bit cringey, but this is also a movie that has more than 30 years, and clearly a lot changed since then. However, I think that a lot of modern productions should take notes, on how to build tension and suspence. The jungle is the perfect environment, as the thick vegetation does not let you see clearly elements around you, being on a constant danger, because of wild animals and of course an alien that can use active camouflage, attacking you by surprise. The soundtrack is really good, it is dynamic and fits perfectly.I strongly recommend this film, if you want to watch some good old school. Special effects may not be as good as today, but you can see that a lot of attention and care has been put on this work, it is aware of its limitations and it does not take himslef too seriously.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Mediocre 80's action flick redeemed by,"The original Predator is very 80's. Sometimes that's a bad thing. Like when they stumble on the guerilla base and it turns into ""The A-team"". Offensive the way those bad guys are stereotypical, Spanish-speaking puppets, mowed down by the dozen. Then later, in contrast, the black guy's friend dies (the tobacco-chewing, cowboy- hat-wearing, Southern fella), and the film goes all teary-eyed on you. Ridiculous. Also strange how at the beginning, Arnie says his is a rescue team, not an assassination team. Then later they happily rank up video game kill count numbers.About Arnie, he does a good a job of playing the responsible team leader. The few one-liners he lays down don't work the way they do in some of his other movies, and I don't find the way he survives later on all that believable. But overall, I think he was well cast.So what is it that redeems Predator? Two things: the phenomenal soundtrack (it really is) and of course the (very cool) predator character. You don't get to see much of it for a good while, but the threat is looming. In conjunction with that, is Billy, the Native American looking guy and to me the most memorable of the bunch. His hunter's instinct senses the predator, even if they can't see it, and leaves his team worried. At one point, he tells the others that he is afraid and that whatever is hunting them, is not a man",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Ultimate Movie Experience,"I saw this movie when I was 5 years old, and still, at the age of 32, I watch it nearly every year. I never tire of this masterpiece.Why is it one of the greatest action/sci-fi/horror films of all time? Because it's director John McTiernan at his best, it has a cast of talented macho men running around in the jungle firing witty dialogue and big guns at every leaf or tree branch that looks out of place, and the slow-burn build-up to the epic last act keeps your heart rate steadily increasing until you think it's going to explode out of your chest.The Predator itself is one of the best designed creatures in the history of creature design. Stan Winston's imagination has been immortalised by this creature alone.The greatest part of the movie though: Alan Silvestri's thumping, pumping, bravely brass score. It's close to being the most perfect score to have ever been written for a movie. Every note, every horn, every drum beat feels like if the film had a bone fide soul, Silvestri was channelling it.If you have not seen this movie, there may be something wrong with you, so get to the video store, fly there on a chopper if you have to, and see what a real action movie looks like.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Of course, Arnie turns the tables, if just barely, but here is one of few times when he is very evenly matched with his opponent.  This movie isn't just about action; it's about well thought-out action, and while the antagonist is out of this world, the procession of events is VERY believable.This was also my first exposure to the musical handiwork of Alan Sylvestri, whose musical dynamic ranges from the potent main theme to a trumpet voluntary, heard over Mac's eulogy to his buddy Blain and just before the close of the movie.  Good stuff, which has had me looking for more of his handiwork.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Run Of The Mill 1980s Schwarzenegger film.,Having never seen this 1980s release starring Arnold Schwarzeneggar in his mid 80s action movie peak what better time than now? The story is about a rescue team lead by Dutch (Schwarzeneggar) sent behind enemy lines in the Cambodian jungle to rescue a cabinet minister. The rescue team along with 'Apollo Creed' Carl Weathers as a CIA agent who Dutch knows are attacked one by one by a mysterious enemy that bleeds a green blood.In one scene thousands of rounds of ammunition are discharged blindly into the jungle overgrowth to try and kill the object. When trying to meet up with the extraction helicopter all hell breaks loose as a camouflaged creature is detected. A human like figure with this camouflage technology. The remainder of the film sees characters killed one by one until Dutch attacks the figure using spikes and booby traps.Perhaps the film has dated as it showed no significance to me. The director John McTiernan went onto better things the following year with Die Hard. Schwarzeneggar isn't quite up to his hasta la vista standards of The Terminator. A boring film really. I won't watch again.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Old but gold Action Horror,"Ah, Predator, a movie that has surprised many viewers expecting a generic 80s Action movie and actually delivered a Horror Action movie and a very well done one at that.The movie starts out like a generic Action movie and suffers from bad dialogues and cheesy one-liners in the beginning, but soon changes into a very different, darker movie.It drops some hints that something bad might be happening in this jungle and once the Predator starts acting, the Horror movie begins.The atmosphere is serious and dangerous. And even though most of the movie was filmed during the day, the horror aspects work very well. There is something out there trying to kill the squad and these hardened, cool and competent soldiers are nothing more than prey once the Predator attacks.The movie is very gory which adds to the seriousness of it.The music takes a bit away from it but is not that bad overall.The cast is diverse and very well picked, the actors fit very well with their characters and work well together. Some of them might be a bit too muscular, but apart from that, they look like they actually do commando soldiering for a living. (and suspension of disbelief works very naturally here)
The acting is not great, but fine for what the movie tries to achieve. The character's dread, horror and rage are believable.There is not a lot of character development, but each character has their own personality and displays it in different ways.The CGI is fine, there a some scenes where it looks really bad and outdated, but overall it looks alright.The finale is a big action piece that really suffers from the movie's old age. The action is slow and boring compared to modern action. The idea of having a big confrontation between human and alien was pretty fresh at that time and is generally not a bad idea. It is just the execution that did not age well.Overall, the movie is old but well done. It shows a specific kind of horror, similar to Event Horizon, and honestly, it is probably the best kind of horror in my opionion. No jump scares underlined with sharp sound effects, just the feeling of everpresent dread.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Passable sci-fi action flick,"""Predator"" is a 1987 sci-fi action film that is considered a classic, spawning many sequels and spin-offs. At the same time, while I liked the movie, I found it nowhere near perfect.Visually, ""Predator"" may look good for 1987, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance is solid, the plot itself did not appeal to me, not even the concept: the fact that a team is being hunted by an alien is not original, as ""Alien"" used the same basic story before. Some scenes are stretched out and the film's running time in overall is way too long.The film score of ""Predator"" is repetitive and adds little to the atmosphere. The cinematography is somewhat good, and while John McTiernan's direction is also decent, he has done much better (see: ""Die Hard"").The film that I think does the best, if I had to choose, is creating a somewhat suspenseful atmosphere. It does this relatively well.So, while ""Predator"" looks good for 1987, has some fine suspense, fairly good acting, and the direction and cinematography are decent, the film has a number of flawed qualities that make it rather forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Good action, bad science-fiction","""Predator"" starts out really good. From the beginning, this is a heavy testosterone macho-flick. That is confirmed already in the opening scene, where the camera zooms in on Arnold's and Carl Weather's arms (and muscles) when they're having a strength duel. It continues in the same style, with a team of soldiers wandering around in the jungle with 70+ kg. each of weapons and ammunition but with no further supplies or food. Who needs that when we have the biggest machine guns in the world, eh? Especially one really heavyweight machine gun that looks like it runs on gasoline. That one is operated by no other than Jesse Ventura. If I had said in 1987 that the two most extreme muscle-guys in this film would be governors, I think everyone had thought it was extremely funny and unlikely. After the first half of the film (who involves a really good action scene), the film turns to science-fiction. This part is really boring and bad, and destroys the movie's hope in getting a good ranking. Therefore: 5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great Action Film.,"Predator is a great action film that combines military action with outer space creatures.A group of top notch military soldiers soon find that they are being hunted by a mysterious being.First off I want to say that the cast is really good in this film. Schwarzenneggar gives one of his best performances in a film and definitely one of his most under rated. He has a lot of great one liners (""stick around"", ""knock knock"") as well. Carl Weathers also is great in this film and I think he is one of the best supporting actors in the films that he is in notably ""Rocky"" and ""Happy Gilmore"". ALso you can not go wrong with Jessie Ventura in an action film.The Predator in this film is pretty cool. I like how they do not give away what he looks like right away to build suspense. The idea of a creature that blends in to the surroundings and kills is pretty cool. The Predator gets to do a lot of killing in this film and is a pretty good bad guy for a film.THere is no shortage of action in this film. Right off the bat there is a great gun fire battle between Schwarrzenneggars crew and some foreign country, I forget who they are. Then you have the Predator going against the entire group and an epic battle between Schwarzenneggar and the Predator one on one.Of all the Predator films this is the best by far and I strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Aaah the 80s.

OK bad example, there is nothing entertaining about reality TV.Predator harks back to a simpler time, when anything non-human needed a bullet, or better yet thousands, and the musclier you were the more likely it was you would win.Arnold is Dutch, and he and his team of well muscled meat-heads with names like Poncho, Blaine, Billy and Mack are venturing into the deep jungle with Dylan (Carl Weathers) in tow to represent the brass. This well trained and professional unit are used to this though, this is their job, they actually move through the dense jungle like soldiers not cowboys, everyone moves in unison without instruction aside from a quick whistle and a point or signal where necessary.Moving on, Dutch and co are on a search and rescue mission, only very early on they find there is precious little worth rescuing, and that most traces of those that needed rescuing will fit into a couple of jam jars. There are no tracks and little evidence that the deceased knew what was happening even as it happened... which is a concern to Dutch as the victims were all highly trained soldiers.As they continue on their mission it becomes evident that they are all being watched, Billy their Indian (looking at least) point man seems to twig first, he is Indian after all!After a pretty great gun battle where the good guys slaughter the bad with no casualties aside from a scratched arm (thank the Lord that Blaine ""Didn't have time to bleed"", that could have been serious!) the crew continue through to the extraction point with a young female hostage in tow. This is where the movie gets good-er-er.The previously unseen onlooker progressively becomes more evident, either he is lazier or they just thought the ""clickle-lickle-lickle"" sound effect wasn't going to be enough on it's own. In saying that though I guarantee if you play that two second grab to any guy under 50 and 90% of those guys will instantly recognise the origins, the other 10% are re-watching Avatar for the 11thtime and spanking it to the 8ft Zoe Soldana creature. Prove me wrong sticky hands! The Predator tracks the soldiers using a heat registering device, initially he is content just to watch and learn. He apparently has a sense of fairness and only hunts those that might prove a worthy adversary, therefore the unarmed are left alone. The Predator ""Ain't ferm around heyre"", that much is obvious, it engages sophisticated cloaking devices to blend in with the surroundings, which means that only the audience can see it most of the time for some reason.After the initial kill there is a brief sighting that leads to approximately three kajillion rounds being unleashed, leveling an area that I think now is used to graze the entire MacDonalds herd.From this point the Predator turns serial killer, picking off the soldiers one by one and taking various trophies for himself (think spines and skulls rather than earrings and wallets), he is a seemingly invincible killing machine that appears destined to kill off the entire cast without so much as breaking a sweat.We learn because the female hostage tells us that ""only in the hottest years this happens"", and that the Predator is essentially a game hunter here on a bit of a safari of sorts. The news that this is simply a lark for him is a sobering thought to the trained soldiers he is toying with, so Dutch decides that they have no choice but to kill it. Bold words, but a few minutes later and it is a 1 on 1 battle between two huge gargantuan looking behemoths, one an alien incapable of discernible speech who communicates in clicks and grunts, the other is the Predator.The Predator itself looks like a rasta-crab complete with dreadlocks and four alternately movable fangs, I'm not sure how the creature effects were done but for 20 + year old work they are pretty masterful and seamless and hold up extremely well today, in fact the effects on the AVP movies are distractingly dodgy or in some cases CG, strange given that technology should make things more convincing.The final fight involves Arnold taking it old-school and eschewing weapons to rely on his wits and primitive fighting methods, that should be a problem but after the biggest preparation montage in cinematic history the Big Dumb Action sequence that closes the movie is excellent and caps off proceedings nicely.Arnold is at his super-buffest and most action-friendly. The Predator itself, a super-cool creation (like the Terminator) that is both scary, daunting and admirable, a worthy adversary and after the Terminator almost the ultimate bad guy. It most definitely helped that the creature design and effects made the character totally convincing and realistic.Often imitated but never bettered, Predator is an awesome action sci-fi experience. Rather than watching the Danny Glover sequel (OK) or the new Predators reboot (also OK), or the excrement that was AVP and sequel, check out the best. First.Final Rating - 8.5 / 10. Big Dumb Action is very rarely this Fun. There's a reason why the Clickle-lickle-lickle sound effect and the washed out heat vision the Predator employs are so memorable to so many guys. They are Awesome.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An alien in the jungle,"John McTiernan made a good fist of Predator but it was Die Hard where he hit pay dirt with a cracking action film combined with wit, humour, a devious plot and an action man better known for comedy roles.Predator actually starts off in space as a pod heads for earth. Meanwhile Arnie and his crack team of special forces personnel are hired by CIA agent (Carl Weathers) to rescue some hostages which includes an important politician in the Central American jungle.However the CIA have ulterior motives in sending the team. After a firefight with the rebels the team get picked off one by one. It seems something is watching them, something invisible and maybe alien.After the success of Commando and The Running Man, the budgets and production values increased for Arnie action films. Predator shows it on screen with a better and more diverse cast as well including an early acting role for future action film scribe Shane Black.This is a popcorn film with humour, action and teamwork. The latter part of the story pits Arnie against the Predator. Rather prophetically we see even in these early films Arnie having tender scenes with a latino lady.The film is still a little too formulaic and by the numbers. Apart from Carl Weathers we get little insight to the rest of Arnie's squadron who are shorthand stereotypes.However Arnie did realise after this film that if he was going to conquer the action genre, he needed to show more than his muscles but films with a good script, very good effects and a visionary but also zany action director. His next big action film, Total Recall would certainly deliver the goods.Interestingly the film has two actors who went on to get elected as Governors.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Nothing special,"I haven't seen this movie for half an eternity and didn't really know how I found it anymore. Well, to be honest, I still remember the film better.Because if Arold Schwarzenegger and a few other well-known actors were not there and if the creature design would not be that great, then the movie would only be a trash movie. At least I think so, because the movie doesn't really have much more to offer.The first half of the movie is actually only that Arni, Carl Weathers and the rest of the troupe flex their muscles, tear a few jokes and then shoot around what it takes. Of course, I'm happy for anyone who likes that, but I can't do anything with that. Well, and only in the second half does the movie really show what it has to offer and there are really a few exciting ideas and moments. Because in principle, this fight, or rather this hunt between man and predator, is quite interesting. That's why the end of the movie in particular is really exciting and provides entertainment.Especially if you take a closer look at the creature design of the Predator. Because this one just looks great. If you compare this with other CGI creatures of today, it just looks fantastic.The actors in the movie are... well... they are action heroes and great acting you shouldn't really expect. Although the actors are actually all convincing in their roles.So the movie is basically entertaining and especially towards the end it will also be quite exciting. But unfortunately, the movie consists of two parts and the first part is actually just trash cinema, which you can find funny, but I find it rather exhausting. Well, if the movie had focused more on a serious plot with a rousing atmosphere, it might have been more suitable for me and definitely more exciting. But the movie is actually quite nice, but really nothing special.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The best Arnold flick ever!,"Superb!  From start to finish, this movie left me on the edge of my seat. Arnold S. was perfect in this movie and I don't think any other actor could have pulled it off better.  As I watched it, I was just as bewildered as the guys in the mission.  Things were happening, and they didn't know what, and niether did I!  It was so cool to know my heart was pounding to their rythum.  Eventually, when everything was exposed, it got even better.  The action was very well plotted and the soundtrack matched perfectly.  Carl Weathers was a cool sidekick, giving complaints here and there and turning out to be a mole.  My only complaint is Arnold's invincibility.  I mean, he died like 5 times in that movie.  Either way, that doesn't harm my rating for this movie:  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun Action Movie!,"Several reviews ago, I had written that the 80's was a good time to start introducing high-profile action films. Well, here's another example of an action classic that almost everyone has seen. This is a true classic starring the 80's favorite, Arnold Schwarzenegger. This movie also introduced another alien character who movies are still being made about today(AVP, Predators)This is about a group of elite macho men who are assigned to go to Central America and rescue some people from guerrillas. But they encounter something much a worse, a killer from another world.The Predator is made well. He looks scary especially his hair.

"Good effects and action, but recycled story and somewhat rushed.","I honestly didn't have much of an intention to watch this, but my brother forced me into it, and I went ahead and saw it. It was your typical average action film, explosions, gun fights, and gore up the butt. Although it does include a few different things, its a basic system that I've already seen over and over. Not that I didn't like it, but its the same repetitive action that has been done already.Arnold Schwarzenegger and a team of mercenaries set out in the jungles of Guatemala to investigate a group of missing mercenaries, along with taking out a campsite of Guerrillas. But their mission becomes a survival mission when they become the prey of an evil creature from space, which has the ability to camouflage itself.You can count on this film for giving you good action and explosions, but what you can't count on this film for is freshly made ideas for the story that you've never heard of before. It starts right away, and gets into the conflict right away. The film isn't long enough to make any stops. It just keeps going on.The film is quite gory for an eighties film, but it just makes it into another one of those shocker films that tries to shock you as much as possible. Don't get me wrong, it is quite graphic, and it pulls it off most of the time. But the film's main problem is not having enough time to stop, or some kind of different idea other than constant running and action. No expectations, just a little more different than other action films.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Arnold VS. The Predator,"Dutch(Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team of commandoes go off into the South American jungle to rescue some hostages.  His team includes Dillon(Carl Weathers), Mac(Bill Duke), Blaine(Jesse Ventura), Billy(Sonny Landham), Poncho(Richard Chavez) and Hawkins(Shane Black).  They go in and encounter their enemies but soon discover something more terrifying: the Predator.This is one of my favorite Schwarzenegger films to come out during the 1980's.  The action is tight and director John McTiernan's direction is slick.  The Oscar nominated special effects are cool.  One should take into consideration about the violence in this movie.  The violence hear is quite gory, yet hardly of the supergraphic kind.  The skinless bodies of two men are found hanging from a tree, a man's arm is blown off, another man has a hole the size of a basketball blown into his chest, and another man's brains are blown out.Last, but not least, a lot of praise should go to the towering, late Kevin Peter Hall for his excellent portrayal of the Predator; the silent, invisible hunter from another planet.  He literally has all kinds of weapons up his sleave which include a shoulder blaster, a blade, and a powerful self-destruct weapon.  Kevin Peter Hall returned to do the highly underrated sequel Predator 2 with Danny Glover and Gary Busey.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Ain't Got Time to Bleed""","""Predator"" is classic. Great Arnold Schwarzenegger flick. He's not the star of this movie though. The jungle atmosphere and the sense of the team being hunted by a member of a strange alien species is the main attraction. This movie reminds me a lot of ""Alien"", and I guess that makes sense considering all of the crossover stuff that's happened between the franchises. Like the ""Alien"" series though, it's really the first (and also second in the case of ""Alien"") that just gives us a solid movie to enjoy. Love all of the ballistic action, it really felt like a mix of ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" to me, a lot of action and a lot of thriller. Some of the characters are weak but I really think ""Predator"", if it has a few flaws in the department of character, more than makes up for it with a literally explosive final hour. Pure 80s camp, but in the most pure way. Absolutely recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Plenty of action...,"""Predator"" is an Adventure - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a group of commandos going on a mission into the jungle where they face an extraterrestrial warrior. They have not only to protect themselves but also to fight back.I believe that ""Predator"" is a classic Sci-Fi movie which consists of plenty of action and suspense, something that made it very interesting. The interpretations of Arnold Schwarzenegger who played as Dutch, Carl Weathers who played as Dillon and Sonny Landham who played as Billy made the difference in the movie and I believe they all did a really good job.

Great 80s action film,"In 'Predator' Arnold Schwarzenegger and a bunch of tough guys fight in the jungle but end up fighting someone entirely different, someone not from this world. You don't need more information to know what you're up for.I love this movie although it's hard to ignore some flaws which are typical for the action cinema of the 1980s. Let me give you some examples.Arnold's oneliners and his impersonation of a one-man-army feels kind of dated today. The age of muscle-packed, almost immortal heroes is over, at least for now.
This was typical for the 1980s. If you want to see the prototype of this kind of movie making, I recommend 'Commando' from 1985.
The aforementioned bunch of tough guys is as clichee and one-dimensional as it gets.Apart from these minor flaws, the movie rocks. Here are some reasons for that:*It is violent and doesn't hold back anything. Although a big budget movie, it doesn't even think about going PG13.
*The setting in the jungle is great and creates lots of opportunities for hiding, sneaking around and danger in general.
*Predator still looks good. Watch it in HD and you'll forget that it's more than 30 years old.
*The Predator is one of the best movie monsters ever designed although some people make fun of his dreadlocks. He is instantly recognizable and therefore iconic. Besides, like in Spielberg's 'Jaws', it takes a long time until we really see the monster. All we get until quite late in the movie are glimpses, which makes for additional suspense.
*I like that Arnold doesn't stand a chance in a hand to hand-combat against the Predator. Unlike most of his movies, he isn't the physically strongest of the characters here. That's why we feel more worried about him than usual because at least here, something COULD happen to him.In conclusion, 'Predator' is one of the best bad-ass action movies of the 1980s. I prefer it to all of the later sequels / reboots.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Arnold in his prime...,"Along with its great showcase of action, and special effects Predator also brings some vintage Schwarzenegger to the table.The movie follows the story of Arnold and Co. and they go into an African jungle to rescue some pows or something like that. However that isn't important as the real plot shows up soon enough as we learn that an alien is hunting the solidiers for sport. Not exactly Shakespearian but decent enough.Arnold is definetly in full tough-man ass kicking mode here. The supporting cast gives strong enough performances, despite any terribly signifigant lines for any of them.Predator is definetly a great choice for a bit of mindless action fun, with great special effects for its time, and with surprisingly good laughs to go along with the action.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Arnold delivers!,"Let's get ONE thing straight about this film:  This is for MEN!  This is a MAN'S action flick.  There is no cheesy love story to keep your date cuddled up with a pillow at night, no sub-plot about boyhood friendships, and no breaking down and saying, ""I can't take it, Sarge, I can't go on!""  Nope, this film is about standing up, walking tall, and fighting to the end.The great Schwarzenegger gives one of his best performances ever as ""Major Dutch"", we've got Shane Black showing what he does when he's not penning a Lethal Weapon script, Carl Weathers being anything BUT Apollo Creed, and Jesse Ventura spouting out uber-cool lines like, ""I ain't got time to bleed.""  Guns, guts, glory, and an alien with special effects that are still pretty sweet in today's ""CG-overkill"" world.My one problem is that we never get to see what happens to Billy.  It looked like he was going to go all awesome and then what?  A scream?  Whatever though.  This film ""makes trophies"" of other films attempting to do the same.

Schwarzennegger in his prime,"In the mid to late eighties it seemed as if Arnold Schwarzennegger could do no wrong.  Practically every movie he made was successful, people loved him, and things were good.  ""Predator"" is typical of the movies he was turning out, just enough schlock and humor to add some fun, serious enough to get your attention, and gobs of special effects and action.  Carl Weathers and Jesse Ventura complement rather than compete in the drama, and there's enough shoot outs and one-liners for everyone.  (Bad Idea, Stick Around.)What's always stuck in my mind about this movie was where the final battle took place, a forest with huge trees and an almost primeval look to it. I've always felt the director was trying to symbolize going to the basic instincts of survival and conflict; when the identity, race, and origin is stripped away, and all that is left is two beings fighting to the end. Maybe I'm just reading in too much.Most people would agree that ""Terminator Two"" was the peak of Arnold's acting talent, but ""Predator"" is a sample of what he did when making hit movies was his bread and butter.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun action movie,"Predator is a rare case where an extremely simple story is really enhanced by all the other strengths of a film. The cast give some great performances, the combat scenes are filmed in thick jungle and that gives it quite an authentic look. The dialogue is pretty memorable and quotable. The editing is nicely done and the action is well captured without the need for all the shaky cam stuff we get now. The film's simplicity is both it's strength and weakness, it's not trying to be anything other than it is, but what's there is done really well. The film has become something of a classic since it was released and falls into one of several great action movies from the 1980s.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Decent, but I'm afraid it could have been better","I enjoy Arnold Schwartzeneggar movies as much as the next guy, and the Terminator films are some of my favorites. Because ""Predator"" received some fairly good ratings, I decided to check it out. I admit it can be fun, and there are some good moments of humor and action. However, it's far from great, and I'll tell you why. We hardly get to know any of the characters, especially Arnold. In a movie like this, we want characters we can really care about so we can hope they'll get away from the bad guys (and the alien in this case). Secondly, Arnold's movies are usually much more chock-full of funny lines than this, which usually give the movie a reason to stick in your brain. The action scenes are pretty good, although some of the scenes with Arnold and the Predator toward the end go on a bit too long, and they seem to keep on going back and forth. This is a decent action movie if you don't want to think too much while you watch it, but if you prefer something with a bit more depth to it, I recommend the Terminator films or ""True Lies"" instead.*** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Let's consider what this movie predates (pun intended),"The 5/10 rating is of course because ""Predator"" is only intended for Arnold Schwarzenegger's hard core fans; the arty crowd will consider it worthless. In this case, the future Governator plays Maj. Alan ""Dutch"" Schaeffer, leading a platoon into a jungle to stop a rebel army (har har), when they get besieged by an alien. Naturally, the movie is mostly an excuse for Ah-nuld to be as much of a bad-ass as possible.Of course, there's also the one-liners. Most famous is Blain's (Jesse Ventura, also a future governor) ""I ain't got time to bleed"", but there's also ""Knock knock"" after Dutch breaks into a rebel tent. It's weird to think that Elpidia Carrillo went from a dead serious, pro-revolutionary movie (""Salvador"") to an Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle.All in all, we can probably all agree that this is nothing particularly special; mostly two hours of Ah-nuld kicking booty (and anti-revolutionary, just as Reagan probably liked). But as long as we understand that that's what it is, then there's really no harm done. Also starring Carl Weathers.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The jungle itself nearly becomes a character because of it's massive foliage and nooks and crannies where the predator can easily hide.The second half of the film takes off once they discovered they have been targeted.Once the audience gets pulled it, it's a mile a minute and you'll soon discover that the sequel is worth a look considering there's a lot of information to process about the predator.

"""Predator"" offers simple entertainment in raw form","""Predator"" boasts a few unique claims, one being that it's the only movie to feature two US governors. The ""Jaws"" and ""Alien""-inspired monster attack film also gave birth to one of the most original creatures we've ever seen instead relying on aliens or dangerous animals. But most of all, it's the ability of ""Predator"" to deliver entertainment on bare-bones plot structure.Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in director John McTiernan's breakthrough action thriller about a team of commandos on a hostage rescue mission in a Central American jungle who on their way back find themselves being hunted one-by-one by some extra-terrestrial hunter with stealth armor.The beauty of ""Predator"" is that's all for the plot. No sub-plots, no character development, nothing -- just gunfire and guts. Only occasionally does a mindless film like this one come along, recognize that its mindless, and just execute ""entertaining"" right down to its very definition.The cast is completely talentless, but Schwarzenegger appears to have finely honed his ability to be an action star without distracting us with a thick accent. His recognizability at this point in his career is enough to like him in the film. Jesse Venture adds a bit of variety to the cast and makes for a nice fun fact many years later.It would be one thing if there was no good reason for ""Predator"" to be devoid of everything but spine, but an alien with hunting gear and dreadlocks killing commandos for good sport needs nothing but some clever action sequences and effective suspense. Like ""Alien,"" we don't see the Predator in full until way into the movie and that's half the excitement necessary to enjoy it.Other movies try and give us back story, romance and clever twists when they aren't capable of delivering them well.

I have loved this movie since I was a kid. Plus it is definitely is the best of the series the other movies in the series do not match up in scope or plot. The recent avp movies are a far cry from the original. The effects and action are also great for its time. This movie is a must see for any person that calls themselves a movie buff. I think it is Arnold's best work. The jungle setting is the best place for a movie of this scope. It sets the people up to be the best ""game"" for the predators, and only Arnold can defeat him. This movie brings back fond memories of my childhood and watching ""R"" rated movies with my dad. Great movie to watch with your son.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Bad case of jungle fever,"Calling John McTiernan's ""Predator"" the greatest action movie of all time is just pique to say the least. It's too simplistic to be greatest anything. I think what people mean when they say that is, in fact, the most ""action"" movie of all time. Its simplicity offers a casual but very satisfying viewing which oozes pure entertainment. Add to that the face--and pecs--of Arnold Schwarzenegger and the loudest, sweatiest handshake in movie history, and you've got yourself a perfect blockbuster.So yeah, not the greatest movie of all time--that would be Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" for me. Let's take as an example the very first action scene, in which Schwarzenegger, playing the role of Dutch, the leader of a top tier Special Operations crew, signals his commandos to begin assaulting a military outpost deep in a Central American jungle. There's silent takedowns, gunfire, explosions, exposed muscles and exploding cannon fodder. But there's no flow to it. The scene has all the action pieces, but it's too simplistic to put them all together. But we get the point. Dutch's crew kicks butt. The outpost is taken, and we are back to taking a break and doing close-ups of enviably angular chins.Dutch himself is no complex guy either. All we know is that he is the best there is and has an uneasy friendship with an ex-partner who now has a desk job in the military which, of course, makes the rest of the crew look down on him because they consider he's gone soft. As for the crew itself, you've got Billy (Sonny Landham) as the wise silent tracker with a keen eye, Mac (Bill Duke) as the cold and hard to trust maverick who doesn't take kindly to outsiders like Dutch's pencil-pushing friend Dillon (Carl Weathers) and Blain (Jesse Ventura) as a moustache-bearing spinach-chewing Popeye look-a-like who's got ""no time to bleed""--you get the idea.The movie tries to introduce the Predator slowly as its action pacing switches to an attempt at horror. There are disemboweled bodies scattered throughout the jungle, local myths about its nature and we even get glimpses of it as it follows and closes in on Dutch's crew. However, this kind of foreshadowing requires the kind of finesse this movie simply isn't capable of. When we reach the ending, which contains an epic battle between Dutch and the Predator, we again see the same thing--dirt, muscles and explosions struggling to piece themselves together into something suspenseful. Fortunately, this movie does just well enough even without it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Perfect 80ies Action Movie,"It helps if you don't expect much - but who expects much when there's Arnold and a bunch of tough guys win guns in a jungle? That's it. You know what you're getting into.And inside the context of this genre, this movie is flawless.Always tight; always fast paced; we care about the team; no boring ""explanation"" scenes; there is really a very long list of things other movies do wrong that this one doesn't do wrong.And so it ends up being way more entertaining and gripping than your modern blockbuster or Netflix big budget film. It should be shown in film schools as an example of storytelling - a lot is told with very little dialog.Not everything makes sense, and the genre staples of jungles + automatic weapons and grenades are all present, as was the fashion of the day.But the actors are perfect, there's not a line out of place, not a scene out of place, and the end fight is spectacular as well as surprising.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If it bleeds, we can kill it..","Predator is regarded as one of the most well-known action movies of the 80's & certainly one of Arnie's best performances. It has everything you would expect from a classic 80's action flick, explosions, guns, blood, suspense & classic one-liners from Arnie! Arnie and his team of commandos are called in to assist with a rescue mission in a Central American Jungle, a helicopter has gone down and they are sent in to locate any survivors. Before long they become targeted themselves by an alien hunter which starts killing them off one by one.The scenes before we see the Predator are very iconic and it is at that moment that you realise it is not your standard action flick. The first time we are introduced to the Predator is from its point of view. The crew of commandos will be down on the floor of the jungle and then it will switch to an infrared point of view from a birds eye location, watching them from the trees. You are shown the predator watching the humans, whilst making quite disturbing noises and breathing sounds. They are very effective scenes that add suspense and a nervous feeling to this movie. One thing which is done very well is that the Predator is not revealed too early, it is not fully seen until around half way into the movie. This does a great job of adding suspense and a 'we are more scared of what we can't see' effect.The gore is just about right also, there is enough gore to show you how vicious the Predator is but it is not over the top. There are no real stomach turning scenes. Arnie does a good job, as does Bill Duke, other members of the cast can be quite annoying or simply drift into the back ground and aren't really cared about once they start getting picked off by Predator.The story line is Interesting and it adds something different to a standard Arnie action flick. If you like this genre then you have probably already seen it as it is regarded as a classic. It's not really a genre that I have a large interest in and this is why I haven't seen it until now! 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the Arnie's best work,"Predator is one of the best Arnie's flicks ever made. Revolutionary for 1987 and still easily survives test of time . It is old school, all non-stop action, practical effects, great tension, short but memorable dialogs ( RUN TO THE CCCHOPPA is iconic) and all around excellent survival story. McTiernan, who gave us classics such as Die Hard, certainly knew how to make a captivating thriller. All actors besides Arnie are great too. Main creature idea is unique and well implemented. Watch only Predator, all sequels including ones done after 2000, are not even remotely on par. They just make them like this anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Often Imitated But Never Duplicated, Predator Stands In A League Of Its Own.","One of the most enjoyable, quotable, entertaining, exhilarating & testosterone-filled action extravaganzas of all time, Predator is a strong shot of adrenaline that fuses action, adventure, science-fiction, horror & thriller into one and is delivered with such remarkable finesse that even after two decades & countless imitations, its ass-kicking experience has never been duplicated.Set in the jungles of Central America, Predator concerns an elite special forces team of six who are ordered in to assist a CIA officer on a rescue mission which ultimately turns out to be a ploy. But the deception soon becomes the least of their concern when, on their way out of the jungle, they find themselves being stalked & hunted by something that's not of this world.Directed by John McTiernan, the film opens with a brief prologue after which it travels the road of an action-adventure feature for a while but over the course of its runtime slowly, steadily & seamlessly transitions into an impressive sci-fi horror that ends up succeeding on all fronts. The idea is incredibly original, the premise is highly intriguing, the setting is absolutely fitting & the casting is pitch perfect.The screenplay may not have that immense depth of characterization but the simple basics of it is able to provide each character their distinct personality without causing any distraction when they're working as a team. Cinematography expertly uses the atmosphere of jungle to its advantage and with its controlled panning shots manages to pull the viewers in as, just like its characters, we also try to look harder for something lurking somewhere in those trees.Explosively paced from start to finish, it never lets the viewers settle down for a moment & gets busy with its main plot as soon as all its characters are introduced. Add to that, editing wonderfully arranges the predator's point of view shots with those of its characters without ever stepping over the line. Visual effects still holds up pretty well, sound is cleverly used & Alan Silvestri's spectacular score effortlessly adds a sense of impending doom to the whole narrative.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Shane Black, Sonny Landham & Richard Chavez, led by none other than Arnold Schwarzenegger. The lean & muscular bodies of these actors ends up being an impressive entity in itself for it adds more meat to the badass characters they play while also improving their physical presence in the picture. And their overall interaction with each other is simply flawless.As for the creature itself, it's cleverly imagined by the writers, expertly designed by Stan Winston & wonderfully mimed by Kevin Peter Hall on the screen. On an overall scale, Predator is one of the finest examples of quality filmmaking in which each aspect works in perfect harmony with the other to deliver a cinematic experience that's damn satisfying in every manner & retains its high quality no matter how many times you watch it.A genuine classic, a genre masterpiece & one of my favourite films of all time, Predator is a must for every action, sci-fi or horror fan out there. One hundred percent recommended.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A little overrated, but still a fun time.","If you want to find a fine example of pure 80s action cheese, then look no further than John McTiernan's Predator. This action-packed film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesss Ventura, Shane Black, and Kevin Peter Hall as a group of mercenaries on a rescue mission to retrieve hostages from the jungles of Central America where they soon encounter a unknown being out of this world. Predator may not be my favorite Schwarzenegger movie, favorite 80s movie, or hell, not even my favorite action movie, but it packs in something to keep you entertained and engaged.Like most action movies released during the 1980s, Predator's plot is very simplistic without being too messy and all over the place. However, the plot to this film isn't something to go crazy about. This may be a more subjective issue with me, but I found Predator to be fairly predictable and straightforward in terms of storyline. Its not terrible by any means, but I would not call this script exceptional either. Even with the corny quotes and one-liners (and they do make Predator a little more watchable), its still a descent story to stay interested in.The acting and character development is pretty much a mixed bag for me. Some performances are dull and forgettable while others are pretty good for what they serve in an 80s action movie. Arnold may not be the best actor, but his role as Dutch does serve a purpose and he pulls a fairly good performance and is the most memorable human character. Kevin Peter Hall's portrayal as the predator is also memorable in which his body movements help bring this unknown being to life. The rest of the cast does a decent job at playing their given roles, but they don't bring anything memorable aside from a few cheesy lines.This visual effects are the strongest asset to Predator and they still kind of hold up well 20+ years later. All the effects done on the predator are handled fairly well and the creature design by Stan Winston remain an iconic one to this day. The cinematography captures the isolation of being in the jungle as well as the lighting being utilized to change the time from sunny daylight to dreary darkness. Editing is also put to good use taking the action scenes and placing them in the right areas.Although I find Predator to be good, but not great, I still find it to be an entertaining 80s action movie with all of its cheesy glory. With a simple plot, corny characters, and great visuals, I can understand why a lot of other people love Predator so much. Even though I find it to be a little overrated, it is still worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of Schwarzenegger's best!!!,"I can honestly say that the idea behind ""Predator"" is one of the coolest Sci-Fi stories I've ever heard/seen.  I absolutely love the idea of an alien being coming to earth, not to meet new life-forms, but to find a good hunt! Brilliant!!!  I like the idea of the hunter becoming the hunted!The cast is superb in this film.  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the perfect Dutch, Carl Weathers plays the perfect Dillion, Jesse Ventura as Blaine, Bill Duke as Mac, and so on an so forth.  Everyone is great in this film!!!The look of ""The Predator"" is just perfect too!  I can't say enough about how much I like the look of ""The Predator"".  Stan Winston did a fantastic job with the design.  Kevin Peter Hall did a fantastic job playing ""The Predator"" as well!Not only does this film have a great cast and a great creature designer, but it has one of the best directors around, John McTiernan (Hunt for Red October, Die Hard, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, 13th Warrior, Medicine Man, and more).  John really did a great job directing.Well, if you haven't seen this film yet, I really think you're missing out on something great.

"A dynamic and influential timeless masterpiece from Thomas bros, McTiernan, Winston, Silvestri, and the greatest action cast of all time.","In my honest opinion, this is the best film of all time. I think I was about 4 when i first watched it in 1991, and it has remained my favorite for its sheer visual creativity, visceral non stop action, purely macho legendary cast, and the single most brilliant creature design ever witnessed. The brilliant story of a technologically advanced yet savage alien that hunts for sport going up against the toughest and most dangerous commandos in the world is portrayed in astonishingly entertaining fashion throughout this classic. Director John McTiernan showcased his signature suspenseful action vision jam packed full of immensely executed sequences with outstanding camera work and excellent jungle landscapes/atmosphere. The larger than life characters played by Arnold, Ventura, Weathers, Duke, Landham, Black, Chaves, and Peter Hall (as the Predator) make up a once in a lifetime cast of legends that absolutely shine and engross the viewer in every frame they're in. The most integral and monumental aspect of this film comes from the production shift of having the early predator suit concept with Van Damme as the Alien, scrapped and shifted into bringing the creature effects mastermind Stan Winston on board designing the untouchably magnificent iconic Predator design. Still to this day the detail delivered into every facet of the alien creature's design is as vibrant and realistic as you can get and made the film what it was imo. When you first see the predator take his mask off and reveal his grotesquely unique face and vicious mouth, it's something that blows you away and stays with you forever. As a perfect compliment to all of the spellbinding visuals, we get a sonic work of art with Alan Silvestri's rambunctious pulse pounding score that elevates the entire experience to new heights as the thrills and shrills take place. Also you have to give credit to the FX team as they broke ground with some of the Pred technology features as far as the thermal vision sight, camouflage cloaking, glowing green blood, and the plasma explosions. In a time where effects were just being experimented with, these were advanced for the time. The overall production quality of this humble 18 million dollar budget film is astoundingly well executed. There is a reason this has become known as a classic (though still slightly underrated) over the past 20 years and appreciated for its massively inspiring timeless legacy.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Let Us Prey...,"PREDATOR starts out like any other military-type action movie of the 1980's. A select team of commandos led by Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger), heads for the jungles of Central America to rescue hostages and take out a rebel group.Several explosions and machine gun blasts later, mission accomplished. Easy Peasy.With one female rebel in tow, Dutch and company head off triumphantly. Unfortunately, their mission isn't quite over. In fact, it's about to become a fight for survival against an impossible enemy.PREDATOR is an example of a mixed genre movie that works exceptionally well. Arnold is at his peak, his comrades (including Carl Weathers, Jessie Ventura, and Bill Duke) are a perfectly-cast group of bada$$es, and their foe is the most terrifying, formidable creation since ALIEN.The violence factor is high, befitting of the situation.

"Saw this in 1987 It Is a Rip Off of ""Without Warning""","This is 1987 film is beloved by many people. I for one am not a huge fan of it. This film was just a bigger budget version of the 1980 film ""Without Warning"".A spacecraft flies near Earth and releases a bright object which enters the atmosphere. In the Val Verde jungle, Major Alan ""Dutch"" Schaefer and his team — medic Mac Elliot, tracker Billy Sole, gunner Blain Cooper, explosives expert Jorge ""Poncho"" Ramírez, and radio operator Rick Hawkins —are tasked by the CIA with rescuing an official held hostage by insurgents. CIA agent, liaison and former US Army Colonel George Dillon, a former commando and an old friend of Dutch, is assigned to supervise the team despite Dutch's reservations.The team discovers the wreckage of a chopper and three skinned corpses, whom Dutch identifies as members of a U.S. Army Special Forces unit he knew personally. They reach the insurgent camp and kill the soldiers, including a Soviet intelligence officer searching through secret CIA documents. Confronted by Dutch, Dillon admits the mission was a setup to retrieve intelligence from captured operatives and that the dead unit disappeared weeks earlier in a failed rescue. After capturing a guerrilla named Anna, the group proceeds to extraction, unaware that they are being tracked with thermal imaging by an unseen observer.The film is not bad but it is not as great as some people think.

Stone Cold 80's Action Horror Sci-Fi Classic,"'Predator' is widely considered, and rightly so, to be one of the best action horror movies of all-time thanks to its high production values, b-movie cheese, high octane thrills and over the top action set pieces to craft a highly entertaining thrill ride from start to finish. The narrative is simple yet effective and absorbs you in from the very beginning thanks to it ass kicking combinations of horror and sci-fi elements, incredible cast and one of the coolest looking monsters ever to grace the big screen.The Plot = Major Alan ""Dutch"" Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is recruited by his old army buddy CIA operative George Dillion (Carl Weathers) to lead a rescue team into the jungles of central America, to rescue a group of hostages. They are jointed by Blain (Jesse Ventura), Mac (Bill Duke), and a handful of others. There, they discover that they are being hunted by something not of this world.The movie cleverly mashes its action, sci-fi and horror genres by misdirecting its audience into believing it's a standard action flick before diving into horror with a three act structure defined by action in the first act, horror in the second, and survival in the final act and by doing this the movie turns some of the usual action movie tropes on their head, by transforming into a sci-fi slasher film complete with action heroes being picked off like classic horror victims one by one and yet as the film continues it becomes more and more stylish and once certain elements are in place it completely shifts with Dutch angles, camera zooms, slow motion, and plenty of carnage and gore. The action sequences are intense and awesome combined with a masterful build-up of nerve-racking suspense and a foreboding atmosphere filled with unnerving dread before leading to sudden bursts of violence, and all of that is thanks to the superb direction by John McTiernan as he delivers exactly the type of movie the audience wants, a big budget cinematic b-movie masterpiece.The visual effects are stunning and still holds up pretty well by today's standards. The monster design on the titular Predator itself is interesting and unique thanks to the work of Stan Winston and his talented team. The Predator monster itself is simply iconic.The cast of this movie are brilliant with Arnold Schwarzenegger being at his prime tough guy best here with his muscular action hero brawn, skilful one-liners and natural on-screen charisma that makes up for any limitations in acting as he gets to play to his strengths and the movie is all the better for it. Carl Weathers is easily the best actor in this flick and shares amazing on-screen chemistry with Arnie. Jesse Venture provides a fun and memorable turn as the testosterone fuelled Blaine. Sonny Landham gives an effectively intense turn as Billy. Shane Black and Bill Duke each round out the cast nicely and provides solid support here.Overall 'Predator' is a stone cold 80's action horror classic, it's tense, it's exciting and it's got a cool monster and plenty of violence to kick start a franchise where none of what followed could match the raw intensity of the original.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Almost great,"Predator is like the best pretty good movie ever made. There's something about it that holds me back from loving it, and I admittedly don't really know what that is. It's so simple, but I don't know if that's the problem, given I love other movies that could be described as super simple more. To be fair, I guess there are also super simple movies I like less.I feel a similar way about the first Alien, funnily enough. I guess there was a surprise factor to both movies that's missing when you watch them later on, when you've been exposed to pop culture references and know what to expect. That's also not the fault of the movie necessarily, but it might point to both being too simple if they can be impacted so easily. Maybe it is somewhat their fault. I long for something more here, especially in Predator. It might be that the characters do little for me. Aliens has always been a cut above Alien and Predator for me, and I think the characters - both the heroic and villainous ones - just do more for me.Some of Predator is great, though. Arnold's iconic, there are some good set pieces, and I am a big fan of the final act. I think it feels a little stretched thin, as if it were a 50-minute-movie stretched to 100-ish minutes. But I'm still entertained more often than not, and I understand why certain scenes and moments here have become iconic.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
When mere explosions were enough to hold your attention,"It's cringeworthy when so-called elite troops walk brazenly into the open and somehow kill dozens as bullets dance around them. It's the sort of the film where any military doctrine or strategy is suspended and the 'good guys' are invincible and the 'bad guys' can't aim. How boring!Meanwhile, Dutch (Arnold Shwarzenegger) and his old buddy Dillon (Carl Weathers) deliver some of the most emotionally stunted scenes known to cinema where manliness can be conveyed in ever more intense stares. The word 'acting' is a stretch here.There are a few visually interesting scenes, good costume design for the 'predator', and certainly plenty of action, but the absence of effort in delivering a script, a more complex plot, or any thought out military tactics makes this film a massive miss for me. I don't think Predator has aged well even if its basic concept and design still entertains.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Arnold and his team go into the jungle in this film as hired by USA and find themselves in the midst of beastly mayhem.  Quite a thriller indeed, and one of Arnold's better popcorn flicks.

"""If it bleeds, we can kill it.""","""Predator"" is one of the best ever vehicles for action superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger, and stands tall as an example of just how capable director John McTiernan was during this time, as he moved from this to ""Die Hard"" to ""The Hunt for Red October"". It's a slam bang kick ass combination of sci-fi, action, and suspense, with a touch of horror, with its roots in a similar, much lower budgeted film of seven years previous, ""Without Warning"".Arnold plays Dutch, leader of an elite rescue team hired for a mission in the South American Jungle. Arnold and his men haven't been told the truth about why they were hired, but that's the least of their problems. Soon a stealthy, merciless, and invisible entity will be stalking them and eventually killing them one at a time, basically hunting them for the sport of the thing.Everything comes together very well in this well paced, brutal, and tension filled spectacle with tons of gunfire and explosions, plus some very impressive special effects, especially the ""cloaking"" effect. The Predator itself is the work of the late, great Stan Winston and a team including people like Screaming Mad George, Howard Berger, and Robert Kurtzman. On location shooting in Mexico is to the movies' credit; there's much genuine jungle atmosphere. Alan Silvestris' propulsive music is superb; when it quiets down and it's just the percussion it creates an eerie effect.The pacing is excellent throughout. It's very deliberate at first, but picks up considerably once Dutchs' team starts being eliminated. THEN things start happening very fast. The final half hour or so when it's just Dutch vs. the monster is the best part, and there's an interesting idea at work when Dutch is obliged to get ""primitive"" in a hurry in order to try to defeat his enemy.Also, while Arnold is showcased to good effect, the movie doesn't just revolve around him. There's a fine ensemble here, beginning with charismatic Carl Weathers as Dutchs' old buddy Dillon. Bill Duke stands out as Mac; also appearing are Jesse Ventura as Blain, Sonny Landham as Billy, Richard Chaves as Poncho, ""Lethal Weapon"" screenwriter Shane Black playing comedy relief guy Hawkins, old pro R.G. Armstrong as General Phillips, and lovely Elpidia Carrillo in the lone female role as Anna. Another late talent, the wonderful Kevin Peter Hall, has lots of presence as the Predator (and has a secondary role near the end as a chopper pilot), a role that was originally going to be played by Jean-Claude Van Damme! (Another trivia note: Hall had also played the murderous alien in ""Without Warning"".)A rousing story from start to finish, ""Predator"" delivers a lot of fun, and has quite a quotable script (by Jim Thomas & John Thomas) to boot. It even starts its end credits with a curtain call, the kind of thing we don't see all that often. Highly recommended to any action fan.Nine out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fast paced action thriller,"This film in many peoples eyes can be seen as your averige action film with an old idea of having an Alien killing them, but I for one see it as much much more. Predator`s plot is explained in the name, but it isn`t the big strong, gun loaded Arnold that will be doing the hunting, oh no its the technologically brilliant Predator, one by one this savage yet inteligent monster kills one of the members of Arnold`s team for sport, good thought was put into the making of this alien as it will only attack people that pose a threat(a weapon) (shown in Predator2) so if you see the sequel alot can be explained adding longetivity to the series. Perfomances are solid enough with a good share of acting to the team throughout, character development is good seeing as how the Predator rarely kills more than one, so the squad goes through encouragement, confidence, fear and yes death... The novel thing is Arnold Schwarzenegger is commonly known to have a high powered Rifle with a underslung grenade launcher, grenades, pistols, knifes etc etc.. and yes he does, but only through the first 1/2 of the film and is then made too make use of the jungle much like the Predator. throughout the film Dutch(Arnold) learns the predator only is able to view in heat vision! due too his mask, so Dutch gets in water to cool his body and smears himself in mud to appear no-where in it`s vision, then using spears, arrows and spike`s he battle sit out in a contest of wit and strengh. This movie is very speical too me because of its different view of a action film, though it may not be the next Silence Of The Lambs or Pulp Fiction it is a classic of this particular genre.overall:  9/10If you like either Predator, Predator2 or the Alien saga (or even if you dont) buy the games! it represents the two memorable speices very well and is fun (Predator2 featured an Alien skull that triggered a ongoing story between the two, a film is being scripted!.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Always enjoy this movie,"Predator is an action-packed, suspense-filled classic that remains one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's most iconic films. The premise is simple yet effective: a group of highly trained soldiers is hunted by an otherworldly creature in the jungle, and the film thrives on its blend of survival horror and explosive action.The movie's pacing is solid, with a tense buildup as the team realizes they are not just up against human adversaries but a lethal, intelligent predator from another world. Schwarzenegger's performance as Dutch is commanding, and his showdown with the Predator is a thrilling culmination of brains versus brawn. The creature design is excellent, with Stan Winston's practical effects giving the alien a terrifying and memorable appearance.However, the film isn't without flaws. The supporting characters, while entertaining, lean heavily into action-movie stereotypes, and some of the dialogue feels a bit cheesy. Additionally, the plot is straightforward to a fault, leaving little room for deeper storytelling or character development.Despite these minor issues, Predator is a highly enjoyable ride that balances intense action with a genuine sense of dread. It's a must-watch for fans of 80s action films and sci-fi thrillers, even if it doesn't reach the heights of perfection.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A killer from outer space,"The 80s of the last century were truly the heyday of militants. We remember these amazing films with Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme and other heroes. But in 1987, something new comes out, a mixture of a classic action movie with a true thriller. And the name of this film is ""Predator"".It seems that the plot is not complicated - the commandos team will have to go into the jungle to find out where the group disappeared, and at the same time find out the enemy's positions. There are about a dozen heroes in the frame, all behave like typical commandos, the pathos is off the scale, the testosterone level on the screen is simply immeasurable. And this whole team is led by a charismatic Dutchman played by a famous actor, the star of ""Terminator"", Arnold Schwarzenegger.However, the typical plot comes to an end already in the first quarter of the film. It seems that the enemy is defeated. You can't help but wonder, what's next? And then begins a real thriller about survival in an unequal battle with an alien from outer space.The cast is an excellent example of a successful meeting on the set of a mountain of muscles and famous names in the world of action movies. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Duke, Cardle Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Shane Black. Every hero does not appear to be a mere soldier. All of them are personalities who are well disclosed in their allotted screen time. There is a camaraderie here, even friendship between some of the heroes. And you believe them. Especially Duke in his late-night monologue.The alien is also good. He does not reveal himself to us immediately, keeps an intrigue, sells his appearance. Of course, this is a masterstroke of the screenwriters and the director. When we see him, we realize that even Arnie's impressive size turns out to be a baby next to this giant. The predator is original, peculiar. He represents his culture, which is revealed as much as possible in the film.

Definitive action movie,"When some American diplomats are taken hostage, the army calls in a elite team of soldiers led by Dutch (Arnold) to go a retrieve them. They are air dropped into the thick of a Central American jungle as a team of six with a forced upon them seventh, Dillon (Carl Weathers). Before long they find a green barret team that has been killed and skinned. It does not take them long to discover that they are being hunted by something that is not human and next to impossible to kill. As Dutch tries his best to lead his team to the extraction point, it becomes clear that the hunted need to become the hunters.At the time I write this, this movie is 33 years old, and it still holds up. This is a great action movie, a great sci/fi movie, a great guy movie, it is just great. Forget what has come along with the Predator name attached to it and watch the grandpappy of them all, you won't regret it.Interesting side not, this movie features two future Govenors, Arnold Swarzeneggar and Jesse Ventura.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Genre mashup,"What I find most interesting about Predator from a narrative perspective is the fact that it changes genres after half an hour. It quickly runs through the conventions of a big budget 80s action movie with a huge action set piece led by the muscle bound lead Arnold Schwarzenegger, the plot essentially resolves, and then it becomes another movie for the next hour or so.The action movie of the first half hour is quick and dirty. We get a group of elite mercenaries who are given a mission by a CIA operative to go into another country and extract a foreign minister, and we have just enough time with each of them to differentiate them from each other. We know little of them beyond one is a sexual tyrannosaurus, another loves telling dirty jokes, and the rest look different. Along the way to the remote rebel base in the middle of the jungle, there are hints that there's something else out there, but they're largely pushed aside in favor of focusing on the mission. The attack on the base is a great example of excessive action filmmaking from the 80s with quippy one-liners from Arnold, big explosions, lots of gunfire, and a well placed knife to the abdomen from several yards away. The plot resolves when Arnold finds out that his old buddy, Dillon the CIA operative, was lying to them about there being a foreign minister in need. They were after a document stash instead. This doesn't really come up again. It does provide a bit of tension within the group as they head back to the pickup site where Dillon isn't viewed as trustworthy.It's at the tail end of the attack that we get our first real confirmation that there's something else in the jungle with them. I gotta say that I love the point of view look for the Predator, using faux heat maps to view the world. It's decidedly different from how we look, more than just a filter over an image but something almost alien that we have to interpret in a new way.And that's the point where the movie turns from an 80s action movie into something else. It's a claustrophobic monster movie that's set outside and where we barely see the monster. I find the first half hour of the film fine if not particularly special, but I find the rest of the film something else entirely. It's a survival horror film against a powerful and intelligent enemy that gets three, count 'em, three separate reveals, each one cooler than the last.As the hunt goes through our discernable mercenaries, ultimately leaving Arnold and the young woman they captured, the deaths become more elaborate and brutal. One of the joys of the film is the fact that both predator and prey are actually intelligent. The mercenaries set traps. The predator can work his way around them. It's a game of cat and mouse, and its only by chance that Arnold figures out a way to hide himself (though wouldn't the mud heat up to Arnold's body temperature after a time?) leading to the final large confrontation. The way Arnold almost gets the predator into a trap, the predator figures it out and sidesteps it is a really satisfying moment. It shows that both Arnold and the predator are smart and strong opponents.Of course, the creature design is great. As I said, the predator has three reveals. The first I the first time we see his light bending camouflage. The second is when he uncloaks and we see him with his mask. The final time is when he takes off his mask, revealing his fantastic set of elaborate and hideous jaws underneath. Each time we see the creature, he's revealing more and it's really satisfying, reminding me how the xenomorph keeps changing form in Alien.It's first act is rudimentary and functional, and the thinness of the characters doesn't help. However, the style and execution of the bulk of the film is what makes it special. It's a very fun creature feature that understands the basics of how to use its creature effectively in ways that Spielberg accidentally found in Jaws. It's a really fun balance that we get a lot of looks at the creature but it gets to keep changing, taking the design deeper several times. Arnold is himself, and the rest of the cast acts appropriately tough and scared. It's a good time at the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Pure Action, Horror, Sci-Fi, and Schwarzenegger","""Predator"" has been a childhood of mine, as our eldest brother show us this movie on FX, then one time when he got himself a copy of the movie on DVD, and we all love it from beginning to end. The movie is about a group of soldiers as they go into the jungle to look for some hostages, until one of its members set them up, and then come across of an extraterrestrial, that is hunting for sport and begins to slaughter them one by one. So its up to Dutch, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger as he must face the Predator alone, in order to survive by becoming the ultimate warrior. I don't what else to say that hasn't already been said, but everyone knows this movie and it definetly gets so much to talk about as this is the most quotable and most memorable movie of all time. It has a lot of memorable one liners with fantastic action set pieces, and at the same time its really suspenseful. The film is like 106 minutes, and never was I bored by it. The cast all did great, where they may not be 3 noted, but they at least have a strong presence. Schwarzenegger, alongside with Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham, Richard Chaves, Shane Black, and Jesse Ventura are all great together, and you really do buy them for the roles they were given. They're also likable too. Kevin Peter Hall is also really good as the Predator for the way he moves, and the way acts. The special effects, and the Predator design by Stan Winston is fantastic. John McTiernan, who would go on to direct ""Die Hard"" 1 and 3 has made a fun movie, and really knows how to do the action scenes really well. The atmosphere in this movie is really strong, and love the setting that this movie takes place in the jungle. Alan Silvestri's music is really unforgettable, and definetly one of his best scores. I could go on more about this movie, but if you haven't seen ""Predator,"" I say check it out; its definetly pure action, horror, sci-fi, and Schwarzenegger. I am giving this classic Schwarzenegger movie a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Creates Something Very Deadly,"Predator, one of my Sci-Fi favourites. To be honest with you, I'm not a Sci-Fi fan, apart from The Terminator series, Sci-Fi's like Aliens, The Thing and all those type of movies have never been compelling to me. Predator doesn't feel like a Sci-Fi, they're not in a space-ship or involved with some sort of high-powered unit, its set in a very wide, featured environment: the jungle. This movie created a very rare, and predatory villain that was then featured in comic books, and in future released movies. Its got excellent effects (nice use of CGI), a great ending and some good acting. Predator is your one source for a 'different' theme in the genre Sci-Fi.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Before you go see the reboot, see this movie first!!!","Fun fact about this gem...one of the actors in this movie, Shane Black, would go on to write the screenplay for the Last Boy Scout, and went on to direct Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Iron Man 3, both starring Robert Downey, Jr., and then the remake of the movie he was in. Arnold Schwarzenegger is great as the main good guy, along with Jesse Ventura, Carl Weathers, and others in a movie directed by John McTiernan that became a huge hit that was followed by a sequel, a prequel, and a crossover with the Alien in two movies, all of which can't hold a flame to the original.

Great Action/Sci-Fi flick BUT...,"The story is well written and the effects are even better, but the movie suffers because of ""I'll-be-back""-Arnold.

I seriously think the movie would be better with someone else in the lead role. Now to the special effects: now they are AWESOME. The warping caused by the Predator's cloaking is (if I'm not mistaken) computer generated. Compared with the stop-motion used on the T-800 in ""The Terminator"" (which is VERY lame), they are really ahead of their time...The setting is great, but the setting in Predator 2 is better. Anyone can hide in a dense jungle, but it isn't THAT easy to hide in a big city (""Look mommy, a ghost!""). The movie gives you  a lot of those ""I know you're out there, but I just can't see you"".

A timeless classic,"All I've heard about The Predator franchise is that each new movie entry always fails to live up to the original. With a new Predator movie now being released that seems to be the best predator movie since the original, I wanted to see why the original is so beloved. I now understand why.Predator is an excellent action movie and a gripping survival thriller with element of horror thrown in for good measure. What starts as a traditional 80s action flick suddenly descends into horror movie with a fantastic antagonist committing brutal kills all the while remaining out is sight. The film balances these tones expertly. It uses the action oriented first half to build up its main characters, showing how they're a competent military unit who know their business and will complete a mission with ruthless gung-ho efficiency. This makes it all the more impactful when they start getting picked off one by one, fear and panic starts to set in as they realise they are up against an opponent far stronger than they are.The strongest aspect of Predator is definitely the monster itself. The film does an excellent job at building it up as an intimidating threat and only shows small glimpses of it as to let the fear of the unknown creep into the audience. The creature design itself is phenomenal which is likely why the design has remained so iconic after all this time. The effects work in general is just fantastic. Big action set pieces are expertly done, with fantastic practical effects and stunt work. The small uses of CGI even hold up pretty well for today'a standards as well.Character-wise, the film is somewhat lacking. Each character is still very memorable but they aren't exactly well-developed with the exception of the protagonist, Dutch. The acting is decent for the most part but I think what makes these characters so memorable is their dialogue. There are so many over the top lines that are so iconic that it makes it so the characters leave an impact on you. While not up to the standards of something like Aliens, the characters are decent with Dutch being the exception. We see him go from efficient military man, to desperate but crafty survivor, creating traps and weapons to fight the Predator being reduced to his most basic instincts. By the end of the film, he isn't victorious or uplifted, but damaged and tired which makes him feel very real as a character. Arnold could do better but then again you can't imagine anyone else in the role.Overall, while it didn't have as big an impact on me, I can acknowledge that Predator is a fantastic movie, with fantastic action and great horror. With memorable characters, expert tension building, iconic creature and sound design, this film has stood the test of time and will continue to do so for years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terminator fights Predatornator,"Yes, it's that fu..in' alien that started it all, in another super dooper fantastic box office smash Arnie movie. These were the years, like all those other flexing meatheads we loved, when they did better movies. In this original, the best of course if only stacked up against No 2 (as I haven't seen the others) we see much more of the alien, some nice ones in CU- who is as Arnie quotes, ""One ugly son of a bitch"". The story starts off pretty much as Rambo, where an elite team of commandos go into the jungles of South America, to take down an army of rebels who have hostages, where this part of story eases beautifully among the great shootout sequences, with Arnie, popping in a few one liners, and then the other more graver part of the movie, the predator. Much blood is spilled, more here than the second, where one by one, they are taken out by this beast who moves with beautifully agility in camouflage, until he's down to one man. Have a guess, who? The last twenty minutes, is a much grueling due between two adversaries, with Arnie baiting the monster, and it's a greatly shot and thought out sequence. Remember, the predator is no push over, none more a hell of a challenge. Elpidia Carrillo, as the only remaining hostage, is given more dialogue, than you think she would be given. She's very good. Arnie's Arnie. Weathers, looks like Action Jackson at the start, indeed a worry, while the supporting and very familiar connected cast, including a lucrative screenwriter, give better performances, Ventura, an acting revelation, while it was Sonny Landham's performance which got me.

"If he can bleed, then he can die.....","This is truly and deeply among the best action picture ever made, with another masterpiece, purchased by the very same director: DIE HARD, one year later.

At the time of its release, in 1987, I showed it one year later to my grandma, who grew up with silent movies and Lon Chaney Sr; and guess what, she adored this film: PREDATOR; despite the fact that was probably the first action movie she saw in her entire life., You are literally grabbed from the beginning to the end; but I admit that the first twenty minutes are a bit lousy, run of the mill. But after those twenty minutes, the main element is not Arnold Schwarzenegger - who is awesome here - but, I repeat, the directing, camera angles and also dialogues, characters involvement in the story, relations and tension between every of them. And also the face to face between this group of super men and the alien. The scene where Arnold is lying in the mud and then becomes involuntarily invisible from his enemy, chameleon at his turn, placing the Predator in Arnold's former position, this sequence is the pure highlight of the film.

It's really not great however. The Predator appears in the end of the movie, the final battle between him and Arnold is not that memorable. His cruel laughter and gruesome methods of killing, however, make ""Predator"" really an entertaining scifi action. The soundtrack is also terrific.

I love the brute force of this movie and how raw it is. It's big, it's dumb and it's silly and most of all it's unapologetic. The practical FX and gore are beyond amazing.

He exudes an unparalleled rockin, Reaganormous centeredness as he leads his team of Marine ass-kickers to the choppah. You get the feeling that he could snap a python in half if given the chance. He might have to say, ""snap"" as he does it but you get what I'm saying. Predator is the greatest cautionary tale against deforestation by artillery fire you will ever see. Witness the explosion of manimalistic emotion as the marines unleash a ferocious frenzy of bullets against a treacherous treeline. Whether they are doing this to kill a Rastafarian alien or to prepare for a new highway is unclear. But whatever the case, there has never been a more awesome display of ammo ejaculation. The sequence is also revealing of something else. It seems obvious that this Extra-Territorestrial is trying to provoke an inherent jungle insecurity in the egos of the Marines that has been dormant ever since Vietnam.

Juxtaposing Schwarzenegger and his fellow cast spending the first half of the film measuring each other's manhoods, we spend the film's climax with an excellently designed creature seemingly built for battle.

What happens when you combine Alien and Rambo,"There's just something about 80s action films that gives me joy. Sure, they're testosterone-poisoned macho blasts where grotesquely muscled men use big guns to shoot anything that moves. But they're so honest about it that it becomes endearing. They're like that one jock friend you had, who you'd expect to be insufferable, but who turns out to be surprisingly humorous and kindhearted dude full of good cheer.Case in point, Predator, starring the manliest man who ever manned, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Who likewise turned out to be surprisingly humorous and kindhearted individual. In this film he plays Major Dutch, the leader of a mercenary group sent into the jungles of Central America. The mission seems to be going well, until something something starts hunting him and his men. Something not from this Earth.What I like in this film is how it goes straight to business. Here's the setting, here's the mission. Go there and start blasting. Honest, straightforward, pure in its over the topness. And when the film transitions into a horror film, it's pulled off well. The character of the Predator is one of the icons of action horror cinema for a good reason.The special effects are surprisingly good for late 80s, albeit not perfect by any means, and the final confrontation between Dutch and the Predator is one of the best action set pieces of the decade. And that's a stiff competition.Still, it must be said that Predator is not a perfect film.

A Perfectly Made Action Film,"First to dispel the inevitable confusion about the above rating. How can a film about an alien killing marines in the middle of the jungle afford a ""eight""? The answer is not a question of whether the film's premise is worthy of this rating, but whether the film itself is nine worthy. 'Predator' most certainly deserves to be praised. It is one of the best action films ever produced.This is because within the confines of the action-film genre, Predator fulfills every criterion faithfully.The first rule of action films, entertain the audience. Predator passes this test with flying colors. It is very watchable and is bound to keep any action fan happy. This film is simply never boring and maintains the tension the entire way through.The second rule, don't try and overload a story, focus on its execution. This is where the magic of Predator comes to the fore. The audience is kept entranced not because of the film's inherent charisma, but rather the way it is put together. The cinematography and sound is used for suspense rather than spectacle. The film oozes atmosphere and mood to the point where you feel as though you are stuck within the ""world of hurt"" on screen. This is why this film is just so much fun. It strips away the aspects that make some action films unbearable. 'Predator' is perfectly made. McTeirnan's direction is faultless.The third rule; have distinct characters that people can still relate to. This is another area where the film strikes gold. The characters are masculine, macho and muscular. They tell dirty jokes and kill things. Yet despite their obvious similarities the entire ensemble seems unique. They are given plenty of screen time before things inevitably start to go wrong. As a result, it is much easier to connect with the marines and the unfortunate situation they find themselves in.The fourth rule; stage terrific action sequences. The action sequences in this film aren't grand in scale but are dazzling in execution. Completely entertaining despite the film's budget.Predator is beautifully made from start to finish. It follows every convention within the action genre but is so tightly directed it is still very much worth the effort. Movie Makers take note when producing the next brainless, adolescent-fantasy action romp. If more film's followed McTeirnan's example the action genre wouldn't be so rampantly dull.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A different kind of Sci-Fi,"The most interesting part about this movie is that it's not a hi-tech sci-fi.  It's a down to earth movie with a sci-fi creature brought into the middle of it.

After completing their mission, they find themselves in the Central American jungle being stalked by an intergalactic hunter that collects the skulls of his kills for trophies.  Awesome acting, storyline, and non-stop action.  A definite must see.  Very different from any other kind of sci-fi and is pretty much uncomparable because there's nothing to compare.

"Pays homage to both ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"", but falls short of great cinema","As a big fan of the movies Alien and Aliens, I was compelled to watch the so-called 5th Alien move, Alien vs Predator. AVP was not bad, it was fun. But, I had never seen Predator and wanted to see the back-fill. Now that I have, I cannot say that Predator is a bad piece of cinema.However, the accolades I've seen for it on IMDb are astonishing and unwarranted. This movie was neither Arnold's best, nor a superior sci-fi or action film. It was only mildly entertaining. I did not find myself drawn in by it, or caught up in the suspense.This is perhaps because I saw AVP ahead of time, or am completely jaded by the awesome movies that clearly inspired Predator: Alien and Aliens. Maybe I am disappointed that the set and setting were not other-worldly. To Predator's credit though, it pays homage to both Alien and Aliens while adding a fresh touch all it's own with the main characters' special effects.But c'mon guys... even if you first saw this when you were 15 years old, can you not recognize now that it is formulaic and mediocre? The story is unoriginal and the build-up is poor. Suspension of disbelief is shattered toward the end. Where did Dutch get all that stuff anyhow?If you like a good shoot-em-up, go ahead and watch it. The action sequences, for the most part, are easier to follow than average. But overall, I think I would have been happier spending my time re-watching the films that I believe are the inspiration for this picture. A rating of 6/10 for Predator is generous.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's fine?,"I really wish I liked this more. I love the premise and I love the ideas. But to me it just isn't that tense and that's where it fails for me. Okay so first off this movie is somewhat slow it takes about half an hour before it properly starts there is one action scene before that but to me it feels very uninteresting as there's no stakes. When the movie properly starts it is much much more enjoyable but I still find it isn't tense most of the kills and fights happen off screen and granted considering how bad the cgi is in this film I can definitely understand why, but it really takes away from the tension and action when for most of this film the deaths feel very random and have no tension. The ending is when this film shines as it actually shows us more action and shows us more of what to be afraid of and actually gives us multiple reasons to be afraid (also it's just really cool of an ending). That being said I just can't give this a high rating because it takes to long to kick off and isn't tense enough until the very end.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pick the next cast member to become governor and win!,"Major ""Dutch"" Schaeffer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) runs a ragtag commando troop that specializes in difficult search and rescue missions. They're called in to assist in finding an important diplomat in the Central American jungle, but there may be more to their mission than meets the eye. As if a human-fueled plot twist isn't enough, there just may be something not quite human and not quite friendly waiting in the jungles, as well.The first half of Predator is a fairly standard actioner/war film. The second half veers more into sci-fi/horror/thriller territory. It's an interesting combination, and succeeds in the end, but a few flaws keep getting in the way.At times, the script is self-consciously cheesy (how about those gratuitous Flex Magazine-styled shots?). Although I'm usually a fan of cheese, it doesn't always work here--it's both too overt and too infrequent. Another problem is that the script is occasionally too weighed down with mumbled jargon that's meant to situate the characters in a ""real world"" with an extensive history, but which viewers would be hard-pressed to make heads or tails of. There are also a number of plot developments, including character decisions, that make little sense if you think about them much, but on the other hand, the film is basically an excuse for an extended game of hide and seek, punctuated by explosions, dismemberment's, and so on. There isn't much of a political subtext, despite the fact that the film features not just one but two future governors blowing the crap out of various people, buildings and trees with high-powered weapons and frequently calling opponents ""m-f'er"".Also, the film works best initially if the viewer doesn't expect the developments of the second half. But director John McTiernan spoils the surprise to an extent with repeated ""heat sensor imaging"" cinematography. Many viewers will wonder what the heck those shots are supposed to be--it has a tendency to pull them out of the film. The film probably would have worked better with a more abrupt change of genre ala From Dusk Till Dawn (1996).But, believe it or not, I liked the film on the whole (although I have to say that I wanted to like it even more than I did). McTiernan very effectively builds up suspense as soon as our team of rag-tags enters the Central American jungle, and the first big action blow-out is exciting, even if I couldn't tell who was shooting at who or why half of the time.And that's nothing compared to the suspense created during the hide and seek phase with the predator. Everything is amped up enough in this section that I didn't usually care if our characters uttered dialogue that made little sense or took actions that seemed ridiculous. I was just geared up to see more stuff blown up and disfigured. The predator itself was superb, from its look and accoutrement's to its behavior, thanks to actor Kevin Peter Hall. Even the predator's ""music"" was great--that rhythmic sound accompanied by a synthesized drone--it reminded me of the musical theme of the Master of the Flying Guillotine (1975). By the climactic showdown, I had pretty much forgiven the film of any and all flaws--I was with McTiernan all the way.The film is really only worth watching if you're in the mood for a somewhat clunky auctioneer/horror flick with little in the way of comprehensible plot development, but most of us get in the mood for such fare frequently enough, and at those times, Predator just might hit the spot.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Classic,"Predator is a classic. For me its the epitome of 80's action movies, and much of Arnold Schwarzeneggers career. Ive seen this movie more times then I care to imagine but I still love it. If you think about it, really its not very good. The plot it undeniably thin, dialog is inexistent and its a little slow. I watch it today and every other line (albeit rarely) is cheesy and the over the top explosions unnecessary but back then it was run of the mill and probably not that stupid. I miss these types of movies that act as catapults of ideas to so many films of today. In my eyes Predator is iconic, I love the ending and the action sequences, I love its abrupt ending the over the top violence and gore. It does its job, tense, gory horror adrenaline flick. In its time the effects were brilliant but even now digitally remastered I enjoy this movie more than ever before. Yet to be critical it has huge flaws and always will, the characterisation and story could be so much better. That said would Predator be as iconic as it is today if it was more developed... get to the choppa.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent Sci-Fi/Action movie,"This is a very impressive sci-fi/action flick. Arnold gives a great performance in the kind of the movie I think he's best at: an action movie. Like Terminator and True Lies, Arnold is really great as the serious, action type. There are amazing fight sequences with the Predator, and that is the way it should be. Sure there is gore in this movie, but this movie does not rely on that or special effects. This has story and great actors to perform it. Thumbs way up!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun but pointless,"I realize that ""Predator"" is not supposed to have a point, few good action movies do, but something about its presentation just seems a bit empty. We have Arnold Schwarzenegger in the jungle with his elite force of operatives, and they quickly learn they were duped into going on an assassination mission by Carl Weather's CIA operative character. They are nevertheless incredibly successful, taking out a massive camp of rebels in a fashion that is, by Arnie standards, very believable (let's just say we aren't asked to believe he succeeds because 50 guys can shoot at him point blank with automatic weapons and not give him so much as a scratch, as in the ridiculous Arnie flick ""Commando"").The spot the elite team is in, with a valuable captive in tow, is apparently too hot for an airlift so they have to go through a nasty stretch of jungle, where they quickly learn they are being stalked by something evil. They have to fight it off, and that's pretty much the movie.I have always been underwhelmed. It's true that the actors do everything you could expect, and the script isn't weighed down by silly moral and political posturing, love interest subplots, convoluted sci-fi back-stories and the other clichés Hollywood feels need to be tacked on to action flicks. Still, the finished product is little more than Arnie and flunkies in the jungle fighting a monster. It almost reminds me of Arnold's infamous first movie where he fights a bear in one of the most poorly shot action sequences ever. This treads dangerously close to being that bear fight with a massive budget. That's not to say anything in the movie is badly done, this is a very solid production, but there's really nothing in the movie other than the well-directed action scenes.All that really saves it are the fine performances by the actors (including Jesse Ventura of later political fame), its streamlined presentation, and the fantastic score, which seems to have been very influential on action film music up to this very day.If you want something fun, utterly void of anything to think about at all, this movie is alright, but I'd be just as happy with one of Arnie's sillier movies where you can enjoy yourself just poking fun at the absurdities.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I Named My Dog Dutch... That Says it All,"In 1987, the trophy hunter from space was born (not literally). 'Predator' is my favorite Schwarzenegger film.

Of course they're not the only ones to make this movie incredible; the music and sound are just as recognizable, and the rest of the cast full of bad mother truckers makes this one of the best action films of all time.I've seen 'Predator' countless times, but it's always a pleasure to introduce it to someone new.

It's a film that captures your intrigue right from the beginning and only gets more interesting as the movie continues. The action scenes are terrific with the final showdown really bringing out the intensity and becoming one of the best battles in cinema history.

The Perfect B Movie,"Predator is B-Rated, action nonsense at its unadulterated finest. It's just about everything you could possibly hope for in a maniacally crafted, action blowout. From my perspective I can respectably understand both the majority of Predator fans' opinions and the majority of critics' opinions (which tend to be negative) towards this film. In the long-run, Predator isn't necessarily my cup of tea, but I fully respect the hype and admiration surrounding the picture, as it does make for a solid, kick-back watch. However, that doesn't take a way the fact that I had some faults and issues with the flick. Despite the movie containing some of the all-time most rad, cheesy, badass one-liners, it's screenplay/dialogue is quite mediocre for the most part. Additionally, the actors'/actresses' performances, at least for me, don't hold up superbly well-(I hate saying this) even Schwarzenegger sometimes feels unconvincing in parts. It's also pretty shoddy that it becomes troublesome to care for any of the characters in this movie, considering we are provided little to no information on just about any of them, making the deaths and kills feel more gore-porn directed rather than emotionally draining. I understand that this movie isn't necessarily trying to be super subversive, deep, nor meaningful/compelling-it's just simply trying to be a mindless, action phenomena-but regardless, it doesn't change the fact that some character development would've made for a better movie. Also, the emphasis on ""action/violence over-kill"" didn't fit well with the more intense atmospherical presences. There's certain points where a sequence will carry on with an ongoing series of explosions, or an ongoing series of random gun-firing, and it'll be pretty wicked for a while, and then exceed it's welcome for way too long, and sooner or later, become pretty comical and goofy. I'm sorry if it seems like I'm nit-picking apart this film to death (and it's defintely seems like it cause I probably am) but conclusively, at the end of the day, I enjoyed rewatching Predator, its just that I didn't feel like I took a whole lot out of it despite its creative aspect/gimmick with the Predator villain. It essentially, didn't seem disaparate enough nor equally or close to as impressive as some of the more classic slasher/sci-fi thrillers. The most interesting aspect about this movie though, well, was the character of the Predator, who is BEYOND dreadfully stunning. Every time you get to glance through the perspective of the Predator, it makes for a bone-chilling sensation. He's almost up there with the Xenomorph for me, and additionally, I'll also give him the benefit of the doubt by saying that he would totally kick a Xenomorph's ass if they went head to head (this being from the perspective of a person who has not yet seen the AVP movies). Predator may be a semi-gutless, creature feature, but it's also a semi-kick-ass, action extravaganza. Verdict Change: (B+ -> B)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Predator: 5/10,"I suppose that all of these ""versus"" movies have some redeeming qualities to them. They make the average moviegoer go and see the original movies. Before Freddy vs. Jason came out, I rented Friday the 13. And for Alien vs. Predator, I rented both of those movies. Alien's DVD was broken, so I watched Predator instead. Expecting a pretty good action/sci-fi along the lines of The Terminator, I was excited to watch this movie, hoping-nay, knowing-that it would be better than Alien vs. Predator. Was I right? Sure, but not by much.Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his commandos are sent to a jungle in Central America to rescue others, discover that there's worse things at work there instead of random bad guys the army has to kill. It turns out that the title thing, who can become invisible at will, is stalking and killing all of them. Guess who's the last one alive who has to kill it?The first 45 minutes of this film have nothing to do with the title being. Instead, it's this search-and-rescue mission that doesn't affect the outcome of the movie at all. Dutch and co. have to go in and kill a bunch of random people, the nationality doesn't matter, as long as they're not American. I suppose that's tolerable as long as the last hour is filled with thrills, gore, and fun. But considering what I just said, the last hour didn't have those things. Instead, what we have are a few, misplaced one-liners, a little generic action, followed by a lot of sitting around and talking. It's not even violent, it mainly consists of the cut-away kills that people don't like about the PG-13 action films. But when the people sit and talk, the dialogue isn't even interesting, it's a bunch of cursing and ""Where's [name]?"" Does anyone really care?Not being alive in 1987, I can only assume that the special effects must have been spectacular for the time. Now, they look generic. The costume of the Predator's alright, but nothing to write home about. Definitely the best part of the movie are the POV shots taken from the Predator. He obviously sees in heat, and even I was amazed by those effects. They also play the continuity with that well, while every other possible continuity error occurs throughout the film. For instance, at one shot, Dutch is completely covered in mud. The next? Clean. To sum things all up, Predator is a sloppily made action movie that's made superior from its ""versus"" movie because of the view of the Predator. Save your time and money by looking online for some screenshots from the movie. You'll thank me.My rating: 5/10Rated R for language and some violence.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This film will make you a god damn sexual Tyrannosaur,"There's a trailer doing the rounds on youtube at the moment for Alien versus Predator 2: Requiem that looks set to readdress everything that went wrong with the Paul W. Anderson directed first installment. Relentlessly gory and violent, it features exploding heads, children under attack from face huggers, a man's nose being burnt off by acid and absolutely masses of blood, guts and bad language. Aside from bringing worry to every puritan mother who lets their kids browse the web unattended, it also shows that with this new movie, a different approach has been taken. For one thing, the producers aren't throwing ideas across the board room table about how to update it for a new audience by making it suitable for children. It also seems as though the director has bothered to watch the originals before he set about making it. In short, it's just the sort of promotional material that gets anticipation building and is precisely why now is the right time to go back and watch Predator, the muscle bound and ridiculously violent rumble in the jungle that became one of the most loved action films of the 1980s.Considering that the film sees an elite commando team being hunted down and killed off one at a time by a ferocious alien monster, Predator's lineage is quite blatantly obvious. It's almost a missing link between the two Alien movies; blending the stalk and slash monster mash of the first with the Vietnam era machismo of the second. However, it also has enough individuality to stand on its own two legs, thanks to the appearance of two iconic individuals.First and foremost of these is Arnie. Good old reliable Arnie, doing what he does best; playing a really big guy with lots of guns who specialises in killing people. Dutch Schaeffer isn't a big step up from any of his other characters from the era: he has no convoluted back-story, no dark secrets in his past, but he is a professional and the absolute best of the best. How do we know this? Because Carl Weathers says so. And then he shoots a bunch of people. He's ably matched against the other icon: the Predator itself. Taking on a more humanoid form than the xenomorphs of Alien, the Hunter is a formidable presence. It stands at seven feet tall, dresses like a cross between a bodybuilding Samurai and a bondage model and its favourite hobbies include ripping the skin from its victims bodies and collecting skulls as trophies. Hell, it's so bad ass that it seems like the only opponent Arnie has ever faced that could conceivably kick the living daylights out of him. Not even the Devil managed that.They're backed up by a colourful cast of supporting characters, among them Carl Weathers, Sonny Landham and Jesse 'The Body' Ventura. Each is unrestrained machismo taken up to boiling point, especially Ventura, who spends most of the film striding around with a ludicrously big gun in his hands, chewing tobacco and reeling off swear words. Best of the bunch though is the character actor Bill Duke as Mac; the imposing man mountain driven mad by the heat and the violence.But there's a third hand at work in the proceedings who isn't so immediately visible: director John McTiernan, his generation's answer to Michael Bay. Considering this was only his second directing credit, he handles the project with remarkable skill. The explosive battle with the guerrillas is a barnstormer of the highest calibre, McTiernan filling the screen with massive explosions and a ludicrous body count. With that out of the way, he changes gears and the whole film shifts naturally into a chase through Central America. He may have a reputation for being most at home with chaotic gun battles, but the second half of the film is remarkably tense. As the commandos are pursued by a foe they cannot see, their bid for survival is packed with suspense.No surprise then that this film is so loved. It's ridiculously silly in every aspect. The men are so macho they're barely a step away from appearing in a gay bar's cabaret act. The violence is so outlandish that shooting people isn't enough, half the time they have to be on fire as well. And the guns are so big that in real life, some can only be used if mounted on the side of helicopters. It may be the Friday night beer and violence flick of choice, but it packs more iconic characters, quotable dialogue and downright cool sequences into it's 107 minute running time than Van Damme managed in his entire career. It's even got a few nods to the ambiguities of the Vietcong apparent in the unseen, alien enemy for cultural studies students to get their teeth into. The second round with the Aliens is due at the end of the year, but my money's on this guy.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of Arnold's best.,"This one has soldiers attacking a base of rebels or terrorist or something. After they hit the base though the fun begins as this creature from outer space is tracking them through the thick jungles.  It kills them one by one, hunting them.  The army men led by Arnold try to set traps for the creature, but no matter what they do the creature always is one step ahead and one tough critter.  The fact that this movie was such a hit is a bit of a surprise...in fact how good it was is a surprise too.  They had so much trouble shooting this one, almost all the predator shots had to be done again as the original Predator looked really bad...it was played by Jean Claude Van Dame.  They got a really tall actor to take his place and it worked a lot more as this one towers over Arnold and made the final fight great.  The design of the monster's face changed a lot too, as the original looked really stupid, more like a mosquito or something from a bad science fiction movie of the 50's.  In the end though this one turned out great and the finale is one of the best.  Arnold facing off against a giant, ugly, super space alien hunter.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Don't like the first-act action scene? Stick around, it gets better.","Updated review (written in 2021):
Typical 80s-action-movie excess gives way to slow-burning suspense in 'Predator (1987)', a sci-fi action-horror about a group of elite soldiers who find themselves stalked by an otherworldly sports hunter after they complete their latest mission in the jungles of South America. The crew are commanded by Dutch, a no-nonsense cigar chewer played by the insanely swole Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose ultimate face-off with his would-be killer is the film's clear highlight. The picture is macho in just about every sense of the word, for better and worse. There's also something ironically homoerotic about a lot of it, the frame often filled with the rippling biceps of sweaty men who constantly find excuses to take their shirts off, and one subplot heavily implies - likely by accident - a romantic history between two core characters (at least, that's how it feels to me personally). This isn't meant as a slight, of course; I think Hollywood could use more gay action heroes. Another likely accidental undertone is the feature's decrying of Reagan-era CIA operations and the way in which they disrupt other countries for their own typically monetary gain. The movie, despite its obviously right-wing approach to military men and masculinity in general, is rather anti-government. This is true primarily of its first movement, which sees our heroes undertake a dangerous mission on iffy intel because their higher-ups view them as expendable. This plot element is largely discarded once the eponymous predator starts picking off core characters one by one, but it reverberates throughout the entire affair. Not only does it ensure the isolation that makes the movie's central concept so dangerous, it also thematically mirrors the literal events of the narrative. The film isn't all that interested in politics or theme, though. It's a down-and-dirty, moment-to-moment rollercoaster ride that switches between tree-surveying suspense and bullet-spewing action more times than you can count. The flick gets more successful as it goes along, initially starting out quite slow until its first act crescendoes in a chaotic set-piece that's easily the biggest and loudest part of the entire affair. Then, it starts to pare things back as its second act progresses, instilling a sweaty sense of dread as we join our characters in squinting through the shrubbery to see if we can spot the elusive outline of their near-invisible enemy. The third act strips away the militaristic bluster and endless supply of nature-shredding ammo entirely, transforming the feature into a tête-à-tête between predator and prey. This largely dialogue-free segment is the highlight of the experience, a tense and exciting showdown that works precisely because it is so comparatively subdued. The overall film is exceedingly well-crafted and atmospheric, a wholly believable marriage of special-effects wizardry and brass-tacks filmmaking. This is a big-budget blockbuster with tons of style and just the right amount of smarts, an almost unexpected blend of surprisingly successful suspense and the kind of over-the-top action that's now synonymous with the decade of the film's release. The pacing of the first half is slower than I'd like and some of it feels a little tonally incongruous. The guerrilla camp battle (or, let's be honest, massacre) is too disjointed to connect on any meaningful level other than ""oh, look at those cool explosions"". Plus, a lot of the flick isn't as engaging as it could have been. Despite these issues, this is still an almost consistently entertaining experience. It's occasionally really gripping and it's a ton of fun when it is. It constantly gets better as it heads into its finale. It's really good. 7/10Original review (written in 2016) presented for posterity:
Predator is hilarious for all the wrong reasons, and I love it! Well, I say 'love it' but it's more like 'I like it quite a bit.' It's full of stupid, cheesy one-liners that are endlessly quotable (my favourite being the one I referenced in my summary just due to it's pure randomness.) I laughed a lot more than perhaps the film wants you to, and thought that the entire movie was actually pretty bad but for all the right reasons. Arnold Swarzenegger is as good an actor as he's ever been, but he carries this film well based upon his actions rather than words. The action is what you come to see, though, and it's all pretty good. John McTiernan expertly directs the film, keeping up the pace and making the Predator a believable and compelling villain. Indeed, the special effects are very good too and I didn't once see the Predator as just a man in a suit. Look, this is by no means a masterpiece. However, I can see why it has such a cult following - like so many of Swarzenegger's 80s flicks. It wasn't the best film I've seen; wasn't the worst; wasn't even all that engaging, but it was entertaining and gave me a good laugh or two. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A fun, action flick that I would consider a classic.","I read on the IMDb trivia that Arnold was originally wary of the original script that featured just him facing off against the Predator, and thank goodness for the rewrite. All of the supporting characters compliment the plot near perfectly, and they all have simple, easy to follow character traits and motivations that make for easy investment without taking away from our lead - Dutch, played by Arnold.The setting of the film is fun, believable and engaging. It certainly brings the jungle alive and pulls you into the story. The score plays a big part in the storytelling, and does a phenomenal job at creating the mood and atmosphere for the scenes that it takes place in. The sound design is what I would personally compliment the most, as I do not believe the film would be the same without the way the jungle sounded so authentic, the effects of all the different types of gunfire used, and not to mention the iconic sounds that brought the Predator to life.A seamless film with little to no dull moments, would be the perfect addition to anyone's collection for all sorts of occasions.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Predator's design is awesome.,"When you watch this movie, it is obvious it's at least 30 years old, but on the other hand, it offers a lot of stealth action, tension and drama, things that many movies lack today. I must admit that the movie has a bit to slow pace for my taste, but at the end the fight sequences between Arnold and the Predator, who by the way, looks sick without the mask, made this movie what it is today. Of course, a lot of macho moments, cliche quotes and all of that, but it is from the 80's when all of that was awesome anyway.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Weird action thriller that spawned a legacy.,"ACTING 5/10 Though we could say it has Arnie at his best here, Predator (1987) is a festival of plank characters with strong personalities.SOUNDTRACK 5/10 Overall, generic action movie soundtrack for the time.SPECIAL EFFECTS 7/10 Even though they did a great job with what they had, you'll be seeing some weird CGI and that heat detection camera view that is overused throughout the movie.PLOT 6/10 Predator spawned a legacy of his own, but we gotta be real here: its plot is as simple as it gets. ""A rescue time is called to, duh, rescue hostages from a bunch of guerrillas."" Sounds generic, and it is! The plot twist: they are being hunted since the beginning by a killing machine creature. Nothing is explained enough and it's all about them being hunted down.OVERALL 6 (5.75)/10 Predator creates an inovative, sort of weird, plot that manages to deliver. It's nothing but good ol' 80's action.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Arnold bounces back from Raw Deal,"After the huge disappointment with Raw Deal, a fresh new idea came to action films.  An alien that hunts humans for sport.  Carl Weather (Appolo in Rocky) teams up with Arnold in this action adventure.  Arnold is such a good physical actor that in the end with his Conan scream make this film a thriller.  A director does not need much dialogue in a script when the visual is considered more important.  The direction in this does not need it.  This film will hunt you down, and I give it an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The suspenseful music score is a true classic and it's a shame that it hasn't been released on CD yet.  The actors, even Arnie, are perfect for their roles.  Director John McTiernan's shooting style and editing are dynamic and effective, still looking very very modern.  In fact, in that respect McTiernan was ahead of his time.  How many other movies from the 80s look like this?  It's paced and shot like any modern 1990s/2000s film. Terminator 2 is a great film, but the dialogue, fashions, and effects have already begun to look dated.  Sometimes, keeping it simple is better...",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Epic motion picture. A must see for all!!!,"Predator knocks it out of the park! Even though it might appear dated at first glance, do not be fooled. This movie is a timeless classic, and is a must see for anyone who has even a remote interest in action, sci-fi, horror or adventure genres, or just loves epically awesome movies! A group of U.S. commandos is sent on a covert rescue operation, deep into the jungles of Latin America. On their way back from the mission, the members of the squad start getting killed off, one-by-one. They realize that something in the jungle is hunting them.Predator is as great as it is straightforward. The story, acting and special effects are not elaborate, but are all exceptional on their own and work extremely well together. Yes, I said acting in Predator is exceptional. It's not going to win any Oscars, but the collaboration of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers, along with a group of fine supporting cast members are perfect for the kind of movie that Predator is. Thus, I deem it exceptional. Same goes for character development, which effortlessly makes you feel like you've known these men for years.This movie is violent at times but it is not sadistic in nature, which is the route so many of the current action, sci-fi and horror films have chosen to take. A character's life comes to a swift, glorious and warrior-like end rather than a slow, miserable and painful finale.The Predator takes pleasure and pride in the challenge of the kill, rather than the torment of the prey. I believe this to be an important distinction that needs to be made. It shows that the Predator has a lot more in common with his prey than one would think. After all, humans have been hunting for sport for centuries. The Predator also takes his victim's skulls as trophies. The need to collect trophies of personal conquests is not unlike the behavior of many human hunters.The score in this movie is brilliant and well timed. It achieves the desired effect of heightening the tension and suspense of the film. The atmosphere created by the music is both worrisome and exciting.This movie is great because, among other aspects, it deals with the human nature. We witness a band of hard men, who pride themselves on their toughness and fearlessness, succumb to doubt and fear. To their credit, even when the commandos are facing certain doom and are clearly worried, they never panic, and fight and die with honor.The dialog is short and to the point. There are some pretty funny catch-phrases as well. This movie avoids the uncomfortable, corny state that some sci-fi, action and horror movies find themselves in, when trying to be too funny or too serious.Predator is a bastion of epic glory, a must for anyone, regardless of your creed, age or political affiliations.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The jungle....it just came alive,"When a crew of specialists is called in to trouble-shoot a problem and fix it, nothing could prepare them for what would follow. For me this is a hard-hitting solid, cold calculated role for Schwarzennegger. Not over thrown by one liners, not lame special- effects, over dramatization of the story, just a master work, done by John McTiernan, the same director that made Bruce Willis a house hold action character name.This was astounding!! The story as it starts, when they land and go into action, taking some guerrilla fighters out. Guerilla forces that have captured some American soldiers and are killing them, attempting to take over that area and occupy the territory. As Dutch (Schwarzennegger) leads his team in with cutting skill, they find surround and move in and take out a large number of fighters that have A few American soldiers with them. Then, after they have put it together and wrapped it up, they realize something is not right. There is unfinished business. They move out again after a soldier holding a woman is brutally killed, with no explanation, and the woman has seen the attack and is not making any verbal sense of any of it. This is where the terror is just starting in!So with the native Indian guide, a 'Tracker' (Sonny Landham) who's skills are honed and highly in demand for this type of work. Leading the crew of 'Specialists' including Jesse 'The Body' Venture, and Bill 'The Killer' Duke -(from many different roles)into a mission that is not what it was 'sold' to them originally. Carl Weathers, who was not so straight with them, ends up as sort of a sacrificial lamb anyway. Very well-fit considering, he was part of the original 'information' problem.The team, finds their objective and neutralizes the problem, only to find, that there is something else waiting in the wings...for them. Hunting, the expert hunters, as if it's nothing, at all. The film, is haunting, in the daylight. But when the night comes, nothing is as it seems, for this band of military brothers...Shane Black, who wrote and co-starred in this picture was right on it, all the way. This film, grips you, and pulls you into a terrifying situation, that keeps you guessing, unsure of the outcome!I rate this a ten for ten, because it rocks you and rolls all the way through. Riveting, I recommend it highly for Arnold fans or even if you don't like him, so what this one delivers it all.(****)",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the all-time classics,"Schwarzenegger redefined the action genre, owned the action 80s, and this may be his finest.It doesn't have as much campy fun gore as, say, The Running Man or Total Recall, but somehow manages to come off a little less serious than Terminator.But that said, it has remarkable tension, such that, years after the unknown element is removed, it still keeps you at the edge of your seat.As you may have read from all the other reviews, shortcomings aside, this is one fun flick.I liked the fact that the creature, which was the focal point of the film, was totally unknown to the ""bad guys"" who tricked Dutch and his team into going; the creature turned out to be a very unpleasant surprise even for Carl Weathers' character.I also liked the sinking feeling of doom as the team founditself in grave danger of an unknown, unseen threat -- it was a very good interpretation of what Vietnam might have felt like for those who never experienced the psychological terror of an unseen enemy in the thick of the steamy jungle.One thing that bugged me was that Dutch missed the creature when he had him in his sights -- I mean, crack commandos don't miss a life-and-death shot like that, do they? They should have directed an alternate reason for missing, like a little jungle animal behind Dutch causes the creature to turn his way or something...But, nonetheless, see it. Predator is one of the greats. Predator 2 is decent also, in terms of clarifying the purpose of the alien creature -- as much as we may feel hate for the alien creatures, low and behold, they show us what we, as humans, might look like to other creatures here on earth, when we hunt for sport. - should we hate ourselves as well?",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It's a movie to have in the background,"Predator didn't really do it for me. I get why it's a classic for some people, but it just felt kind of hollow.

A lot of it felt like generic action scenes strung together without much to say beyond ""look at how tough these guys are.""Arnold Schwarzenegger is fun to watch as always, and the Predator itself is a great design, but the characters felt pretty one-dimensional. I wasn't invested in anyone, so when things started going south, it didn't hit that hard.The pacing was also kind of uneven. There were moments of tension, but a lot of it dragged or felt repetitive.

Great Subversion of Genre with Amazing Storytelling,I really liked how this movie started as a muscly army film that people knew well and twisted it into an unnerving horror. Thus having the great characters be broken down to the point where their expert military skills wouldn't save them from this deadly beast that was expertly visually conveyed in how dangerous it was. Those being through freaky POV shots on both sides with the Predator's unnerving the audience and the soldier's showing great fear in how much our of their depth they really were in seeing the Predator's aftermath.

"An excellent action film; tense, suspenseful, and atmospheric","In the hands of a lesser director, ""Predator"" probably would have been another cheesy eighties sci-fi/action flick and it probably would have been remembered as such. However, in the hands of director John McTiernan (Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October), it is a sci-fi/action classic that nobody will be forgetting anytime soon. It is simply a better film than most that are similar to it, and it sets itself apart by being both technically more proficient, and far, far smarter than your average action film, and as a result it is one of the most entertaining films of all time. Though it can be enjoyed simply for what it is- a high octane, fast-paced, thrilling action film, ""Predator"" contains several references to other stories, in particular 'The Most Dangerous Game', which it could be called an adaptation of, and 'Beowulf' (the director's obvious interest in the story of 'Beowulf' led to him directing the feature film adaptation of Michael Crichton's Beowulf reworking 'Eaters of the Dead', known in its film version as 'The 13th Warrior'). It is creative and original in its reworking of these stories, as well as in itself.""Predator"" is so entertaining that some tend to overrate it. It is, no doubt, an excellent film, particularly when compared to many of the films in its genre, but that hardly makes it the 'flawless masterpiece' it is often called by its devoted legion of fans. Though the film is professional and of good quality throughout, the script can hardly be called perfect, featuring some of the most unintentionally hilarious moments in A-movie history. Also, though some of the acting is excellent, Schwarzenegger, even in action hero terms, is hardly the greatest actor to ever walk the planet. He is simply incapable of producing a performance similar to Sly Stallone in ""First Blood"" or ""Rocky"", or similar to Bruce Willis in ""Unbreakable"", or for that matter McTiernan's masterpiece ""Die Hard"". The cinematography and score more than make up for this however, and the action scenes are absolutely superb. McTiernan also makes the wise decision not to show the Predator in full for quite a while, saving the monster for the final sequences and adding a lot to the film in terms of tension and atmosphere.""Predator"" is a lot better than many people are willing to say it is and most certainly better than most films similar to it. It's atmospheric, tense, action-packed, and well directed. Though ""Predator"" can't be mentioned in the same breath as say- ""Terminator"" or ""Aliens"", it is one of the better action films of the eighties, and the Predator itself is a great, simply unforgettable villain.8/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I just feel frustrated and disappointed how boring it was. The plot progressed slowly, the dialogs lame, even the acting lame. But to be honest I liked the music.

"If it bleeds, it can be killed","When a special-forces outfit is assigned to locate a downed US military helicopter in the remote jungles of Central America, their mission takes a lethal twist with the discovery of an alien enemy apparently impervious to their skills and weaponry. One by one the commandos are picked-off by the shape-shifting creature, as the once-cocky hunters become the hunted.One of the great sci-fi movies of the 80's, and in my opinion, the one that firmly established Schwarzenegger as a sci-fi mainstay following his success a couple of years earlier with ""The Terminator"". The cast of muscle-men assembled includes pro wrestler turned actor, turned politician Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura, Rocky's old sparring nemesis Carl Weathers, ex-porn actor Sonny Landham and actor-director Bill Duke among others. Veteran R.G. Armstrong has a cameo early in the picture as the military brass who effectively sends the outfit to their doom, while the imposing 7'2"" Kevin Peter Hall dons the mandibles and inter-galactic costume to interpret the indestructible predator.Pulsating soundtrack is matched by the loud overall sound, courtesy of about ten-thousand rounds of ammunition expended throughout the picture, while the jungle sets and costumes are first rate production values. Director John McTiernan went from strength to strength following ""Predator"", first with ""Die Hard"", then ""The Hunt for Red October"" and shows the talent for storytelling and suspense here in his second feature in just his mid-thirties.

fox tricked the critics on part of the 3D,"I have seen Predator in so many ways, VHS, DVD, Blu Ray and now finally in 3D. The reviews were stunning about the 3D trailer that the critics saw and everyone who adored this flick hunted down the 3D predator. But was it all worth the wait was it what we expected from 3D. Being an old flick and never been shot in 3D a conversion was to be made. But Fox did it in a hurry and didn't work years on the 3D project like done with for example The Wizard Of Oz (1939).They used the Ultimate Hunter Release as base for the conversion. But UHR was already under fire by the critics due the bad Blu Ray conversion. So rumours started within the geeks about the 3D release. To the point, it does work in some ways and sometimes it indeed has a 3D look and sometimes it just didn't work at all. The opening sequence was the real thing with the alien arriving from space. The stars really gave depth into your 3D telee. And that's exactly were FOx went wrong. They worked with in-depth 3D in stead of 3D coming out your telee.Nevertheless, I must say that I enjoyed it because it's a hell of a movie. Some effects might see outdated but the suspense is there and the gore is still intact. I'm happy with my 3D Blu Ray but I can understand that the geeks thinking they would feel the predator are a bit disappointed.Just say that Fox went for the money and didn't spend time on the conversion, and just watch the 2D Blu Ray added within the box, it's just the old release with all the extra's but nothing knew to discover. So it's a fifty-fifty, if you like 3D just pick it up, there are uglier conversions to catch...but for the geeks of predator just leave it as it is. I gave it an eight just for the flick itself.Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terrific action film!,"Wonderful action film! Really enjoyed it!Predator is a film which can easily be enjoyed as a piece of entertainment. It isn't edgy, it isn't subtle and it doesn't give us much to ponder on but for a two hour roller-coaster ride I can't think of many films which can match this.The acting in general is quite good, the actor who plays the PREDATOR does so very well as well as Carl Weathers. Many people have criticized the film for being a kill fest but there is depth here, it might not come from the characters but it certainly does from the plot.The script is excellent and must have evoked a lot of imagination when first reading it. The films interpretation of the PREDATOR is very impressive, with very good special effects definitely deserving its academy award, indeed there is a lot of innovation here especially in CGI effects. This combined with John McTiernans great direction gives the film a brilliant visual look with steady cinematography which lets the story flow easily.

smartest use of mud in motion picture history,"Several years ago, when I was still hacking my way through college, one of my psychology professors decided to bring up ""Predator"" during a lesson on adaptive intelligence.  ""Smearing mud on yourself may not seem smart,"" he said, ""but if it blocks the Predator's sensors, this apparently meaningless act becomes an intelligent act.""  As it transpired, no one in the class had seen the movie but me, and one guy kept shouting, ""I don't get it!  How does spreading mud on yourself equal intelligence?!""  My frustrated professor eventually declared that men who hadn't seen ""Predator"" didn't qualify as real men.Just thought I'd share.  Anyway, my professor was on to something; this is a really manly, tough guy sort of movie.  And, like so many tough guys, ""Predator"" is both powerful and stupid at the same time.There's lots to loathe about this movie, including Silvestri's monotonous and silly music score, the ridiculous opening scene packed with cliched dialog (""It's been a long time!""), and the totally unrealistic battle with the rebels, who can't even manage to kill a single American while they're being mowed down by the dozens.  Then there's the dreadloked Predator itself, who is a memorable alien, but not nearly so memorable as, say, the Alien.  He's a bit silly-looking, you know.But then again, there's lots to love.  Carl ""Apollo Creed"" Weathers can elevate even the lowliest material (well, maybe not - I haven't seen ""Action Jackson"" yet), and Arnold gives a very natural and laid-back performance. The Predator's cloaking effect still holds up, and some of the sequences are suspenseful.  When the girl calls the Predator ""the demon who hunts men's skins"" (or whatever), I always get a little chill.Still, this is a pretty silly movie, even if you're in a charitable mood. My biggest problem with the upcoming ""Aliens vs. Predator"" is that the former series is venerable (it produced three classics - yes, I count Alien 3!), whereas the latter series is tacky junk.  But, thanks to Dark Horse comics, these two basically unrelated properties are now fused together into one ghastly whole.I'm rooting for the Alien.

Intergalactic big-game hunting.,"I remember when I first heard about this when I was a kid, and what stuck in mind was that it featured humans that have been horrifically skinned by an outer-space visitor. Well my eyes lit up, but at the time my parents wouldn't let me watch this, despite my constant begging. I even played the video game (that was on the old-school 'Nintendo') before seeing the movie. So when I got around to seeing it. I was totally wrapped by it, that it became one of my favourite films. Maybe I don't hold it up that high now, but I do enjoy getting it out and reliving the fun of that nostalgic period. There are no pretensions here. What we get is a no-brainer, punishing sci-fi action joint that relishes in its gripping intensity, barnstorming violence, macho performances and vastly superior alien design by Stan Winston.The stereotypical story is minimal and rather unimportant because it's all about big guns, little words to lead on to the inevitable match-up between the Predator and Arnold Schwarzenegger. What a perfect choice it was to have Arnie involved, also where else can you see him cover himself with mud. Around this time he was at his prime (where many of my favourite Schwarzenegger efforts originate), and surrounding him was an appealing, and well fitted cast featuring Carl Weathers, Bill Duke and Jesse Venture. They weren't the greatest of actors, but nonetheless were convincing in their chemistry and delivering on the action. In the Predator suit was the towering Kevin Peter Hall. This outstanding design was unique, from the ability to camouflage to its thermal imaging POV shots and the collection of weapons made this one unforgettable Hollywood monster creation. Everything about the special effects still stands up today. What this boils down to is the flow of action and well-timed suspense, and there are many commendable, almighty sequences that go hand-to-hand with the stinking hot and thickly lush jungle terrain. The location does grow tighter, and superbly alienates. Alan Silvestri's atmospheric music score is filled with scorching cues, and a foreboding presence that pierces the humid air. Testosterone fills the script, with constant one-liners, which are quite memorable. Only his second feature at the time, director John McTiernan's vigorously upbeat and confident style would go to feature prominently in his career. This man knew how to get the blood pumping, and cook up effectively powerful visuals and thrills from nothing all that special.Satisfyingly fun, brash and macho 80s action / sci-fi that doesn't wimp out on you.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A fantastic vehicle for Schwarzenegger that pits him against a formidable alien foe,"In a South American country, Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his miliary rescue team are called in by Dutch's army buddy from Vietnam, Dillon (Carl Weathers), who's now CIA to rescue assets whose helicopter was downed in the jungle. When the team finds the Guerilla's they learn this wasn't a rescue mission and was actually a CIA mission to stop a Soviet invasion. Now en route to the extraction site, Dutch's team are picked off one by one by an invisible force hunting them.Predator originated as a script titled Hunter by brothers and first time screenwriters Jim and John Thomas who'd managed to get their script looked at by sliding it under the door of Fox producer Michael Levy who in term got in shown to Joel Silver. Following the success of Commando, Silver decided to take the script and repurpose it as a vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger liked the idea, but opted for changes to the script so it wasn't just by his words ""me and the alien"" and made it more of an ensemble piece. The movie was a hellish shoot with many of the cast and crew getting Montezuma's Revenge from some of the food and water as well as the cold of the Mexican jungles that required heat lamps to be on. The movie received mostly positive reviews at the time and made back $98 million against its $18 million budget and is looked back on as one of Schwarzenegger's best films as well as the start of an interesting and formidable monster.At its core, Predator starts out as your typical ""men on a mission"" action movie that had flooded multiplexes for the better part of the 80s with the likes of things such as Rambo or Missing in Action. As the movie begins with Dutch's team laying siege to South American guerilla's in what would normally serve as the climax of one of these kinds of films, the movie sets the audience up for what seems like a macho exercise in military action only for these imposing and deadly soldiers picked off one by one by an otherworldly force. The movie does a solid job of transitioning from action film to sci-fi horror as it uses the opening guerilla siege to setup basic but strong characterizations as well as their strength as a team so it's all the more shocking when they're picked off. The titular Predator is well realized with unsettling camouflage as well as a host of weapons used to kill the soldiers and take parts of them as trophies and the suit performance by Kevin Peter Hall is well done especially considering Hall couldn't see out of the costume during filming.Predator is essentially a mash-up of Commando by way of Alien, but it adds in enough of its own identity to stand apart from the various clones of the time that tried to ape that formula. The movie features a solid performance from Schwarzenegger as well as his team with the likes of Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, and others, and the atmosphere and action are palpable and exciting.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An all time classic,"Predator is the best multi-genred film of all time. It perfectly blends action, science fiction, horror, and mystery while also having elements of a slasher and thriller. Every thing is so memorable and well written. The charecters are likeable, the suspense is fantastic, the pacing is perfect, and the action is unforgettable.

"Through somewhat interesting visual effects, the filmmakers are able to sustain the film with almost intolerable suspense, and occasionally heart-stopping moments.","Predator represents how sci-fi horror is so marketable. After James Cameron's Aliens, Predator offers another thrill for the mass audience, combining similar story structure with an instantly recognisable film star - Arnold Schwarzenegger (in a role that suits him perfectly). Through somewhat interesting visual effects, the filmmakers are able to sustain the film with almost intolerable suspense, and occasionally heart-stopping moments.Predator is solid fare, but it doesn't match the standards set by Aliens. While McTiernan has a steady hand in what he's doing, he's unable to capture the 'dread feel' associated with Aliens. Nevertheless, the action doesn't tire viewers on repeated viewings, and the film has a lasting quality to it.

A Classic,"When a team of commandos are sent into the jungle of Latin America on a rescue mission they discover that the enemy they face is nothing they could have expected.Even after all this time, 'Predator' is one of those movies that I truly love. Yes, the plot is nothing groundbreaking. Yes, the acting is a little wooden. Yes, some of the optical effects are looking a little dated. But, this is one of those classics that just never grows dull even after multiple viewings. The story is quite thin, but is fast paced and when the action does happen, it happens with bells and whistles on! The characters are all well defined and likable in a macho ""muscles and guns"" kind of way. And of course there is the Predator itself, which is a true classic of monster design. The creature effects are just outstanding, especially the unmasking sequence which is going to be one of those movie clips that will be shown in many years to come. Even though this is an Arnie vehicle, he just plays second string to the title character, and it does make a change to see him get the absolute crap kicked out of him.

Predator,"Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator) stars as Dutch, a soldier sent into an American jungle with a group of his best soldiers. But as time unfolds, they slowly learn they are being hunted by an evil alien warrior.Arnie plays the role of Dutch very well in this fast paced and mysterious Sci-Fi thriller. This is one of his more recognized and appreciated roles from his film career. His intelligent and authoritative character gives the film extra sophistication and tension as the film unfolds.It's a tense film and a very exciting watch. Being in unknown surroundings and with something out there, the film is an on the edge of your seat thriller with good action, good effects and great direction.Slightly confusing and a bit dull to begin with, but when the action scenes begin the film becomes alive with engaging fast paced scenes and reasonable dialogue.Personally I would have liked to have seen more depth to the characters. There were quite a few characters encoded but by the end I didn't feel I knew many of the characters too well to make a judgement.The villain was especially exciting. The ""Predator"" is kept quiet until half way through which makes it exciting and gives a feeling of danger and control, which justifies the position it is in, to make the film even tenser.The final scenes are very exciting to watch and the way the film ended was clever.The use of the jungle and the trees in particular are used to great effect with a feeling of claustrophobia around the setting.Its very fast and energetic and much watch for all Sci-Fi lovers.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Manliest Film Ever Made!!!,"Huge guns, Huge tough guys, macho dialogue, funny banter, One liners and an Alien. John McTiernan's 1987 classic 'Predator' is a action fans dream and a true guys film. What's not to like? Quick setup. Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team of bad-asses are sent to the South American jungles to rescue a group of POW's from an enemy hideout. Simple enough, but that's before they start getting picked off by a hunter from another planet. The rest of the movie relies on suspense, an over the top macho atmosphere and a entertaining team.John McTiernan's style of creating a believable atmosphere shines out through the characters and dialogue. Every member of the rescue team is memorable and likable due to their humorous dialogue and over the top macho-ism. Dutch chomping on cigars, Blain wielding a mini gun, Mac shaving with his own sweat and Billy's huge knife are all examples of the manliness portrayed in the film.The Predator is great in its first portrayal, brought to life thanks to Stan Winston's incredibly lifelike effect. His gadgets and weaponry stay cool and interesting right until the end. One of the things that make the film interesting is watching the team come up with new ways to kill this creature that's picking them off like flies.The film is filled with memorable quotes and scenes that will linger in your mind any time you think of masculinity. Any fan of action or Schwarzenegger will know this is a must see and one of the quintessential 80's flicks. A true guys film that teaches us that 'If it bleeds, we can kill it' and Guns + Muscles + One liners + An Alien = Manliest Film Ever. Highly Recommended",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

GET TO THE CHOPPER!,"A perfectly crafted action classic from 1987. A childhood favorite of mine and I still watch it regularly. What I like the most is the simplicity of the storytelling. It is hard to pull of, but the director John McTiernan keeps the story moving in a perfect pace. He uses the camera in a very modern way and I often forget that it is a movie from the 80s. Every short is well though out and interesting.The creature design is done by the legendary Stan Winston. The predator feels menacing and unique. The full reveal is timed just at the right moment to keep the suspense at the maximum. And when the final battle kicks off you appreciate it that much more as an audience.Even the score, made by Alan Silvestri is suspenseful. As are the action scenes. You can feel the danger behind every corner.The casting is also spot on and the chemistry between the actors is very good, giving the movie a grounded feeling as a result. Every character gets a moment to shine no matter how small the part. Great movie from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""The Love Of All Living Creatures Is The Most Noble Attribute Of Man.""","'Predator' is on my top ten sci-fi movies list. Higher than 'Terminator' and 'Prometheus', but trailing '2001' and 'Demon Seed'. A violent, chunky thriller with a score you could wrap a Padron 1926 in.In amongst the skinnings and spine-ripping, vast Arn (SO not bothering Googling any name-spell) struts his deep vegetation stuff as only he - and Stewart Granger - can. As his co-units - varying degrees of butch and dry wit - fall one-by-one to the 7ft dreadlocked light-bender, Arn becomes a kinda end-of-his-tether Tarzan: swinging on the vines and shooting explosives from his jerry-built bow.What's ace about 'Predator' is that the only human emotion on view is the will to survive.No-one's in Arn's badass unit coz they were bullied and seek to prove their tormentors wrong (yawn). No-one is there amid the amazing slaughter to forget a wrongdoing or bombed-out love affair .. They're there because they get off facing down death.Valiant pc-types concerned with modern existential horrors - societal patriarchy, toxic masculinity, dominant paradigms - can take a couple hours off their torment and focus on more swashbuckling issues: virile camaraderie, macho-carnage and undaunted he-mannery.A woman IS in 'Predator' - gasp! - doing little. She isn't in much peril; nobody gets involved with her; she doesn't get jiggy with Arn, causing him to take his eye off the ball and place his crack crew in needless danger. All this is waived. Want angry, gonad-bustin' visuals minimised by insipid old sex .. ? Exactly.There's also none of that silly Greta-inspired finger-wagging that heaped more misery upon what was already pretty miserable in 2018's cringe reboot. That folk actually believe this nonsense is a much scarier concept than pitiless sci-fi killer aliens.Back at the pageant - music clanks on, eviscerated bodies pile up, jungle clamminess almost slithers off the screen .. and there's Arn, yelling Weissmuller-style in the canopy - offering manly might, cunning and brutality as the true means to save the Earth.I like it.Fun, fun, fun til nanny (state) takes the fireworks away.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Schwarzenegger vs. The Alien Hunter: When the Jungle Becomes the Octagon,"Right from the start, Predator throws you into a jungle dripping with sweat and testosterone. It feels like Rambo, but The Expendables before its time. Major Dutch, aka Arnie, and his crew of bodybuilder soldiers aren't there to hand out flowers. When you've got Carl Weathers with you, it reeks of muscle and punchlines like Stallone on steroids. But surprise: it's not some Vietcong hiding in the bushes they're about to take down. No, they've stumbled upon an alien that makes the U. S. military look like Ewoks from Star Wars.If you thought nothing could top Alien, Predator comes in like an angry Hulk slap. Ridley Scott laid the foundation in space? McTiernan decided to do the same thing but in the jungle, with dudes who look like GI Joe figures on steroids. And surprise: the alien here is an invisible hunter cosplaying as a T-800. This isn't some Alien hiding in ducts-this is Splinter Cell with dreads, collecting skulls for trophies. The jungle becomes his arena, and the soldiers turn from predators into prey, like noobs in a Battle Royale.You'd think with Schwarzenegger headlining, the Predator would get his butt kicked. But what's genius here is even our Terminator gets his ass handed to him. The guy who sends Val Verde into retirement with a shotgun ends up running naked through the mud. Yes, even Arnie, the man who smacked down all the robots of the future, gets hunted like a rabbit in Far Cry. And that's where McTiernan hits hard: you see fear creeping onto this giant's face. Arnie in survival mode is like watching Batman struggle to find the Batmobile-strange, but oh so satisfying.If Predator was just explosions and big muscles, we wouldn't still be talking about it today. No, what really locks you to your seat is this jungle, which becomes the soldiers' worst nightmare. It's like a hardcore version of Jurassic Park, except instead of a T-Rex, it's an alien slicing you to bits like a Mortal Kombat fatality. The jungle becomes a character of its own, a final boss you have no chance of defeating. And when you see Arnie covering himself in mud like a hardcore Survivor contestant, you realize the film has leveled up. It's not just an action flick anymore-it's a full-on descent into hell, Dark Souls style.The final act is pure perfection. You think Arnie's finally going to take control, but no, the Predator pushes him to his absolute limits. This is now a Street Fighter duel, but with tree trunks instead of fists. The soldier becomes the animal; the man becomes the beast. It's a return to basics, a fusion with nature to survive. It's like hardcore Minecraft, where he's crafting traps with sticks and string. And when the Predator removes his mask, it's a shock: the dude looks like a weird cross between a Rastafarian and a crocodile. It reeks of end-times, but it's glorious.In short, Predator is one of the greatest action films ever made. It's pure adrenaline where man must become an animal to survive. Arnie proves that even he can get scared, and it's a treat. The action scenes are legendary, the jungle becomes a character all its own, and the Predator stands as one of the greatest villains in sci-fi history. If you've never seen this movie, you're either an alien or a fool who deserves to end up as a trophy on the Predator's shelf.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"""Predator"" (1987) - The Ultimate Hunt Begins","Ohn McTiernan's ""Predator"" is an action-packed classic that seamlessly blends the thrill of an action movie with the suspense of a sci-fi horror. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch, the leader of an elite military team, the film takes audiences deep into the Central American jungle, where the hunters become the hunted.The film begins as a typical 1980s action flick, with Schwarzenegger and his team on a mission to rescue hostages from guerrilla forces. However, the narrative takes a sharp turn when they encounter an extraterrestrial hunter with advanced technology, the Predator, who begins to stalk them one by one.""Predator"" excels in its pacing and tension. The slow reveal of the Predator, with its thermal vision and invisibility cloak, builds suspense effectively, turning the film into a nerve-wracking survival story. The jungle setting adds to the film's atmosphere, creating a claustrophobic environment where danger lurks behind every tree.The film's success also lies in its iconic creature design. Stan Winston's creation, with its dreadlocked appearance and fearsome mandibles, has become one of the most recognizable monsters in cinema history. Combined with the Predator's unique weaponry and hunting methods, it's easy to see why the character has endured for decades.Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers one of his most memorable performances, balancing the physicality and charisma needed to go head-to-head with the Predator.

A modern classic...,"When I first saw Predator, I was immediately struck by the genious way in which the director had presented this movie.

But one of the movie's biggest assets is undoubtedly the music.

However, it had a great movie to rely on, thus making it fairly acceptable, I would say.Although the characters had relatively small roles, they invite to memories past, and I sure would like to see a movie where we get to now what Poncho means when he says; ""Remember Afghanistan?"" and Dutch replies;"" Trying to forget..."" .

with it's sequel Predator 2 both on VHS, then in 2012 I got Predator 2 on
DVD, and the original Predator I recently got on DVD in 2018.The supporting cast is great as well, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke and Carl Weathers
I don't remember the other two Latino actors but the were good as well.Overall, an awesome film with an original story and concept.
I give it an 8/10. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Classic action sci fi,33 years on and predator is still my favourite sci fi action movie,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A truly great sci-fi flick!!,"This was an amazing movie.  Very unpredictable and entertaining.  The only down-side to the movie is that there are some boring scenes and Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura dies.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best Science Fiction thriller ever,"I finally saw this film, and I have to say that I loved it! The action is great,and the graphics on the Predator deserved an oscar. The plot is plain and simple, just the way I like it. I think this is Arnold's best film next to the Terminator's. If you like Arnold, this is a must see!  I also think the 7.2 rating is too low, I think it should be right up in the top 250 with the Terminators. 9.5 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of Arnold's best.,"Watched Dec 19, 2012Lee's review published on Letterboxd : No matter how many times I watch this it get's better and better. This is Arnold's best in my opinion,after the film finishes you end up either quoting/texting/Facebook/twitter etc...placing some of the best lines EVER in movie history, that someone out there will cherish. Just one is missing ""i'll be back"" ;--( The effects/action are top notch and like the so called fishy thing called 'Jaws', you don't see what the predator looks like until 40 odd minutes in. The first time I watched this was in 1989 and the suspense kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through. The Blu Ray transfer is top notch as I noticed the sweat pouring of Dillon's face through out. The sound is mixed into DTS-MS-TR which makes you hear every bullet fired from the front and trees/bushes etc being hit from the rears. If you love movies and you haven't seen this, stop reading and watch now.' Do it' as this simply will be placed in your Schwarzenegger Top ten list.Update:- 3D. An prime example where 3D is a gimmick. I like 3D as long as its used properly. This has been re-vamped but not a bad Job I must say. Soon as the troops hit the jungle we have plenty of 3D depth. I don't recommend for anyone to watch this in 3D but it is a great excuse to watch this class action movie again.I was very lucky to be here at a screening of Arnold's latest film. It was the best to here him shout out one of the best lines of this movie at the end of him leaving. youtu.be/fJ_K2hQk7Z0 Check the avatar pic people!""Get to the choppa""Update in November 2014:I also went to his Q & A in Leeds which was an amazing talk. Please check out these videos too.His entranceyoutu.be/a-v1kw2aZ7gBeginning of the Q & Awww.youtube.com/watch?v=-nC52NuKW4AThe best part, Arnold stating his lines...love it!www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rikgkl7G6Do",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"one of the best action movies ever, attmario!","This is one of my favorite move of all times. It has everything you could ever ask for, a cool alien, machomarines, arnold and a minigun. 10/10 without a doubt",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One Of The Best Action Movies Of All Time,It has a well developed plot and colorful characters. The Predator and looks stunning and makes this movie very interesting. A lot of memorable quotes and just a great film. A must see for anyone.,8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Get to the chopper!,I watched this movie growing up after the sequel back in the days when Arnold was the top action hero. I was probably too young for it and can remember my dad commenting on the language.My interest in watching again was started by the famous line which has become somewhat of a meme and it's really rare to find on streaming but finally got it.Like Die Hard this is another 80s action movie that has held up well and is very watchable 4 decades later. The mostly practical effects don't feel dated and the essence of raw action and suspense carries the day.They really don't make them like this anymore!,8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Original and Still the Best,"""There's something out there waiting for us, and it ain't no man. We're all gonna die.""First off, I lost track of how many former U.S. governors are in this movie!Predator is practically the ultimate in late 80's testosterone-fueled action movies, maybe second only to Die Hard, also directed by John McTiernan...the dude was on a serious roll! The last part of the movie reminded me somewhat of the last part of Jaws, just man vs. beast until one of them is killed. I was surprised Arnie didn't kill the predator with some of his eyeball-rolling one-liners! Yes kids, this is where ""Get to da choppa!!!"" originated.When I first saw this back in the 80's I thought this was average, but now I realize how much it advanced the genres it was working in. I had some questionable taste back then, I'm only slightly better now. Predator is a much beloved Schwarzenegger classic that has withstood the test of time and spawned several sequels and copycats. It has definitely left its mark.My aunt and uncle visited the set in Puerto Vallarta years ago. It's still there and used as a tourist attraction. All I got was some generic t-shirt.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Short and solid.,"Predator is so much fun to watch that I forgot all about it being an Arnie movie. It has suspense, terror, gore. a little humor and an amazing creature that will blow you away. John McTiernan does a terrific job and Arnold was very solid. Check Predator out and you'll be very happy that you did because this picture rocks!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
When action films had muscles!,Before we were as experienced in computer effects and massive explosions using CGI for every major scene we had to have real action and creativity.. that's why the action movies of the 80's are so good. Talk about testosterone.. the entire film is action packed with it. Just the whole concept is creative. The jungle comes to life.. and it skins you alive.,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A classic 80's action movie that is still popular today.,"Predator is one of those 80's action movies that still stands as a classic movie. It is also one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movies in his blockbusting career. This is pure alpha male testosterone at its finest. It's got it all: explosions, big guns, violent action, huge biceps, larger than life personalities, no nonsense story lines, and plenty of one-liners that still hold a special place amongst movie geeks. Director John Mc Tiernan has also struck gold with this classic gem of a movie and would later go on to establish himself as a reputable director with movies such as Die Hard (1988) and The Hunt for Red October (1990).Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is the leader of a special ops rescue team sent in by a CIA taskforce led by General Phillips (R.G. Armstrong) to spearhead a rescue operation of political officials and military personnel held hostage by insurgents in an South American rebel camp situated in Val Verde following a helicopter crash. Dutch maintains that he is solely a rescue team, not assassins. Dutch's team includes Mac (Bill Duke, Commando), Billy (Sonny Landham, 48 Hrs), Blain (Jesse Ventura, The Running Man), Ramirez (Richard Chaves) and Hawkins (Shane Black, screenwriter of Lethal Weapon). Also assigned to the rescue operation is an old friend of Dutch's CIA agent Dillon (Carl Weathers, Rocky). Not long after insertion, they stumble across the horrifically skinned bodies of three soldiers believed to be at the hands of the rebels. Following the successful all out assault of the rebel camp in which the insurgents are successfully taken down, Dutch takes prisoner a female guerrilla named Anna (Elpidia Carrillo). Dutch also finds out that Dillon set up and used Dutch's team as expendable assets to take down the rebel camp in revenge for the deaths of the military personnel and its hostages. Unbeknownst to the rescue team, an extra-terrestrial alien with superhuman strength, advanced weaponry and thermal imagery has come from another planet and is hunting humans for sport. One by one the rescue team are being hunted down and picked off by this unknown predator which leads to an inevitable confrontation with Dutch.While this is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best roles, it also feels like a who's who of the 80's tough guys with Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura and Sonny Landham who featured in numerous action movies throughout the 1980's and these men were a welcome addition to the cast of Predator. Shane Black was also notable for going on to establish himself for his work as a screenwriter with Lethal Weapon (1987) and The Last Boy Scout (1991) as well as a director with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) and Iron Man 3 (2013). Producer Joel Silver was well known force behind an assortment of many blockbusters such as 48 Hrs (1982), Commando (1985), Die Hard (1988) and Die Hard 2 (1990), the Lethal Weapon series, and The Matrix series.Composer Alan Silvestri (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump) always produces fantastic work and his orchestral score keeps Predator exciting to watch as well as the movie's ability for shock and awe.With Arnold Schwarzenegger's quirky one liners, Predator is still a popular 80's action movie that is still well liked by many fans. Predator is one of those movies that they just do not make like that anymore. I believe that the sequels and the Aliens v Predator spinoffs do not hold a candle to the original Predator movie and this is THE movie that still never gets old 29 years later.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than most things,"Predator is for the person who enjoys the finer things in life. Easily one of the best action movies ever made, even though I don't think even they expected it would have this sort of impact.The films starts out as an action movie, then transitions beautifully into a sci-fi/horror. The pacing could not have been better, all characters are memorable, the one liners are legendary.One thing that has always stood about to me though is the squads interactions with Dutch. Clearly the leader in a group of ultra alphas, Dutch is the ultra ultra alpha, and the film makes that clear without rubbing it in your face. The subtle interactions that they have show that his squad have the utmost respect for him, and even when they are messing around they are always careful about it, and snap out of it instantly when something serious happens. Dutch will need a pair of binoculars and just hold out his hand, and boom, there is now a pair of binoculars in it. Just little things like this that add so much to the film.As for the Predator himself, he's just awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent horror,"This film also has an Intergalactic Alien Big Game hunter equipped with plasma cannons, Stealth Invisibility and Thermal Vision. It would be so easy to imagine this film going nowhere if it where to have fallen into the wrong hands. You could really imagine a plot of an Alien hunting Commandos in the jungle coming off a bit lame but no, Fox thankfully had faith and McTierman had a vision. Fox's faith may have been down to there two previous unexpected big hits ""Aliens"" and ""Commando"" which you could possibly say this film is a hybrid of.Film also benefits from being made in that 80s early 90s era where your action film could take its self seriously yet still not too seriously. One minute we see a fairly realistic use of of weapons and tactics the next Arnie throws a truck down a hill equipped with C4 and Jesse Ventura pulls out his M-134 Mini Gun and shreds some Gorillas.The Predator it's self is a classic design, thanks to the genius Stan Winston, and in my opinion never looked better than in this movie. It looked slightly fake in Pred 2(Not a bad film too) and don't get me started on the travesty that is AvP. It could have been a different story if they had stuck to the big rubber turtle they had shot scenes with thank god Arnold himself suggested Winston.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Just because it bleeds that doesn't mean you can kill it... or, let's rumble in the jungle","One of the great Arnold action films of the 80s pits everyone's favorite Austrian and a team of rugged, machine gun powered commandos and a Hispanic chick, Anna, against a killer alien the size of a basketball player (played by the late Kevin Peter Hall, who was also big foot in ""Harry & The Hendersons""). Chaos and mayhem ensues...What starts out as a shoot 'em up slowly becomes a thriller/suspense chase movie as Arnold's men are picked off one by one until the climax between Arnold and the Predator. Arnold delivers his usual performance as a wise cracking hero and his fans will not be disappointed by this entry. One can only imagine that had he returned to the sequel, there would still be thousands of these being made.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
fantastic,"i thought predator was a fantastic movie and a complete blast of the 1980's, this movie was made the year i was born (1987). I think Predator is so cool because he is so strong and powerful and can easy kill someone, i am looking forward to the 3rd movie with a versus with alien. I think that movie will blast again of the 2000's, it's going to be one hell of a good movie, i hope it pulls out well with lots of people telling themselves and others what a fantastic movie it is, The movie is coming out in August. I think Arnold Swarznegger is a fantastic actor, he played a fantastic part in predator and has done other fantastic movies besides predator, movies such as Conan the barbarian, The Terminator, Commando, running man, twins, terminator 2: judgement day, total recall, kindergartan cop, Eraser, collateral damage, end of days, terminator 3: rise of the machines, Now theses days i think he would done great movies because his time i think has now passed as he is the governer of california. Overall i wish him all the best in the future and i do hope he will make some movies that will kiss ass, thank you arnie for the great, fantastic movies you have made for us to watch, thank you so much. I give this film 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
