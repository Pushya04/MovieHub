A romcom for effed up people,"I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a ""hey this is a great flick"" way but in a derogatory, judgmental ""you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)"" way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Enjoyed it,"People are saying that it's ""offensive"" and ""too happy"" to be real, and that surprises me.
As someone who lives with mental illness (severe major depression with severe psychotic features), and was in psych ward for quite a while, I didn't find it offensive. I found it to be remarkably accurate in portraying some of my own struggles, with mind-dulling medications, unwanted outbursts, deep paranoia, odd tics, etc. that I have had for over ten years.
As for the ""overly happy"" stuff? Too many movies and TV shows focus on being ""dark"" and ""edgy"", so I found it refreshing to see someone going through struggles being positive about it. I won't pretend to have had the most difficult life, but it hasn't been easy. I saw this movie a few months after I was released from psych ward (2016), and I can honestly say it gave me a bit of hope to find my own silver lining.

Stunningly accurate look at the bipolar life.,"I am bi-polar. I have been that way since I was a young man. I am approaching 60. I have been in treatment for many years. There have been relapses and time spent in hospitals. There have been good times. Before I received good treated, I left a trail of emotional, professional, and relational disaster behind me. It broke apart the lives of others as much as it did my own.I did not know what to expect from this movie. It is a stunningly accurate trip into the mind of a BP sufferer. It shows the disease from the outside, too. It is amazing in its accuracy. The mood swings, the detachment from reality, the failure to learn from past errors are there. Here is a guy who has so messed up he is in the hospital. He is released into the custody of his parents. He improves himself physically yet cannot see what he has done, what he is now, and what the future portends with any sort of reality.There are other situations in the film which mirror the BP life. There are job losses, broken relationships, unlimited optimism, anger, and a feeling that no one understands you. But he doesn't even understand himself. He thinks he is the only sane person around. He is in complete denial yet goes along with treatment just to get along with others.The obsession with his estranged wife drives him. Everything he does is to make himself look desirable to her.Then there is the hair trigger and the propensity toward violence which ultimately put him into the hospital. He has the belief that he sees with much more clarity than anyone else. There is also the hatred of medications and the belief that he doesn't need them.Yet, there is hope. There is no miraculous cure. There is a negotiated peace between his illness and the way he must be to survive in the world.The only thing I felt was missing was the crushing depression. But I understand that. Depression makes for lousy movies. The film is strictly about a manic life that wants to be better but cannot accept that he is badly off dead center normal.If you are bi-polar and under control, see this film! If you live with or deal with a BP, see this movie. If you are untreated, you won't get it because BP clouds the mind.My new wife and I went to see it. Up front I told her that I had this mental illness. She still married me. She is a health care worker with an understanding of illness and of treatment. After the film she asked me what I thought.I told her that I was a bit frightened to tell her that the portrayal is spot on and that I had seen all of it before.But like all bipolar sufferers, I wanted her to know that ""I was never that bad."" The truth is, I was....but we BP people don't handle reality all that well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Entertaining & good story about bipolarity.,"I'm surprised by the negative reviews. I can't really see why people would dislike this movie. Even if it's not really my genre of movie I thought this one was very captivating. Bradley Cooper did a really good job playing his bipolar character, to me it was one of his best performances yet. The Oscar for best female actress went to Jennifer Lawrence, which surprised me a bit, even though she did a good job here. But to me Bradley Cooper is the star of Silver Linings Playbook. The rest of the cast was also excellent, all contributing to make this movie very enjoyable to watch, with some good giggles, but most of all an interesting story. I find stories about the ""little bit crazy"" people always fascinating to watch and in Silver Linings Playbook Cooper did a great job playing a bipolar. I wouldn't pay too much attention to the extremely negative reviews on here, those people rarely are satisfied by anything in life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"It's a platinum lining, not just silver.","""I'm remaking myself."" Pat (Bradley Cooper)Silver Linings Playbook doesn't play by the current romantic comedy book—No scatology, nudity, f-bombing, or feminist and gay bashing. It's simply a smart playbook about the mental institution's recently-released Pat Solitano (Cooper, shedding his Hangover boy-man shtick), who may be saner than his dad, an OCD gambler (Robert De Niro), and Bradley's new friend, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence).But that comparison is all relative because director David O. Russell (remember his funky family in Flirting with Disaster?) allows each character in this dramedy to become whole and interesting without becoming marginalized.After some serious outbursts of anger, Pat starts training for a dance competition with Tiffany in order to make contact with and eventually impress his estranged wife, Nikki (Brea Bee).The eventualities of the story are not half as stimulating as the plot along the way, some of the best scenes centered around the family squabbling about the Philadelphia Eagles or Pat's relationship with that ""slut,"" Tiffany. When Pat confronts his parents at 4 AM about the deficiency of Hemingway's ending to A Farewell to Arms and when Russell places under another scene Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash singing Girl from the North Country, you know you're in a film that follows no particular playbook.The dynamics as fostered by these superior actors are some of the best ensemble work this year. In fact, this is so far the best of the romantic comedies in recent memory. Pat and Tiffany may be bi-polar, but they can dance the stars into your eyes.Jennifer Lawrence plays so different a character from those in Winter's Bone and Hunger Games that it may take you a scene or two to recognize her. But when she dances, you'll confirm she's one of the best young actresses in Hollywood, and this film one of the best of the year.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Silver Linings Playbook is a refreshing addition to the rom com genre,"While most romantic comedies usually contain bad acting, sappiness, and a large amount of predictable moments; Silver Linings Playbook is the exact opposite. There may be a little amount sappiness in this movie but there is bound to be some in any romantic situations. In reality though, all of the sap in Silver Linings Playbook can be overlooked due to the fact that the film is completely original, extremely funny, and contains outstanding acting from the two lead roles.Written and directed by David O. Russell (The Fighter), Silver Linings Playbook is about a man, played by Bradley Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover), who was just released from an eight month stint in a psychiatric hospital. He wants to get his life back on track but is being held back by his parents and his unstable condition. After a little while, he strikes up an interesting friendship with a female played by Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone, The Hunger Games). Both of these characters are going through somewhat of the same type of problems which makes their friendship even more quirky and thought-provoking.Because a large amount of romantic comedies are stale and overdone, Silver Linings Playbook is a breath of fresh air. Usually movies in this genre follow a very particular road map that entails: man is at rock bottom but then finds the perfect girl. After a while, man loses girl and must win girl back in a very cliché and unrealistic fashion. What's original about Silver Linings Playbook is that it doesn't follow that mediocre story line in the slightest making it unpredictable but at the same time, more relateable. Chris Tucker is in this movie and even he isn't predictable. Chris Tucker, the loud-mouthed actor who hasn't been in a film without the words 'Rush Hour' in the title for almost 15 years, was surprisingly mellow. Even though he was mellow, he was still very comedic and played a great role in the film.The most surprising aspect of Silver Linings Playbook, however, was the performance of Bradley Cooper. Even though this is a comedy, Cooper plays what is maybe one of the most serious roles he's ever performed. After audience members witness his work in this film, there shouldn't be any more doubt if the man can act or not. Silver Linings Playbook is without a doubt Cooper's best work thus far in his career. Jennifer Lawrence has a performance of equal caliber but that is expected from the young Academy Award nominated actress. What was surprising about Lawrence's role in the movie, was how adult it was. Fans of Lawrence's work may have been worried that she would be stuck in teenage roles after playing the character Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, but she should silence those doubts after this film with a very adult, yet professional, performance.Silver Linings Playbook is full of creativity and minimal on romance clichés. It is hands down one of the best romantic comedies to be made within the last couple of years. This film contains many laugh out loud moments and a number of scenes that will warm your heart to the point where you can't help but leave the theater smiling. Silver Linings Playbook is the perfect date movie that both men and women can easily enjoy. A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Most Enjoyable Film of 2012 So Far,"I don't even know where to begin when it comes to this film. First of all, I think it's about time I profess my love for David O'Russell because he keeps making movies that I simply can't get enough of. If there's one thing I've learned this year when it comes to movies, it's find a director you love and follow him or her blindly. There's styles you'll love, and styles you'll hate, find the ones you click with and never let go.Silver Linings Playbook has generated a lot of hype since its worldwide premiere at TIFF, and frankly, as far as I'm concerned, it deserves all the praise its received. It is by far the best film I saw at the festival, and is easily one of the most memorable films of 2012. Based on the novel by Matthew Quick, Silver Linings follows the life of Pat (Bradley Cooper) as he moves back into his parents' house after spending months in a mental institution because of a violent outburst that occurred after he found his wife with another man. The movie follows Pat as he attempts to get back his life back, but he meets a new challenge as Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence, who is completely girl crush worthy) finds his way into his life.I honestly can't remember the last time I enjoyed a movie more from beginning to end. O'Russell brilliantly tells a heartwarming, yet complicated and hilarious tale, that leaves you on the edge of the seat. The cast is wonderful, and all deserving of nominations in the 2012 award season. If people didn't know of Jennifer Lawrence before, they will now. She's quirky, complicated, hilarious, and you really just can't get enough of her. DeNiro also delivers a strong performance as Cooper's Philadelphia Eagle's loving, somewhat OCD father.If there is one movie worth seeing this year, it's Silver Linings Playbook. The story may follow a family in a very serious situation, but we can all identity with the truth and emotions that comes with struggling through times. It's a story that's easy to connect with, and it's a film that will make you smile from beginning to end. Catch this movie when it comes out in November, and I promise you, you won't regret it.For more Reviews Check out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"A Bi-Polar Review: Loved the characters, Not so much the Plot","I loved Bradley Cooper's Pat and Jennifer Lawrence's Tiffany. As two unconventional souls, living arrested lives, they deliver powerhouse performances.In fact, all the characters really shine in a way that was honest, crazy, sexy. Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro were pitch perfect as the parents. The family dynamics - the humor, the conflict - were so authentic, I believed I was watching a real family in real time.I just found a disconnect between the slightly contrived rom-com conventions used to structure the movie - the Dirty Dancing-type competition and the ball game bet.For me, I would've loved the plot to be as loose, crazy and unpredictable as Pat and Tiffany. They were the silver linings in the story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Incredible, incredible, incredible!","I saw this at the Hamptons International Film Festival as the Spotlight film and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is so relatable, even if you don't suffer from the same afflictions as the main characters, and its implications are so far-reaching that everyone, I believe, can learn a little something from Pat and Tiffany. The story sends such wonderful messages about finding the ""silver lining"" and is uplifting, even in the seemingly most dire circumstances. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are phenomenal, and I found myself really attached to their characters. This is a must see for everyone! And I will be seeing it again when it hits theaters in November.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
You'd be crazy to miss this,"Based on a novel by Matthew Quick, David O Russell has both written and directed this variation on the romantic comedy in which both main characters are deeply damaged and variably medicated.Patrick used to be a teacher before he beat up a fellow teacher (he deserved it) and was diagnosed as bi-polar and confined to a mental institution for eight months. Tiffany used to be married to a cop who died in circumstances for which she feels blame and she has not been behaving as quietly and demurely as is expected of the newly bereaved. Both lead roles are played by attractive and talented young actors: Bradley Cooper (""The Hangover"") and Jennifer Lawrence (""The Hunger Games"") and, by the time I caught up with the movie on DVD, Lawrence had been awarded a deserved Academy Award for Best Actress for this quirky performance.One of the distinctive features of this wonderful film is that most of the characters are obsessive to one extent and in one form or another, most notably Pat's father who is charmingly portrayed by veteran Robert de Niro. At turns funny and poignant, this is at heart a plea for us to be tolerant of others because - let's face it - we're all a little crazy.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Life Is a Lot More Complicated/A Psychiatrist's Buffet,"I have to agree that Jennifer Lawrence is darn good in this. Bradley Cooper overacts with the best of them. But as I watched it unfold, I just couldn't buy into it. Of course, this is ultimately a comedy, though it is a dark comedy. Cooper is completely out of control when he is off his meds. This is pretty well presented at the beginning as he rants about getting back together with his wife (after having nearly beaten her lover to death). His strained relation with his father, a bookie/Philadelphia Eagles Fan/and a raving OCDer, is in the forefront. The dad, played by Robert DiNiro is about as off his trolley as Cooper. The mom wants everything to be nice, and is constantly caught in the middle of these ""crazy"" people. DeNiro has been banned from the Eagles' stadium because of rowdy behavior in the past and believes his not being present is the reason for their lack of success. Anyway, Cooper hooks up with Jennifer Lawrence who is newly widowed. She is also a nut case. She becomes his mother confessor and his link to getting back together with his wife. She is learning to dance and insists on his helping her with this in exchange for her participation in getting messages to his ex (there is a restraining order that keeps him from her as well as the high school where she teaches). Lost in all this is the seriousness of bipolar disorder. All the people in the movie are in serious trouble, and when the chips are down, the writer and director back off and turn it into a bit of a silly romantic comedy. Cooper is unrecognizable in the second half. Where did all the angst and despair go? These people don't have epiphanies. They are in constant battle with their disease. While it captivated me on one level, I felt it sold out and became less that it could have been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Fantastic,"A smart, impactful, and surprisingly entertaining narrative, Silver Linings Playbook does more than an impressive job of exploring the live of those with bipolar, and provides a fantastic story along the way. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both give fabulous performances as the leads, Pat and Tiffany, as well as Robert De Niro as Pat's father. The film is really entertaining, engaging, and interesting to watch. It can be certainly tough to view at times, but as the world around these characters are broken down and break down in the process, the film does a masterful job of making us want to root for their sides. The film is incredibly clever and well written, and the work of the book can easily be seen upon the screen, and proves to be quite an impressive feat to match. The cinematography is interesting, and honestly provides plenty of shots that i'm sure in the future will be lead to be iconic. The pacing of the film starts off slower than the rest, but this justification, is by all means a great way to start it, and will be firmly enjoyed upon my future viewing. In the end, Silver Linings Playbook is a wonderfully romantic, emotional, and very clever film. It's approach on bipolar is a tour de force, and one of the many reasons that makes this such an important work of cinema. It's entertaining, captivating, and very impactful, and will easily not be an experience I forget anytime soon.

Crazy love for Jennifer Lawrence!,"This is without a doubt THE movie that launched Jennifer into stardom. And deservedly so! For all those who love Jennifer Lawrence and for some unexplicable reason havent yet seen this gem there is only advice: stop reading this review and start watching!But this movie is much much more than just a fun filled Jennifer flick, because David O Russel wrote and directed this crazy love classic, a movie about 2 people who are crazy and in love. The guy is played by Bradley Cooper and besides his other role in ""American Hustle"" I truly feel that this is his best performance ever.All David O Russell pictures are about families in chaos. Utter chaos. BUT despite all the chaos and craziness in David O Russell's pictures there is always a true love at the heart to be found. That is what makes Russell's pictures so endearingly huggable, loveable and crazy positive. It is so touching and uplifting to see the craziest dysfunctional people fall in love and support eachother despite all their sorrows, fights and utter craziness.Terrific supporting role by Robert de Niro!

Love Love. Rom-Com but Not,"I know a 9 may be a stretch but I absolutely love this movie. Maybe I am sucker for romance but this is NOT your typical cheesy rom-com by any means. The chemistry and acting by Cooper and Lawrence is fantastic and the scene when they meet for the first time I literally can't stop thinking about; it's so good. You then have De Niro who is also fantastic in his dad role and a little Chris Tucker addition who is perfect in his small role, just a great cast. You have Cooper who is bipolar and you get to see the real effects of bipolar and the maniac mindset of someone in love. While you know how it will end, it's just so perfectly put together that it doesn't matter. The only thing I will say, is that the score wasn't super emotional like a romance movie but it really doesn't take away much. Great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
De Niro is back,"While the big headlines might be taken by the Oscar nominated lead actors (and also Oscar winner, regarding Jennifer Lawrence), the other good news is that De Niro finally had a role he could relish in again.

And while he is never able to completely disappoint, you won't remember him for a movie called ""Freelancers"" and others in that vain.But back to the leading couple. A couple that is really so far apart, that you know what that ultimately means for them. But Bradley Coopers character has a lot more going on than that. There are relationships that went wrong and it's really tough sometimes to watch him destroying himself or at least attempting to. A very good movie, with great dialog",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Solid performances but obvious direction and writing rob it of wit, intelligence and depth","Beyond the nominations for Oscars, I hadn't really heard much about this film so I didn't have any preconceptions to speak of and came into it blind more or less. The film focuses on two characters who are each struggling with mental and/or emotional issues that manifest themselves in acting out violently or sexually. The two get together to work on a dance project which appears to help them deal with their issues to a point, however family pressures, emotional pressure, sports pressure and just generally life doesn't just go away.Given the cast involved and the awards it is up for, the one thing I did expect was for the film to be better than it ultimately turned out to be. It has a certain charm to it but mostly the film disappoints by being so very straightforward and never going really going anywhere dark or deep. Considering the backgrounds (and presents) of the two lead characters, this film is roundly safe and accessible. The mental and emotional struggles of the characters don't seem so bad – just bad enough to justify them as plot devices but never bad enough or real enough to really be an issue that would challenge the viewer or even make them uncomfortable. It isn't that it is comic so much, just that it hasn't got much meat on it. This continues throughout the film before finally it gives up any pretence of being more than just romantic fluff with an ending which does at least represent honesty from the makers – this is the film they were making all along. This is not to say that it is without value – because it is a big film with a lot of talent that is aiming to be accessible entertainment, and it doesn't miss that mark – it is just disappointing that it was aiming for the target generally, not the bullseye.The cast certainly deserve better than they got, although of course they are generally good enough to make the most of what they have. Cooper isn't someone who appeals to me much but he was solid here. Lawrence will probably get the Oscar here and, whether she deserves it or not, she is pretty good – everything asked of her she delivers which is why it is a shame that the film didn't ask for more. De Niro is enjoyable in his turn while there is decent support from others such as Tucker, Mihok, Stiles and a few others – nothing amazing, but solid. Nobody really shines though – but this is down to the material, not them. Russell as writer and director doesn't seem to have any spark, nothing really going on that stood out for me – it is professional, has some charm but mostly it was workmanlike.This is how the whole film turns out in fact; it is good in specific moments but it really plays a nice safe line throughout – ignore the subject matter, it may sound dark and interesting but it is nothing of the sort. A safe film that is consistently accessible and easy on its way to a conclusion that is at least honest about the type of film it is – it will charm many with the ending but the majority of the film doesn't charm or challenge, it just ""is"", and I found that to be disappointing.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"Beautifully acted, but difficult to believe","This is the kind of film that the Academy love and regularly shower with awards come Oscar season. Silver Linings Playbook is a story of love triumphing over mental illness that sees excellent performances across the board, but, as is the norm with these types of films, the 'serious' subject matter glosses over the cracks in the story's believability, and the happy ending rather waters down the seriousness of bipolar disorder, resulting in a somewhat insulting message that love can somehow cure mental illness. But David O. Russell, the former indie pioneer who's now a regular Oscar-botherer, is a good director, and with it's many flaws aside, Silver Linings is a funny, quite moving picture.After being released early from a mental institution, Pat (Bradley Cooper), a man brimming with anger and who has bipolar disorder, tries to win back the wife that has taken a restraining order out on him. He has a new positive outlook on life, but is still quick to anger, throwing a book through a window because he doesn't like the ending. His parents (Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro) try to support him but find it difficult to cope. He meets the equally unstable Tiffany (the beautiful Jennifer Lawrence), and the two make a deal. She will get a letter to his wife as long as he becomes her dance partner in an upcoming contest.Russell's back catalogue shows his unique eye for comedy. I Heart Huckabees (2004) was a bizarre existential comedy full of oddball characters that really worked, and Three Kings (1999), his breakthrough, managed to squeeze many laughs out of a war-torn setting. Silver Linings Playbook is more comedy than drama, but the laughs are few and far between. De Niro is the real comic relief in the movie, but his OCD, Philadelphia Eagles-obsessed father isn't believable. In fact, the whole family setting asks a lot of the audience. For a film so seemingly grounded in reality (it takes the washed-out, shaky camera approach), the supporting characters just aren't real.It works best when its two leads are together. The movie really depends on the chemistry between Pat and Tiffany, and they do sparkle in their scenes. It's rare that a movie makes me want characters to get together, but in the moments when they dance, you can feel the connection, and you want Pat to forget his estranged wife and open his eyes to what's in front of him. Cooper brings a likability to a occasionally despicable character, but Lawrence steals the film. Tiffany is a force of nature, damaged by the death of her husband and now finds herself labelled a slut after many a one-night stand. With Lawrence at the helm, it's impossible not to fall in love with her.The rom-com clichés are followed very much to the T, with eccentric minor characters that somehow all end up in the same place at the end, the will-they-or-won't-they climax, but it does them well. It also avoids any real upsets in Pat and Tiffany's journey, instead opting for a much more light-hearted, easy-going approach. But, like Pat says, isn't their enough f*****g misery in the world already? Maybe he's right, but I feel the movie took an easy path opposed to a more serious study of the effects of mental illness.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

She bets everything with no guarantee that he is capable of giving her what she so desperately needs, willing to run the risk of diving off the emotional cliff for a chance at the real thing. Her character is the lynchpin of the story. And Jennifer Lawrence is nowhere to be found here. The success of the movie rides on her shoulders and she is brilliantly up to the task.

Not really a family-friendly movie, but definitely worth a watch for adults! I would recommend to everyone :D",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Silver Linings Playbook (2012),"A witty, funny and emotional film about a unique person with psychological issue. A story about recovery of soul, redemption and struggle. And they are beautifully captured to film.Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence is an awesome duo.Robert De niro was also stunning.Overall one of the must see movies of the year.Overall - 3.5 / 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Realistic and Heartwrenching,"My brother has Bipolar, similar to Bradley Cooper's character in Silver Linings Playbook. I stumbled upon this movie by mistake and chose to watch it because of Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. By the end, I was in tears. This movie (which is an adaptation of the book) is so incredibly emotional as it chronicles the attempt of Cooper's character to manage his life, despite his mental health. Jennifer Lawrence is a welcome addition to the cast in one of her most serious and well-acted roles to date. This film is a must watch of 2012 and will always hold a spot in my library.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
I was strangely attracted to this film.,"Not only for its ""real life"" romantic comedy with tragedy (like last year's ""The Descendants""), but just the blunt honesty that the film brought to relationships.

"intimate, offbeat, and thoroughly engaging","Excelsior! Having spent several months in a psychiatric hospital, a recently divorced man suffering from bipolar disorder is released to live with his overbearing parents in a suburb of West Philadelphia-not exactly an ideal scenario given his unpredictable behavior and attempt to get his act together. While his mother tries to get him back on the right track and his father desires to make up for lost time by bonding through Eagles football, he meets and forms an uneasy friendship with an unorthodox young woman (recently widowed) who's just as messed up as he is. Like you'd expect the film has a foregone conclusion, but focusing on two lead characters who are totally screwed up creates more entertainment by sidestepping the typical elements of the genre. Moody, poignant, and unconventional, with colorful dialogue and important themes like family and friendship are all displayed by Russell's skillful direction that effectively captures the shifting moods of his mercurial characters. Cooper is appropriately brooding and neurotic, Lawrence perfectly feisty and acerbic, but the acting is superb all-around. ***",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Underwhelmed,"I think I must have gone into this with unrealistically high expectations after all the foo-fer-all made of it during award season because I came away underwhelmed. Sure the acting is fantastic and if this was meant to be a romantic comedy (?) its a good one, although I don't know how you could classify it as such. It is original in its storytelling though; sad, dark, fresh.Bradley Cooper gives a great performance as a man just released from a mental institution after 8 months, trying to rebuild his life and win his wife back, or at least get the restraining order removed. Jennifer Lawrence is good too but again I think I was expecting more from her due to the academy award she received.The ending was kind of meh, that's it? and I'll admit to being bored in sections as well as catching a couple of errors (duct tape appearing and disappearing on shoes). Philadelphia and their team The Eagles play a major role. There's a great supporting cast with Robert DeNiro and a refreshing role from Chris Tucker. 05.13",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
The real life:: Silver Linings Playbook,"If I had seen this movie within a month when I got discharged from the rehab I would have definitely said this movie is just insane and nothing happens like that no one behaves like he does...etcetera _. But now after a few months , when I watched it I should definitely say it was just the same or no way that one could explain it better than the way it is done in this.If you have ever been admitted in a rehab it's yours. If you have any one of your family member who has gone through a rehab you can relate it to those situations or if you had any friend turned maniac and put inside there you too can understand a bit. If you have no idea how it will be the life after you turn insane and your life after the the rehab and how the society will see you after all these ...,there is no other movie which can show you better..No matter what. If you watch it there is no doubt that you become a hardcore fan of Bradley Cooper cos he has not just acted or lived in the movie he had done something more than just words could explain.Cinephile Opined :: #Love_it",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Typical Hollywood cliché,"I give this movie a generous 7/10 only because it handled the issue of bi- polar disorder quite well and the performances were solid. However, other than that, this movie was nothing special.Typical Hollywood cliché. Predictable all the way through, relatively uninteresting script, extremely cliché finale. SLP had heaps of potential. It was good, but could have been MUCH better!I feel I might be pessimistic, but the run at the Oscars this year with the Best Picture Nominees has been disappointing, with not a single film giving me that amazing special feeling I have gotten in the past.

Jennifer Lawrence Outstanding In a fantastic movie.,"I've been a great fan of Jennifer Lawrence. I've watched all her movies and always rated her highly. With the exception of The House At The End Of The Street. I think a poor script was more to blame. She is a beautiful and very hot Actress. I first saw a review of her on bustybusts.com and have been hooked ever since. So about the movie....I like movies with a strong story line, this delivers on that score. Bradley Cooper plays a guy who is released from a mental institution and goes to live with his parents. He meets up with Miss Lawrence (Tiffany) and it's kind of a relationship that build only 2 crazy people can develop. I can't say much more than in fear of spoiling it.

Zonked Right Out On Life,"Silver Linings Playbook is a touching, moving love story about two damaged people who find love and try to get over their past trauma.The big plus is that the film is a well acted ensemble piece. The negative is that it is never going to be a true portrayal of mental illness.We meet Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) when his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) takes him away from a mental health hospital after eight months. The doctors do not think he is ready to be released and initially you think they are correct. Despite Pat's positive outlook he is still affected by the memories of his disintegrating marriage. He found his wife in the shower with her lover who he then beat up. Pat was hospitalised as part of his plea bargain. A certain Stevie Wonder song still sets him off.His father Patrizio (Robert De Niro) himself has some OCD, he is gambling in order to buy a restaurant. Despite hitting rock bottom, a friend introduces Pat to a widow Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence.) Tiffany married young and her husband who was a cop died young. She is volatile, depressed and is dealing with her pain by having frequent casual sex. It starts off well with a discussion on various medications they have been prescribed.Both begin an acerbic relationship, which becomes tender as they practice for a dance contest. Pat still needs to come to terms with his relationship with his ex wife. Pressure mounts as Patrizio has laid a big bet based on the outcome of the dance contest.Writer/director David O Russell probably knows what it is like to be manic. Actor George Clooney made it known how appalled he was with O Russell's on set behaviour in the film Three Kings. This was not an isolated incident.The film is a funny, touching, gritty drama. It has comedy and feels heartfelt of people pulling together to help each other out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Worth watching many times,"I am a guy whose favorite movies/shows are dark true crimes such as Mind Hunters and Narcos. Silver Linings Playbook is almost the opposite to those. But I somehow love this move so much that I just watched it again on Netflix. This is my third or forth time watching this movie!First, this is by far Jennifer Lawrence's best performance in her career. She was brilliant in this movie and just oozed incredible charm as if the movie was written for her. Maybe JL is a little crazy herself, you might think because she portraited a bipolar person so incredibly well. I bet it will be challenging for her to find another role that she can match her performance in this movie.The second best performance belongs to Jacki Weaver, who played Pat's mom Dolores. She is such a beautiful and skillful actress and her expressive eyes are truly precious. You could not tell from her accent that she is actually Australian.Bradley Cooper, being a Philly native, had solid performance. However, I felt cooper missed a moment to bring it home when he was reading Nikki's letter. It should be a very emotional moment and his expression felt a tiny bit short. It could be just me.It is a fun story about two mentally challenged persons and how they found each other. Go watch it on Netflix, unless you are a Cowboys' fan LOL.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"An engaging, witty and heart warming story","Among the new releases over this holiday season was quirky comedy/drama Silver Linings Playbook. Starring Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert DiNero, the offbeat comedy has swept this year's awards with major nominations for Oscars and Golden Globes; it even managed to snag a best lead actress globe for Jennifer Lawrence at last week's ceremony. The story centers on Pat (Cooper), a teacher who has to move back in with his parents after a stint in a mental institution, Pat suffers from bipolar disorder and is trying to get his life back on track by getting fit and reconciling with his wife, but like any good comedy, this does not go to plan. Pat's football obsessed family want to help him get his life together, but once he meets young widow Tiffany (Lawrence), things start to go awry. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, but in return she asks him to be her partner in a local dancing competition.Silver Linings Playbook had the potential to be your regular romcom, but thanks to its somewhat controversial theme and excellent casting, it effortlessly avoids this. Instead, viewers are treated to character driven plot that is filled out with a mix of tense and hilariously awkward scenes that make the film incredibly enjoyable. The ending is the only predictable aspect of the film, but it's a satisfying one as the characters you were rooting for get what they deserve.From the get go, Silver Linings Playbook is clever, engaging and heart- warming, both Cooper and Lawrence give outstanding performances that make their characters not just likable, but believable too, and an all- star supporting cast including Robert DiNero, Jacki Weaver and Chris Tucker give the story more layers. A film about mental illness, dancing and American football might sound slightly strange, but it's the strangeness of this film that makes it so good, and a shoe in for at least one Oscar this year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Not a Rom-Com, Just A Beautiful Motion Picture.","I don't understand why I'm seeing such a pervasive rom-com label attached to this film. This is a fallacy. In reality, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a film of captivating emotional depth with a spot on depiction of bipolar disorder and stigmas within mental health. The acting across the board was sensational from Robert Deniro's best supporting actor nomination to the breathtaking performances of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.

This film is well done,"Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best preformed films of the year. Bradley Cooper plays against his usual ""man whore, with a heart of gold"" routine and gives his best performance ever as Patrick, a man recently diagnosed as bi-polar. Cooper is effortlessly captures moments of humor and only to turn to anger or sorrow in the next minute. Jennifer Lawrence in the perfect compliment to Cooper playing a recent widow turned sex addict. Lawrence took what could have been a flat character and was able to make a dramatic and moving performance that shows her acting skills; being able to transform from totalitarian fighting teen in the Hunger Games franchise. Cooper and Lawrence drive the film through their chemistry, every moment they share on screen is magnetic.The supporting cast is also fantastic. De Niro gives his best performance in years as Patrick's football fanatic father. Much like Lawrence, De Niro is able to make his character grow, even with limited screen time. He also draws a surprising sympathy from the audience despite his unlikeability. Jacki Weaver should not go unmentioned. Her sociopathic character in Animal Kingdom was the black horse of the Oscar's in 2010. Weaver makes due with a small role that would go unnoticed with any other actress.Overall O'Russel makes has the perfect balance of comedy and uneasiness that should be in a drama. He adds romance without making it the main focus, a triumph for a genre usually clouded with clichés. The script should be in the runnings for award shows this season, as it deftly handles the reality of mental illness without losing it's heart along the way.Silver linings is in my top ten this year, check it out while its still in theatres.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
eye-opening and entertaining expose of mental illness,"Generally, this film is a romantic drama, confronting mental issues sympathetically and with some humour but keeping the poignancy of the subject. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are the stars and rule the screen together with great chemistry and physicality. Robert de Niro was also (unsurprisingly) brilliant, depicting Pat (Cooper's) father - suffering with some mental issues himself and creating an unstable environment for a young man with vulnerability having just come out of a mental hospital. Jennifer Lawrence, also amazed by her acting skill; great range, as did Cooper. Portraying someone with bipolar or erratic behaviours is difficult to change posture and expression on the drop of a coin and these two actors did very well.The story is complex, gripping, nerve-wracking and quite complex. The story isn't spelled out and is revealed in the narrative and through the occasional flash backs. The scenes are a little choppy, certainly at first, but this probably is a technique to speed up the opening part of the film. The cinematography is plainly shot, with no surprises, and I think that it could have used some more artistic styles or variation. The language in the film was quite bad, given that I was watching with someone who was sensitive to that, but it wasn't entirely unnecessary in that it fit with the characters and the narrative. The story itself took in mental illness, love, disappointment, familial dysfunction, gambling issues, bereavement and is wonderful, uplifting and very interesting but sometimes worrying and uncomfortable to watch.I can see why this got lots of awards, including Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar, given the range of the actors and the complexity of their characters. Whilst it was brilliant, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone but will certainly vouch for how good it is! A fantastic character led drama with a touching love theme.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Some great new twists on a familiar against-the-odds romantic comedy,"Silver Linings Playbook (2012)A great drama/comedy, both funny and moving, with terrific acting from a terrific cast. What more do you want? Ah, maybe a little more originality, an ending (and a dysfunctional family) that wasn't a twist on ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" something a little less sentimental?All of these things. And yet, with misgivings intact, the movie is still great in its own way. Part of the reason is some hard, true acting. Both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are spot on believable, funny, and fleshed out beyond stereotypes. The rest of the cast, including De Niro as the Cooper's father, are simpler characters and yet the types they play don't quite become stereotypes. In fact, the three men (the dad and the two friends) are superb within their roles.It might be Lawrence who sets the movie on fire most, even above Coopers volatile, yet tightly bound, performance. Lawrence is a kind of freed version of what Cooper must play, and she's more fun, less troubled perhaps, and utterly optimistic. Which brings up the point of the movie.Beyond the plot of a pair of young people struggling with common forms of mental illness that require medication but allow for fairly normal lives, there is the larger point of rising up, of being positive, or making things happen by wanting to and following through. This is the moving part, the part that makes you love and identify and even envy the main characters as they show how to succeed within their malaise. It really is a common thing to face a mental flaw that brings your life down, or someone you love. And here is how to deal, how to try to deal.Yes, this is pure Hollywood, without suggesting its happy ending in any detail. It lacks what someone like, say, Cassavetes would attempt in this situation (and the result would fail to reach a larger audience). But it has some brave aspects, making real a situation that needs some understanding without turning it into unmitigated nightmare.Director and co-writer David O. Russell has a leaning to films that mix high drama and real human and interpersonal concerns. This might be his best film (""Three Kings"" is worth seeing for its mix of serious and comic aspects to war, and ""The Fighter"" has qualities of sadness and persistence that echo here), and it is one that sets his direction as a more serious, interesting Hollywood director. See this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Tiffany and Pat, two volatile people","Watching Silver Linings Playbook tonight I got the feeling that the parts of the film good as they are did not add up to a perfect whole. Still the film has a lot to recommend it. After all it did get eight Oscar nominations from last year including one each in all the acting categories. And an Oscar for Jennifer Lawrence for Best Actress.Bradley Cooper, nominated for Best Actor plays a husband who just did a stint in a mental hospital for beating the living daylights out of his wife's lover. All three were teachers at the same high school in South Philadelphia and that must have had the faculty and students gossiping for a year.Jacki Weaver and Robert DeNiro play Cooper's parents and both were nominated in the Supporting players category for both sexes. Weaver had her son released in her custody without telling DeNiro who accepts the situation for peace at home. He's got his own issues, he's a degenerate gambler who drives Weaver to wit's end.Some friends try to fix up Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence on the theory that two volatile people could help heal each other. Lawrence's issues stem from the death of her husband a Philadelphia cop. Although there is an attraction for them, both their joint volatility and Cooper's refusal to give up trying to win back his wife are obstacles.All those things plus DeNiro's gambling habit combine in one interesting climax where the growing relationship of Cooper and Lawrence plus DeNiro's finances are on the line. I dare not say more.Some nice location cinematography also distinguishes Silver Linings Playbook. Having visited Philadelphia a few times I recognized quite a bit of it. We get to see quite a bit of South Philadelphia where it seems everyone knows everyone and everyone's business.Both Cooper and Lawrence come across as decent and three dimensional people trying to cope as best they can with mental illness. Lawrence just lights up the screen with her performance. I didn't see the other nominated roles, but they would have had to go some to beat her out for the Oscar and apparently didn't.My main criticism of an otherwise fine film is that I see no silver linings for either main character. They'll have to do a lot to make the relationship work if they can.Still Silver Linings Playbook is a wonderful film deservedly honored with all those nominations and Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"""That's Not Just Tinsil""","Great watch, probably won't watch again, and can recommend.This is a great movie that I don't care about. I'm not a particularly big fan of either Bradley Cooper or Jennifer Lawrence, though they are clearly great actors, and give a fantastic performance in this, especially with the range of emotions delivered and broad spectrum of dialogue topics.It's about two sad, broken people who are trying to rehabilitate and release back into society despite their behavioral problems. While that is intriguing from a psychological perspective, I found it to be more sad than fun, which does make it powerful and worthy of awards and your attention, but it's not a movie that I'm going to re-watch lovingly.The writing is excellent: well structured and has good content, with an odd message that it is okay to lie to people when it is in their best interest so that you can get them to a potential to better themselves even if choose not too, and that is what love is.The movie also focuses a fair bit on proper etiquette of social interactions, football, and dancing: none of which I'm particularly fond of watching.So while there isn't a lot for me in this, objectively, I do believe that a lot of people will like this and it is well worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Overrated but fairly typical indie drama,"Over the years, indie films have become, in many ways, as formulaic as the Hollywood blockbusters that are their supposed opposites. Silver Linings Playbook is such a film. It is a standard misfit romance that tries to combine quirk with pathos(as is often the case, its fence straddling between the two means it does neither well), and the ending is pat even by Hollywood standards.It's also a movie that rings false throughout. This is not mental illness, this is movie-mental illness, in which a set of symptoms are chosen based on what the director wants the characters to do and feel. My social-worker girlfriend said the guy really struck her as more developmentally disabled than mentally ill, and while that would never have occurred to me, I can see her point. He's really more badly behaved than anything else, and it's hard to tell if his main problem is mental illness or just a streak of stupidity. His emotional evolution makes no sense as well; the change is too fast, radical and complete to be considered remotely real, and we don't really see it happening.Even the dance contest in the end doesn't seem real; it is as though two separate contests are overlapped.There are good moments in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence, while probably not really deserving of her Oscar, does a nice job of creating someone both tough and emotionally fragile. There are also bad moments, like a surprisingly off-key ""emotional"" scene with De Niro.There was a time, back in the 1990s, when an indie movie promised something that was in some way different. I miss those days.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Really Good,"I was not expecting to like this movie. I didn't want to like it. Part of me tried not to like it, even while I was watching it, but I just couldn't help it. I really liked it!

Sometimes I'm wrong, but not often. But this time I was.The reason I watched it even though I didn't think I'd like it was because a friend of mine told me that it was really good and that it would be different than I expected. This was the same friend who recommended GIRL, INTERRUPTED to me (not a fan), so I was skeptical. But he was right this time. It was so much better and different than expected.

The main reasons: I thought it would be more funny and I never really grew to like the main characters. It has absolutely nothing to do with the acting, but I often found myself annoyed by them. I really tried to like it, and kept on thinking that the best part still had to come, but by the end of the film I felt like I had missed something.

"A feel-good, enjoyable comedy-romance","""Silver Linings Playbook"" belongs to the category of good and sane American comedies, with some drama and romance, where all the necessary components are carefully and wisely rationed out to give rise to a pleasant and always enjoyable product. First, a well-constructed plot, that besides some conventions moves forward quickly and grippingly, and never concedes a single moment of boredom; then, an intelligent screenplay, that without sounding that original, is able to touch some emotional chords in a delicate way, with the addition of some funny lines. In addition, the intelligent use of a camera, to focus on the eyes of the protagonists to try to capture their inner distress to the utmost, and the emotional power of a varied and intense soundtrack, ranging from soul, to jazz to pop. Given all this, let's add a very strong cast, and the successful result is granted. The couple Cooper-Lawrence works perfectly, they are fully in sync, the former offers and unusually intense performance, and the latter gives a very promising adult-performance, considering her young age. But (and that goes without saying), the best performance goes to the always exhilarating Robert De Niro, who plays the obsessive-compulsive father with both strong and funny pathos and interacts with the loving mother Jackie Weaver in a very joyfully and heartfelt manner. To sum up, if you are looking for a feel-good comedy, just enjoy this comedy, which deserves the merit of facing the relation between mental disorder and love, with that amusing but respectful attitude, which is not so easy to find in movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

A Poignant Rom-Com,"I finished this film and read a touching review submitted by a man long suffering from bipolar disorder. As a pharmacy graduate it is a mental illness I have studied and reflecting on this reviewers honest insight I believe Silver Linings Playbook serves as an incredible portrayal of the lifestyle and personality of an individual afflicted with manic bipolar disorder. Bradley Cooper carries the lead role extremely well - I actually believe it is his career best performance - and his chemistry with Jennifer Lawrence is what the success of the production cruxes on.I would best describe Silver Linings Playbook as a poignant rom-com, and credit must be given to the director and the whole cast for pulling off such a genre bending feat so successfully. There were just a few things about this film that I didn't get, which ultimately has lowered my rating somewhat. I don't get why Pat (Cooper) was so hung up on his ex wife the whole film if he decided he was in love with Tiffany (Lawrence) the night he met her. The heavy American football theme throughout was a miss - it was actually the least interesting angle of the movie, and I usually always enjoy themes of sports in films. It just felt like a little bit of a distraction from the main story and the relationship unfolding between the two lead characters.The viewer is led to believe that Silver Linings Playbook closes with a happy ending, but I'm not so naive to believe that two people suffering from quite serious mental health issues will constitute a stable relationship. We want the best for Pat, but I felt more grief than joy at the end as I don't believe Tiffany is the most sensible suitor for him in this moment in time. As the final credits roll, I sensed there is a lot more turmoil ahead for Pat and his family.Regardless, Silver Linings Playbook is another hit from director David O. Russel. If I could, I'd give it a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A modern day classic!,"One of the greatest films made in recent years; smart, hilarious, sad and brilliantly romantic with lovely performances and written so well. Ultimately pretty feel-good too which always helps! Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are absolutely stunning in the central roles; they fully become the characters Pat and Tiffany, which we root for every step of the way. Pat's parents Pat Senior and Dolores are performed to absolute perfection by Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver, their support and want for their son to feel better is a thoroughly engaging, emotional and often times funny aspect. Very much like the film itself! Every performance is great in this film, from Chris Tucker's Danny to John Ortiz's Ronnie. It is based on a novel by Matthew Quick adapted for the screen by writer/director David O. Russell (Joy, I Heart Huckabees) who has crafted such a beautiful warm hug of a film that I really must go and buy the source material too! Everybody in the cast and crew should be so proud for having made this gem. Hell of a great soundtrack",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Traditional comedy movie, recommended","In fact, everyone has such small psychological problems, such as coercion, depression, and irritability. This is where the audience resonates with the film. The story is more common, and develops in the expected direction. The trouble of one relationship is healed by the other. This is a traditional family ethics love comedy film, the story is built quite traditionally, acting is naturally the biggest bright spot, the climax of the arrangement is one after another, the final emotions are bright and bright, and the infectious and atmosphere of the story Awesome.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"A heartwarming, pleasant movie with excellent lead performances and script","David O Russell just makes immensely fun, watchable movies. Silver Linings Playbook is a realistic and empathetic consideration of living with mental illness, and Cooper and Lawrence make the movie a success with excellent performances. From the first scenes, we empathize with Pat's day-to-day struggles and root for him to succeed. Cooper does a phenomenal job in showing the emotional swings and challenges to control himself that Pat goes through as a bipolar person. The romance and plot may be a bit forced and predictable, but Lawrence brings necessary depth to Tiffany's character. It's nothing earth shattering, but the script and performances allow the audience to really connect with and root for these unusual, struggling characters, and as I've come to expect from Russell, you get a somewhat traditional movie executed well that's just enjoyable to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Pure brilliance!,"I thought this movie was pure brilliance! I found it so powerful and gut wrenching in parts, I really felt for the characters. Pat and Tiffany are damaged, you feel that however against all the odds they fix each other. 'Silver Lining Playbook' has such beautiful morals and ideologies. It went from the depths of really low points of Pats life to the moment we were all praying for. I think this was drama more than comedy but the wonderful thing is you found yourself laughing when you didn't realise it, almost feeling embarrassed to finding things funny about difficult people with such serious problems.

Phenomenal,"Silver Linings Playbook, a movie directed by David O. Russell staring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, who both do a phenomenal job. They are amazing and have a great chemistry together. The movie is about a man named Pat who got out of a mental hospital because he snapped when his wife cheated on him, however he is still madly in love with her. The movie revolves around Pats life and his experiences as he tries to improveThe movie itself is so so good. It is so well made and just such a gripping experience that you love every moment. It has so much emotion and you just feel so many feelings watching it. Pats relationships with Tiffany, and his father and his friends, it is just so pure and really reflects his person.The movie tackles mental illness and using context clues autism. Both the main character Pat as well as Tiffany both have mental illnesses, which is definitely reflected by their characters. You learn Pat has bipolar disorder but you never truely learn what Tiffany has, however you get the idea. The movie displays mental illness so so well. It shows that even though these people are ""different"" they are still people who have experiences. The movie really just shows you how they function and live. It is so interesting and really opens your eyes to these illnesses.The cinematography is also so good. It is very pretty and shows a lot of emotion. Espically during the dance scene. This was so so beautifully filmed and is just so so fun to watch. The pure emotion from the film just makes you so happy.Finally the music really puts the movie together. The soundtrack as well as the song that triggers Pat makes the movie just so well rounded. All the songs are amazing and all around this movie is just amazing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
So much better than a 5!,"I've heard some harsh criticism of David O. Russell and his direction of several movies lately. This had me expecting this movie to be a 5 but it is so much more than that. The writing and the direction are both incredible. David O. Russell had his hands on both. The David O. Russell movies I have seen so far have all been very good and I am not sure I agree with some of the criticism I have heard lately. This movie is an example of how great he is at taking something written and adapting it into a well crafted, witty screenplay. Then he translates that onto the screen and achieves a movie that I will not soon forget.I will get the few negatives out of the way first and create a review positive / negative / positive sandwich.The major problem I had with this movie is John Ortiz and quite frankly that isn't even close to the next worst part. Ortiz plays the character of Ronnie. Ronnie is a man who is stressed out because his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles) demands that her life be perfect and that she gets whatever she desires or he is afraid that she will leave him. Veronica's harsh character fuels Ronnie's stress to the point of needing someone to vent to so that he will not freak out in front of her. This is why Ronnie ends up venting to Pat (Bradley Cooper). Ronnie is a clown. He is distracting and tries way too hard to be funny. Ortiz's delivery of every line is quite annoying and I am not sure why David O. Russell let this Jim Carrey-esk overacting performance pollute what could have been a near perfect presentation from just about every character on screen. It may have even been highlighted as a result of him being surrounded by a group of actors nailing it in every scene. Such a shame.The only other issue I had with the movie was some plot holes and cheesy moments but those were easily overlooked due to the strength of the acting and the story as a whole.You can tell a good script by how information is delivered to the viewer and Silver Linings Playbook was one of those movies that everyone should see just for that aspect of it. The way they deliver information about characters and who has certain relationships with others isn't by saying ""you're my dad"" or ""I'm your brother"" but it is cleverly disguised by psychiatric evaluation in therapy of Pat. As the movie progresses, you learn more and more information about these troubled characters. Each character has their own issues and development but each character needs the other characters to be able to grow, cope with tough situations and develop further. Lastly, the comedy in this movie is dark and at times subtle but it worked so well for me as I was laughing at many of the situations each character was involved in.I loved this movie even with its few flaws. It was great to see Chris Tucker on the big screen again as he made his triumphant return. This is a great date movie as it has sports and cheesy moments all wrapped up in one package. Just don't watch this one with a new relationship as there are some aspects that are not first date friendly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Perfect Final Image,"I adore this movie. Filmmakers tend to make movies about perfect people, but what we really want to see is the growth of those people. What I love about ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is how absolutely broken Pat and Tiffany are portrayed at the beginning (and throughout). Hands down, this is my favorite performance of both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence's careers. Their chemistry is palpable, while also being awkward and endearing.On top of their excellent performances, there is so much to love about this film: the dialogue, the setting, the Eagles, the emotion, the realness, the reaction to the final rating at the competition, I get chills just thinking about all of it. It's all wrapped up in the perfect final image before the credits roll.Best Character: Pat and Tiffany (I can't just pick one)

Two films in one,"I found there to be two films within this film. One worked better than the other.The first half of the film worked better for me. There was a veritable tension as we decide if Bradley Cooper's character is still crazy or not. The film didn't rely on silly plot triggers in this half of the film.The second half fell into too many pitfalls. I cannot see for the life of me see why there had to be so many secondary characters. Not a single one of them worked and the gags seemed tired. I've seen the Indian guy stereotype cutting loose at least five times in other films. What did the black character bring to the film? The brother subplot underdeveloped and I'm forgetting even more secondary characters..This film did not need to explore to it's depths these characters and whatever tension that was established in the beginning quickly fizzled away as we followed pointless subplots created from space ie; the dance competition and betting.The film was also too long and a bit of cutting/editing and winding up some scenes quicker than they were would have added a greater vigor to the film. However, I enjoyed myself throughout the film and did not want it to end.The absolute shining light is clearly Bradley Cooper, every other character cannot hold a candle to him. His female counterpart was particularly grating and painful to watch. Hats off to Bradley as he carried this film on his shoulders and it's a performance hauntingly difficult to forget.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Nice Movie to Watch (8.5),"Another great movie from David O.

Joy movie is very similar in terms of family relations I like your style.Just the end of the movie seemed a little simple to me it felt like they finished quickly. Maybe they should have given Nikki more time. We could only see the words she said in her ear it was a short scene that the name in the whole movie

A well-written and solidly-acted romantic comedy,"I have to say that every actor in this movie is brilliant, Cooper, Lawrence, Tucker, Weaver, and most noticeably De Niro. They all should have won some awards for their performances. The screenplay is fantastic, particularly in lines and jokes. The plot is a little bit predictable but still quite convincing. The standard four-act structure makes the movie rather accessible, even by the most common moviegoers, and that's why the film got a really high revenue.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Just a review.,This is my favourite romcom of all time with all the great story and the great characters.But with all this the movie still has got flaws in editing and dialogues that don't fit and I might as well say directing flaws because some events don't match up.

This movie will help you find silver linings in your own life.,"It's hard to take something sad and make it seem joyful. It's hard to take something challenging and turn it into something easy. It's hard to take a bad ending and turn it into a happy one. Sometimes, in life, those things aren't just difficult but impossible. Life, ultimately, is short and difficult and not naturally conducive to happiness. We have to make our own happiness, and that's where silver linings come in, or rather, that's why we should always be looking for and working to create silver linings. The theme of this film is silver linings and how even bad things can turn out good if we work hard and look for the best in everything and everyone.Silver Linings Playbook is about a man, Pat (Bradley Cooper), who comes out of a mental institution after being sent there for a crime he committed, in part due to his bipolar disorder. He comes out ready to get his old life back again, including his wife, who left him and filed a restraining order after his conviction. He's convinced that all he has to do is get fit and prove that he's dependable and stable and his wife will want him back. He's convinced that all he has to do is keep working hard and trying to find the silver linings and his story will have a happy ending. As part of his plan to prove that he's dependable, he teams up with a woman named Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who needs a partner for a dance competition.As the film progresses, Pat puts more effort into his training with Tiffany, and his bipolar disorder becomes more and more manageable. American Sniper is another film that looks at mental illness and its effects and reveals a similar story of healing. It's about a Navy SEAL, and part of the story shows how he suffered from PTSD upon arriving back home after multiple combat tours (). Just like in Silver Linings Playbook, it shows how the main character built himself back up by looking outward and doing what he could for other people.One scene that shows clearly how Pat's search for silver linings was paying off was when his brother came home to visit him. His brother apologized for not visiting Pat at the hospital and made some derogatory comments about how Pat was suddenly the looser of the family while his own life was going very well. In that moment, Pat could've gotten angry at his brother, but instead he forgave his brother and hugged him. And for the rest of the movie, Pat's brother didn't act like a jerk. That's the power Pat had in searching for silver linings. When he was looking for them and working to create them wherever he could, they became more likely and more powerful.Part of the challenge of making a film like this is helping the viewer understand at least a little bit of what it feels like to suffer from a mental illness like bipolar disorder. The film did this well by using sound and editing. The quick cuts, particularly during conversations (the more heated the conversation, the quicker the cuts), gave a sense of conflict and increasing agitation of the kind Pat must have been feeling. Similarly, the sound design added to this atmosphere. The different sound sources (TV, people) came in and out of focus as the focus shifted from one thing to another, giving the viewer a disoriented look at what was unfolding.Silver Linings Playbook is a film that takes a difficult, often sad topic and finds the silver lining in it. It shows that there's always hope, that any level of control that someone can exercise over their life is an opportunity that shouldn't be lost. And maybe, just maybe, that opportunity, if taken, will even turn into a happy ending.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Jennifer Lawrence excels in a decent romantic-drama,"Based on a novel by Matthew Quick David O. Russell's adaptation of The Silver Linings Playbook was one of the big awards contenders during the 2012/13 awards season, being the first film since Reds to be nominated for all four acting awards at the Academy Awards.Patrizo ""Pat"" Solitano (Bradley Cooper) is a man who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and been sent to a mental health hospital for eight months after finding out his wife was cheating on him. Pat is released in the care of his parents (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver), but he is still of the brief that he just needs to better himself and he will get back with wife, despite the fact she has a restraining order against him. Pat live soon changes when he meets a young woman who also has mental health issues, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a woman that could be his route back his wife. But Tiffany is a damaged woman and wants something in return, a dance partner.Jennifer Lawrence won an Academy Award for her performance and it was deserved award. She totally convinces as Tiffany, a forthright personality who has a lot of demons. The role was clearly meant to be for a slightly older actress, but it goes to show how talented Lawrence is by selling the role. Both as a character and as an actress she dominates the screen, whether she has to take command or when she has an episode.The rest of the cast also give excellent performances, something you expect considering the talent involved. Cooper and De Niro are both top actors and are excellent as the father and son, both with issues, Cooper managing with a condition while avoiding using drugs and De Niro having some OCD tendencies, hinting that Pat's condition may run in the family. One of the big scenes in the film was when the family argue after an incident and Tiffany coming and controlling the situation. This trio of Lawrence, Cooper and De Niro obviously enjoy working with Russell because they end up working together again in American Hustle and Joy. Even Chris Tucker is tolerable in his role as Pat's best friend.Despite the praise the film has received Silver Lining Playbook has a very standard story arc, that Pat wants to get back with his wife, but want he needs is to move on. It is clear from the start she's not interested in getting back together and from what we find out about her Pat just idolises her. The screenplay is also very episodic, a series of challenges Pat has to face: accepting he needs to take his pill, taking Tiffany out on date, learning to dance, face a big dilemma and perform in a final competition. There was a slight sports movie template. There are subplots looking at the Pat's relationship with his father, how American Football is key to their relationship, yet has a poisonous effect on Pat, getting him banned from the stadium for fighting and his passion and superstitions lead to him foolhardy decisions.Silver Linings Playbook has been described as a comedy and it does have some witty lines and comedy interactions, but it is really a drama. It is not humorous enough to be a full on comedy. Props does have to be given to Russell's direction, giving us little hints of the family's life through the set dressing. It gives us hints of the wider discord within the family. But the dialogue in the film does feel overwritten and unnatural, being more focused on being profound then grounded or realistic which would have been more appropriate.Silver Linings Playbook is a showcase for it acting talent and Russell does an excellent job in the director's chair. But it's billing as a comedy-drama is a little misleading and its scripting is very standard affair.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Not perfect but definitely good,"I have just finished the film and read a fair bit of reviews before writing my own. This film is a unique and unusual rom/com, But in a good way.The acting and cast is really great. I loved the relationship between Bradley's friend and the complicated one with Jennifer Lawrence. At times Jennifer is too whiny, and mean. Other times is cute and funny to see them bicker. I dont know what having bi polar is like but with the reviews I've seen made by bi polar people i will have to take their word for the accuracy the actors depicted bi polar disorder.The screenplay and plot direction was pretty enjoyable. There are very cheesy moments but I dont personally mind it. You get attached to Bradley's character and really want to root for him. You also can't help feeling bad for him because of his condition and traumatic past expierence. There is lots of fights on screen which does get old but is still palatable. The football talk is also very overwhelming for someone who isn't American or doesn't give a baloney about the sport. The romance is very unique, unusual but sweet and cute in my opinion. Overall its a interesting Rollercoaster of a story.Summary:

Every cloud.....,"It's frustrating you know, watching a film where two people who are clearly meant for each other struggle to discover that conclusion for themselves. They argue, fight and do all they can to avoid the inevitable... to no avail. Of course it does help when the pair are likable enough for us to root for them, and here Hugh Jackman and Jennifer Lawrence have an instant rapport, and we love them as much as they eventually will one another. In another time-honoured movie tradition, both are borderline crazy, and yet seem to be so much wiser and perceptive than their other, supposedly sane family and friends. They might lose their temper for no reason and cause scenes in public places, but at least they're not afraid of speaking their minds and have firm plans in motion.Oh yes, the 'plan'. This is what the movies boils down to... the ""Silver Linings Playbook"". Think positively about everything, and refuse to let doubt get in the way of your goal. Good luck with THAT. If this film proves anything, it's that the unexpected always get in your way... and if you think life is just a straight highway to your destination, you're in shock. And just like reality, the dialogue here is rich with emotion and humour... these characters jump off the page and become full functioning human beings we care about.

So refreshing... but also so unoriginal,"Most films about mental illness take a sensational approach to the characters and disorders in question, often focusing on what's remarkable about them or their illnesses (Rain Man, anyone?). Silver Linings Playbook, on the other hand, changes this around. It looks behind the diagnoses and views its bipolar protagonists as human beings with some peculiar characteristics. The disorder itself is of minor importance at best. This angle is so refreshing, from both a filmatic and a psychological/sociological point of view, that we're off to a flying start already before director David O. Russell starts introducing his plot, disclosing that his film is really a conventional romantic comedy in disguise.But if you're going to make a romantic comedy, which arguably is the most cliché-ridden of all film genres, this is the way to go about it. The focus should not be on the payoff and the happily-ever-after (although ultimately, it always is), but on the characters and their struggles. And the characters in Silver Linings Playbook certainly have their struggles. Not your typical Hollywoodish, plot-oriented struggles, but deep, personal issues which are remarkably accurately rendered. It's quite evident that David O. Russell, who also wrote the script, knows well what he's talking about. And I think a lot of people with bipolar disorder will enjoy watching a film which tackles this seriously, but still not without humour. I particularly felt that Pat's progress, often consisting of two steps forward and one step back, was authentic, well helped by Bradley Cooper's sensible performance. And the man is really funny too.As the ending approaches, Silver Linings Playbook unfortunately starts going through all the motions. After having been so original up until then, creating its own little universe, I was disappointed to see that Russell couldn't find another way for his boy to get his girl than by dragging us through a number of cliches and audacious plot twists. I suppose it'll still work for those who are in the mood, but it doesn't live up to the great standards the film sets for itself during the first hour or so. Luckily, the many fine performances still do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Must watch!!,"SEVENTEEN STARS OUT OF TEN!!!Pat is curiously confident and upbeat for a man just released from a mental hospital and under a restraining order from his wife. That's because he's determined to repair the damage he's done to his life and surprise everyone by moving ever onward and upward. His motto is, ""Excelsior!"" What stage of bipolar disorder would you guess he's in?Pat (Bradley Cooper) assures his parents, Pat Sr. and Dolores (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver), that all will be well. They're not so sure. One of the charms of ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" the screwy new comedy by David O. Russell, is how Dolores is a sane and caring woman and has had long experience in dealing with compulsive behavior, because her husband is a fanatic fan of the Philadelphia Eagles. Having been banned from the Eagles' stadium for fighting, Pat Sr. now focuses uneasily on his TV set, convinced that the Eagles will win only if his several superstitions are fulfilled.Pat Jr. in desperation is drawn toward Tiffany (2010 Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow in the neighborhood. Lawrence appears here much transformed from the woman we saw in ""Winter's Bone"" and ""The Hunger Games."" Still only 22, she looks softer, sweeter and somehow prettier than before, yet she plays Tiffany as all edges and elbows, who can understand Pat because she's crazy herself.We're fully aware of the plot conventions at work here, the wheels and gears churning within the machinery, but with these actors, this velocity and the oblique economy of the dialogue, we realize we don't often see it done this well.

I must watch it again because I only caught the last 3/4.Brilliant acting; crackling realistic dialogue - I can tell this is a 9.Simply offbeat humane characters with a music score that is perfect!Being without a family (orphan) and single - this film made me long for the REAL LOVE that comes with just being fully and accepting the people around you.,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
About what you'd expect,"Pat(Cooper, the barely repressed anger of other of his performances) with bipolar disorder is released from psychiatric care and moves back with his parents. He can't get along with anyone, until he meets Tiffany(Lawrence, confident, using sex to avoid her emotions, amazing as usual. Solid chemistry between the two. She alone is worth watching this for. It would be nice if the role wasn't still a manic pixie dream girl), and they can share about each other's issues, and examine their relationships with each other. She offers to help him get back with his ex-wife if he enters a dance competition with her. But will they develop feelings for each other?I'm told there are differences from the novel, I have not read it. There are themes of dark and light, looking on the bright side. The ending really doesn't work, both as a sort of climax and the note it ends on. It became clear as this progressed that that's where it was going. Still, this does show, somewhat realistically, people who need help, and portray them as human beings. There are jokes about it, and there's drama with it, and they also get to be more than a diagnosis, have things going on that aren't about their issues. This is filmed in an interesting way.There is a lot of strong language, violence including some bloody, and a bit of sexuality, as well as a little nudity, in this. I recommend this to fans of romantic comedies. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Good Movie,"Silver Linings Playbook goes through humor and heartbreak. Bradley Cooper shines as Pat, a man with bipolar disorder determined to win back his wife. And Tiffany played by Jennifer Lawrence, a young widow with her own problems. Their unlikely partnership for a dance competition forms the crux of the story.The film excels in its portrayal of mental illness. It's not romanticized, but the characters struggles feel genuine. The humor arises from their quirks and anxieties, but never feels mean-spirited. There's a strong supporting cast too, with Robert De Niro delivering a memorable performance as Pat's obsessive-compulsive father.While the dance competition is a bit cliche, it serves as a metaphor for Pat and Tiffany's growth. Their journey isn't about finding a cure, but about learning to live with their flaws and finding strength in each other. The film's message of hope and acceptance resonates, making Silver Linings Playbook a ultimately uplifting crowd-pleaser.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
This movie might just give you bipolar...,"Dont worry, its just clickbait, but if you often find yourself to be one with characters from movies this is something for you.
The events do line up a litle to perfect for my liking. This takes away from the life like feeling, which in my opinion was the best part of the Silver Linings Playbook, but the characters are very true to life - until the ending, i find it a little to strong.

Silver Linings Playbook - A boy-meet-girl tale in modern age,"Finally a cinema-going to officially culminate all the Oscar BEST PICTURE nominee of last year, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK treads upon a traditionally crowd-pleasing boy-meet-girl romantic genre while smartly embodying two main characters with distinguished personal mental foibles, which is a masterstroke to keep them refreshing and connected with the present quirk-emancipated modern generation.After his ambitious brothers-boxers drama THE FIGHTER (2010, 8/10), David O. Russell has ascended to the top tier of Hollywood where he can harness marquee stars and meaty source materials, thus, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK has all its edges to be winsome and lovable, but somewhat the final outcome doesn't live up much to the heated expectation, personally I am rather stolid from the American football fanaticism and the ""parley gamble"" bidding is by no means a recommendable action to be encouraged (but it is an intrinsic default in the source novel, O. Russell should not take the blame here I suppose), anyway, the scenario does make wonders to gyrate a captivating duo-dance between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, both utterly committed to their characters, verbal ripostes are acetic and sharply accessible. The chemistry sparkles albeit of the age-gap of the actors (a inconceivable 15 years in real life).Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar-crowning has sparked (understandably)controversies (like most of the years), but it is like the film itself, acceptable (for me), the stretch of her character may be impeded by the condescending male-perspective of winning the right girl, why on earth it always ends with a stale ""it is the girl who lingers on the verge of being hurt"" plot even under the exception of the mighty confidence discharging from Lawrence's character. Her youth is the double-edged sword in this case, thanks to her mature countenance, audience may not detect it instantly, and the film also bypasses to specify her age. So it is a younger example of Helen Hunt's win and looks like a future Jodie Foster career orbit, plus her Kristen Stewart popularity (THE HUNGER GAME franchise will continue lighting her path), she is the ""it girl"" in Hollywood right now and a role model of the industry.Bradley Cooper, a later-bloomer in his leading man status, has seized an unexpected earlier harvest in Oscar-nomination than most of his contemporaries, although constantly in the danger of being overshadowed by his more sapient co-stars, performance-wise, it is his own victory. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver, are not in my top 10 list of the year, since the script doesn't challenge them hard enough, but they do reflect the slice-of-life authenticity of the endearing parents (except that De Niro's weeping scene is too maudlin to endure). And forget about Chris Tucker, I don't know why he pops up here to interrupt his satisfactory (both to him and to me) holed-up.So, it is a happily-ever-after fairytale full of mentally unstable people with various neuroses, the steady-cam cinematography looks hipster but also impairs one's concentration, the ultimate dance-routine is mesmerizingly shot, but the banal ending does causing a compulsive meh before the credits rolls, although the final speech is fine and (artificially) sincere.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Finally An Emotionally Gripping Mental Health Drama,"2 December 2012. Certainly not a Hemingway movie. Finally a full feature film with mental health as its central core that captures the visceral and authentic impact of mental illness without the cliques, stereotypes. At it is for the fact that director/writer David O. Russell avoids these pitfalls that allows the real captivating and emotive vibrancy of the this family and relational drama come alive. Such movies don't need the extra baggage of sweeping epic dramatization as The Sound of Music (1965) and occult horror special effects Constantine (2005) or unusual circumstances as Fly Away Home (1996) or The Wrestler (2008) to create fascinating characters and situations from fantasy and instead can follow a well-written script to make its emotive impact as Where the Lilies Bloom (1974) or even the more unlikely intensity surrounding Elizabethtown (2005) or A History of Violence (2005) or the exotic foreign look into Slumdog Millionaire (2008). Helen (2009) opened the door to mental illness as a decent movie drama sub-genre by itself following up with the authentic human drama found in Margot at the Wedding (2007). Silver Lining Playbook is a penetrating look at the behind the close doors and sometimes not so closed doors of real life disputes, family conflict without resort to hyper-drama disconnected with most lives in America or around the world as A Beautiful Mind (2001), The Fisher King (1991), or He Was a Quiet Man (2007). Even a relatively common as unemployment and poverty might be as depicted in Seven Pounds (2008) or even more closely aligned in topical matter to The Soloist (2008) dealing with schizophrenia, Silver Lining Playbook focuses on our family or a family that we likely know.Silver Lining Playbook stands out from even Girl, Interrupted (1999) for its more accessible look into a family that that most in America can relate to in the family room, bedroom, in public streets, a cafe instead of hidden away residential facilities. Unlike Lars and the Real Girl (2007), the humor in this movie is in part based on our own uncomfortable feelings that are touched so much closer to home, a laughter based on the intensity of mental illness and the embarrassment that we might feel if we actually acknowledged the tragedy that periodically occurs in this movie, like slapstick comedy of the silent movie era. Much like John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) made everyday things such a dog into a horror creature, Silver Lining Playbook allows its audience to take everyday life and begin to understand how any of our lives or those around us can be so easily touched by mental illness or the polite facades and idiosyncrasies we all surround ourselves with.Silver Lining Playbook might be more closely compared to a more upbeat Little Miss Sunshine (2006)or the more artistic and polished American Beauty (2000) or the contemporary plight of economic recession on family man in Up In The Air (2009) or the more straight forward dance movie of Shall We Dance (1996 and 2004) or a raw dramatic look at family life of the 1950s of The Tree of Life (2011), the darker A Day of Wine and Rose (1962) which presented a stark and tragic look at alcoholism.Except for the ending, Silver Lining Playbook represents a significant and daring family drama presentation of mental illness, though perhaps in the tone of Pat from the movie, this definitely isn't Hemingway and thus makes it the perfect movie, if wants to throw Hemingway out the window.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Mama weer all crazee now. 72.5+%,"This is a very odd, unconventional movie. It's about a man, Pat (played by Bradley Cooper. Cooper seems familiar to me from somewhere...), who is released from a mental institution and who tries to win back the affections of his wife...but she has a restraining order on him! Pat had an undiagnosed mental condition which makes him violent, hence his wife's restraining order. We don't really see much of the wife in this movie. Pat is put into the path of Tiffany (played by Jennifer Lawrence), another damaged personality who also has had dealings with the medical fraternity over her mental health issues.Here's why this movie is so odd and unconventional...Pat is a very unlikeable fellow. It's hard to root for him, hence my lower score. If Cooper was going for a very unlikeable portrayal of a damaged man, then I suppose Oscar recognition is not out of the question. Pat is clueless as far as his interactions with people is concerned and he also lacks self-awareness. Jennifer Lawrence is very sexy in her role (in a Meg Tilly kind of way...but more so) but she isn't a conventional leading lady either. It's hard to imagine what Tiffany sees in Pat...perhaps it's just a case of beautiful people being attracted to each other, even though they may be abrasive personalities (to say the least, especially of Pat)? Lawrence puts together a very strong performance and deserves her Oscar for best actress (I still prefer Naomi Watt's turn in ""The impossible"" though, for drawing out powerful emotions from the viewer).I've bumped up my score (and maybe could have given it 75%, say) for the end game of the movie. The leading characters warm, as does the movie, as they/it become more conventional in a rom-com kind of way...you do start to root for the characters. So, eventually, this does turn into a date movie.Robert De Niro as Pat's father (Pat Sr.) is 'interesting'...you can see that Pat Jr. did inherit some of his genes from him! Jacki Weaver as Pat Jr's mother Dolores has some emoting early on in the movie and does give the occasional arch look. Her accent was good (Australians are better at American accents than Americans are at Australian accents)...I don't think she ever lost the accent but maybe once it seemed to lose its flavour. Have heard in the media (perhaps in Australia) that she was nominated for an Oscar in this movie for her performance in the great Australian movie ""Animal kingdom""...which is the way of Hollywood. Chris Tucker as a fellow crazy of Pat the younger is sort of a running gag in this movie.Did find some of the early shots in the movie rather awkward...a bit too self- conscious...perhaps with Weaver, especially.Two of the subplots in this movie were rather odd too...a business sideline of Pat Sr. as well as a ""Strictly ballroom"" kind of turn (the Australian movie).Even when the leading actors were being abrasive (early on, especially), there was still much humour to be had in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Great Performances Bring Characters to Life,"Silver Linings Playbook (2012)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Excellent performances highlight writer-director David O Russell's story of Pat (Bradley Cooper), a mentally unstable man who moves back in with his parents (Robert DeNiro, Jacki Weaver) after being released from a stint in an asylum. Once out he plans on trying to get back with his ex-wife but the restraining orders keeps him from doing so until he meets an equally disturbed young woman named Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK contains some of the best performances you're going to see this year and it's great to see a film that's main focus is acting, writing, story and direction. It seems these things are awful overlooked in today's time but Russell does a very good job building up some extremely likable and believable characters and we got a terrific cast that really brings everything together. I think the main thing that makes this movie so memorable are the performances from Cooper and Lawrence who are simply wonderful. I thought the two of them did a terrific job playing disturbed without falling into any sort of stereotype. Both of them are so believable in their parts but what really caps it is the chemistry they have together. Whether it's romantic, fighting, annoying or just being calm, the two of them really deliver. DeNiro is also very memorable in his supporting bit as the father. I thought this role gave the actor a chance to do both comedy and drama and it's certainly one of his more memorable roles as of late. Weaver, Chris Tucker and Julia Stiles are also good in their supporting parts. Russell offers up a terrific atmosphere of working class Philadelphia just like he did with the setting of Massacusettes in THE FIGHTER. The only thing I'd say working against the film is that it's a tad bit too predictable and it takes a long time getting to where it's going but this here isn't all that bad since we enjoy spending time with the characters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A book with plenty of tricks up its sleeve,"Silver Linings Playbook, by David O. Russell, is one of those movies with a protagonist whom you fervently wish can overcome his demons but whose methods and goals you cannot easily reconcile. The movie is witty, foul-mouthed, very poignant, elegant, and, of course, odd.Pat (Bradley Cooper, playing way against type) has just been released from an eight-month mental-health-facility. His doctors are reluctant, but his mother (Jacki Weaver) insists he's better and that the place is, well, no place for him. She brings Pat back home to live with her and Pat's father Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro), hoping that after eight months Pat will be able to get his life back in order once again.Pat, though, has other plans. He had been committed to the hospital because he violently beat a fellow teacher whom he had caught in the shower with his wife. Okay, so he snapped - he was lucky that hospital care was all he got. In any event, what he wants to do now is reconcile with his wife and resume his life. Sure, there's a restraining order, which is why he goes to the trouble of reading the books she teaches in her English class, anything to prove he's more mentally fit. Oh, during his stay he loses a lot of weight (apparently), something his then-wife had harped on. (Note: She sounds like a winner to me.)Things do not go as planned. For one thing, Pat never takes his medication (he's bipolar), which leads to the occasional angry outburst; the song that had been played at his wedding and was played while his wife took her infamous shower is now a trigger for more violent behavior, even when he doesn't hear it. He wants badly to make amends, but he's aiming in the wrong direction, as his ex shows no signs of wishing to see him again.To help him along, friends Ronnie and Veronica ask Pat over to dinner, and they invite Veronica's iconoclastic sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who has social skills that are below even Pat's. The dinner isn't exactly a disaster, but Tiffany leaves abruptly and has Pat walk her home. A kindred friendship is born.Although the reason for Tiffany's behavior is somewhat important to the plot, I won't mention it here, but somehow she sees something in Pat, something honest, someone she can relate to. Meanwhile, Pat Sr., a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan, considers his son to be a lucky charm and practically begs Pat to stay and watch the game with him on Sundays. Pat Sr. desperately wishes to reconnect with his son (there's a recurring theme), but Pat is ambivalent. To cope with his own emotions, he jogs. A lot.The emotional tug of war, punctuated by the Pat's own inability to control himself (still no meds for him) begins to ebb a little when Tiffany makes him a deal: she'll do something for him (not spoiling) and in exchange he will be her dance partner. You see, Tiffany studies dance as a way to cope with her demons, and there's a gala competition coming up - but one cannot compete without a partner, and she has nobody. Even her parents are wary of her. So that's the deal.So on the one hand you have Pat Sr. believing his son is a lucky charm and wanting to spend more time with him anyway, and on the other hand you have Tiffany, who offers to help Pat achieve his overall goal if he'll help her. There's a lot of bickering back and forth among everyone; that is, when there's no jogging involved (note: there's plenty).Okay, enough about the plot; I'll stop before I do give something away. Let's look at the performances. Cooper is exceptional. We've seen him be kind of a jerk in The Hangover and a ladies' man in The A Team, and here he is as a completely conflicted man who desperately wishes to reach a goal for which he's striven for eight months. His is a raw, laid-bare performance.Lawrence is truly stunning as the somewhat-unstable Tiffany. She's passionate, angry, caring, bitter, sweet, and she possesses even more charisma than she did in The Hunger Games or Winter's Bone. Her jaw- dropping work here is very much deserving of award recognition; Tiffany can be brutal and brittle and still completely endearing. It's the best work Lawrence has done in her short but strong career.Surprisingly to me, though, the standout in this cast is DeNiro. Now, DeNiro has been sort of phoning it in for a few years now, with the exception (perhaps) of movies like Limitless and Stardust. But here he really shines; it's possibly his best work since at least the 1990s. I've seen tough guys on camera get emotional, and often it just doesn't work. They can't sell it. There's a rare breed of actor who can do the macho angle and the sensitive angle and do it justice, and DeNiro, particularly here, pulls it off. Pat Sr., himself an emotional fellow, is a man full of love and passion and a man who is not without some regrets on how he's raised his kids. DeNiro brings all of that out flawlessly.Silver Linings Playbook is not a lighthearted movie. It's compelling drama led by a cast composed of relative neophytes and grizzled veterans. It's quirky, just like its director, and it is a clear-cut winner. Here's the best thing I can say about the movie: It feels authentic. When someone is hurt, I feel bad for them; I don't feel that they're staging it. The script is original and idiosyncratic, and every morsel of every scene is one to cherish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Not only a great Rom-Com but a Fantastic Movie,"Whenever i think of the genre of romantic comedy what springs to mind is a cheesy film with a load of same old same old actors that are there for the pay packet, and after the film is finished you don't even remember the characters names. This Movie is a cut above the rest, i was worried that the big names would kill the films soul but it only fueled it. I did not remember i was watching a film the whole way through i thought i was just observing the fascinating lives of Tiffany and Pat, the characters were built and portrayed so perfectly that they were almost like these weren't actors these were real people.Where the story makes itself for me is in the style it is created with great emphasis on emotion and portrayed the mental illness of the characters perfectly. there was no lack of depth in the film and it felt like 2hours of breathtaking because the film was astounding.Many people criticise the Oscars for some of the awards it has given out, but in my opinion anyone who criticises them for awarding best actress to Jennifer Lawrence is clearly blind. I have to say that Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany was an absolute perfect casting decision because she is arguably right now one of the greatest actresses on the planet and if anyone disagrees then maybe they should watch this film and Winter's Bone because for a girl that had no acting classes she is phenomenal. The way she blends between sanity and mental illness in this film is impeccable you will not even notices it because from the first moment you meet her you have already forgot that its Jennifer Lawrence from the hunger games and engrossed yourself in the world of silver linings playbook, only great actors can pull that off and i have to say that this performance puts her down as a great.Bradley Cooper was also stunning in the film i was worried that his humorous side would make him lose track of his character but boy was i wrong. honestly if it wasn't for Daniel Day-Lewis performance in Lincoln then i believe Bradley Cooper would have an Oscar right now too. Humor is seen at sometimes but only when necessary this is a very serious performance from Cooper and it is probably his best performance to date.I could go on and on about the great characters and the astounding directing but i will simply end with the statement that this is the best Romantic Comedy i have ever seen. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Silver Linings Playbook (2012),"There is a certain type of manic energy that drives the films of Writer/Director David O. Russell (The Fighter, I Heart Huckabees). His films tend to feature ensembles of flawed but lovable characters struggling to piece their lives together while coping with various familial stresses, chemical dependencies and existential meltdowns. Russell's newest film, Silver Linings Playbook, continues this trend by tackling mental illness with a degree of honesty and warmth rarely seen in Hollywood films.Bradley Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover) stars as Pat Solitano, a volatile, bi-polar ticking time bomb prone to violent outbursts, serving 8 months of court-ordered time in a mental hospital for assaulting his wife's lover. Early on we see Pat get released, almost surely before he is ready, and begin to pick up the pieces while living in his parents (Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver) attic. It's clear to the audience that mental illness runs in the Solitano family after meeting Pat's father, an undiagnosed obsessive-compulsive wreck with severe anger management and gambling issues. Driven by delusion and a new optimistic outlook, Pat embarks on a seemingly endless quest to win back the heart of his wife, despite the restraining order she has placed on him.From the start, Pat is portrayed as a filter less social pariah, instantly alienating (if not terrifying) everyone he comes into contact with. That is until he meets Tiffany, a mysterious, young widow played by Jennifer Lawrence. Like Pat, Tiffany is wild, capricious and damaged to the core. Though their initial meetings go horribly, the two eventually connect and form a shaky, co-dependent alliance. Discovering a loophole in his restraining order, Pat enlists Tiffany to deliver a letter to his wife. She agrees under the condition that he participates in a dance competition as her partner. As they begin to spend more time together, the two grow closer and Pat's behavior becomes less erratic. Cooper is fantastic as Pat, combining his natural comic ability with a dramatic awareness previously unseen in his prior films. Nevertheless, it's Lawrence who ultimately shines brightest. In Tiffany, she has created a complex character bursting with comedic energy, sexiness, intrigue and melancholy.Perhaps the Russell's greatest achievement is how genuine and natural Silver Linings Playbook feels. Like its characters, the film's tone is skittish and unpredictable, seamlessly blending flashes of uproarious humor with weighty emotional moments that never seem to ring false. While it's certainly not a conventional RomCom, Silver Linings Playbook is unable to fully escape the trappings of the genre. In an instance of uncharacteristic insincerity, there is a bizarre scene in which Russell makes light of the compulsive behavior of one of his characters in order to propel the film towards a predictable yet satisfying conclusion. It's a minor blip in an otherwise memorable effort.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"One of the great ""romantic comedies.""","For a while, Silver Linings Playbook presents itself as more or less a conventional, somewhat predictable genre film. By the second half, however, as the plot develops and deeper complexities are revealed, it approaches greatness.There's a great symmetry and subtlety to the film: loose ends are tied up quietly and without fanfare, and events are mirrored like the rhymes in a great poem. ""Playbook"" is darkly hilarious, well-written, warm without ever becoming over-sweet, brilliantly acted (why doesn't Robert De Niro take more roles of this caliber?), and beautifully shot. The lighting alone is masterful in many shots and sequences.Silver Linings is in many ways as paradoxical as its main characters. It is at once formulaic, simple, and obvious, and yet also reserved, subdued, even coy in its tendency to let the viewer connect dots and fill in subplots and backstory for himself. Even in the most ridiculous and far-fetched of scenes, like the argument and negotiations of the parlay bet near the film's climax, there is a stunning reality and believability to the characters (due in no small part to the inspired chemistry of De Niro, Lawrence, and Cooper).Like its two main characters, the movie is at times loud, obnoxious, and in-your-face. And yet it's elegantly constructed, with a careful eye for nearly subconscious detail, both in imagery and plot. It is easily one of the best films of 2012.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
One of the most unique romantic comedies I've ever seen,"Silver Linings Playbook is technically a romantic comedy, but I hesitate to lump it in with all of the other cookie-cutter rom-coms out there. It is one of the most unique romantic comedies I've ever seen. Plus, it doesn't have that pretentious ""quirky for quirky's sake"" feel that many independent films do. Bradley Cooper is surprisingly good in his role and Jennifer Lawrence is impressive as always. This is an intelligent movie with an entertaining story about broken people who are trying to help each other become whole.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Block out the Oscar hype and watch with lowered expectations; Silver Linings Playbook might just grow on you.,"As Sigmund Freud said, ""One is very crazy when in love."" Silver Linings Playbook delivers a little less than what its title suggests, but as a romantic comedy, it is enjoyable nonetheless. Adapted from Matthew Quick's novel, this film by David O. Russell (The Fighter, I ♥ Huckabees) shines as a date movie.Bradley Cooper leads with familiar, sun-kissed energy that made him the stereotypical guy-next-door in chick flicks (The Hangover I & II, Valentines Day) and Jennifer Lawrence flexes elegant moves in a genre new to her filmography (The Hunger Games, Winter's Bone) but in Silver Linings Playbook, the real show-stopper turns out to be Papa DeNiro.Pat Junior (Cooper) is bipolar and after eight months in a treatment facility, leaves to recover at his folks. Despite the bad run with his estranged wife (that landed him there in the first place), Pat still loves her and believes that conquering his psychological demons will win her back. Tiffany (Lawrence) is a young widow nursing old wounds and idiosyncrasies of her own. Sparks fly when both meet at a party thrown by Pat's BFF (played with finely tuned sensitivity by the underrated John Ortiz).This is not an odd romantic pairing; but the emotional vicissitudes demanded of Pat's role seem to fall short in its rough-hewn delivery and thus, weakening mental health themes in the finished film. Fortunately, the silver lining lies in a strong lineup of supporting cast and Pat Senior (Robert DeNiro) shines as an un-diagnosed OCD with eccentric (but believably instinctive) ground rules about ""good and bad jujus"".Bulk of the film's humor and depth (premised on psychological anxiety) comes from DeNiro and it comes as a delightful surprise. I would love to see a sequel or TV-series patterned after his breakout performance in this film--spin-off of sorts. As Pat's father, the idea that some of his neuroses may have imprinted on Pat adds a natural layer to the subplot-- father and son dynamics.At the end of Silver Linings Playbook, I left the cinema believing it was written with a heartfelt message nestled in its narrative. But the output fell short, thus inviting criticisms about exaggerating stereotypes for the sake of a few laughs. The mental health industry has also responded with comments about inaccurate portrayals of bipolar behavior.But like I said; for date movie material, it dazzles as cookie-cutter romcom (with an edge).Block out the Oscar hype (nominated in eight categories) and watch with lowered expectations; Silver Linings Playbook might just grow on you. This feel good comedy is an entertaining peal of laughs and it stands on its own merits.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"Pleasant, decent - but not impressive; apart from the cast, of course","The screenplay has several good moments, incl. strong characters, but, all in all, it is hectic and neurotic, like a movie of Woody Allen without Allen. True, the background allows this, motives are logical, but neuroses and shouting are not very catchy to follow and some laughs I had were connected with psychiatry and related topics. When Pat Jr and Tiffany meet, the following outcomes are fathomable already. The ending is too predictable, even plain.The cast is great - it is seldom so that 4 actors receive an Academy Award nomination! However, I must admit that male performers seemed more interesting to me - Bradley Cooper, Robert de Niro, Chris Tucker, Anupham Kher... Jennifer Lawrence, Jacki Weaver, Julia Stiles etc are less memorable.I expected more of a comedy, but it was not, really.

Two Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.,"Former teacher Bradley Cooper is let out of a mental institution after having a mental breakdown after discovering his wife (Brea Bee) was having an affair. He tries to handle his bi-polar condition with the help of his parents Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver as he moves back in with them and attempts to put his life back on track. His success is hit-and-miss at best and then another potential monkey-wrench is thrown into his life when he meets a young sex-addicted widow (dynamite role by the always impressive Jennifer Lawrence). Together these two very similar, yet very different individuals go on an emotional journey to reclaim normalcy and self-reliance in their lives. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is brilliant in most every way. The performances reach near epic heights with Lawrence leading the talented cast. The film's screenplay is deeper than it appears as it shows subtleties in its characters where you have trouble understanding who has mental deficiencies and who does not. In the end the movie is about humans doing their best, with the help of those around them, to find happiness and success against sometimes grim and seemingly insurmountable odds. In a crazy world, doing one's best in a dance competition and making that little extra money betting on the hometown Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL can become the most unexpected roads to individual happiness and group camaraderie. A definite winner. Kudos to director David O. Russell in keeping what could have been a schizophrenic screenplay (no pun intended) on the straight and narrow path to cinematic success. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Pretty Little Story,"I've just rewatched this film having seen it a few times but not in the last 3 years or so. Revisiting it I really do love it. It's a very sincere film with a difficult subject matter of a particualy mental illness. The three main actors, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro give tremendous performances. De Niro proves he can still give raw emotional meaning to a newly written character. The two leads have not given better performances than they have in this movie in my opinion. Bradley Coopers character Pat is put in a tough situation in this film which leads to really good character development and gives the audience insight on the mental illness while telling a compelling story. The cinematography was nice and would have meaning from time to time, it was shot on 35mm film wich I appreciated and fit right for the story. The score by Danny Elfman didn't really do anything for me personally. The editing was really well done, there were a lot of interesting uses of certain techniques used in the editing process that worked really well to help tell the story. The ensemble stood out in this film, it doesn't really seem apropriate to have an ensemble cast with so much screen time in a movie so personal to two main characters but it works here. David O'Russel does write ensembles very well in movies as seen in American Hustle and The Fighter. In the end, I really enjoyed this movie, it did a lot for me, I'm glad I rewatched it and if you haven't seen it or haven't watched it in a while I would definitely recommend doing so.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Everyone's a little crazy.,"My first glance at The Silver Linings Playbook was during the 2013 Oscars when Jennifer Lawrence was nominated for best actress. The ceremony presented one of the most popular scenes from it, the scene that would compel me to watch it. She asks why Bradley Cooper ordered Raisin Brain, he says because he didn't want it to seem like a date. He says he hopes people don't associate his mental issues with her ""crazy."" She shows him crazy.Part of me can't help but love this scene. This moment is so raw. Or Real? Perhaps neither. But it is so exhilarating. And many years after having first watched it, I think I may, now, know why.It must her manic-pixie-dream-girl attitude. The politics of this movie already verge on the conservative but the introduction of a manic-pixie girl would perhaps seal the deal. Does she meet on the requirements of one? Perhaps not, but what are these requirements. I mean she seems manic, having sudden bursts of energy. And she does seems to share the spontaneous attitude Zooey Deschanel sports in 500 Days of Summer (an icon for the manic pixie dream girl trope). She also seems to enliven her lover the way one does. Her dancing seems to bring out new life in Bradley Cooper. It's no wonder my teenage self loved her. She brought out in Bradley Cooper that which a women would someday bring out in angsty-teen me.My second glance into this movie was when my dad was watching it. After he finished up I asked how it was and he said ""Good."" Isn't it about someone who's crazy or something?"" and he said ""Everyone is a little crazy in this."" I liked that description. It was as if everyone was a little crazy in their own way.Does this movie romanticize mental disorders? Perhaps. Is that wrong? Probably. But as a person with a mental disorder I liked it. It made me feel like someday I would find someone cute and ""crazy,"" and we could be ""crazy"" together. But my experience is a poor representation for all and I think it's a really a tricky sub genre to enter into, the romance between people with mental disorders. You will doubtless have to walk on thin ice to create a film that people won't find an issue. For how can one make a rom-com in this sub-genre without romanticizing the mental disorder. Isn't that what Romance does?In any case, whether I like the politics or not, a part of me will always hold part of this film close to me. The acting is good, the script funny, the romance dysfunctioning(until the last few moments of film where Bradley Cooper takes her in his lap and steals a kiss, I'll ignore those moments) and cute. Lovely film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Phenominal Movie With Great Performances,"Silver Linings Playbook is a movie that leaves a mark. Phenomenal writing by David O.

Good TV Movie,I saw this on TV and was good to watch because of the all star cast.As much as I like Bradley Cooper I cant believe he suffers from any mental illness in this movie. Brad Cooper is more the all time hero good guy that everyone loves and not believable as someone having mental illness.Also I cant believe the ending either. There was no build up to the ending and Brad Cooper again is unbelievable in the ending.Maybe Im being a bit harsh because I've seen all Brads other movies which were great ! and thats what Im used to. This one is like 90% of his best effort. However hes still worth seeing anyway.Nevertheless apart from that its more of an interesting story and De Niro is brilliant as always.Watch it for the interesting story and overall a good strong cast of A List Actors.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
It's pronounced TrA-zadone,"Three months ago I was hospitalized for bipolar disorder, and then had to move back home with my parents... in Philadelphia.

Everybody has their problems...,"But it makes them what they are, and without it, they wouldn't be themselves, and that's what this film justifies so superbly. It's probably the best Romantic Comedy I've ever seen and it is so light-hearted and feel-good funny it'll have you wanting repeated viewings. Bradley Cooper is an American with some Italian origins who returns from a mental hospital to reunite with his ex-wife, not your usual rom com story, but it works. While he seemingly tries hard to do that, he bumps into Jennifer Lawerence, who also plays a one with problems, but as the Oscar-winning performance goes, it's absolute. Their meetings and such are so charming. And you see their similarties, and hear their separate problems. Robert De Niro hasn't been at his best in years, until now and he plays an OCD, football-obsessed dad who just wants the best for his son while Jacki Weaver plays Cooper's mother who is also good but gets shun upon by everyone else's outstanding performances. The film has it's flaws though, there is the length, and the predictability of it but that doesn't matter, Romantic Comedys are not so much for the story but the substance and heart of it, and this film does it just so right.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

And a very accurate portrayal of the manic side of bipolar disease.I want more movies like this; sure, there is an overall formula here, but it breaks a lot of rules along the way, never becomes sappy or predictable.

If you go into this movie thinking you are about to see one of the best movies in recent years, then you will be asking yourself ""Really?"" throughout the entire film. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie overall. I just wish my expectations had not been so high. There was very good acting by everyone in the cast, and Jennifer Lawrence is arguably one of the prettiest actresses to come along in decades, but during much of the movie the dialogue just doesn't sound even remotely believable. There was also a contrived fight scene near the end of the movie that I guess was necessary for the plot, but it was entirely 100 percent unbelievable. Still, I would give this movie 3 out of 4 stars for the good acting and the good-natured script. The world needs more positive movies like this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Watch for the signs,"Pat Solantano Jr. (played by Academy Award nominee Bradley Cooper) is just getting out of the mental hospital; he was in there for beating the man that his wife was cheating on him with. He comes home to live with his parents, go to therapy and to find the silver lining in things. Eventually he meets Tiffany (played by Academy Award Winner Jennifer Lawrence), who has her own problems. He forms a connection with her and she even offers to help him get a letter to his wife, and in exchange he helps her with a dance competition. Pat Sr. (played by Academy Award Winner Robert De Niro) and Dolores (played by Academy Award Nominee Jacki Weaver) are Pat's parents and Pat's father is somewhat OCD; he likes his remotes a certain way, he doesn't want anybody in his study and he believes that his son is the positive juju that the Eagles need to win the Super Bowl. The question is: Can Pat Jr. find the signs? Or will life get him down?This is a great movie, plain and simple. The editing and writing of this film is top notch. David O. Russell is at the top of his game with this film and he earned a well-deserved Oscar nomination for both writing and directing the film. Whether you agree with his directing style or not, it is clear that he loves these characters and, in spite of all their faults and differences, he makes them all likable in many ways. Kudos to Russell for pulling off such an amazing feat!But let's face it: the real stars are the stars themselves in this movie. Let's start out with our main character. Cooper is a revelation in this role. This was the role that got him out of his comfort zone - the comedy zone - and into the world of versatile acting. He is now known for his supreme acting chops and he knows how to make it work in a drama. He knows how to create characters that can be crazy but in a good way. Definitely deserving of the Oscar Nomination. With Jennifer Lawrence, while I can't say that she deserved the Oscar (it should have went to Emmanuelle Riva for Amour), I can say that this is the best she's ever been. She is on the top of her game in this role and it is clearly a role that she loved to play. Her and Bradley Cooper went on to star in two more David O. Russell films - American Hustle and Joy - and it is very clear that they love working with each other; you can practically feel the chemistry that these two share. She definitely at least deserved the nomination.But let's talk about the supporting characters. Robert De Niro is a prime example of ""when you grow older, you start getting the grandpa roles in crappy movies."" While the dude can act, it's no question that he is in a slump. It's this movie, however, that showed that he's still got it and that he is not going away anytime soon. This is the guy who won awards for being a younger version of Marlon Brando and for boxing other guys in a ring. It's good to see that guy again; definitely deserving of the nomination. But the person who I believe should have actually won in their category was Jacki Weaver for her performance in this movie. She is the Mom who is worried sick about her son because he was in a mental hospital and she just wants him to be a part of the family. She is amazing in this role and she also gives the best performance of her career!Needless to say, a great movie! What more can I say?",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"Paradox, delusional narrator commits to dance","The Oscars are famously fuddy in a cinematic sense. So, having earlier this week murmured at the snubbing of Moonrise Kingdom, I am now pleased to see this film take its place in the lineup. Part of me is not convinced by some of it, for instance that we should be shown in films the achievement of a perfect happiness as the ending depicts here, if you will a happiness that is happiness because it is perfect. In reality, things rarely fall into place but that shouldn't preclude happiness of the present moment, being whole now with just this whatever it is, in a Buddhist sort of way.But on with the film.I come to this as a viewer steeped in narrative dissonance, paradox and asymmetry, these are all things I value in the films I see, in particular when those are carried in a visual way—the Japanese are masters of this, try and track down the seldom-seen All About Lily Chou Chou.The story here is that we follow a distressed group of more or less delusional people who suffer the usual social frictions with an unusual acuteness, precisely the fact that things are not into place but broken, and through the film overcome their damaged selves to come out on the other end, still more or less damaged but whole. In truth, we all walk through life with delusional expectations of the ideal life, this is just comically exaggerated in this group.This is most clear in the football-obsessed father, who outgrows his compulsive disorder that in order for his team to win, things or people have to be in a certain place, in a certain order. They don't, life fluctuates. It can go either way. The acceptance of this fundamental truth is what in my eyes sets this apart from something like The Descendants, a touristy film that mistakes manufactured beauty (linked to memory as a Hawaiin postcard) for purity.The beauty is all in the recognition that things are damaged, dissonant, incomplete. Which brings me to my main point—all of this is wholly carried in the narrative in a visual manner.The obvious first. The narrator is clearly delusional—to that effect throughout the film the camera is tightly screwed at eye-level, intensely prowls as he does and bursts into views. The narrative has a bipolar energy, with mood swings all over the place. In that vein, I would have liked more swings in the mood, in the 'color' of the camera, together with more visual narration, but so be it, the film is dialogue-driven first, plot-focused.This type of first-person camera I have elsewhere remarked that can achieve the literary effect of stream-of-consciousness, of consciousness hovering in and off itself, where what we see is not necessarily 'real', but as Malick exemplifies and Herzog before him, can lead to ecstatic perceptions of 'real' intensity.The filmmaker is aware of something along those lines, you will see in the scene where the man attacks his father in the wedding video scene, that suddenly remembered images from the earlier assault that was the breaking point burst into view.In line with bursting views, mood swings, and the acceptance of a dissonant life is the dancefloor climax—things fall into place when you commit to the dance together, the dance as love, but this doesn't have to be the ideal dance as you'd normally expect, a 5.0 will do.And in the actual dance, we have abrupt swings from ballroom jazz to rock'n'roll, from normalcy to how these people experience feelings. The dance reflects who these people are together, a little sloppy but committed.That's all more than enough. What makes it so enjoyable though, and ultimately exhilarates, is that the whole is continuously stitched with paradoxical behavior. I only recently discovered Lubitsch, whose famed 'touch' was about exactly this.The finale still bothers, but I can write it out of my mind. This is good stuff.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
An interesting and a fun experience at the cinema,"SLP is one of the few movies that's worth watching on the big screen, not just because you know there won't be any loud and obnoxious people in the cinema with you, but for a seemingly good time that seems to fly so quickly that you feel slightly dazed when the end credits roll.The story is interesting, if a little bit clichéd in one part, but that doesn't take away from the overall experience. It was fun trying to watch Pat try to sort out his life after being let out of the mental institution and once out he has a host of obstacles to overcome, the least of which happens to be Tiffany, a young unemployed widower.Bradley Cooper is excellent as the disturbed Pat, so scarily so that you think that Cooper in real life exhibits these problems. He's well supported by Robert DeNiro as his Dad, with one or two loose screws of his own. Jennifer Lawrence is good but for some reason, for me anyway, she didn't quite pull off the role of a crazed or mental person. At least not when you compare her to Cooper.The pace of the movie moves along quite nicely, the editors doing a good job of moving from scene to scene seamlessly. There's never a drop or a part that doesn't fit in. The humour is funny and helps break the serious flow at the right moments.All in all it's a good movie, an even better date movie, but one that you'll enjoy at the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Silver Linings Playbook,"Silver(Gold) Linings PlaybookSilver Lining Playbook should be called Gold Linings Playbook with the performance that David O. Russell puts up in this movie. Silver Lining Playbook opens up with Pat Solitano(Bradley Cooper) after 8 months in a mental hospital, realizing he's been separated from his wife after finding out he's an undiagnosed bipolar and realizes he needs to get his wife back, always keeping with him the idea that if you stay positive and work hard then a silver lining will happen; it just takes him the whole movie to figure out what that silver lining will be. Pat meets Tiffany(Jennifer Lawrence) who has just lost her husband and in her mourning also develops a mental illness, which creates a friendship that turns out to help both of them a lot more and in a way they never would've thought before.
 David O. Russell takes the problem of mental health/illness and shows what it's like to be in their heads, for the people around them, and put into this real issue into a romantic comedy; putting mental health into a movie like a romantic comedy is genius because it shows how normal or regular it is for people to have them.
Silver Linings Playbook opens in the mental hospital where Pat is staying and his moms strong drive to take him out which builds a strong sense of pathos between the audience and Pat, and makes them feel sadness and pity for him. In building this Pathos it allows the audience to feel what he's feeling and relate to him more, and always hope for the best for him. 
 Russell chooses 2 incredible actors, Cooper and Lawrence, who are able to take the complexity of these characters to the next level and let us really see what is going on in the heads of these two characters, not just portraying them as crazy and through the eyes of just the surrounding people, but what mental processing is going through their heads when it's happening and what drives them to get there. A big trigger for Pat is hearing his wedding song, because that's the song that he was hearing when he walked in on his wife cheating on him with another worker at the school they worked at. Everytime Pat hears this song it triggers him to go back to that place he was in when he caught his wife with that man, and allows us to see how just one song can affect someone in this state of mind.
Though there aren't a ton of movies that put an emphasis on mental health, Silver Linings Playbook does fail to show how people who haven't suffered traumatic events like getting cheated on by your wife, or losing your husband can also suffer from mental health issues like depression, and anxiety. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower includes the aspect that anyone can suffer from mental illness and it doesn't make it any less important that they didn't go through anything traumatic and still happens just as much if not more. This is what Silver Linings Playbook lacks because although it puts a very big importance on this issue and in a realistic approach it lacks to show how common it is like The Perks Of Being A Wallflower does.
 There has been so many movies done in the last couple of decades that Silver Lining Playbook gives us a breath of fresh air giving us a movie like nothing else made. Russell let's the audience draw their own conclusions about what they think of each character and whether or not Pat and Tiffany are actually crazy or it's actually that other people got them to that place. This movie makes the audience question society and how we treat people and to look at ourselves in the mirror and see the impact we have on one another, rather then bringing people down we need to focus on lifting them up . Silver Lining Playbook is a must see and you will not be disappointed in the performance by these two brilliant actors that make you fall in love and acquire more empathy and understanding for those who deal with mental illness everyday",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Nice movie but over-rated,"Reading all the rave reviews this movie has been receiving and the user review of IMDb, I just watched this movie. I am an avid movie buff and here are my 2 cents. The movie is honest and has some great acting by Brad Coop and Jennifer Lawrence. De Niro and his wife also support well. Chris Tucker is wasted. The movie has a clichéd climax. It's not so feel good nor is it hard hitting and take you on an emotional roller-coaster. The only reason this movie is getting all the press is because of its A list starcast. Shoot the same with lesser known faces and this would have been trashed or relegated to the B levels. Seriously over-rated...watch it on DVD instead",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Chaotically Beautiful,"I saw this movie on premiere night in Holland, February 28, and had been anticipating to see it for months. The reviews were full of praise and if the award and nomination count was anything to go by, I knew I would be entertained.As the movie began I found myself a little confused by the chaos in which director David O. Russell decided to film this movie, but as the story got a shape and I became familiar with the characters I found myself appreciating this way of filming. It was chaotic, but it was beautiful. A perfect nod to the state of mind Pat and Tiffany must have been.This movie is one that deals with mental disorder, which are no laughing feat, but Pat's inability to be sensitive with his words and Tiffany's bluntness when talking about her past make you laugh out loud on many occasions. Soon enough you find yourself caring for these characters. For Pat, because he tries so hard, but is facing a family and a community that at first does not really believe in his recovery. And for Tiffany, because she is the kind of girl to do something for others without expecting anything in return. The movie throws memorable lines at you early on and you will be pleasantly surprised to see that events or comments from the beginning come back in the end.This is not a movie you should go see if you wish to sit back and not think for a good two hours. Though it will surely be enjoyable and a good watch, I believe you cannot truly appreciate the beauty of Silver Linings Playbook if you do not take the time to analyze the characters and their actions.

She's taken out a restraining order to prevent him from making contact, so he enlists the help of a female acquaintance. The troubled Tiffany has problems of her own - she's a young widow using sexual promiscuity to deal with the grief of losing her husband - but she agrees to act as Pat's go-between if he partners her in a dance competition.Since 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a romantic comedy, Pat and Tiffany's unusual arrangement develops an emotional element. Jennifer Lawrence breathes her quirky brand of combative femininity into Tiffany. Whenever she's on-screen, the story has vitality, but instead of exploring the off-beat relationship between a couple of misfits, the narrative detours into a slapstick sub-plot about a small-time NFL gambling operation run by Pat's father. The film's potential slides into farce and sentimentality before it concludes with a predictable ending at the dance contest. Although it's been a huge box-office success, this play-book results in a field goal rather than a touchdown.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Good but flawed,"'Silver Linings Playbook' is a film directed by David O. Russell about a man with bi-polar disorder who is trying to get his life back on track after suffering a mental breakdown upon discovering his wife was having an affair.The story is a bit bizarre with Pat (Bradley Cooper) befriending Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who also suffered a mental breakdown after the death of her husband. Pat agrees to enter a dance competition with Tiffany in order to send a letter to his wife via Tiffany to try and re- build their relationship. The first half of the film seems a bit misleading. It portrays bi-polar disorder was just being the same as someone being a little bit odd or quirky. I don't think that they take the disorder seriously enough – for a film that a lot of people have claimed will win big at the Oscars in 2013, I don't think it will; it has missed the point with mental illness. The plot itself moves quite smoothly and I was never bored whilst watching this. The second half is better; it becomes a lot funnier and seems a lot more light-hearted. The plot is good but the acting can sometimes let it down.Bradley Cooper is quite bad; he has obviously done very little research for his role and has clearly read a paragraph on bi-polar disorder noticing that, under stress, they can shout and panic – there's a scene in the film where he is screaming and his eyes are blank with no emotion. This meant that the scene came across as funny and people in the audience were actually laughing during a scene that was written to be a scene of heartbreak. Jennifer Lawrence was excellent here; she portrayed her character perfectly and provided humour where it was meant to be. She has obviously done a lot of research for her role and she has had a fantastic career in 2012 which can only get better. Chris Tucker was a surprisingly positive addition to this cast; he died not annoy me at all in this film which was a huge development. David O. Russell has done a great job with the characters in this film. Robert De Niro is another great supporting character here; his role as Pat's father who has some form of OCD is just brilliant and he really seems to have portrayed it just right. This is his best performance in quite a while and I hope his films get even better.Overall, I liked this film; there were just a lot of flaws within it. It has some good comedy, some great performances and is a fairly good film to watch. If you're a fan of Jennifer Lawrence, you will like this film as it is yet another film that would have failed if it wasn't for her (see House at the End of the Street). This film is worth a watch but I don't see it doing well at the Oscars – I hope not anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Disappointing and irritating,"Critical reaction and user reviews seem to be hugely positive. Let me offer up one dissenting voice. I thought this was virtually unwatchable and would have walked out if I had been seeing it alone. The theme of the film is that most of its characters are mentally ill, or at least damaged, to one extent or another. Unfortunately, this manifests in the form of characters angrily shouting at each other. This extends to about 75% of scenes in the film, at far too great a length, without any wit or craft. None of the major characters is remotely likable. This would be fine if the film was a serious depiction of mental illness. It sits very uncomfortably with a contrived, implausible romcom plot, largely free of originality or surprises. But sadly the romcom element does not extend to more than the occasional funny moment. Jennifer Lawrence is fairly good and the other performances are OK, but the film has nothing else to recommend it. By far the worst film I've seen for over a year.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Not a Spoiler though.. just story,"SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOKPlease visit - http://iamalekhya.blogspot.in/'SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK' is a sensitively soothing romantic dramedy! With an apparently simple yet contextually deep screenplay, it touches your heart at many levels.Aided by some incisive performances from its cast, the film is an emotional treat.Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper) has lost everything - his house, his job, and his wife. He now lives with his mother (Jacki Weaver) and father (Robert DeNiro) after spending eight months in a state institution on a plea bargain. Pat is determined to rebuild his life, remain positive and reunite with his wife, despite the challenging circumstances of their separation. When Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a mysterious girl with problems of her own, things get complicated. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, butonly if he'll do something very important for her in return. As their deal plays out, an unexpected bond begins to form between them, and silver linings appear in both of their lives.The film is adapted from a novel by the same name, by Matthew Quick. The film never attempts to reach those heights of a deeply meaningful cinema or social satires and that'exactly why it succeeds. It provides you with naturalistic experience of a rom-com with grit and emotion of a realist drama. The characters are believable and skilfully sketched. These two hours at the theater infuse positivism and contentment within you. It's a perfectly suitable drama for these anxious times that we live in. There's love and warmth, there's emptiness and heartbreaks, there's optimism and competitiveness , and yet there's contentment in all of this and so much more that life gives. The director gives you a lot to like over here especially the breeziness that he brings to a tale of two misfits trying to make it work. Essentially a comedy, he balances this film perfectly by giving some serious heart to it. It's modern, delightful and absorbs you completely. And in the end you leave with a smile on your face.Performances are basically the life of this film. A subject like this could've easily got derailed if the performances fell any short of what they are right now. The lead actors give it depth and deliver two of the most moving performances you'll ever see. Bradley Cooper surprises you with his acting prowess. Usuallyconsidered as merely a good looking charmer, he surfaces a totally unforeseen side of his talent. He proves how underrated an 'actor' he has been. Jennifer Lawrence is superb too. Her character has multiple complex shades that she portrays amazingly well. The support cast is terrific, bringing completeness to this fulfilling drama.All-in-all, 'Silver Linings Playbook' can be perfectly defined as a ""serious romantic comedy"" which is intelligent and edgy, with romance at its core. Go for it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Truly fantastic,"I had been anticipating Silver Linings Playbook very much for a good while now, although I wasn't entirely sure I should be. It does look like some sort of romantic dramedy, and while the genre can work well many times, it's also not a genre that does anything particularly amazing for me. And while I liked Russell's The Fighter a good amount (his only other film I've seen) it's also the sort of film that quickly fades from memory. So I can't say how well I'll like a film like this as time goes by, but for now, I'm in love.I never saw a trailer for this. I only saw a clip between Pat and Tiffany at the dinner table with another couple (who I now know is Pat's friend and Tiffany's sister), and the clip hugely impressed me. I loved Lawrence in Winter's Bone, but this just seemed like such a huge step for her. And then there was Bradley Cooper, making a large impression in the short two-minute clip that I was completely shocked. Who knew the guy from The Hangover could do so much in such a small clip? So for them I definitely had high expectations, just based on two minutes. And they certainly didn't disappoint in any way, shape or form. There have been some great duos in 2012, but no two actors electrify the screen together as much as Cooper and Lawrence. They bounce off each other magically, making me long for more recent films with a central relationship as dynamic and as charismatic as this. Lawrence nails every single second of her character. There's a real energy to her, you just can't look away. People have wondered whether this is just a really large supporting role. Here's the thing. When you look at cinema's history you see a lot of roles considered ""leading"" that are sometimes really large secondary characters to a more prominent lead. A great example is Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire. But the reason he is ultimately seen as lead alongside Leigh is because of the amount of power he brings to the screen and for the fact that he brings to the film the type of spark that not everyone can achieve, and as a result the relationship between Blanche Dubois and Stanley is the central power to the film. The same goes for Lawrence here. Whatever she is in terms of category, she gives the best female performance of 2012. I say that without hesitation, and I truly hope she wins the Oscar over the also-great Chastain or Riva.I wanted to talk about Lawrence before Cooper because, as it is, it's the performance with the most notices. But Cooper is just as equally magnificent and radiant, demonstrating a true talent for handling something as dramatic and comedic as this. He drives the film in ways no other actor of the year besides Jackman in Les Miserables did. But despite being the main lead of the film, his role is perhaps not as showy as Lawrence's. The role requires for a true navigation between many different emotional arcs that should drive the film in a clear and empathetic way. Cooper finds the perfect balance and as a result it's one of the easiest characters to sympathize and connect with in recent years.The rest of the cast is strong, and De Niro and Weaver both do great in their roles. As is the case, I'm not sure why people are too upset about Weaver, especially when De Niro was seen as a strong, strong possibility for an Oscar nom for several weeks now and yet doesn't have all that much more to do than her. Based on reactions to the Oscar nods, I expected Weaver to be in it for very few scenes. She's more prominent than that for sure. The ending also worked brilliantly for me, but this is the type of ending that I could see perhaps weakening or making the film stronger when I reflect back on it later on. Ultimately, this is a very strong film and among the best of 2012.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
What everyone needs once in a while.,"Before I go on to say what I thought of the movie, I must address that I went in to see this after I had read the book. If you are of that group this review may speak to you more than to others. If you have not read the book I highly recommend it to you all.The movie was very good. The screenplay was very up to date with what a good movie should have. The pace of the movie and the mood of the movie was very up beat and would entertain today's audiences. I really like the adapted story. I would say it was an alternate to what I was expecting, but I was not disappointed at all. The performance given by Cooper and Lawrence was amazing and that is truly what made this movie a treat to watch.Now I will contrast this a little with the book so for those who are going to see this will not be caught off guard. The story in the movie (other than for some major plot points) did not correspond with the book at all. The book had a much more serious tone to it. For example there was a grim veil around Pat in the book because in the book he is in a much more serious and mal-adaptive condition than in the movie. Along with many character adaptations, the story in the movie has 40% mutability with the story in the novel.That being said, I recommend both the book and the novel VERY MUCH. The book is almost completely different and is a good story as well but a little more grim, which makes the silver lining all the more satisfying.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Lighthearted drama with heavy themes,"Silver Linings Playbook tells the story of Pat (Bradley Cooper), a mental institution patient who has just gotten released and now has to re-enter society while avoiding the pitfalls that landed him in the institution in the first place. Enter Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a friend of a friend, who has also gone through her own problems and, like Pat, is still dealing with them. Throw in some quirky family members, an overarching goal in the form of a dance competition, some football, and you have Silver Linings Playbook.Now, what makes this film work is the chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence and the sheer talent they bring to their roles. Jennifer Lawrence won an Oscar for her role and it shows. Tiffany is a brilliant mixture of varying characteristics. She's a bit manic, she's a bit of a goth, she has her bitchy moments, but beneath all of it you can see the cheerful and caring person she could be. Full of nuances and personality, she's a great character. Not that Cooper does any worse in his role. The film dedicates more time to Pat, him being the main character, and especially the first few scenes, when he's at his most vulnerable, are very effective in introducing his character and getting us to sympathize with him, while still providing some humour.The story itself isn't overly complex or anything you haven't seen before, but it doesn't really need to be. Romantic comedies/dramas like this one are always more about the characters than plot, so I wasn't expecting anything more. And the story is decent, don't get me wrong. It allows for some nice character moments, some nice dialogue and it carries the movie to a satisfying conclusion. Could it have been better? Yes, but that's a nitpick. No film is perfect.I'd easily recommend this to any fan of romantic comedies/dramas and to anyone who likes strong and layered characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Genuinely witty, genuinely emotional and very compassionate with a great sense of how far to escalate a scene.","I was quite excited for Silver Linings Playbook earlier in the year when it seemed to be the big hit comedy drama like Sideways, Little Miss Sunshine and Beginners that I find myself adoring. Then the trailers came and made it look like a messy chick flick shot by an amateur and my expectations plummeted. I had no intentions of even seeing it in the cinema but I'm really glad I did because it fulfilled the big hit comedy and more. What's so special about this simplistic film is that it comes straight from the heart. I've never been too much of a fan of David O. Russell. I Heart Huckabees seemed like a surefire winner for me but it missed the mark. The Fighter and Three Kings were good, but cold. Silver Linings is the film to prove Russell's worth. It's a very special experience that I already want to see again. It's very entertaining and easy to relate to so it cuts straight to the core. Although it is rough around the edges and the third act is a little cluttered, the second act is absolutely wonderful and is enough to make it great.The most impressive aspect about the film is the intricate production design, with a very delicate and seemingly deliberate use of colour coding for each scene in subtle hues, it's one of its most consistent and interesting aspects as well as cinematic push ins on characters in dramatic moments. The script is what makes the film, fast paced, genuinely witty, genuinely emotional and very compassionate with a great sense of how far to escalate a scene. It's so great to see Robert De Niro great again after so long. His part is small and to the side and focused on two particular aspects, but it's classic De Niro that has been sorely missed with a few emotional scenes. Bradley Cooper is the real revelation here. I enjoyed him in The Hangover even though I didn't enjoy that film, but here he really emotes and his comedic side is put to best use. He really is deserving of all the acclaim. Jennifer Lawrence is certainly great, but if she were to win the Oscar for this it would probably draw far too much negative attention to being overrated as she was better in Winter's Bone. Easily one of my favourites of the year.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Give a medal to Silver Linings Playbook,"A much more concise and pretty story than I was expecting, Silver Linings Playbook is definitely more of a feelgood movie than a film about mental health.I've e never seen Cooper in another film outside The Hangover and he's a completely different actor here, which paints him in a very different light for me, I'm very much looking forward to checking him out in his other movies. Lawrence is golden and beautiful and powerful as always. The rest of the cast are the rest of the cast.You can get past the fact that Cooper and Lawrence don't quite pull off convincing portrayals of mental health - to their credit it's very hard to do well and they both equally give it a good shot - because the meaning and energy behind what's going on here is more powerful than its individual parts. None of the characters are that special, none of the shots are that memorable, none of the jokes are that funny....but....but....the way I felt as the credits roll has remained with me for some time now. Maybe I'm warming up as I get older.It kinda does exactly what it says on the tin I guess. Though like I say I wasn't quite expecting the emotions I felt. The last 20 mins felt a bit rushed but it just held itself together for an ending that certainly had me welling up for all the right reasons.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Poor representation of bipolar disorder,"As soon as I heard the characters pronounce the drug Trazodone incorrectly twice near the beginning of the film, I knew this wasn't going to be an accurate portrayal of someone with bipolar disorder.The two supposed ""mental cases"" didn't exhibit any unique traits that would pin them as bipolar or unipolar or psychotic or...anything. Also, was this supposed to be a romantic-comedy or a drama or a film about ballroom dancing and overcoming odds? What the hell was it? While I thought the acting was fine I was shocked that some consider it Oscar worthy! DeNiro was excellent but everyone else - just average.Lastly, I would think the producers/directors would do some background research on mental illness before releasing a film like this. For one, find out how psychotropic medications are pronounced and what they are used for and find out the behaviors of a person suffering from bipolar disorder. I realize this wasn't a documentary on the subject but with a hefty production budget, can't you get the basics right?",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Excellent, one of my new favourite movies.","A member of my family suffered with the bi- polar illness, and I was so touched with the story I started unexpectedly crying halfway through the movie, embarrassing as it was.

The sense of a community pulling together throughout this film really touched me and gave me hope. What better 'silver lining'in a movie can you ask for, and isn't this the best thing a movie could hope to achieve? I couldn't fault any part of it. The only thing it was missing was the full sense of depression and despair that bi polar sufferers experience, put to be honest that would make too uncomfortable viewing for me. fantastic acting from everyone, especially the lead roles. should have received more Oscars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
The Comedy Shines First and Foremost,"If, while watching ""Silver Linings Playbook"", you have previous experience with bipolar disease, then the film will likely speak to your heart. If, however, you are like me and really don't know anything about bipolar-ism, the humor in the movie will still keep you enjoying it throughout.For a basic plot summary, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" sees Pat (Bradley Cooper), a diagnosed bi- polar sufferer, being released from a mental institution and trying to fit back into his family and society at large. This includes a father (Robert De Niro) who is a die-hard Eagles fan and is as superstitious as they come, a friend (John Ortiz) completely treading water in his marriage, and a mother (Jacki Weaver) who is always caught in the middle. It is only after Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow battling multiple personal demons of her own, that he realizes the lengths he must go to in order to succeed in battling his illness.At heart, this is a film about mental illness and its effects on everyday life. If you have experienced similar situations, the storyline will likely touch you on a very deep level. Yet, just the humor of some of the situations this crazy family puts itself in will easily be enough to keep your interest level high. The moral of the story is that we are all a little ""screwed up"" on some level, but we just need to find that ""silver lining"" to get through life. Whether those themes touch you a little bit or a lot, there is enough comedy to keep things from really bogging down.Plus, even if all else fails for you in the viewing process, there is the appeal of watching the two beautiful leads. Lawrence is showcased in enough workout outfits and dance costumes to perk up males in the audience, while I hear the ladies like Mr. Cooper just a tad as well.Overall, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a solid movie, though not really an all-time classic. It does enough things right--like make you laugh a little, think a little, feel a little--to be solid and not boring in any way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Needs more detail on portrayal of mental illness,"Silver Linings Playbook shows all the major characters to be suffering from a great range of mental illnesses which varies from Depression to OCD to Bi-polar disorder. These mental illnesses are depicted some-what accurately through the film but there are some flaws that I feel could have been addressed. The Characters who suffer depression are not shown to be suffering the same symptoms of depression that people in reality suffer from. The Characters do not have great slumps in mood, feel like the world is against them and then isolate themselves from family. If you watch carefully you will notice that the characters are always doing something during the film, they never isolate themselves from family. Being from a family with a history of depression and mental I feel that they are not portraying mental illnesses in enough detail that they could of.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A Feel Good Romantic Comedy,"I went into Silver Linings Playbook with a sense of optimism. I had gotten free tickets to this through a promotional deal so I had no personal investment going in. Being advertised as the feel good movie of the year I must say that this movie totally delivers, it wasn't even until I left the theatre that I realized I was watching a romantic comedy. The movie walks a thin line between adult-oriented family drama, and romantic comedy. It is a tricky tone to establish if any major department comes up short. Fortunately, the writing clicks, the direction is solid, and the actors have enough chemistry to make you forget your watching a movie; at least until the curtains come up.I usually don't like Bradley Cooper (38) as he often plays too much of a jerk in his movies; typecast as a cocky womanizer in most of his other roles, but I was surprised he was able to put together a performance where he was just crazy enough for the audience to relate to, but not too far gone to be alienating.Having just seen ""The Hunger Games"", I initially figured Jennifer Lawrence (22) was far too young to play a widow, but she is often able to bring a certain amount of maturity to the roles she takes on. This is vital to a film that casts to lead actors with 15 years between them to carry on a chemistry that is believable and it mostly works.As for the rest of the acting Robert De Niro seems to have more life in him in this role than we've seen in years. I particularly loved the scene where he is speaking to Bradley Cooper's character asking him to spend some quality father and son time watching a football game with him. The emotions of disappointment wash over his face in one of the films standout moments.The remaining cast acts as filler serving the main performances. You get fills Jacki Weaver acting as a stereotypical old age mother, and have Chris Tucker also pops in for a few funny scenes to sport extra comic- relief. Overall the ensemble works just as it should with performances that slightly elevate standard rom-com material.In a crowded holiday season, I like to look for a real gem and this movie stands out as one of the better films of 2012, and will most likely get Oscar attention from the academy come awards season.Overall Grade: +2/ B+",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
We've All Got Issues,"This film is a quirky drama with an underlying comedic tone throughout starring Bradley Cooper as Pat Solatano and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany. Having been released from a brief stay at a psychiatric institution Pat moves in with his Parents in Philadelphia and he is bent on becoming a better person and staying rehabilitated - his primary motivation being to reconnect with his estranged wife who has a restraining order against him. Pat is determined to stay positive and look for the silver linings in his life despite many obstacles he faces in the wake of being incarcerated for beating a man nearly to death whom Pat caught his wife cheating with. Of the challenges he faces, the biggest ones are internal. Being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Pat experiences sudden changes in mood. The fact that he refuses to take his prescribed medication only serves to make the problem worse.Pat is obsessed with winning back his wife and is chasing the carrot that everyone around him is certain he can't catch. Like Pat, everyone has their own problems, but believing that a happy ending is possible is the one thing we need to get what we want out of life and most of the time the main obstacle is ourselves. This is a driving theme throughout this film much akin to the film Good Will Hunting (Damon & Affleck, 1997) where we see a character that gets in his own way and doesn't see true happiness at first though it is right in front of him.In Pat's quest for self-betterment and winning back his wife's heart he meets Tiffany, who he quickly learns is just as dysfunctional as he isif not more. This common thread initiates a friendship that allows them to help each other understand their issues and deal with them better. As time goes on we see the development of a crush that Tiffany has on Pat that does not appear to be reciprocated, yet a friendship has begun. Though an attraction exist on Pat's part, he must decide which relationship is an illusion and which one has the silver lining he is looking for.Throughout the film we get acquainted with Pat's father, Pat Sr., and continue to get a deeper understanding of his love for the Philadelphia Eagles and his strong superstition. Pat Sr. is strongly convicted of the fact that his son is a good luck charm and consistently pressures Pat to watch the Eagles play under the guise of needing bonding time with his son. We see just how strong Pat Sr.'s superstition is when he begs Pat to watch the game with him at a time when Pat has a previous commitment with Tiffany, who is helping Pat become a more controlled person. Eventually, Pat Sr. learns that his superstition was an illusion and that even if had been real, he would have been lost a bet he hung his superstition on anyway.This film shows us that we can be our own worst enemies. By believing that what we want is possible we can still end up with the result we want but a great deal of heartache can be avoided if we open our proverbial eyes and get out of our own way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Great character driven story,"I love stories that are about people - sounds obvious but you can tell the difference between one that's more plot / lore oriented and those that are propelled by the journeys their characters take. For me, this was one of those stories. I really liked Pat and Tiffany, I found myself rooting for them all the way while also being able to objectively look at how their behaviours were affecting themselves and those around them.

Jennifer Lawrence plays a sex addict(surprise surprise) who's husband passed away. One day they have a chance meeting and... Well you can guess where it goes from there. A very unconventional, original and unique love story that provides a couple of laughs too. I would recommend it to any and all Bradley cooper, Robert DeNiro and romance/comedy fans.

"Neurotic, crazy, funny, screwball romantic comedy","¨The only way to beat my crazy was by doing something even crazier. Thank you. I love you. I knew it from the moment I saw you. I'm sorry it took me so long to catch up. ¨Silver Linings Playbook is director David O. Russell's second straight Oscar nominated film for Best Picture after the his critically acclaimed The Fighter. This film is very different from his previous work although it also has to do with family relationships in some sort of way. It is based on Matthew Quick's novel of the same name and the screenplay was adapted by Russell himself which resulted in a really quirky but sharp script. There are plenty of hilarious moments in the movie and Russell has really raised the bar for rom-coms by mixing it with some realistic drama. These romantic comedies are very hard to come across these days, but Russell manages to deliver a nearly perfect one thanks to his sensitive direction. He did take a huge risk with this film considering its thematic was a bit tricky since the main character does require some patience and forgiveness from the viewer. He is not a very likable character at the beginning, but if you stick with him and give him a second chance he will win you over. It is not easy to make a romantic film when you have two main characters suffering from bipolar and OCD disorders, and on top of that mix it with comedy, but Russell was very sensitive about the subject. I really love Russell's style of direction, and you either love his movies or hate them. I really found this movie to be easy to connect with as it is a heartwarming and funny story despite the complications and tricky subject matter. Critics are calling this film crazy good, and I agree with them because it is deeply romantic despite being strange and neurotic. Besides we are all a little crazy, and I think Russell was pointing that out through every character in this film.We are introduced to Pat (Bradley Cooper) in the very first scene of the movie, who is being discharged from a mental institution by his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) against medical advice. Apparently Pat was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after finding his wife, Nikki (Brea Bee), having an affair with a fellow co-worker and nearly beating him to death. He was sentenced to be institutionalized for eight months, and after doing so his mother was free to take him back to Philadelphia as long as he live with his parents and stayed away from his wife who had placed a restraining order on him. Pat is received with some surprise by his father, Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro), who had no idea he was coming home, but Is happy to have his son back who he considers a lucky charm for the Eagles' games. Pat Sr. is a very superstitious guy and after losing his job he's been making a living through sports gambling. Pat's life changes when he meets another troubled woman named Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who has recently become a widow and a sex addict. Pat desperately wants to get back with Nikki and will do what it takes to win her back despite not being able to get near her. Tiffany offers to give Nikki a letter from him if he agrees to enter a dance competition with her for which they will have to rehearse extensively. Both characters suffer several meltdowns and seem to have some sort of shared neuroses, but in some odd way they end up helping one another and struggle together to rebuild their lives.This film really deserves all the buzz that it received first from TIFF way back in September, and then from its recent eight Oscar nominations, including the big five (Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay) which hadn't happened since 2004 (Million Dollar Baby), and it also received Oscar nominations in all four acting categories, which hadn't happened since 1981 (Reds). The cast is truly wonderful in this film, everyone gives such great performances. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both expanded their range in this film and went way out of their usual comfort zone creating some unique characters. Lawrence especially surprised me with her quirky performance, and her entrance in the film truly shifts the momentum of the movie. I was really not sold with Silver Lining Playbook until she appeared giving Cooper's character a lot more likability. I loved her in two scenes; the first being the one she has a meltdown in the restaurant and goes off on Cooper and the second being the confrontation she had with Pat Sr. For those two scenes alone, Lawrence could win the Oscar. Cooper, De Niro, and Weaver were all outstanding as well. These characters were all well drawn and the actors took advantage of that delivering solid performances. The film has such a great pacing building the momentum up to the very climactic ballroom dance routine. It was something special. The message had a pretty positive outlook as Russell seemed to be reminding us that we should all look for a partner that can coexist with our craziness and not try to find one that will lead us out of it as we usually do. This was a great and optimistic film that deserves all the buzz it has been receiving.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
The Vidiot Reviews,"Silver Linings PlaybookThe easiest way to tell if you're still crazy after being released from a mental hospital is if your imaginary friends throw you a welcome home party.Luckily, actual people receive the bipolar outpatient in this dramedy.Discharged after a stint, Pat (Bradley Cooper) arrives home to find his wife has a restraining order against him.Living with his parents (Jacki Weaver, Robert De Niro), he formulates a plan to win her back.Helping him in the process is Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a deranged widow who needs a dance partner in trade.But when a binary bet pairs their recital with the Philadelphia Eagles, Pat's recuperation is threatened.A charismatic comedy combined with a neurotic love story, Silver Linings Playbook plays host to a horde of hysterical performances and madcap chemistry.Incidentally, the hardest adjustment to life outside of a mental health facility is administering your own electric shock therapy.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Exceeded My Expectations on Every Level,"I go to movies for A) a good story,B) to watch transformational actors and C) being hopelessly drawn in to a world that is both none of my own making, but resonating and breathing with universal emotional connection and humanity. And this film was like having all of my own emotions placed in a Cuisinart and processed on ""high."" And I mean that in the best possible way. Bradley Cooper, whose other films I'd never seen was a strong pivotal character who never had a break. Even when focused on others like Mr. DeNiro, Brad was always in the background. DeNiro and Jennifer Lawrence were superb, as were all the supporting cast members. The only time the film lost its grip for me was when Jennifer's character, Tiffany, who had previously proclaimed no interest football, gave a performance not unlike Marisa Tomei in ""My Cousin Vinny,"" when she suddenly became an unstoppable informed witness on Pontiac tires. Tiffany had a similar moment where she took over the living room with a huge and informed monologue about football. That said, it was integral to the plot and the remainder of the story. I loved the visuals of the Halloween revelers, the diner scene (which I anticipated with both anxiousness and child-like glee) and of course the ever-present Christmas theme (almost can't make a movie without-certainly not a romantic one.) Pretend we are talking about wine. This film had tones of the 1970's with its sloppy and scrappy humanity, Bradley Cooper could have been Woody Allen in some scenes, and the therapy scenes recalled ""Ordinary People."" A great movie about life, love, family and crazy people which is never maudlin, nor preachy. The acting, directing, and cinematography was all perfectly meshed. I suspect there will be awards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Jennifer Lawrence Shines In Top Drawer Romantic Comedy,Silver Linings Playbook is a wonderful modern romantic comedy from director/screenwriter David O. Russell. The cast is excellent especially Jennifer Lawrence whose work here could earn her an Academy Award nomination. Bradley Cooper is a former teacher recently released from a mental institution after being sentenced for a violent outburst. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder he is determined to pick up his life where he left off and that includes reuniting with his wife. He isn't at all prepared for Lawrence a mentally conflicted widow living in her parents' garage. Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver are Cooper's football addicted dad and June Cleaver-like mom eager to help their son get his life on track. I found the characters totally believable with a nice blend of comedy and drama ultimately leading to a thrilling climax. Chris Tucker is terrific in a small role as Cooper's friend from the institution.,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Game Plan,"As a saying goes when the door is shut, god opens a window. Yeah we all had out down points in life, however the truth about life is it's most of the time a matter of how you get back up from troubled circumstances is what counts. This is one of those romance stories I really like because like any plan in football that works it runs toward the goal line.With any good romance stories and dramas this film has characters that I actually care about and really like. But also really love the quarky, bizarre yet down to earth nature of the film.The dialog in this film is great, it is at times a little strange and humorous but I feel that's what makes the characters seem more human. It really felt like I was hearing people talking and not just fictional characters.Pat is played well by Bradley Cooper this is probably my favorite role from him for now. Pat is a broken guy you really feel pathos for. The legal and psychological troubles he's been though, sure what it did isn't completely right, but the guy he beat up wasn't innocent; along with a painful divorce. I like how his aggressive attitude toward things which is not just a psychological problem but a quark. One really funny scene is when he does a rant on a Ernest Heminway book which he literally throws out the window, it's funny because he kinda makes a point. He wants to rejoin life again but the problem is he's calling the wrong play.I really like how the film at times has some really intense scenes. Like one where Pat was acting out a bit from the fact he couldn't find the wedding video, you can't help but feel for the guy as he has both anger and sadness combined, the fact that the wedding video is gone reflects the life he can't get back because to him that was the only times of happiness. But I really like the humanity of his character, whenever he feels he letting people down whether it's his mom, dad, or Tiffany he feels awful about it and himself; I feel it shows he's not a selfish person he really does care about other people and letting them down is the last thing he wants.However my favorite character in the film is Tiffany, played brilliantly by Jennifer Laurence whom I think is kinda hot and a more than capable actress. Her character reminds me a little of April Ludgate from ""Parks and Recreation"" whom is also a little similar. I really love how fiery, feisty, energetic, a little bizarre, dark, she has charisma which is black, quarky, or clever. However the best thing about her to me is the fact that she accepts that she's not perfect she has her psychological troubles but she accepts them. She also a character you feel pathos for since like with Pat had to endure a loss, with her though it was the loss of her husband. I like that she's is ambitious in a way, she loves dancing and wants to be a champion but also doesn't want to be alone wants someone in her life again.You already know in the film both really are a good match for one another. Both are somewhat the same, like with Pat she's also has aggression in an intense scene in the restaurant just seeing her exercise it makes me feel she might be more aggressive than Pat. Both are broken and are trying to get their lives back together as well have more in their life that they haven't had. And the chemistry between them is great I really love the banter between them, there are sparks whether they know it or not, and they support one another in a way; heck both of them dance well together so that ought to say something.And you want both of them together but not just yet because like with any good romance story I feel one or both have to earn it first. And both do, in a way the film is a bit like a Howard Hawks film, as the film goes on both characters grow, Pat becomes more of a man and Tiffany more of a woman. And as that happens both start connecting, say things they probably never said to anyone else.However this I don't think is just a romance about two people but it's also about love for family.The supporting characters are also really good each with quarks and trouble of their own. Robert De Nero as Pat Sr I thought was great, just like his son he's psychologically troubled. And just like his son has a humanity, really like this one touching moment when he has a talk down with Pat and admits he hasn't been the best father. And we see in the film both of them also start growing closer becoming in touch with one another again.I've said enough, Silver Linings Playbook is a touchdown.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

I wonder why Jennifer Lawrence got an Oscar for her performance,"Jennifer Lawrence is okay in this movie but she's not that great. I don't think it really showed her acting chops. On the other hand Bradley cooper was great as a bipolar guy. I think the mental illness was depicted very well. But I wouldn't call this movie a comedy. It wasn't very fun.

A Rom Com that guys can love,"I must admit that I was a bit wary at first of whether or not I would see Silver Linings Playbook. Being a New Yorker and a member of NYGiants nation my first take on seeing the trailer for this film was that it would be a fantasy tale for Eagledelphia in which the Eagles would finally win something and everything in the Phillyverse would be right for 90 minutes. I could not have been more wrong as what unfolded before my eyes was a gem of a film that has something for everyone. Silver Linings Playbook is a rocky love story about mental illness that stays close to our hearts with funny and frank dialogue. The film brings home a point that we are all imperfect by showing the ups and downs of our imperfections in a real way. Using sports as a backdrop the story centers on a working class Philadelphia family that you'd swear live at the end of your street. If there were awards for Casting Director this film would get it. (Maybe there is an award for Casting Director??)The group of actors chosen for this film all complement each other so well it's as if they've know each other their whole lives. You would actually expect to see these folks together at a bar or a BBQ. It was great to see Chris Tucker in a role where he was not running through Hong Kong or yelling at Jackie Chan and oh Julia Stiles where have you been? She is one of the underrated talents of her era. Bradley Cooper is stellar in his portrayal of the lead character Pat. I cant believe this is the hangover guy. He has arrived and is taking names. Hope they spell it right on that gold statue he'll be getting ; } It was also great to see Robert Deniro in a role that he was able to sink his teeth into as he was in classic form. There are some gut-busting laughs in this film and moments that make you squirm and say ""did he just say/do that?"" There are many strong performances all around from just an awesome and talented cast. The director let this story unfold for you and delicately nudged the story along through several ups and down always keeping you on your toes and afraid to take your eyes off the screen for fear of missing a moment good or bad. Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic in her range easily holding her own as the feisty ""Tiffany"". I expect we'll be seeing quite a bit of this beautiful and talented young actress in the immediate future. This is not your classic ""When Harry met Sally"" but will no doubt leave you with that same feeling at the end having you saying to yourself ""I just witnessed something! This film is going to do well collecting a few golden statuettesJG",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Everything a movie should be.....,"We laughed our heads off; we got teary-eyed; we held our collective breath(s); we beamed with happiness and pride; we were stunned with surprise a few times, too. These characters are LIKABLE -- a little unpredictable -- but still WONDERFUL. The story was mesmerizing, well-paced, and COMPLETE.Robert DeNiro was, as always, brilliant. Simply brilliant.This film is a breath of fresh air in all ways. Although deeply troubled and confused, Bradley Cooper is absolutely lovable here. One just can't help but pull for everyone in this story.I DO hope this film does well at the Academy Awards.

Buffalo 66 re-set in Philadelphia  with many more words,"Romantic? Definitely. Bizarre? Most definitely. Predictable ending? Sure. Comedy? Not the rollicking type, but in the classic sense of a non-tragedy with some amusing touches and incidents, it qualifies. Great acting? I'll take issue with consensus here - I thought Jennifer Lawrence was electric. I thought Bradley Cooper showed a bit too much physical self-control during his intense bi-polar episodes but was otherwise very good. DeNiro seemed to overlay his performance on Gazzara's in Buffalo 66.Why do I compare this film to Buffalo 66? You have an off-center protagonist coming home post-confinement with unfinished business and a chip on his shoulder. You have a dancer with some emotional damage of her own as the lead female (albeit not held hostage) against a blue- collar backdrop of economic depression and local sports hysteria.This film is less misanthropic than Buffalo 66 and has some brighter characters, making it a lot less dark overall - but many of the themes are similar - as is the unlikely romantic resolution.One major difference - Buffalo 66 nailed Buffalo - felt like buffalo during the week I spent there. I spent 10 years in Philadelphia. First, I'm unclear whether this was supposed to take place in Italian South Philadelphia or Llanarch (a suburb just outside west Philly), but the roads where he ran seemed much too wide for either and the houses and front yards were much too wide as well. Parking was too spacious. They talk about the 76 (which everyone calls the Schuylkill - or various local take-offs - school-kill, sure-kill, etc.). It passes by South Philly, but nowhere near Llanarch (they show a Llanarch Diner). DeNiro and his betting ""friend"" seem right in character for South Philly. None of the other family members look or act the type particularly. Julia Stiles' character (sharp performance in a thankless role), family, and home with lawn seem more like Llanarch but the areas shown in most of the running sequences don't match. Then the Indian bus and the parking lot brawl seemed way too staged and forced. Unlikely that just getting off the bus - a bus they've seen before and had a friend of one of their group on it - would precipitate such a brawl. So, for those who trumpet how realistic this movie was, I found the depiction of Philly and its dysfunctional sports fanatics to be totally off. Invincible did a much better job of depicting these folk as they are. The story in Invincible was more credible also. I lived there during the Vince Papale years.All that said, I generally wouldn't get so deep into a romantic comedy but this one is considered very special and ground-breaking in its characterizations. It is a good movie and does an acceptable job to me of characterizing one person with one manifestation of bi-polar disorder, his friends, and his sports-crazy dad for me to enjoy. I'd have been interested in learning a bit more about Lawrence's character's post-traumatic nymphomania and its treatment since this too can be a real dysfunction but that was glossed over and I only accepted it because of the fire in the belly Lawrence displayed. Her subtle traits and occasional physical ticks lent credibility to me.So, overall, I enjoyed this somewhat Hollywood-ized and somewhat clichéd but still highly thoughtful and enjoyable movie. Certainly, I've found many less engaging ways to spend two hours in a movie theater in the past 10 years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
This is NOT how mental disorders work...,"I was so curious what makes this movie the most awesome rom-com in the entire world that re-defined the genre and whatnot, because this hype avalanche came rushing at me wherever I looked. So I caved and I decided to see it for myself. It wasn't the best idea...I've dealt with mental disorders in the family and amongst friends, and even myself. I know that doesn't make me an expert and I don't claim to be one. I can only draw from my personal experience with this stuff, and according to that, this is NOT how it works. Not even close. This movie is just using all the correct narrative tools to FOOL you into believing this is how it supposed to work. No, mental disorders, bi-polars, schizophrenia, obsessions, psychotic episodes are NOT quirky or slapstick, and people screaming nonsensical BS at each other is NOT drama. Also, no, you cannot magically cure mental illness by dancing with an equally mentally screwed up girl. That's not how things in life work.I have to say the acting is first class across the board. No complaints there, it's excellent. That's all the 4 stars up there. I believe the actors did the best they could with the screenplay they've been given. But sadly the screenplay is so far torn from all things realistic, that's what makes it hollow. It has some genuinely good moments, at some places I really saw something shining through, but then it immediately does something so stupid, so predictable, so clichéd, so movie-esque that destroyed all the immersion that's been built up.I know that's not fair to criticize a movie for not being realistic, because it's a movie, it's not supposed to be, but in this case all the praise I see unleashed on Silver Linings Playbook is about how realistic it is with real emotions and a realistic depiction of mental disorders. No, it isn't! If you want to see a realistic depiction of mental illness, visit a mental ward at a hospital. Don't worry, it's free, you can visit any time you want. Getting in is not the hard part, but getting out...Long story short, this is an average rom-com movie, with great acting and a good story layout that's been ultimately destroyed by Hollywood clichés. It's certainly not the bestest, awesomest, genre-defining, Oscar hogging masterpiece some people make it out to be. Also, if you haven't dealt with mental disorders in your life, don't believe this is how it looks like, because it doesn't. Thanks for reading.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Magic In Silver Lining,"Silver Linings Playbook might be beyond than just a romantic comedy. It is probably also a verisimilitude about people with bipolar disorders and families falling apart. It may offer more to the story, but despite all, it still centers to the romance than anything else. It's not groundbreaking to the genre, though it doesn't have to. For some reason, it sort of feels quite refreshing. The film is compellingly and genuinely charming. It has a lot of memorable performances. It can be predictable at times but it's easy to ignore those by the film's merits. Silver Linings Playbook is easily one of the best recent romcoms we get.It did not start out as a romantic comedy, though. The film begins as a drama about a guy struggling with his condition and longs to win back his ex-wife. The whole romcom formula only appears when it introduces the connections between the two leads. Some points can be typical, but they are thankfully not noticeable because of its clever storytelling and writing. The film's humor, like any romantic comedies, aims to be awkward, but their delivery is pretty natural instead of hamming up. In most romcoms, the screen couple aren't usually appealing. The biggest reason is because their romance always ends up being empty, unlike here their love leads to something. They rather express their honest mistakes, but when they don't, they just share their sweet side to each other.Apart from the romantic comedy is a drama comedy that deals with Pat's complicated life and family by his serious condition. It is suppose to be both funny and affecting but it never ignores the darkness of their problems. Just like David O. Russell's recent films, he manages to keep it heartfelt and utterly entertaining. The performances also carries the film. Bradley Cooper has always been charming in his romantic roles but here gets to do more like bursting his character's expressions by his mental illness and he's quite convincing at doing it. Same thing goes to Jennifer Lawrence. Well they are both amazing, leading a remarkable chemistry. Robert De Niro is, without a doubt, terrific that this could be one of his memorable recent performances.It's a simple fun love story about two people sharing their same life problems, or maybe not simple. It is both light and dark but in a less serious way. They go crazy, fall in love, and talk about ridiculous ""superstitions"", but that's what makes it so likable. We could forgive its minor flaws. This is a rare romantic comedy that isn't exasperating, artificial, and hollow. It is awkwardly hilarious, and has genuine love and charm that we needed in the genre. It finds something wonderful in the end. This film is a silver lining to this becoming stale genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Silver Linings Playbook,"Over the past several years we seem to have several romantic comedies coming out each year. Most of them do not interest me one bit and I stay away from them. I am sure you know which ones I mean. The ones that are predictable and despite all odds a handsome leading man ends up with his beautiful female leading lady and the chemistry does not feel real and it all feels so contrived and clichéd and it's one of those situations where if you have seen one of them, you have seen them all. Thankfully, Silver Linings Playbook is an exception to that rule. It is a film that is more, or less a romantic comedy, but also deals with mental illness and real people and their feelings. The film at times would indeed make me laugh, but at other times I sat in quiet amazement over the wonderful performances that were on display here from the whole cast and also the top notch writing that brings us deeper into these characters and provides for much entertainment and brilliant dialogue. I know some people were a little concerned about having a film where the two main characters have both suffered from and still do to an extent, mental health issues. However, I did not find that the film put that element in there to mock, or single out these characters, but instead to show a different perspective on every day life and in this case different views on love and relationships as well. When you are first watching Silver Linings Playbook, for the first half hour, or so, you really do not know which way this film is going to go, or what type of a film that it will be, but I was pleasantly surprised on all accounts. Both stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are terrific in this. I have only seen Bradley Cooper in The Hangover, before this and while it was humorous and entertaining, I think we all have to admit that it is not an awards calibre movie. Bradley Cooper shines in this role and gives us so much to walk away from the film thinking about as does Jennifer Lawrence as well. This is the first film I have seen Jennifer Lawrence in and she was also terrific. There is a certain element of mystery and a sense of uncertainty about her character as you watch the film. She seems to have put up barricades around herself, probably to protect her, but as the film goes along and she lets down those walls and you get to see more of her character and look past her insecurities and neuroses, you really do start cheering for her and hoping it will all work out for her as well as Bradley Cooper's character as well. It has been awhile where I have seen a comedy drama with such well layered and developed characters as they are here. They felt real to me and because of that, I could often identify with them, feel for them and feel a certain connection to them. Every minute of screen time they had, I just wanted to continue to watch them over sheer fascination of these characters and because of how well written and how well played they were. Supporting actors Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver do a great job here as well and to be perfectly honest about it, I think this is one of De Niro's strongest films and performances in years. Silver Linings Playbook often brought a smile to my face, gave me something to think about and at times almost brought tears to my eyes because of the sheer simplicity of it's characters and the beautiful relationships they have developed with one another and how they just don't give up when things get tough, or throw in the towel, so to speak, but they actually go and want to better themselves and improve their lives and get over the stigma and stereotypes of mental illness and prove that they can make it on their own and achieve what they want to achieve. This film was really special for me. It made me laugh, almost cry, allowed me to identify with the characters and lifted my mood watching the film. It put me in such a good mood that I wanted to stand up and cheer after the film was over. What a monumental piece of filmmaking where everything seemed to have gone perfectly. This alongside with The Master, are my favourite films to date of 2012. I see big things ahead for Lawrence and Cooper and David O.

The real silver lining? The Oscar.,"'Silver Linings Playbook (2012)' is about as conventional as they come in many ways, if not most. Yet, even though director David O. Russell almost exclusively deals in this kind of 'Oscar bait', the film itself never quite seems like solely a soulless awards-grab; it's more concerned with telling a story than showing off its behind-the-scenes talent. While that talent are all, essentially, at the top of their game, it's the relatively unconventional and generally very well-rounded characters that set it apart from its peers. These may be involved in a predictable and slightly baggy plot, but their writing and performances combine to create some really compelling scenes. The entire affair is relatively compelling, actually. It's consistently engaging and, even, entertaining. Its non-condescending focus on mental-health issues is refreshing, too. I suppose, in a certain light, it could be considered adjacent to an indie flick, with a narrative worth exploring regardless of its potential in the awards circuit. Still, it's practically impossible to ignore the fact that it was clearly made for this purpose, especially given that it was only green-lit after Russel proved himself with the similarly successful 'The Fighter (2010)'. That's not necessarily to deprive it of its value, but perhaps to explain why it's ultimately a tad generic. In a way, though, it's a wonder that it's as good as it is, basically being genetically engineered to win awards. The silver lining isn't happiness, it's an Oscar. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Rethinking my own restraining order...,"Honestly, this sat at home for a while as I thought my wife had got the Sandra Bullock mainstream football movie. So the pleasant surprise in finally watching it and realizing my initial mistake gave this an extra boost.It's a bit different than the typical dysfunctional family drama. In that the leads are aware of their dysfunction and trying with great effort to overcome. It's also different in that it strives to address a serious topic (listen to some of the David O. Kelley recounting of his son's illness on the DVD) but ultimately this is a comedy I feel.In fact, I'd bet Kelley prides the Hollywood normalcy that the story takes, granted with a circuitous rout at times to find. You won't love this film as much as Kelley loves his son, but still it's worth a watch (I wish my wife could have pushed past some of the rough aspects of the beginning, but alas no...) The key is having these atypical leading characters, sure the ""chase the wrong one"" love story is hackneyed, but here Cooper's character is easily seen as chasing himself and how things were before the incident, rather than really chasing his estranged wife.There are many precious moments, and DeNiro find a nice supporting role to act up a storm in (too bad they didn't edit out the lines that hamfistedly state the obvious coping strategy and illness that he as the father suffers). But Cooper carries the show (and I thought Chris Tucker shined in his small moments as well). Something about their enthusiastic energy that can be alarmingly charming, but springs forth from darker sources was fascinating. Perhaps no surprise they rose in entertainment as comedians, a career that also feeds off shock and odd angles.The tone of the film is so accepting, it avoids the crass elements. But doesn't sugarcoat the sour slips. We've all said inappropriate things at times, but as Lawrence's character tells Cooper's, we typically don't say more inappropriate things than appropriate. Thanks to the disease of the film, and the ease of the actors in conveying it, this never feels like an FM shock jock reaching for provocation, just the lack of an emotional and empathetic editor in the consciousness of the two leads.Anyways, if like me, you want a restraining order for the big commercial successes, I think you can have it lifted for this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Should've just tuned in to an Eagles game -,"even if I'm not a football fan. This movie almost convinced me that I would've had a whole lot more fun on my couch with some stove-top popcorn watching some live action touchdowns than I had at the theatre gobsmacked by this menagerie of looney tunes fumbling towards a Hollywood happy ending at any and all cost. Try as I might, felt zero affinity for most of these characters. Though you couldn't find two better looking actors than Bradley Cooper as Pat and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, their characters were either too aggravatingly loud and/or lame to keep me interested or root for them. In short, I found the characterization of Pat's bipolar disorder and his family's (not to mention his analyst and the policemen's) response to be so benign and simplistic to the point of absurdity and as crafty as she is, I also couldn't bring myself to care for the underdog lovestruck (sex-starved?) Tiffany. I found her character a self-serving desperate ding-a-ling and worse, a predator in pursuit of somebody more vulnerable to fix. While I can appreciate that birds of a feather might flock together, these two do not a happy & balanced love match make, unless you have high hopes for sustainable joy between a codependent manipulator and and an emasculated romantic. Hmmm, on second thought... Anyway, such a shame the movie focused so heavily on these two sad sacks because the rest of the head cases were much more likable. Chris Tucker was a hoot and so were Pat's friends, Veronica and Ronnie. I wish, too, that I could've chuckled a little more because believe that some scenes were meant to really have us rolling in the aisles or smiling subversively... but alas, not so much. (Some of the more funny moments are featured in the trailer and even those weren't gut-busters, right?) Found myself checking my watch, time and again. (And this from someone who applauds many performances by the remarkable cast and does enjoy unconventional romcoms. I'd sooner recommend three other films which didn't garner half the hype but are far and away sharper, funnier, and more original: ""Eagle vs. Shark"", ""Happy Accidents"" and ""The Science of Sleep"".) Now, if this film does manage to make it to the Oscar playbook, it would be deplorable and affirmation anew that in Hollywood - as in life - all that's silver doesn't glitter.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Silver Linings Playbook has an original story in a worn out genre, David O. Russell have created a masterpiece in this genre","Silver Linings Playbook is a comedy-drama, written and directed by David O. Russell. The film is based on Matthew Quick's 2008 novel The Silver Linings Playbook.
Bradley Cooper plays a man with bipolar disorder who gets released from a psychiatric hospital, and gets to move back in with his parents. He is then determined to win back his estranged wife, but things get more challenging when Pat meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own.
The story is told in a smart and unique way, much to thank for David O. Russell's screenplay, it's a great one. Brilliantly told.The film stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, with Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, Chris Tucker, Anupam Kher, and Julia Stiles in supporting roles.
The cast is filled with acclaimed actors and they doesn't disappoint in this film, you'll find some incredible performances in this film. The ones I want to point out is of course Bradley Cooper as he simply nails the performance, probably one of his personal best. Jennifer Lawrence is the other actor that did a spectacular job, both her and Bradley Cooper deserved their Oscar nominations and all the acclaim. One performance that was really good but totally unexpected was Robert De Niro, now I know how amazing he are and he's personally one of my favorite actors, but I didn't think he would be this good in a comedy. My favorite scenes was actually with him and Bradley Cooper, great chemistry as father and son. But everyone hits the mark in the comedy aspect of the film, it's a great mix between drama and comedy. Loved it.David O. Russell's direction is like always perfect, he got an Oscar nomination for it and he's seriously worthy of all the praise, for his direction and screenplay.
The editing is a major part of why it's incredible, it's extremely fast paced with quick cuts. I don't really like it that much but I understand why it's edited that way, in an artistic way its great as you get the feeling that you're in Patrick's shoes as you get the feeling of how crazy the manic episodes are. When there aren't any episodes, the pacing is much slower and there aren't any quick cuts. Seriously, a fantastic job.Silver Linings Playbook deserves all the acclaim that it got, it's a fresh take on a worn out genre that's often too cheesy, the romantic genre that is. But David O. Russell created an original story with flawed but likeable characters, he also gave the actors lots of freedom as one of my favorite scenes was improvised, Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro shared that scene. It got nominated for Best picture at the Oscars and for good reasons, it's possibly one of the best romantic drama-comedies I have seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
I Have Bipolar Disorder. I'm thinking.. Is this a puzzle?,"I was hospitalized once before. I went to live with my parents after. I obsessed about my ex. Then I got medicated.

"Wonderful smart quirky heartwarming romantic tale of love, redemption, + craziness","This really is a great movie- a tour de force by Jennifer Lawrence, who has exploded out of the gate (meatiest woman's role since Mulholland Drive), but Cooper is brilliant too, even DeNiro and Tucker are good, whom I usually find tiring- DeNiro is the most human I've ever seen him as a neurotic superstitious compulsive bookie who has passed on his problems to his son (like Claire's dad in ""Homeland""), and finally makes one forget the Good Fellas' scumbags; + Tucker doesn't do that gay scream. America's mistreatment of men is manifest- you get sent to loony bin for beating up some guy ravishing your wife in your shower??? Russell truly deserved an Oscar too for writing or directing this very smart, wordy, brilliant script. But it is crazy slutty tough tender erotic glib wounded gamin JL (her cop husband has been killed), who shines in every scene. I didn't want to see a movie about manic-depressive or OCD ""nuts"", my father was the latter, but Cooper and Lawrence are so funny and entertaining, and really admirable, AND Russell slickly tapers down the harrowing wildness (suspiciously so in Lawrence's case- she ain't taking meds?) till you love these people. She obviously was a real dancer (if that wasn't body doubles), and has the rubber physicality and athleticism (like say Jessica Alba) previously evident in Hunger Games, that is very sexy and allows her to morph into different characters and moods.The ending is surprising and really wonderful, and the entire cast, from the lip-biting worried mother, to the stolid brah, to the dubiously patient parole cop, to the football-mad Indian shrink are tremendously likable and appealing. Check this out- for woman it is really romantic; for men it is has sports arcana galore and JL; for business it has the power of positive thinking; for families it displays the infinite value of true loyalty, love, and support; for film buffs it is a superbly crafted and inspirational tale.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Better than I expected,"Normally I do not specifically like this type of movie, but I have to say i'm glad I decided to watch it because it was a really exciting film. The story touched me and I completely forgot about my surroundings.

I knew Bradley Cooper from Limitless and I had to adapt to the role he played here, but after a short while I was fully adapted. Jennifer Lawrence was also a familiar face. I met her in the Hunger Games. At first I missed Katniss a little bit, but it turned out there was an awesome character replacing her: Tiffany.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Disappointing,"Started off on fairly interestingly, then devolved into a completely generic rom-com. The idea that true (or passing) love cures mental illness was a joke. (The premise worked better in the far superior A Beautiful Mind, where the main character at least reasoned his way to a more believable kind of sanity and stability, even if that's not really what happened to the real person.)I do not get all the fuss over this movie. Jennifer Lawrence was good but I was disappointed it had such a pat, Hollywood ending that wrapped up these troubled characters with a big red bow.Don't believe the hype: This is just standard Hollywood fluff.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Look for the silver lining,"Author James Redfield said, ""The challenge is to find the silver lining in every event, no matter how negative,"" but, as French author George Bernanos has pointed out, ""one can encounter optimism everywhere – even at the bottom of a bottle."" He said, however, that ""hope is a risk that must be run. It is the risk of all risks"" David O. Russell invites us to take that risk in his offbeat comedy Silver Linings Playbook and it pays off. Based on the 2008 novel by Matthew Quick, the film tells the story of two people who struggle to help each other out of the emotional hole they have dug for themselves and, like David and Lisa and the recent Rust and Bone, demonstrates that the affection people have for each other can begin to break through the limitations caused by their distress.Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper), a former substitute teacher, is an optimist who looks for the silver linings in life, believing that things happen for a reason. His motto ""excelsior"" does not, however, lead him ""ever upward,"" (except when he takes too many meds) but he believes that it helps him to maintain an even keel. Having just been released from a Baltimore psychiatric facility where he was diagnosed as bipolar, partially as a result of a violent incident involving his wife Nikki (Brea Bee), Pat tells his family, mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) and father Pat Sr. (Robert de Niro) that he is ""solid,"" but as Bernanos has stated, ""a health bulletin is only worth something if it is signed by a doctor, not by the patient."" Pat's tendency to emotional outbursts surfaces again in the office of his therapist Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher) when he hears the song that was played at his wedding, a so-called test by his doctor to gauge the limits of his control which, as the incident reveals is low to non-existent. Not that there is any connection, of course, but his father is no stranger to inappropriate displays of emotion, having been banned from attending home games of the pro-football Philadelphia Eagles because of his violence at the stadium in support of his team. Dad, who is now a bookie, (generally illegal in the United States), has the idea that father-son bonding involves having his son watch football games with him at home every Sunday, but it never seems to work out quite as planned.When Pat bursts into his parent's room at 4:00 a.m. ranting about the failure of Ernest Hemingway's novel, A Farewell to Arms, to provide the reader with a happy ending, flinging the book through a bedroom window, it tends to reinforce the idea in his parent's mind that he is not as solid as he thinks. Pat wants very much to reunite with his wife Nikki, but there is only one problem – she has taken out a restraining order against him which kind of mucks up his plans. He remains unyielding about this, however, even after he is introduced to and establishes a connection with the much younger Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence in an Oscar-worthy performance.Though Pat maintains his distance, it is apparent that Tiffany is looking for more than friendship in the relationship. A comrade-in-arms in the mental health department, she has been depressed since her husband was killed in an auto accident and has attempted to compensate by engaging in gratuitous sex in her place of work. Reaching out in friendship, Tiffany agrees to deliver Pat's letter to Nikki in exchange for his agreeing to be her partner in a dance contest, an agreement she does everything in her power to enforce, leading to unforeseen consequences. Backed by a terrific soundtrack that includes music by Alabama Shakes, alt-J, Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash, Rare Earth, and Stevie Wonder, Silver Linings Playbook works because it is funny, genuine, and emotionally satisfying. Though there may be some clichéd moments, it's relatively easy to find the silver lining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"""Like"" this Playbook!","Call me crazy, deranged, maniacal (why not, everybody else does), or whatever you like, but there is no doubt in my complex mind that ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. A 21st Century Masterpiece! Writer-Director David O. Russell has orchestrated a divine, genuine flick about a Philly ""born and bred"" 30ish man who has been released from a mental institution who returns to live with his parents and also battles his bipolar disorder. The man I am referring to is Pat, who was put in the mental institution due to almost beating to death the man who his wife was having an affair with. Pat is still obsessed with his wife and stands pat in focusing on getting her back. Pat's parents are Pat Sr. and Dolores. Pat Sr. cares about his son dearly, but his main bird it seems is the obsession he has with the NFL Football team The Philadelphia Eagles. Dolores is your typical loving mom who primarily cares about comforting and smothering her offsprings. Pat gets introduced with Tiffany, a vivacious Philly gal who also has some mental challenges of her own and is still trying to cope with the death of her husband. The silver lining here is that this brilliant film becomes a utopia odyssey on dealing with broken pasts and adjusting to novice changes. Pat dismisses Tiffany mucho times due to his obsession on reconciling with his wife; but when Tiffany asks Pat to be his partner in a dance competition, the playbook is up and running on how their life readjusts with those moves. Writer-Director David O. Russell's masterpiece works on all levels due to his skillful integration of family, psychology, obsession, regret, love, and so many more authentic aspects of the film that perfects its craftsmanship. Russell's script is on the playbook as the best of the year with so many unforgettable verbiage; and is there a better written-scene in a movie this year when Tiffany is explaining to Pat Sr. that his son Pat Jr. is really a good-luck charm to the Eagles when Pat Jr. spends time with her. Bradley Cooper's starring performance as Pat Jr. is the best of his career, and should be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar; and no I am not hungover. Even without speaking in tongues, Cooper's gaze expresses so much about his character's condition. Jennifer Lawrence has just catapulted as my favorite young actress working today with her exceptional performance as Tiffany. Robert DeNiro is back baby! Yes, I am talking to you! His lively performance as Pat. Sr. is vintage DeNiro and is line for a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Jacki Weaver showed that her Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for ""Animal Kingdom"" was no fluke, and is in the kingdom of exemplary thespian talent. It was also great to see Chris Tucker return to form with his charismatic supporting performance as Pat's friend from the mental institution. The game plan for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" was executed to the max, and hopefully is in line for many Oscar nominations. So get your entertainment playbook in gear, and schedule a visit to the ""Silver Linings Playbook"". ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

The best movie about mental illness I've ever seen!  Jennifer Lawrence has never been hotter!,"'SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK': Five Stars (Out of Five)This critical darling and Oscar hopeful just picked up eight Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing and nominations in all four acting categories (which is the first time this feat has been accomplished since 1981's 'RED')! Being a huge fan of Jennifer Lawrence (she's my favorite actress and top celebrity crush), as well as the writer/director David O. Russell, I had been very eager to see this film since it went into limited release in mid-November (and even before that after watching the amazing trailers) but it still hasn't come to any cities near me and I had to drive 40 miles to the closest one playing it just to finally see it. I know the studio has been waiting to fully release it so it could build bigger business off of word of mouth and Oscar nominations but the buzz is already here! So I finally saw it in Salem, OR and it was totally worth it. It lived up to my expectations in every way and is my favorite film of 2012!In the film Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper plays a former teacher, named Pat Solitano, who suffered a mental breakdown after catching his wife Nikki (Brea Bee) cheating on him with a fellow teacher. He spent eight months in a mental institution as part of a plea bargain for beating the man nearly to death. While there he learned that he's bipolar and has been suffering from the disease all of his life. His father, Pat Sr. (Oscar nominee Robert De. Niro), has suffered from violent mental breakdowns and OCD his whole life as well, he's also a sports nut who believes in superstitions that will help his team, The Eagles, win their games. Pat's mom, Dolores (Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver), takes Pat out of the institution when his committed time is done and brings him home to live with her and his father. Pat learns that Nikki left him, sold their house and filed a restraining order against him (out of physical fear) but he's so obsessed with getting her back that he begins stalking her (which is played off as kind of harmless in the film due to Cooper's good looks I think; looks prejudice once again). Then he meets a girl named Tiffany (Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence, who's never been hotter or more stunning) who's just as down on her luck (her husband recently died) and is almost as crazy as he is. She, like Pat, just lost her job as well due to a recent sex obsession and the fact that she slept with all her co-workers. The two immediately take a liking to each other but Pat fears what this may mean to him and his love for Nikki. Tiffany has been wanting to compete in a dance competition and needs a partner so they both use each other (in a way) as Tiffany agrees to get a message to Nikki for Pat. Things only get more complicated from there. Chris Tucker also co-stars as Pat's buddy from the psychiatric ward. It's his first film appearance since 2007's 'RUSH HOUR 3' and his first non 'RUSH HOUR' film since 1997's 'JACKIE BROWN' (which also co-starred Robert De Niro)! His part is minimal but funny.The movie is a brilliant character study and the best movie about mental illness I've ever seen! I've had multiple family members suffer from depression and I've experienced it a little myself, as well as other mental issues, so the film was really relatable to me. I also love movies about outsiders and unique individuals who are brave enough to be themselves. Both Pat and Tiffany are brutally honest and not afraid to say what they really feel and like the Pat character says in the movie 'maybe they see things that other people don't'. I was just blown away by the characters and totally involved in what happened to them. All of the performances were outstanding; of course my favorite being Jennifer Lawrence but deservingly so. She's totally beautiful and sexy and maybe too much of a guy's ideal woman in this movie but she's also very confident and self dependent (like almost every character she plays). Her character also has the perfect touch of vulnerability, insecurity and mental instability that really make you feel for her as well. A lot of the biggest A list actresses in Hollywood wanted this role (most notably Angelina Jolie) but Lawrence nabbed it. Partially because she's so popular right now, probably the biggest star in Hollywood (like Julia Roberts in her prime after 'PRETTY WOMAN', and the same age, but about five times as talented) but also because she was the only actress that could play this part that well. Jacki Weaver is amazing too; she says very little but at the same time says so much with just her emotions and facial expressions. You can't not love a mom like the one she plays in this movie. Robet De Niro gives one of his best performances in years and is so complex and interesting that I would have loved to have seen a movie just about his character alone. Bradley Cooper gives by far the best performance of his career (as well as one of the best performances of the year) and is the perfect match for Jennifer Lawrence. Despite their more than fifteen years age difference the two have beautiful chemistry together and that's the driving force behind the whole movie. Of course the film would be nothing without David O. Russell's amazing directing and brilliant script. The man is a genius filmmaker and the movie deserves all the award recognition it's been getting. I'm so passionate about film and the characters depicted in them that when one really moves me it's almost like a religious experience.

Uninteresting enough,"This story of a man diagnosed as bipolar and released from psychiatric internment at a state institution after a few months there which led him to lose his job as teacher and his wife is rather uninteresting though the movie is well made, directed and acted.

Then he's got the obsession of recovering job and wife and tries do do it by somewhat awkward means. In the course of this he meets a woman with some psychological troubles also with whom he starts a supposedly friendly relationship since she apparently tries to help him to fulfill his aims.

Plot problems. Why do the cops instantly turn up?,"What a great story. Diseased however, by the plot dictating the characters actions, instead of the plot manifesting from the characters. It really seemed like as soon as the main character did anything wrong, the police showed up. There seems to be a theme pattern in movies today that portray a character's wrong doing by immediately showing the punishment for the action. This falls short of realism and destroys the credibility of a what looked like a fantastic movie. I think it is possible that cops do not have to turn up every time something emotional happens.

"You know, it's something different..","Let's establish two things before I review this title:1. Yes I'm watching the movie two years after it released worldwide2. No I did not know its based on a novel until I saw the credits roll and I still haven't read the bookWell now that we've established this much (and you've decided whether reading this review is worth your time or not), let's jump right in.Silver Linings Playbook is about a former teacher Pat Solitano who moves back in with his parents after a brief stint in a mental institution, and tries to reconcile things with his ex-wife. Tiffany comes in somewhere along the way and things get complicated for good ol' Pat. You know if you're reading the summary for the first time and you haven't seen the movie, I guess you'll have pretty much the same reaction as I did; what's so great about this movie? It just sounds too bland! Is it the power cast that fuels such a rating or can there actually be a good story here?The answer is a bit of both. Bradley Cooper doesn't quite fit into his role so easily like how I do into my 40 inch waistline pajamas but he still does a good job. You want to see his character evolve because he comes out of the institution in a certain mental state and you expect that to change naturally in some way but then he overdoes it towards the end and that can be putting off; you don't radically change overnight, it's not quite possible. The more finer tuned performances were Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver who do a splendid job as Pat's folks. Their roles don't work best together but apart in those singular scenes as father to son or mom to son; that's beautiful drama right there. Moving on to Jennifer Lawrence, I really enjoyed her character in the movie and I found she played her role quite brilliantly. The rest of the supporting cast did a wonderful job as well especially Dash Mihok (read the wacko brother from Ray Donovan) who sort of just made me laugh every time he came on scene.On to the story line, I did find it to be something different. I mean the outcome is sort of realized mid-way and/or after, but the movie is shot in such a way that it leaves you guessing as to how things might turn out for Pat. It's that beautiful combination of comedy and drama which leads to this sort of thinking. However I did find the story line to drag a bit every now and then; it could have been to lay more ground work and give us more insight as to how Pat thinks and reacts in situations. But again the simplicity of the story makes it a good movie to just sit back, relax and enjoy. It's for those quiet nights when you're by yourself or with that special someone and you just want to watch a simple yet beautiful drama.So go on ahead and rent this one, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

It was very funny; definitely a must-see for fans of romantic comedies,"Yesterday, my friends and me went to the cinema and chose Silver Linings to watch. We all had no real idea what this movie was about except for being fans of both lead actors. What I remember from the movie today is that it was extremely funny, the acting was good but it was not one of the best movies I've seen.The movie is using so many clichés and the typical ending. But still, the direct dialogs/discussions make it somehow special. OK, I didn't get the purpose of Chris Tucker (I guess it was only for the fun moments); him being such a stalker was more scaring than romantic; some parts where they talk was a tad too long and in comparison, the ending seemed rushed.

THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THE (CRAZY) LIFE,"Silver Linings Playbook is a milestone in cinema about people with mental health problems. Usually seen as dangerous (as in Hitchcock's Psycho) or funny (Levinson's Rain Man), people with mental disorders end up losing control of their bodies and are treated apart, trapped or overprotected as it happens in real life.David O. Russell's movie attempts, and succeeds in a different way, to turn the dramas of two ""troublesome"" people into a romantic comedy.Handsome, athletic, and confident, Pat (Bradley Cooper) manages to be released from a mentally ill hospital where he remained for eight months after beating his wife's lover and still has a restraining order from her. Diagnosed as bipolar, he returns to his parents' home under the responsibility of his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver).The boy's father, Pat Sr., masterfully portrayed by Robert De Niro, also cannot be considered completely sane: stuck in a restaurant project, but unemployed, lives on bookmaking mainly football games, having an irrational passion for Philadelphia Eagles team, which is why he was banned from the stadium for fighting. Standing in front of the TV, he is convinced that a series of superstitious rituals can alter the outcome of the games.The entry of Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence, fantastic), a young widow who lives in the neighborhood, represents a balance in the plot not because she is understanding and welcoming Pat, but precisely because she seems to be as crazy as he is. During a discussion, they pass in front of a restaurant and, seeing the sign Dines, he invites the girl:Do you want to have dinner with me? - and she, with a face of hate, responds:Pick me up at seven-thirty.Together, they comment on the effects of the various anti-anxiety and antipsychotics meds, and indulge in a ballroom dance project, which will be the movie's great climax: they will try to win a good position and still defend Pat Miller's ultimate bet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Is it a good movie? Yes. Is it Oscars good? Not even close.,"In essence, Silver Linings Playbook was a good movie. The actors were good, the script was good... But really, that's all it was. It didn't move me to tears, or even any sort of heightened emotional plane. It just.. was.I thought by not seeing the trailer I would avoid over-hyping and then being disappointed later on, but alas, this was not the case. The rather lacklustre trailer pretty much echoed the film in its entirety.First of all, I'm baffled as to why the movie is even called Silver Linings Playbook. He mentions Silver Linings a handful of times.. And doesn't speak anything of a playbook. So. That confused me. I at least thought it might have been about writing down his ""Silver Linings"" moments, but no. Even the notion or symbolic nature of a playbook or anything wasn't even present... So whatever. It was just him muttering about it now and then. If anything the film should have been called ""Excelsior"".The acting was good. Bradley Cooper went further than he has before and Jennifer Lawrence was consistent as usual. Their performances were good, and the whole cast was too, as a whole. But did any of them really move me? Make a connection with me? No. Honestly, the best cast members were the supporting roles, and I was left feeling underwhelmed by the leads. The only one that came close to being interesting and who really BECAME his character was Robert De Niro. In my opinion, that's the only Oscar the film deserves - his supporting.Also, as an editor I find it ridiculous that this film is even considered for an Editing Oscar. The editing is alright, but nothing to write home about. There were multiple continuity errors that took me out of the moment.The story, apart from being a bit confusing in terms of the whole silver linings/excelsior stuff and a few plot points that fizzled into nothing, was good. It was a sweet and simple, touching story. The ending was a bit rushed and lame (I would have preferred it to have just ended at the concert at the end), but eh.Also, as someone with mental health problems, I did expect to have more of a connection with the film. Alas, I didn't.All in all, I did enjoy it. But would I see it again? Probably not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

disappointing,"I had high hopes for this movie but was very disappointed. If the issue of mental illness is supposed to be one of the central themes of the film, why couldn't the production staff figure out something simple such as the pronunciation of the drug Trazadone? The drug is not pronounced TRAY-ZO-DONE but TRAAZ-A-DONE. I would expect a large budget film to have some fact-checking in place.Secondly, the mental illness theme was never fleshed out. The Bradley Cooper character appeared to have a temper but no real mental illness. Jennifer Lawrence was slightly quirky but no more unusual than a typical young adult.Comning from a family with bipolar and unipolar depression and borderline personalities, I have an idea of what mental illness looks like and this was not it.Lastly, the film was trying too hard to be too many things. Was it a romantic comedy or a drama or something else? Disappointing movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Very good,Probably one of the best movies I've seen.Things I liked:the cast; great amazing chemistry between Jennifer and Bradley-the acting due to the castthe humor; just so everyday not trying tk be anything very naturalthe storyline; I expected the ending just In a very different way so kinda surprised me but not at the same timethe dancing; very cutethe mental health issue being discussedJust a great movie could have diversified the cast a bit more but that's my only issue.,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A talented failure,"Strong points first. The film is a re-casting of the Rocky story. With a background in working-class Philadelphia, it deploys football and betting as substitute imagery. A strong cast makes the most of their witty and oddball lines; dialogue is contemporary and properly self-conscious and often very funny. Excellent cast and casting add production value. The film starts strongly and concentrates on details of character. A usable story line brings it all together, if rather predictably. Weak points next. This film is ostensibly about a father and son; in reality, it's about their women. That's because the writers know next to nothing about the male mind, ethos, or condition. This is a film written and produced from a male-feminist mindset. The football imagery is overdone, thudding, artificial, and excruciatingly cliché. The film is somebody's clever conceit, not a viable concept. The betting imagery is overwrought and far too clever to ever work. There isn't a female character in the story who isn't strong and wise, fragile, but unbreakable. There isn't a male character who isn't chatty, kooky, dependent, self-absorbed, foolish, aggressive, brutal, or just plain dull. The men couldn't survive 10 seconds without their gals, or without dreaming about them. In the end, the conceit gets tiresome and insulting to the audience. A film destined for Gender Studies and social edification.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Best chick-flick!,"I am not a fan of chick-flicks... as a matter of fact I avoid them at all costs, but saw this in exchange for my girl agreeing to see one of my action films.I have to say, I was impressed! Director David O. Russell did an excellent job keeping the viewer interested all along, but the main reason this film kept me wanting more, were the performances and chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. I don't think any other actors would have kept my interest. Add Robert De Niro into this mix, and you have a winner!It's a well deserved 8/10 from me!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"You say ""Tray-zo-done,"" I say ""Tra-zo-done""...","As nearly as I can figure, Harvey Miramax likes his movies to start out all edgy and unconventional, as long as they turn into feel-good fantasies by the end, and David O. Russell likes raucous ensemble comedies with everybody yelling and shvitzing and running his program. Russell must've loved the idea of a compulsive father and a bipolar son under the same roof, and De Niro's OCD bookie dad more than earns his keep, but son Pat, the film's protagonist, is kind of a misconceived character, and Bradley Cooper struggles to make him seem like more than just a screenwriter's sock puppet.Bipolar or not, Pat's a mixed-up, messed-up guy who's had to whittle things down to a few basic concepts, which works okay as a survival strategy, but tends to make everything he does and says seem selfish and simple-minded--for reasons too ludicrous to go into, e.g., he has a late-night meltdown when he finds out that Hemingway's ""A Farewell to Arms"" doesn't have a happy ending. Aussie actress Jackie Cooper is great as Pat's underprotective mother, and Jennifer Lawrence is a powerful presence in the manic pixie (or, if you prefer, the depressive freakazoid) dreamgirl role, though her big scene, which takes place in De Niro's crowded living room, gets ruined by excessive mugging and stagy ad libbing by the supporting cast.I'm emphasizing the negatives here because this multiple Oscar-nominated movie is really a pretty decent mainstream romantic comedy; it loses some momentum before the big finale, in typical romcom fashion, and really only deals with the subject of mental illness in a very skittish and sitcommy way. I would have liked it a lot better if I hadn't been led to expect something more insightful and original.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"One of the best Romantic, Comedy movie I have ever seen.","This movie is great. Bradly Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence with Robert De Niro was perfect combination and their acting was top of their game.

A Sound Tale of Unsound Characters.,"A sound tale of two unsound characters, Silver Linings Playbook is a tightly structured & wonderfully scripted film by David O. Russell which manages to work on the better side of the silver lining between predictably boring & predictably interesting and the one thing which made sure that happens is the overall performances by its entire cast.The story concerns a former school teacher named Pat who, after his stint at a medical institution, moves back in with his parents in their Philadelphia home and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife & get his life back. But all his plans soon go for a toss when he meets Tiffany, a girl with problems of her own, as the two embark on a love/hate friendship based solely on their own selfish reasons.David O. Russell's direction smoothly covers the evolution of its two lead characters & the film presents a fine balance between its elements of comedy, drama & romance. Although everyone has finely contributed in the acting department, the most impressive work comes from Bradley Cooper & Jennifer Lawrence in what is arguably the finest performances of their careers, so far.Predictable yet interesting, hilarious yet dramatically moving & presented in fragments yet managing to remain quite stable throughout its runtime, Silver Linings Playbook is a delightful rom-com that's nicely directed, lively scripted, elegantly composed & energetically performed by its cast & crew to deliver an entertainment worthy of your time & money.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Very good movie starring  the lovely Bradley Cooper,"Silver Linings Playbook is a novel based on the same name and tells the story of a young man named Pat (played by Bradley Cooper from the Hangover) who suffers from Bipolar Disorder and is released from the Mental ward along with his friend(played by Rush Hour's Chris Tucker) who wasn't suppose to come out at all yet as they both bailed out. Pat lives with his mother and father(played by Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver)and he is very optimistic that his wife will reconcile with him as she left him,and his job got the sack along with everything else he had. But one night when Pat is invited to a party in another friend of his house who is married(played by Julia Stiles from Save The Last Dance),he meets a bad-mouthed cynical young woman named Tiffany(played by Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawerence) who's husband died in a freak accident and she's got a lot of problems to deal with since his death.They both make a deal that if Pat helps Tiffany with the dance rehearsals she will help him get back with his wife by giving him a letter, but did Pat's wife really sent that letter to him and how will his relationship with Tiffany(who he later falls for in the movie)get on?Overall this Oscar Winning movie is very good as it was my first time last night to watch it as I got the DVD of it and quite frankly i think Bradley Cooper SHOULD have won an Oscar for his performance as the mentally young man who swears,and throws tantrums like a child and whenever he hears a certain song it triggers him and he loses his temper whenever he hears it playing. Jennifer Lawrence was also good as the slightly delusional young woman who has a bad temper and a foul mouth.Overall it was a good movie and if you love Bradley Cooper than check it out.Final rating its a 8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Doesn't Bear Scrutiny,Life/people are complicated and this movie portrays that brilliantly. But it is at times static and then bamboozles its audience with sports betting jargon and then loses me with superstition and finally a pat ending that hides any worries we might have about the characters' future. And didn't we all guess that Pat knew what he reveals at the end? Performances are great. Pity the movie doesn't bear scrutiny.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Why is this nominated for Oscars?,"How this film has got such high reviews I do not know! This is a laughable attempt at depicting mental illness, Bradley coopers role as a person suffering from bipolar disorder is probably one of the worst representations of someone suffering from a mental health issue that I have ever seen. The film is so predictable that i didn't even finish watching it as i was so bored, but willing to bet that i can guess how it ended. Do not waste you time or money watching this film. This film actually makes me want to sue David o Russell for wasting 1.30 hrs of my life that I will never get back.

Refreshing take on Rom coms,"Honestly i started to watch this movie just for the cast. The movie starts off with Pat being released from the mental institution and the first thirty minutes give u an impression of there is no where near a rom com. But as you get into the complexities of the characters of Tiffany and Pat, you just get involved. Thanks to terrific performance from Jennifer Lawrence who carried the multi dimensionality of Tiffany's character with atmost perfection. The movie donesnt have any cheesy lines or the leads holding hands and watching stars. It's just two up individuals who help each other to get better. Not to mention Robert deniro gave a stellar performance as Pat Sr. The movie is near perfect and a good watch for one time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Another Movie that Glorifies Screwed up Hollywood Values,"This film had talented actors and a compelling story, but it ultimately validates the very dysfunction that caused such unhappiness in these characters to begin with. The film suggests that it's no big deal to forge a letter, lie to people you love to coerce them into doing what you want, and more. (Avoiding spoilers) In fact, it glorifies dysfunction and then suggests that more dysfunction is the way to ""heal"" and/or help a person. Huh?How come the characters are perfectly fine with being lied to and betrayed? (They would likely have greater difficulty trusting others than most.) Answer? Screwed up Hollywood values. How sad that cultural rot is the cornerstone of pop culture today, and the measure of what is considered to be ""cool."" This image of America is what is exported to the rest of the world.Hopefully, kids will find out through experience, (Since the media teaches them the opposite) that honesty, accountability and personal responsibility aren't old-fashioned, but fundamental to living a happy and fulfilled life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
I have experienced life with people like these.......,"and I found the movie to be straight forward and honest. I think Jennifer Lawrence was amazing. Of the three leading movies I have seen this year, Lincoln, Les Mis and Silver Linings Playbook, I enjoyed Silver Linings the most. And now because I have to fill in ten lines for this to be posted I will now just put in words. This requirement is stupid. It is like making you say more than necessary to get the point across.

"Cooper Outacts DeNiro in Grating, Sometimes Endearing Film","""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a grating, occasionally endearing and humorous portrait of a bipolar misfit attempting to create a livable life after his release from a court-mandated stay in a mental institution. Pat (Bradley Cooper) chases his wife, unseen for most of the film. She has a fulltime job as a high school English teacher. Pat has no job and lives in his parents' attic. His parents, Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver (whom I thought was Sally Struthers) are themselves no prize winners. Dad is an obsessive compulsive football fan and gambler who insists that his son Pat must sit next to him during games while holding a green handkerchief in order for his team, the Philadelphia Eagles, to win. Mom cooks and whines a lot.Pat meets Tiffany, a very, very hot young widow. She falls in love with him at first sight, but he resists her, because he wants to get back with his wife.The best reason to see this film is Bradley Cooper's performance. He is terrific as a man with limited cards playing them the best way he knows how, given his limited awareness, abilities and options. Your heart aches for him. He often behaves in outrageous, indeed, illegal ways, but his insanity is an expression of real sanity in a couple of scenes. He vehemently rejects Ernest Hemingway's decisions in ""Farewell to Arms"" and he rescues his brother from racist thugs.The movie as a whole failed to take flight for me. I found the main characters to be too grating, and I needed a respite or an artistic intervention that would make their qualities more bearable. There was an opportunity for that. Tiffany is a dancer, and she and Pat train to compete in a dance contest. After lengthy, detailed scenes of ugly, irrational and loud familial manipulations, false hope, and dysfunction, I could have used some well-presented music and dance. The director doesn't take advantage of that, though, and the film just squats there, annoying the audience. The film's end is less a resolution and more of a ""we're out of time here so let's wrap things up.""Jennifer Lawrence is spectacularly beautiful, and very young. She's fifteen years younger than Cooper and far too young to be convincing as a grieving widow. She is costumed in skintight leggings and bratops that emphasize her long, slim legs and considerable frontal and posterior assets. Her skin is flawless.I could did not, for one second, believe this vision of health and loveliness to be a desperate, medicated, marginal, screwed up, nymphomaniac widow. I believed her to be exactly what she was – eye candy positioned to keep male viewers' eyes on the screen, no less than a playboy bunny or a cheerleader. A woman closer to Cooper's age, a woman who shows the knocks that life can leave on a person (as scruffy Cooper does) would have been more believable but less commercial. Given the very commercial choice to go with a gorgeous young woman and to parade her assets in every scene, the movie seemed less true, less daring than it thinks of itself as being.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Bradley Cooper is officially an actor.,"Bradley Cooper is officially one of my favorite actors after watching this film. No, seriously. I've liked his movies, like the Hangover and the A-team and The Words. But this movie- this movie brought out the best of his talent. The story centers around Pat, who was just released from a mental institution after a major breakdown when he found his wife cheating on him. He moves back in with his parents on the thought that he was destined to get back together with his wife, who - evidently has a restraining order against him. It's a challenge for him, dealing with his newly diagnosed bipolar disorder and his OCD father who will bet everything on the Eagles winning a football game.But then he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), the sister of one of Pat's friend's wife. Tiffany is probably just as screwed up as he is. She's a broken, lost girl who doesn't care what anyone thinks of her but knows a lot about living. The two form an unlikely friendship, and though they each have problems of their own, you know instantly that they'll be perfect for each other.There was something about this movie that stayed with me after I finished watching it. I'm still not quite sure what it was. Perhaps it was the strong performances of Lawrence and Cooper that made me realize how good of a movie it was. Perhaps it was the storyline and the characters that were so ridiculously troubled that you couldn't help but cheer for them the entire way through. Lawrence's performance was spectacular, and I have a feeling she will become quite an actress in the years to come. But it was Cooper's performance that took me by surprise. As he's known mostly for his comedic roles, Cooper's dramatic role was superb. He stole each scene, and you could tell he loved playing this character.The pacing of this film was excellent, not a dull moment in the entire movie. The supporting characters were wonderful, especially Robert DeNiro, who played Pat's OCD father. The script was fantastic, perfectly written and the dialogue was genius.This is one of those rare gems, where people have heard about but don't really know what it's about. After watching this movie, Cooper and Lawrence definitely have to take home the Oscar. If not both, than definitely Cooper.I will probably own this movie when it comes out on DVD, I loved it that much.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
What's the fuss about it?,"Okay! So SLP has emotions, amazing performances, wonderful story and screenplay and some fresh writing... but I give it a 7 and it cannot beat my favorite rom-com this year, Moonrise Kingdom!.

Slightly Disappointed,"I finished reading the book, got up from my chair and drove to the theater to see the movie. That was a mistake. It's true, you should never read the book before you see the movie. I liked the book so much more than the movie, and felt a little disappointed. I have to say here that I am a life long resident of the suburbs of Philadelphia and am an Eagles fan, not quite as obsessed a fan as the family in the movie, but I do occasionally wear my Eagles jersey on game day, and they drive me crazy just as they did the family in the movie. I related to the author's story on every level. DeNiro's portrayal of the father was completely opposite to the father in the book, where I felt, Pat, the main character, was longing for his wife's love as well as his father's something the movie just didn't capture. As I read, I kept feeling I just wanted to hug him. Of course, I felt the same way about Bradley Cooper, but for very different reasons....oh, those blue eyes! He probably does deserve an Oscar nomination. The street scenes had an unreal quality about them I didn't like, kind of like the movie was filmed on a movie set. The best scene was the dance contest. I would recommend the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Great disappointment. Not at all like the book.,"It is unfair towards the book, Silver Linings Playbook, to call this movie by the same name.

The story had been edited to suit the needs of the mainstream, superficial movie goer.The movie is predictable whereas the book isn't at all. The movie is devoid of any deep, real feelings, whereas the book is filled with it. The movie is more suitable for extroverts and the book more suitable for introverts.

I do this! Time after time after time! I do all this shite for other people! And then I wake up and I'm empty! I have nothing!,"Pat (Bradley Cooper) is Bipolar. It is evident in his constant manic state. I never see the deep depression that accompanies the diagnosis, so maybe he is just manic. Unfortunately, he is off his meds, and trying to solve the problem on his own. Really stupid. He is so deluded that it is not even funny. Is this supposed to be a comedy?He attends sessions with a therapist (Anupam Kher), but it is a waste of time due to the fact that he is not taking his meds. So, how long is it going to be before he is back in the hospital or jail?In comes Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), the best part about this movie. She may be a little crazy, but she is doing the best thing possible for Pat. She has him committed and focused. I think it is a little unrealistic, but there is a point where he does say he is back on his meds, so maybe it was just the script.His parents, Pat Sr. and Dolores (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver), show that the apple doesn't really fall far from the tree.

"A complex romantic tale about real, complex people and families.","The only thing Silver Linings Playbook suffers from is a case of a studio not knowing exactly how to market it. The marketing lead me (and others, judging by the mostly female audience in the theater) to believe this was just north of a rom com chick flick. The only reason I went to see it was because I couldn't believe that David O. Russell, notorious nutbag director of The Fighter, Three Kings and I ♥ Huckabees would make a rom com chick flick. I was right. This is a funny, painful, heartbreaking, heartwarming, complex romantic tale about real, complex people and families.

an interesting and unique romance / drama,"Things that were well done: 1. Well acted by all involved. no bad performances and as you have probably heard the two leads (ecspecially Jennifer Lawrence) were very impressive. 2. Well directed...the way the film was shot had no flaws unlike some movies that fail to capture emotion where it does exist, instead it makes you believe what is happening is real because it doesn't try to overpower the content or hide behind it, just let's it do it's thing. 3. Works well as a romance; i would say this movie is one of the better romances out there, but that is because there aren't very many good ones, mostly inaccesible to guys entirely, but this one works from both the perspectives and has a decent emotional payout at the end and you realise that most of the screen time was working towards it.Things that were badly done: 1. Badly written. in my opinion the only problem with this film comes out of it's attempt at showing the lives of people with certain mental instability. it fails at this not because of the dialog or actual events that occur, but rather it does not succeed in taking us inside the mind of the lead (Bradley Cooper) because it doesn't show enough flashbacks/ weird thoughts he would be thinking instead of listening to other people's voices... but also it doesn't take the route of trying to be objective and shooting as if it was a documentary that you can either choose to take a side in or not, because it doesn't film from angles and zoom levels that suggest being impartial to the characters.a better than average film with a unique storyline that is worth watching just for the great performances but also for a decent romantic pay out at the end.7/10m0n5tercat",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

My favorite Comedy,"After finding out about this movie months ago I had to wait for it to come out here in the Netherlands. Luckily this almost coincided with the Oscars. I've become a big fan of Jennifer Lawrence after seeing her good performances in Winter's Bone and the Hunger Games and was keen to see her in this movie.In my humble opinion, this was a deserved win for Jennifer Lawrence in the category Actress in a Leading Role. She portrays the character Tiffany in a fun way. My only concern before seeing the movie was that she might made it too funny, in a way making fun of bipolar. While that was a small concern seeing the director David O. Russel has experienced Bipolar in his family and knows how to handle this subject. you do have to be subtle when basing a movie on a delicate matter. Fortunately, none of this happened and the movie turned out to be a delight.First off, the acting. The acting in this movie is of good quality. It's not extremely good, but it's definitely viable. Robert de Niro plays a fun role playing the Football-addicted father of Bradley Coopers character. Bradley Coopers character is portrayed in a good way. His reactions to certain situations or sounds are fun to see. While I liked his acting in this movie it's not sublime and i'm happy to see he got nominated for an Oscar for this role. Jennifer Lawrence takes the lead for me though, with a very good performance in this movie. As I said before, a deserved Oscar winner. The dialogs between Pat and Tiffany(Bradley and Jennifer) are a lot of fun to watch. Their chemistry in this movie is exciting and you can tell they had a lot of fun making this movie.The story is good. Comedies tend to be a tad predictable, what this movie is too at points but with a comedy it's about the quality of the humor. This movie made me laugh a lot, so it's definitely of good quality when it comes to the humor.Definitely a recommendation from me if you want to see a fun movie that will make you laugh.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Urban neurotics,"Cooper is almost believable as some kind of crazy-eyed (though functional) neurotic, with an unpredictable demeanour whose quest to win back his estranged wife detours in an unexpected direction when he seeks to exploit her recently widowed sister to 'broker' the reconciliation. As the two spend more time in each other's company, a mutual attraction blossoms and while it's a predictable outcome, it's not without moments of endearment.The concept is fine and some of the whacky characterisations are stand- outs (Chris Tucker in particular), but I found the dialogue at times seemed too sophisticated, or perhaps self-indulgent, like a poor-man's Woody Allen movie where everyone exhibited a varying degree of neuroticism and always had something prophetic to announce with just the right sense of timing. Jennifer Lawrence is clearly a capable actress, confident and sultry, but at times I felt she in particular suffered most from the self-aware dialogue and it made her character uneven as a result.There are some quirky characterisations in both Tucker and Wigham's roles, and while DeNiro's presence elevates the prestige of an otherwise small-scale movie as a middle-class Jewish, sport-loving patriarch, I still felt the material was well beneath his capabilities – more subtlety on the page was desperately needed at times. Weaver's part as the seemingly docile, traditional-domesticated wife I just couldn't grasp – the erratic accent and a role so minor I was struggling to comprehend why all the hyperventilating concerning her portrayal; how she'd scored an Oscar nomination for such an innocuous performance eludes me.Despite my criticisms, it's still very watchable and not without genuine interest, just not what I would label a great film worthy of the plaudits it garnered on its premiere; one of those films where some of the individual components display more promise than the overall result actually achieves. In short, it's a good movie but not a great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"Warm and easy to like, with an appropriate title","David O'Russell is a filmmaker who is no stranger to the Oscars. His 2010 boxing drama 'The Fighter' garnered seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, and also managed to deservedly win two acting awards. Now, his most current film 'Silver Linings Playbook' has been nominated for an impressive total of eight, including the two highest honours, as well as receiving a nom in each of the four acting categories, becoming the first film do so since Warren Beatty's 'Reds' in 1981. But the question on the lips of many is ""does it really deserve to feature so strongly at this year's Oscars?"" Yes and no, frankly.That's not to say that there's anything particularly bad about 'Silver Linings', it's perfectly fine, but is it the type of film that could viewed as being on even footing with some of the other Best Picture contenders? It's questionable, but as far as I'm concerned, I don't think so. Diluted down to its bare factors, it is essentially a feel- good romantic drama, which uses football as an instigator for father/son bonding in the way only an American movie could and depicts how people can manage to triumph over mental illness, in a manner that teeters into over-sentimentality. It isn't really anything you haven't seen before and becomes more predictable as the narrative progresses. Cooper's character is a teacher who has been released from a mental institution for nearly beating a fellow staff member to death, but we only get brief snatches of this as David O'Russell doesn't delve into the darker side of mental illness and instead softens any edges presenting us with an unashamed crowdpleaser, but this is something that is largely unforgivable as the film is ultimately rather charming.However, don't get the notion that this is some sickly saccharine inspirational tale the like of which have become all the common, because this is a film which manages to narrowly avoid such territory and also has a rather appropriate title. Amidst the predictability of the story, we are offered a silver lining in the form of the film's acting. Bradley Cooper plays Pat Solitano Jr., the man readjusting to life after a stint in a Baltimore mental institution, and while he might not be one of the greatest actors of all time, he induces his character with a certain zest and charisma that even the most cynical viewer may struggle to resist. Jennifer Lawrence on the other hand, has proved herself to be quite the talented actress in the recent years with films such as 'Winter's Bone' and this little movie called 'The Hunger Games' and here she continues on this winning streak. She's really great as Tiffany, a young woman who bonds with Pat, able to relate to his mental illness. With his role as Pat's dad, Robert DeNiro delivers his finest performance since 'Casino' in 1995, while Jacki Weaver offers fine support as his Pat's mother and Chris Tucker lightens the already-bright mood as a friend of Pat's.'Silver Linings Playbook' is no masterpiece, but it is still a thoroughly enjoyable film and at its best when Lawrence and Cooper are on screen together, especially coming to life in these moments, where I found myself properly caught up in the drama. Elevated by strong performances, it is never less than watchable and always quite likable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

This is probably one of the greatest 'Romantic Comedies' of all time. It's a unique love story for the 21st century, featuring several amazing performances by Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro and Chris Tucker. The writing is really effective - the funny moments are very funny, and the serious moments can be very emotional.

David O'Russell Delivers another great film,"Led by director David O Russell (The Fighter), and delivered by great performances from the Oscar Nominated leads (Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro), Silver Linings Playbook works brilliants.The film skates over issues of mental illness, only starts to get going with the belated introduction of Jennifer Lawrence (about 25 minutes in), and ultimately follows a relatively conventional rom-com flightpath. But there are times when it does something new with the genre — and it does make you care about the protagonists.As great as he is a writer, Russell's direction is as fantastic as always. If there's one thing that can be said, even in his weaker entries, he's always had a knack for extracting terrific performances out of all of his actors. The lead character on paper is only as good as his actor, and Bradley Cooper expresses every believable ache out of Pat Jr. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver are typically strong as his parents, while Chris Tucker works with a nice little comic relief in his brief role.Why the film works besides the directing is the story. It is fascinating seeing Cooper act as a mental patient wondering his way through his everyday life, as well as Jennifer Lawrence playing a mysterious browser. Silvers Lining Playbook is disguised as a rom- com but it is much more than your typical Hollywood fare. You are rooting for the characters in the end, as even though it may be somewhat predictable, the way it all unfolds is worth the watch. ==================================================================== ====== As for a rewatch (07/04/17') Silver Linings Playbook is more fun and entertaining on another viewer. There is more clues and little hints and as an overall watch it really becomes a much better feel to the film.

great film,"movie we are getting this from http://ashare.me/files/vSaGh1358848168.htmlTiffany is another version of the tough bartender and college drop-out in Russell's The Fighter who sets out to rescue the failing boxer from the family that is destroying him. Both are familiar characters in Hollywood comedies, but the fundamentally sensible Tiffany is given a rare depth and pathos by Jennifer Lawrence. She bonds in a complex way with Pat by giving him a pejorative, one-minute summary of Lord of the Flies before throwing it out into the street. This echoes a literally shattering scene earlier on when Pat reads the high school syllabus his wife is currently teaching, is driven crazy by the wilful pessimism of the end of Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms and throws the book through a closed window. Perhaps the message of this strand of the narrative is to carry on with the medication but be careful what you read. The great strength of Russell's writing and direction resides in the way he consistently manages to retain a comic tone without losing touch with the characters' pains and anxieties. There are numerous scenes that in other hands would be as excruciatingly embarrassing on the screen as they would be in real life: a row in a diner, for instance, that spills out into the street on Halloween night and involves a crowd in fancy dress outside a cinema. But Russell involves us so closely in what we're watching that we become emotional participants. And that's because he cares for these people in a wholly unpatronising fashion",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"A Different Kind of a Romcom with Quirkily Effective, Seriocomic Touches","Portraying mental illness on screen usually means you'll see bravura scenes set in an asylum like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", but iconoclastic filmmaker David O. Russell (""The Fighter"") deals with the edges of emotional disequilibrium in this compellingly quirky 2012 dramedy. Based on the same-name 2008 novel by Matthew Quick, this film reminds me a bit of Russell's 1999 dysfunctional family comedy, ""Flirting with Disaster"", as the seriocomically volatile dynamics here are amplified by the central character's precarious psychological state. High school teacher Pat Solitano Jr. is a man with bipolar disorder who has spent eight months in a Baltimore psychiatric hospital for a violent episode caused by seeing his wife Nikki cheating with a fellow teacher. He's released into the care of his parents and determined to win back his estranged wife.As he strives to improve himself, Pat meets Tiffany Maxwell facing her own level of mental instability since becoming widowed, turning to indiscriminate sex with her co-workers, and most recently losing her job. Eventually they strike a deal where she will help him win back his wife if he enters a dance competition with her, both coping with their disorders at the same time. At first, I really didn't buy Bradley Cooper (""The Hangover"") as Solitano since his idea of showing manically obsessive behavior is to speak loudly in a monotone without much nuance, but his performance grew on me as Russell's screenplay had him show more layers to a character that has a hard time eliciting sympathy from anyone much less the audience. At 21, Jennifer Lawrence (""Winter's Bone"") would appear too young to play a sex-addicted cop widow like Tiffany, but she excels with her preternatural ability to convey unforced maturity and conviction without losing touch with the character's deep-seeded vulnerability.Perhaps the film's nicest surprise is Robert De Niro's sterling performance as Pat Sr., his best work in years after the silly shenanigans of the Fockers franchise. Exhibiting his character's obsessive-compulsive disorder in powerful, brief scenes, De Niro vividly shows how the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. Completely submerging her Australian roots in favor of a convincing Mid-Atlantic accent, Jacki Weaver (""Animal Kingdom"") effectively plays the lone voice of sanity as Pat's mother constantly fretting over her son and preparing ""crabby snacks and homemades"" for home viewing of the family's beloved Philadelphia Eagles. As Pat's best friend Danny, a fellow patient constantly escaping from the hospital, motor-mouthed, high-pitched Chris Tucker (""Rush Hour"") is surprisingly good even if his soulful dance moves came across as a convenient plot device. Julia Stiles (""Mona Lisa Smile"") shows up in a smallish role as Tiffany's patronizing, status- conscious sister Veronica. The climax induces the right emotions even if it means the uncertainties in the plot get wrapped up all too neatly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Formulaic Waste,"I'm shocked at the number of glowing reviews this movie has. It was merely another formulaic, predictable rom-com with lazy writing.It started off great, with the potential to be edgy and insightful, and throw some genuine light on mental illness. The first half hour or so contained some great scenes, with a good performance from the two leads, sharp dialogue and some decent commentary on bipolar. But halfway through, it lost all of its wit and vision, abandoning it to descend into yet another unrealistic by-the-numbers rom-com.If that's all you're looking for, then fine. But I was lured into watching it after being misled into thinking that it would be something more. Very disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
The Game of Life in SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK,"Director David O. Russell (Three Kings) has taken Matthew Quick's novel, Silver Linings Playbook, and adapted it for the screen. It is a topic near and dear to him as his own son has bipolar disorder like the lead character. By balancing dramatic situations with comedic overtones, Russell has accomplished a rare feat, an excellent drama with a superior cast that treads the fine line of humor. By making such a delicate subject accessible to the masses, he has made a really entertaining, crowd pleaser.Pat (Bradley Cooper) suffers from bipolar disorder and, following a breakdown over a failed marriage and confinement to a psychiatric facility in Baltimore, has just been released to his parents' care. Now back in Philadelphia and living with his parents, Dolores (Jacki Weaver), his doting mother, and Pat, Sr. (Robert DeNiro), a sports addict, Pat is determined to get his wife back despite a restraining order. He is so obsessed with getting back with his wife that he boils over on occasion with emotional outbursts which threaten to send him back to confinement. When he is not taking his meds or visiting his therapist, he runs in his neighborhood to get into shape in anticipation of repatriating with his wife, or so he thinks. One day he runs into Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), another troubled soul who not only has been widowed recently, but now sleeps with anyone. Their uneasy interactions lead to an unusual offer by Tiffany for him to partner with her in a dance contest in exchange for her being an intermediary and backdoor link to his wife. What follows are the revelations of emotional scars and the realities of finding happiness in the most unlikely places.The cast is excellent, particularly the four lead actors. Lawrence portrays Tiffany as a seemingly naïve, young woman, but she turns out to be a bright, perceptive person who is not afraid to stand toe-to-toe with anyone. DeNiro has not had such a strong role in many years, and he shows just how good he still is. Even Chris Tucker, in an unusual supporting role, registers as Pat's buddy from his psych group.The film is about how people, who are trapped in their own patterns of behavior, are afraid or unable to reach out and take a chance in life. The depictions of mental illness are portrayed with realism. When Pat undergoes mood swings, it can manifest itself as uncontrollable rage brought on by a simple trigger. He has no filter to his reactions and responses which can be quite awkward and downright offensive. Much as Jack Nicholson's character in As Good as It Gets laments if 'this really is as good as it gets', Cooper's Pat tries to find the 'silver lining' in his life.It is interesting to note that virtually every major character in the story has emotional issues in varying degrees. At one point Pat actually thinks Tiffany is crazier than he is. Pat's father, a superstitious gambler and bookie, has his own issues with obsessive-compulsive disorder. His belief that having his son nearby to ensure the Eagles football team a victory, leads to an amusing confrontation with Tiffany.When you have a cast that is this good, you have to look at the director, Russell, who orchestrates like a master conductor. Despite an uneven filmography in his early career, he is rapidly becoming the actors' go-to director. His attention to minor details like the simple act of tying a tie, a quick reaction shot, or hand gesture enriches the texture of a characterization. His recent films (The Fighter) have taken noteworthy, acting ensembles and elicited superior, Oscar worthy performances amid strong story lines. Somewhere, directing legends, George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story) and William Wyler (The Best Years of Our Lives), are smiling broadly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
SLP: An Interesting Combination of Qualities,"Some will call it a winning one; some will call it otherwise.SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK doesn't quite work as a conventional comedy because it just *isn't all that funny. As a drama about mental illness, it falls short because it tries too hard to be funny; plus, the lead characters are such stereotypes of bipolar-type people. {And in either case, the scenes of violence are horribly fake.} As a kind of funny-serious social satire on how everyone--along with the society they create and inhabit--is nuts in a myriad of ways, this film works VERY well, even if it does take some time to develop.The first half drags and is a bit unfocused; moreover, it seems overwrought with acting, script, and directions that try a bit too hard to portray crazy people. I found it very frustrating but soon discovered that it provided good set-up for the second half. There is also some nice and subtle foreshadowing here regarding the craziness of Pat (Cooper)'s family and all the other supposedly normal people in the film. While Jennifer Lawrence (as Tiffany) over-acts--just as Cooper does--it helps to elucidate the less stereotypical side of her in the second half. Her script--e.g., ""Humanity's just NASTY and there's NO silver lining!""--and entire character contribute a great deal to this film. The second half is also sometimes repetitive and unfocused, but the whole theme really shines through, and it could not end any better. Tiffany and Pat's dance scene is hypnotic (and I'll admit, pretty funny).In the end, it's fitting that a film about craziness follows such a crazy structure.*Many obviously disagree with me on how funny this film is--I'm just calling it as I see it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Pretty Standard Rom Com with an angle,"This is your standard Hollywood Rom Com which is differentiated from the rest of the crowd by the mental illness angle. While this aspect is handled with sensitivity and respect I did get the feeling that it was just another device and did not really message anything of importance. The needs of the Hollywood feel good factor trump a realistic, more in depth appreciation of the huge challenges of bi-polar disorder and mental illness in general. While the makers should be applauded for at least trying to incorporate a controversial and difficult subject it felt shallow and unrealistic to me. Having said that the performances are generally strong (with exception of Chris Tucker who was just annoying) and Cooper shows some range and versatility. It's all too predictable though and while it's fine for passing the time, if you're looking for some insights in to mental illness in the mould of a ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" or even ""A Beautiful Mind"" you won't find it here.

I was expecting it to be different from other typical American rom coms, but I was wrong. I haven't got anything against American rom coms, I just never really rate them highly. What made silver linings especially disappointing for me is that the portrayal of mental illness (which was the part of the story that made me want to see it) was awful. Whether it be bad acting or a poor narrative, but without the talk of mental illness, I wouldn't have even been aware that mental illness existed in the movie. You'd honestly just think the characters had poor social skills or maybe some milder form of a learning disability, such as asbergers, but certainly not bi-polar or any other serious mental health conditions.

Some good but heavy handed,"So I am glad I watched it but just glad and no more. That gives it the seven rating that you see. I appreciate the topic and portrayal of the mentally ill main character. As others have said, the first half shows his torment and detachment from reality. I appreciate the other reviewers for elucidating some of the things going on in the movie that I wasn't able to articulate at first and this is one of them... as the second half goes into a romcom and loses the set-up and reality of the severity of the illness and detachment from reality.I did find it a weird mix to have the mental illness with the quirky family. I mean I guess it was good that they show the OCD and violence of the dad. (I am amazed how people downplay the violence of both the son and the dad. This wasn't just ""getting mad"". )And the dad's OCD, with the mother barely keeping it together, was portrayed within the context of weird? Popular American culture. Which is obsessive in its own right. The tailgate parties, drinking, sports fandom to the point of violence. So you peel back the layers on this movie and it I guess it shows a gradient from ""severe hospitalized detached from reality"" to ""coping at home but risking all of the family's finances"" to ""quirky everyday culture"" to what?

Love story too abrupt and too unnatural.,"Why does Tiffany keep trying with unstable Pat while it was just one time thing with all the other guys the past? Why does Patrizio suddenly change the direction from football to couple's dancing and bet all his share impractically? Why does Pat leave Tiffany so suddenly after the dance even though he was already in love with her? All these unanswered questions could have been easily answered if the flow of the story is logical or at least sensible. Russell's script is very hasty, sudden, and aggressive.Patrizio senior's abrupt change of passion from football to dancing is to make couple dance just for the movie's sake. Pat leaving Tiffany so suddenly after the dance and not telling his true feeling for a week, which is not congruent with Pat we've known for the whole hour of the movie is to make dramatic ending. Tiffany who goes through serious behavioral change after her husband's death and who does not seem to overcome the sadness caused by it suddenly chases after another guy because they are the two protagonists (very clear even from the poster). All the weaknesses mentioned can be attributed to the fact that 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a romance movie.

She's a natural immense talent, so young but already really powerful. She deserved her Oscar entirely! So yeah, no one, no actress will be able to compete or be like her, never. What she did in the 2010s is pure Epic, especially 'tween 2011 and 2013. She has been not ""just"" Katniss and Raven (she still is) but Tiffany (and Aurora, Serena, Joy, Dominika, Maddie...) as well. Simply The Best!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
I like it!,"I was absolutely blown away by this film. Despite not generally being a fan of the 'boy meets girl, boy, and girl fall in love against all odds' storyline, there was just something about this movie that hooked me from the start.The characters in this film are incredibly well-written and truly drive the story forward. Each protagonist is their own antagonist, which makes for a refreshingly original and compelling watch. While these characters may not be easy to identify with, their struggles are undeniably intriguing and captivating.The simplicity of the plot and narrative structure are actually the film's strengths, as they allow the positive nature of the story to shine through. This is a feel-good cinema with both a big brain and an earnest heart.The cast is absolutely stunning - every single actor delivers a standout performance. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, in particular, are a force to be reckoned with. Their layered, raw, and heart-wrenching performances carry the film and make us truly care for their characters. I can honestly say I have rarely seen a film of this kind where I was so invested in the central pairing - I was silently rooting for them the entire time, thanks to the excellent performances and masterful writing.David O. Russell has undoubtedly crafted a film that is littered with small diamonds. The moments, scenes, and glances that he has orchestrated are absolutely stunning and strung together in such a way that it is impossible to resist the film's slow yet powerful grip on your emotions. The movie provides strong drama and sincere laughter, with two scenes that I can confidently say rank among my favorite slices of cinema I have seen this year.The first scene is the one where Cooper fights with DeNiro and ends up hitting his mom in the process. The way this scene crescendos into that awkward fight is simply stunning. The desperation in Cooper, the struggle to hold back and not really lash out at his dad, and the helplessness of DeNiro, resorting to the final physical solution and betraying the feeling he has around his son - all of it is breathtaking.The second scene, of course, is the dance. It is a perfect summation of the film, mirroring the bipolar nature of the characters. It is clumsy and awkward but so sincere and so painful in the glances Lawrence gives Cooper. It was just perfect.Even though this is undoubtedly a film for the hopelessly romantic and for those who don't object to a healthy dose of relentless optimism, I am neither of those. However, something this good is simply irresistible, and I couldn't help but be completely taken in by it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Excelsior!,"I loved the characters, each disturbed in their own unique way. I think this is the first time I've watched a movie and found the bipolar characters actually believable. There's a complexity to them, with multiple mental conditions represented among the characters. It's like a bunch of unwell people just came together, with different issues and to varying degrees. It's not sappy or overly dramatic.It all feels authentic because it doesn't feel blown out of proportion; you see some of the characters and think ""oh I might actually know a person with that disorder."" It made me think about some conversations I've had before as a joke about how everything is diagnosed in the west i.e. America. Africans don't do that lol. If someone if failing in school, back home we'd just say that guy's dumb, and not even with ill-intent usually, he's just your not-so-smart friend. But in America you'd say he has a learning disability. So you have all these things, anxiety, ptsd, OCD, depression, trauma, bipolar; but you'd just say oh yeah man, he's a little odd or moody without actually labeling it lol.I loved DeNiro's character, I haven't watched too many of his movies but the ones I have he's usually a tough old nut, gangster or something, and here he was just a dad. The family dynamic, it was a bit all over the place with all the family's problems, but it was great to watch. The way they interact with each other. The characters were well-written, and while the story was alright, I think the characters are what make the movie.The twist in the past 30min of the movie was unexpected for me, especially the way it was casually revealed about Tiffany. The moment before Pat realized, it's revealed to us first. I didn't know whether or not I was supposed to react to it because the movie doesn't make too much of a big deal about it when first shown. I also didn't realize how much I was rooting for these guys until the dance.I'm really impressed with the movie, because on paper it feels like it should be boring. It's about two messed up individuals finding healing through a dance competition, but it works surprisingly well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Exquisitely made,This movie touches my soul. The acting is done just right. It strays away from being cheesy while being full of emotions. The characters feel like actual human beings and interact as such. Stevie Wonder's ''My Cherie Amour'' appears in different sections of the film as a motif to show us the kind of struggle Pat (Bradley Cooper) faces in extracting the memory of his former wife from his life. The movie also has an emotional and honest take on mental illness. This is a treasure of a film that I find myself watching again and again. Definitely recommend you watch it.,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

An odd portrayal,"This film is an odd entry in the romantic comedy genre in that it heavily focuses on a semi-stable man with bipolar disorder as he struggles to rebuild his life and repair his relationships. The portrayal of mental illness rides a fine balance between character comedy and dramatic tragedy. His personality is best described as oblivious - he stumbles around fully convinced that what he does is perfectly clear and normal, and doesn't want to hear otherwise. Along the way he meets a companion with (I think) a borderline personality which comes with its own hangups. Throughout the film, their interaction is as wild as the disorders they possess, yet has a stable core in the theme of healing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Seriously?? Can this win an Oscar??... Oh, I see, the Weinsteins are behind it","First of all, as I always do when I write a review in IMDb, I'll state clearly again my astonishment with the rating. I insist: looks like something's wickedly wrong with IMDb...Now for the movie. Well, it's not horrible. It's watchable. But the strings show everywhere. With this I mean that to anyone with film knowledge, it's a PRODUCT. A product crafted with the Oscars in view, like everything the Weinsteins do. They sometimes make it good (""The King's Speech"", ""Shakespeare in Love""), sometimes they make it awful (""The Master"", ""Django Unchained""). This is kind of midway.Why do I say the strings show? Well, for anyone that has read a couple of basic screen writing manuals, it shows. It definitely shows. The script is so by-the-book that that's the only reason for the absurd second halve of the movie, the it's-so-stupid-it's-unbelievable double bet thing. I won't get much into it for spoilers reason, but if you've seen the film you know what I'm talking about. Not to speak about the whole dance nonsense or even the possibility itself that such a bet could ever take place with at least one non-retarded adult witness involved. And the ending with all the characters gathered in the same physical place for no other reason than to fulfill one of the more hackneyed writer's Bible Commands??In the good side (the silver linings side?) the idea of displaying a drama involving characters with mental disorders we don't know much about helps us to care more about the real cases outside the movie. Only that I read somewhere among the users reviews that such illnesses are not faithfully displayed. And that's bad. Makes me wonder if the bipolar disorder wasn't really what interested the director- screenwriter, but only the possible awards (we know very well by now that Academy voters love mental illness in a drama).Which leads me to David O. Russell. Like Paul Thomas Anderson, his work starts to show the egotistic perversion of a self-acclaimed ""artist"". I've commented how flawed the script is. The direction is worse. It's mediocre. His pseudo-documentary- style moving camera only makes me dizzy.I insist, it's a watchable movie. But Oscar-worthy???",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
My Kind of Silver Lining,"There is so much to unpack in this movie. It is as multi-layered as the characters in their affliction, a fluctuation between hell and manic exhilaration. Watching two flawed people, one with a diagnosed mental disorder, and the other one with an undiagnosed mental illness, find each other amidst life, family, friends, and Western medical therapy inflicting their world views upon Tiffany's and Pat's daily life is visceral, funny, triggering, even satisfying at times.The dance competition routine is fantastic and shows in a brilliantly artistic way the highs and lows of BPD.If you or somebody you know suffers from a mood swing disorder, this is an absolute must-watch!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A love story between two mentally unwell people (seriously),"*** Spoiler-free review ***Imagine if someone in Hollywood read the Christian bible and said to themselves, ""What if we broke as many commandments from this book as possible and then create a movie around it? Let's broadcast this fallen imagery to audiences around the word and let them consume for their own entertainment."" This is that movie. In short, it is about a man with bipolar disorder finding friendship (and maybe more) with another girl who is also taking medication for her own personal issues. This is not your typical romantic love story if that is what you are looking for.Now let's talk about the themes of this movie. It covers: gambling on Sundays, being violent towards parents, lack of self-control and almost killing a man, adultery between married people, bearing false witness by falsely accusing someone is harassing them, There's also some swearing, drinking, using God's (Jesus') name in vain. Under this backdrop does the movie unfold. To someone who has read the bible, it is clear that the main characters are displaying overwhelming non-Christian attitudes.In terms of acting, I give props to Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver for realistically depicting the struggles of a family with an adult child diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and their attempts to treat him. It hits close to home to real life. My main comment is this: this is what you will be watching in this movie, not some fantastical classic rom-com movie. Jennifer Lawrence portrays a tough girl struggling with her own personal issues.Lastly, will I recommend this movie to others to watch? Personally, this is not your romantic, gooey, fuzzy, feel-good movie. Instead, imagine you were sitting outside a psychiatric ward innocently people-watching and spotted a tall man in the distance behaving slightly erratically mentioning his wife's name. And you decided to follow him around for a few hours to see what happens next. This is that movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"Cooper Plays Pat With Such Believability We Begin Pitying His Character, So Much That We Are Left Dissatisfied With The Resolution The Film Offers Him","There is a thin line of difference between 'eccentric' and 'unstable': Pat Solitano, a victim of bi-polar disorder behaved more unstable than eccentric or quirky, and so I pitied him instead of loving him. Bradley Cooper has Pat's uncontrollable anxiety down to a tee and he plays his character with great sincerity because of which we sympathize with him all the more. Silver Lining Playbook's humor seemed more dark than quirky in the first half, and when the director David O. Russell brings in the screwball comedy post intermission, I was a tad disappointed because I was looking forward to a better resolution for Pat's dilemma. Maybe Cooper should have performed his character with less believability and more stylization, and then I may have laughed with him all along. But since the actor plays every moment of his character with utmost sincerity and believability, I could not laugh at his actions and behavior before intermission. I pitied him, I prayed for him, I had a lump in my throat when he began screaming at the top of his lungs in the middle of the night, but I did not laugh much.I was howling with laughter when Tom Ewell played Richard Sherman in Seven Year Itch. I almost fell off my couch watching Billy Wilder and Tony Curtis play two impersonators in Some like It Hot. I fell in love with screwball romantic comedies like Awful Truth and Send Me No Flowers. In none of the films did the protagonists invoke pity right from scene one. Maybe Cooper, despite his impressive efforts, isn't the right choice for a genre like this. His co-star Jennifer Lawrence is ideally cast though because we do not sympathize with her in the beginning; she plays her part in a manner where we gradually fall in love with her eccentricities and then care for her when it seems she won't achieve her desire. This imbalance Cooper creates manifests strongly in the second half when the situation goes berserk – that is when the artificiality sickens us instead of charming us and our interest in the characters and the plot dwindles right up to the very end.Silver Lining Playbook has a winsome premise involving bi-polar disorder patient Pat's release from mental institution and subsequent endeavor by him to ignore all negativity and set his life back on track keeping the motto 'Excelsior!' in mind. Pat's main objective is to get his wife Nikki back, who refuses to meet him and has a restraining order against him after he almost beat her paramour to death after the two were caught making love in the shower. He is not encouraged by his parents to do so and so when he gets to know that his friend's wife's younger sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) can help him by delivering messages to Nikki, he becomes friends with her. But Tiffany has her own problems – suffering from depression ever since her husband died, she spent a long time having sex with almost all her co-workers (women included) at her job until she was kicked out. Even now, she is extremely impulsive and volatile and she only agrees to deliver Pat's letter to Nikki if he partners her for a dance competition. Pat's father on the other hand suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder and he spends his entire time gambling on football team Philadelphia Eagles after losing his job so that he can buy a new restaurant with the money he gets. Things take a surprising turn when Pat Sr., who believes his son is the luck factor for his winning streak, loses his bet money and it coincides with Pat Jr.'s scuffle at the game; Pat Sr. then decides to parlay with his rival where if i) Eagles wins against Dallas and ii) Pat Jr. and Tiffany get a minimum 5 points in their dance competition, then the family shall recover all the money lost on the first bet.Frankly, the entire football segment with Pat, his elder brother and the American-Indians, and the parlay segment were lame. A big issue I had was the inclusion of Pat's brother in the movie, who served little purpose than to slight his sibling whenever he could and then react to his father's parlay. I was slightly disquieted the moment Tiffany said 'dance with me' but that was nothing compared to the disappointment I felt watching every character break loose and trying to sound as if they really cared about that silly 'parlay'. The part where Tiffany wakes in during the fight and starts reproaching Pat for skipping rehearsals would've suited the old films mentioned in the first paragraph, but doesn't look good in this film. Everything after the parlay scene went downhill, and although it was funny to see the how the events turned up, I was yet dissatisfied by the resolution provided to Cooper's character in the film.In supporting roles are Jackie Weaver, Robert De Niro, Anupam Kher and Chris Tucker. Jackie Weaver speaks more with her eyes and makes it clear that she loves her family to death despite all their oddities. Robert De Niro is perfectly fine except he sounded (only sounded) weirdly like Tommy Wiseau from the disastrous 2003 film The Room at times and that distracted me. Anupam Kher in the role of Pat's therapist Dr. Cliff Patel is alright, but I was stunned when how his character responded to the parlay situation at Pat's home. Chris Tucker is very likable and very funny as the hair-obsessed buddy of Patrick. David O Russell maintains the quick-shifting pace throughout using cuts, zooms and hand-held camera. Yet, on the basis of the impression I got from the first half and the changing impression I got after interval, I was left unconvinced whether Pat had really attained his silver lining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A fantastic performance nestled inside an average movie,"After getting released from a mental institution, Pat (Bradley Cooper) moves back in with his parents and dedicates his life to patching things up with his ex-wife. Things start to get a bit more complicated when he meets the gorgeous Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who has mental health problems of her own, and the two strike up an odd friendship.The best thing about 'Silver Linings Playbook' is that you have some very good actors doing some very good acting. The film itself is alright, I wouldn't say it's great. It's based on a novel, and it's easy to see how a lot of the scenarios would play out better in prose; the writing, too, isn't always strong. Yes, it does have its moments, but I get the feeling that I'd probably have enjoyed it more as a novel.But let's get back to the acting. It is the performances that make 'Silver Lining Playbook' better than it probably should be. Top of the heap is Jennifer Lawrence, who is just incredible. It's the film she won the Oscar for, and deservedly so. She's funny, tragic and pitiful all at the same time. Her comic delivery, her facial expressions, her ability to pull off the crazy mood swings as seamlessly as she does. This is the kind of performance you'd expect from a seasoned actor, not from someone barely in her twenties. Bradley Cooper is great too, and he probably would have gotten all the accolades had it not been for his co-star.What stopped the film from being a great one was the portrayal of mental health. For the first half of the film, I was actually very impressed. The mental health issues are treated with sincerity, albeit with a strong tinge of humour. But as the film goes on, it starts to get a bit farcical and loses that sincerity. A shame, really. Had it been shown with greater care, I think 'Silver Linings Playbook' could have staked a claim for being one of the films of the year. Instead, the film will be remembered for allowing Jennifer Lawrence to give the best performance of her career to date, and not much else.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Cinematic Ambien,"When you fall asleep listening to Bradley Cooper ramble on with  Jennifer Lawrence about absolutely NOTHING in the middle of this film,  wake up 22 minutes later and notice that you missed absolutely NOTHING,  it's time to give this piece of junk the review it deserves. I feel  this way mostly since we entered into the on-demand contract to watch  this drivel on the advice of the Academy and hundreds of delusional  viewers who somehow feel this film has something to offer.   Silver Linings Playbook is a poorly scripted and marginally acted film.  It fails to deliver ANY semblance of anything. The script is horrible,  the story is beyond boring, the ""chemistry"" between any of the actors  is invisible, if not completely absent, and frankly, I couldn't have  cared less how it ended. I think I laughed twice in two hours, that is,  when I wasn't snoring.   Jennifer Lawrence's apparently Oscar-worthy performance was completely  overshadowed by the fact that she said NOTHING for nearly two hours. I  mean NOTHING. Between her and Cooper, it was incomprehensible  gibberish, and it went on and on like Ahmedinejad at the UN. Just two  plus hours of rambling. The mindless, worthless script overshadowed  Cooper's apparently reasonable performance as well. DeNiro was the only  bright spot, but his performance was forced and he wasn't believable as  Cooper's father - not even a resemblance. Bad casting. Wait, Cooper's  character might have been adopted - I'm not sure. I might have missed  that during my 22 minute snooze. Eh, didn't matter anyways if it were  the case. The chemistry there was horrible as well.   I can't even give away anything about the film in a spoiler because  there's frankly NOTHING TO SPOIL here. I could tell you the ending and  it wouldn't mean a thing - you could go ahead and watch away with  nothing to look forward to except wishing you'd spent the $6 on a latte  at Starbucks or a couple of discount rentals of decent films.   Stay away from this film unless you really need some sleep.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Turning Silver into Golds,"I was recently diagnosed with a bipolar disorder. It was fun watching this movie and being able to draw on parallels with the main character Pat. It was interesting seeing his behavior in his manic state because I could draw parallels between his behavior and my own behaviors. Pat fixates all his attention on his ex-wife while I focused all of my attention on my father. I now have a visual of mania from a third person perspective and I feel empowered knowing that I never want to go back to that full blown state. Ok well maybe I will go back to that state sometime because it is enjoyable but then again that is just the inner demon that some people with bipolar need to deal with and defeat in order to have a steadfast commitment to stay in the bipolar wellness zone.I loved seeing Pat agreeing to take his pills because of the normality that he was able to create while on his pills. The manic state can be very addicting so I am happy to have seen him understand that he was supposed to take his pills. Mental illness is real and effects everyone who loves you so it is just plain selfish to refuse to take your prescribed medicine.This movie has everything that anyone could ever want, Drama, romance and dynamic characters. I highly recommend it especially if you want to get better grasp on understanding mental illness and how the mentally ill and their families are effected by it.

Lawrence and Cooper nail it.,"David O. Russell's collaboration with Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence can be seen as a work of art and a dour mess. Just like Picasso's paintings, Silver Linings Playbook, with no reason behind its title, feels broken but whole at the same time. The on-screen duo, who're mentally unwell for different reasons, juxtapose the convoluted story. They're not the most likable singularly, but put together they're a tour de force. Both are equally outstanding; Cooper's Pat wants to win back his wife and the only way to do that is to help out Lawrence's Tiffany.

A warm and witty family drama....,"Mental illness, apart autism, is seldom seen in the movies. And in the aspect the film portrays the mental disorder in normal characters which makes it a treat to satiate the emotion starved audiences. The film gives the warmth of reading a fiction novel at your couch and is further nuanced by the Oscar worthy performances from Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert Di Niro, Jacki Weaver, and a short role of Anupam Kher as the psychiatrist.The beginning is full of surprises with Bradley Cooper out of the mental hospital to his parents' house, after losing his wife, job, and a decent life. The character feels just close to life displaying the moods tantrums, who gets accompanied by Jennifer Lawrence, another character with mental disorders.At the beginning the film just feels perfect with a raised bar for the surprises. But disappointingly, much is lost in the second half with reduced emotions and ease in the end. Jennifer Lawrence in her role is refreshing, but adjudging to the bar set by Hilary Swank in ""Boys Don't Cry"" and Julia Roberts in ""Erin Brockovich,"" it is still not an Oscar worthy performance. Robert De Niro's role too finds not much relevance to gel the drama despite his flawless performance after ""Meet the Parents"". Regarding the story it's purely Brad Cooper's film with his obsession to meet his estranged wife throughout the entire drama till crossed by the aspiration of a mentally disturbed widow. However, concerning a warm and witty family drama, it's still welcome in its genre.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

The only way to beat my crazy was by doing something even crazier.,"Directed by David O RussellStarring Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro.Written by David O Russell and Matthew Quick.'After a stint in a mental institution, former teacher Pat Solitano moves back in with his parents and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things get more challenging when Pat meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own.'With all the hype and nominations this film was receiving, I didn't believe it would be as great as critics acclaimed it to be. Though this film isn't a masterpiece, it was a satisfying watch with plenty of personal messages.I was very disappointed with David O Russell's last picture ""The Fighter"" and it was his directing that almost didn't make me want to see this one. I would have made a terrible mistake. He was great. He told the story so well with the setting it introduced. It couldn't have been a more common neighborhood and all the actor's were so natural that it made it a 'one-two combo!' The cinematography was descent in this picture. It was all normal. The only aspect I enjoyed was some repetitive camera movements that caught me eye to the great storytelling. The dialogue is great. Such a down to earth and natural flow. I noticed that the actors didn't have a problem with their jobs because the script did that for them. The nomination for Best Screenplay didn't surprise me.The acting in this film was awesome. I'm not trying to take anything away from Bradley Cooper who did a great job but Robert De Niro and Jennifer Lawrence caught my eye the most. At first, De Niro didn't get much screen time so I couldn't really judge but once his character started playing a bigger role, I was impressed. He hasn't lose his touch with age. His dialogue, his emotional acting and his character's mannerisms with OCD all came together to get him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. I was hearing a lot of buzz about Jennifer Lawrence before I saw the film. Not only is she beautiful to look at but her acting is just as great! She makes her presence noticeable to the screen. She doesn't over act and try to let her actions speak for her. I saw her as a very natural actress and I bought everything she was saying. Great performance. The only flaw I saw in the cast was Chris Tucker. He was annoying and didn't really have a purpose in the story. Maybe he was brought to lighten up and humor the story but it didn't work for me and was not needed.Music is often key to the story in this film – from Stevie Wonder's ""My Cherie Amour,"" which triggers Cooper's character's rage, to the medley of songs that serves as a backdrop for a climactic dancing competition. The Score brings an element to compliment the great acting and great storytelling.Overall, this is a clever picture. It has some of the best acting and storytelling in film this year.

Jennifer Lawrence outshines more than Bradley Cooper,"(2012) Silver Linings Playbook
DRAMAMom, Dolores (Jacki Weaver) has just signed a release form to allow his adult son, Pat junior (Bradley Cooper) out of an institution for attacking his wife's lover. And upon getting out, Pat still believes that him and his wife still get along as a couple, even though she has a restraining order against him. But, in order for Pat not to be sent back to the institution, he has to live under his parents supervision, who are his parents played by Jacki Weaver as the mom and Pat senior played by Robert DeNiro. Oh, yeah, Pat junior also suffers from bi-polar, who has tendencies to overreact with violent outbursts, and sometimes he'd have to do things in a specific way. And of course, he's eventually going to meet by chance the Jennifer Lawrence character, as Tiffany who has issues as well. Also starring is Chris Tucker as Tucker, the person he made friends with while he was in the institution, and Julia Stiles. Difficult movie to do, about a person who is bi-polar, but the interesting suggestion that's been done here, can be labelled as therapeutic, such as ballroom dancing was a nice touch. And I also liked the fact that the environment didn't have any guns around, since if Pat were to get a hold of one, as he has unknowingly attacked people for no reason, then it would've turned into an entirely different movie altogether.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

So What?,"So I just watched Silver Linings Playbook and thought ""So what?"" I had heard great things about this movie, namely that it had received 8 Oscar nominations. So, I thought, this has to be a great film? Great cast, great director, a recipe for perfection, right? Well, if this movie was a cake, someone forgot to add the yeast, because this sucker did not rise. We start with a very likable Bradley Cooper, who just seemed to be 'acting' too much in this movie. I know that sounds strange, but actors are supposed to draw you in to their performances, make you feel like you could know them on a personal level, like they could live next door. But this just felt like I was watching a performance; albeit a decent performance, by Bradley Cooper. Jennifer Lawrence stars as his love interest and also gives an adequate performance, but that being said, I expected so much more. Without giving too much away, Bradley stars as a man who has got some problems, tries to rectify them, and find himself and love along the way. The feel-good movie of the year? Probably! But not for me. The movie seemed clichéd and derivative. Robert DeNiro is a wonderful actor and a legend in his own right, but a Best Supporting Actor nomination? I just don't get it. What I think makes me dislike the movie even more is knowing the other films it beat out for nominations. Movie like Django Unchained and Argo for Best Director. These 2 films were wonderfully directed and the movies themselves are accomplishments in directing! Big casts, different locations, etc. I felt like I could have directed Silver Linings. For some reason, I got a whiff of Jerry Maguire from this movie: a man trying to rebuild himself, and finding love along the way in the most unlikely (yet most likely) of places. Only, Jerry Maguire was a wonderful film. It had depth and sincerity and still stands as Tom Cruise's finest performance. To say that this felt ""phoned in"" is an understatement. Was this a good movie? Ya, OK, I watched it and didn't turn it off. But, is that saying much?",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

A love story performed by two neurotic patients.,"1. Everyone is extremely lost and frustrated when the exam is down, the layoffs are laid off, and there is a major illness. Maybe it's a particularly serious one in the movie where Pat witnessed his wife cheating. But are these rare in life? It shouldn't be. Although it was a bit of an exaggeration to get Pat into the hospital with this incident.2. The dialogue between the characters at first glance looked chaotic, as if everyone were crazy. But if you look closely, there is only one starting point for these dialogues, and that is love. The mother loved her newly discharged son, father loved mother, Pat loved his brother, Pat loved his wife, and Tiffany loved Pat. Pat, of course, is in deep love with Tiffany. A web of love, holding everyone in the movie.3. Tiffany looked more serious than pat on the condition, although she had not been to the hospital and was not considered a psychopath. And emotionally, she looks a little too active. This is confusing, and it seems nonsense and illogical. But the real situation is that Tiffany is so short of love that her experience has led her to be the most vulnerable in the show.4. As long as you understand the 3rd, the film's final hero and heroine kiss together only seems so valuable.

A game of two halves,"The movie was a traditional romantic comedy with a touch of social commentary on mental illness at the start. It was quite entertaining, Jennifer Lawrence very sexy and the the general level of acting was very good. I am not that surprised to see a number of Oscar nominations but given the lack of gravitas in the movie as a whole I would not expect to see any of it's actors winning the award. As regards Bradley Cooper, I have no direct experience of people with Bipolar disorder but have with schizophrenia and he seemed quite convincing in the start of the movie. His size made his frenetic episodes quite frightening especially in the confines of his parents' smallish house and he had me concerned for the welfare of his parents. HOwever, instead of a bloodbath what we got was a bit of father-son slapping and then a remorseful son gets back on his meds. After that is is basically a traditional romantic comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

A stark portrayal of mental illness with a silver lining,"If a friend asked me what watching Silver Linings Playbook is like, I might say, 'It's a bit like watching a train wreck, filled with crazy people and served up as a dark rom-com slash drama.' However, for the purposes of this review, I'll be more politically correct and describe it as a film about people who care for each other while managing their respective mental illnesses. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both come off as a bit over-the-top angry and frantic, Robert DeNiro's character struggles with OCD, and others with smaller roles seem to struggle with mental health as well.With most of the movie shot with a Steadicam, the resulting camera work gives the movie a low-budget feel. The shaky, unsteady shots add to the sense of chaos and frenetic instability, making it hard to look away even when it feels uncomfortable.In terms of music, a great selection of licensed recordings are used, such as ""Girl from the North Country"" by Bob Dylan with Johnny Cash. However, the sparse use of an original non-diegetic score creates a quiet that makes each scene feel stark and somber.The film's blend of dark humor, raw emotion, and intense portrayals of mental illness create a film that's hard to sit through. But, the biggest problem with this movie is the story which is generally weak and unsatisfying. That said, there is a silver lining: unlike many films in this category, this one does improve as it nears the end. So not a bad watch, after all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

A sweet story of an unlikely romance.,"Silver Linings Playbook (2012) follows a man who is released from a psychiatrist hospital and tries to get back with his ex-wife, however he ends up meeting a woman who's just as damaged as he is. This was a beautiful film that I related to deeply and I'm so glad I watched it! The performances were all great and I was impressed.The personal reason I loved this film was because I'm bipolar and this movie really made me feel understood. For me, the depiction of bipolar disorder was so realistic and well written, especially the mania. I feel like media has really struggled to give a realistic portrayal of mania in the past so I genuinely appreciated this movie for that!We are introduced to the characters well and the acting all around was pretty good! Bradley Cooper was great in his role and really put his all into it, and Jennifer Lawrence was just as good. They both had amazing chemistry and although their relationship was very self-destructive, I couldn't help but root for them!I wasn't a fan of the music at times because it felt like it sometimes broke the mood and was a bit too overbearing and odd. However, some of the music used did reflect the emotions well so it wasn't too big an issue. I thought the score itself was beautiful and added more life to the film!The cinematography was, for the most part, pretty basic and I wish that there would've been some better colour schemes. The lighting was good though and I liked the use of quick zooms! Also, nearer the end the cinematography got a lot stronger and there were some really nice colour palettes.The film wasn't massively engaging but it was easy to follow and the pacing was steady with a plot that builds up well. There were plenty of stressful and tense scenes. The second half was a lot better than the first, and I felt like the final act really saved the movie. The final dance sequence was my favourite part of the film as it was funny but also heartwarming! The film ended on an emotional note, which I really loved.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Insincere,"David O. Russell's 'Silver Linings Playbook' is ultimately a disappointing film: an unconvincing portrayal of mental illness and family dysfunction, with a weak romantic comedy subplot and an utterly meaningless second subplot featuring a dance competition. The central characters are not particularly sympathetic either: if they don't convince as mentally ill, they do convince as utterly self-obsessed - the attraction that the two leads supposedly feel for each other is asserted but in no way demonstrated. It's unclear what Russell was trying to do in this movie; but it's not funny, and nothing in it feels like it comes from the heart.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
An entertaining interesting flick!,"A very well acted drama that makes you feel these characters are real. A very satisfying film filled with an interesting plot and interesting characters.

Leave the cinema with a smile for a change?,"Hectic rather than dramatic; charming rather than funny; and as for romance, that would be somewhat of an insult on behalf of one of this year's finer films. Silver Linings Playbook leads rather than follows an off-beat style for its genre. Scratch that, you gather the sense that it advocates its own genre due to its uniquely complex characters and relationships, yet with a simplistic and easy to follow narrative.The most perplexing scenario when engaged in the theatrical experience is how much we, the audience, are energised by these rather peculiar characters. Each conveys some form of dysfunctional behaviour, whether it is some mental incapacity, an obsession or lying to one's self. Nevertheless, they are extraneously relatable which formulates a wonderful character-audience relationship simultaneously. One can imagine the ease in which the independent studio could have sensationalised the relationships, or added the dreaded cheese factor to this delightful November release. As it turns out, we were instead gifted with this grounded, rounded earth of a film, by which I mean complete as a whole in its entirety. Once the final shot transits to the rolling credits, we feel we require no more from the two hours of pleasurable endurance, whilst also being unable to identify a single flaw, which proves evident in the countless smiling faces (including your own) around the theatre and uplifted mood around the room. The primary cause for this 'Silver Lining Theory' (Bharat Samra trademark) is undoubtedly the combination of an evidently well-written script and truly tremendous acting. The amalgamation of seemingly authentic and convincing dialogue blended with the two phenomenal lead actors and numerous noteworthy supporting actors is what fuels the picture into a smooth journey up a straight path, with some bumps along the way to enable our protagonist to maintain and test his fortitude.One of the aspects of the film which as a viewer you hugely appreciate is lack of condescension. You learn so much about each individual character that there is no need to be continuously reminded of what is occurring in the narrative, as you become so immersed into their lives and behaviours, you almost instantly adopt their personalities, meaning we can assume their actions, and the motion picture's integrity does not yield, yet increases with confluent storytelling. Each actor involved with this production warrants copious acclaim as their influential authority over their roles are not for a second doubted, as they own their part so reliably well. Most conspicuously, the leads in Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are foremost worth valuing due to their, excuse the following cliché, on screen chemistry. Robert De Niro and Chris Tucker are also sensationally suited for this film, for their opposing roles. Tucker not surprisingly assists in the comedic department comfortably, while De Niro vents an irrational, confused and a times angry father to Cooper's character Pat due to his OCD.I believe this to be one of the rare contemporary cinematic releases that compels throughout. It has heart, humour, hedonism and happiness, though you may as times witness the interfamily conflict, the restoration of happiness is, inevitable. The fact that not a lot actually happens in this independent film can be disregarded because it is the characters and their dialogue which carries the picture perhaps into further future award winning territory, to add to the already achieved accolades. Silver Linings Playbook is suitable for almost any demographic, assuming you are indeed above the age of consent for this particular picture, I can almost guarantee enjoyment and pleasure for at least the two hour duration, and even long after the screening, especially the climactic, quite simply fun dance sequence, along with even learning the implication of the terrific title.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Beautiful love story between two strange people 7/10,"Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are one heck of a dynamic duo. When it comes to drama films directed by David O. Russell then you know it's going to be good with both of them on screen.Pat (Cooper) and Tiffany (Lawrence) are two people who struggle with mental illness, each one with a different illness. Throughout the story the hang out together and help each other out in the final act of the film. (Which is also the best sequence of the film).Along with the soundtrack by Danny Elfman, there are many very good songs such as Steve Wonder's great hits.The dance scenes are well done, a lot choreography put into the dances and are among the better scenes among the film.Another shout-out goes to Robert DeNiro who is wonderful and tears in a emotional scene between father and son.Finally, I love the focus on the mental illness each character faces throughout the story, it is purposely done to give more insight to the characters and get to know them better. Even DeNiro's character suffers from O. C. D which is well planted in the movie.Silver Lining Playbook is a great romance movie between two very different people who work well together once they finally come to terms with each other. Gotta love the chemistry between them.By the way, speaking of this film, remember that time during the scene where Tiffany yells at Pat during Halloween?, after finishing the scene, Russell just comes up and shouts he love cinema.

pretty darnn good,"Hey people nice to read my review,the story begins a bit of retarded, I most certainly didn't like it, but after the first struggle of about 25 minutes, it's worth watching, (Unfortunately, you do need to see the first few minutes)At the beginning... Kind of foolish to begin that way, but still, you see a young man who is completely screwed up (pardon the language) during the film he will be helped by Tiffany (a role by Jennifer Lawrence), who (in the end of it all) will help him get sane. It's also a movie about dance, and in case you're wondering, no this is not the kind of movie like Grace or dirty dancing and similar. The dance idea is working for our dear friend to make him sane again. Also Julia stiles is in this movie (sorry, I'm a succor for good looking woman, and in this case, I do have the idea that she should be more in the movie, at this moment, I do believe she has a kind of by-roll) Nevertheless, In the ending... (hussh this one up, would you?) they get together, they curl up together (Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper) on a lounge chair, and who in Gods name wouldn't want to curl up with Jennifer Lawrence?It's quite a nice production, though the first few parts are quite.. well boring, but it's nice to view though.Regards,Paul",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Dysfunctional isn't really funny,"Silver Linings Playbook (2012) was scripted and directed by David O. Russell. It stars Bradley Cooper as Pat, who has been in a mental institution since he ""lost it"" when he came home to find his wife in the shower with another man. Robert De Niro is Pat Sr., who makes his living as a gambler and bookie. Enter the beautiful and mysterious Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence. At dinner party, Tiffany and Pat trade tales of their psychotropic medications, and then they enter into a love/hate relationship. Finally, the two become dance partners and enter a dance contest. You can take it from there.I didn't enjoy the movie much, but I give Russell credit for showing us that mental illness really is an illness, and it's not funny. Jennifer Lawrence deserved an Oscar for her role in Winter's Bone, but I wasn't that impressed by her acting here. Robert De Niro's role struck me as tiresome. Of course he's one of our greatest actors, but I think he was just going through the motions in this film.We saw this movie in a theater, but it will work well on DVD.

Clearly an ""A"" movie in production quality, the fact is that this movie has nothing to say. It seems to display dysfunctional characters for the purpose of capitalizing on those dysfunctional characters and nothing more. This movie might best have been left on paper.I managed to stick with the movie to the end, mostly because I was with a group, and waited (impatiently) for something, anything, meaningful to happen.

"More like platinum instead of silver, a real treasure","Pat (Bradley Cooper) is, at present, in a mental institution in Baltimore. He lost it, you see, when he came home from work and found his wife in the shower with another man. After beating the heck out of the male cheater, Pat's wife also has a restraining order out on him. Nevertheless, Pat is convinced that he is going to get his ""ex"" back and without medication for his obvious bipolar condition. After 8 months of therapy, Pat's mother (Jackie Weaver) does get permission to take her son home to Philadelphia. Problems continue, however. Pat's father (Robert De Niro) has his own anger issues and is running an illegal business out of his home. Dad doesn't understand his own son's situation very well and doesn't have much patience. Especially when Pat Jr., reading a book, gets so upset he throws it out a window, breaking the glass. Meanwhile, some longtime friends (John Ortiz and Julia Stiles) decide to throw a dinner party and invite Pat and the wife's young widowed sister, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). If it is an attempt at matchmaking, it doesn't go well. Yet, slowly, Pat and Tiff do become friends, even to the point of swapping impossible requests for each other. Tiff wants Pat to be her partner in a dance competition while Pat wants the beautiful widow to get a letter to his ex, even though its against the law. As Pat Sr. places a large bet on the dance exhibition and his beloved football team, the Eagles, the stakes are high, especially for the mental health of Pat and Tiffany. Will there be a silver lining for all? This beautiful, touching movie should be rated in platinum, as its value is more than silver or gold. Its serious issues are mixed with humor and sweetness, making for a very enjoyable view. Then, too, the direction and editing are spectacular, offering many imaginative changes of scene. Above all, the performances are amazing. Cooper displays great talent in his role as the complex Pat while Lawrence acts years beyond her tender age to shine as Tiffany. De Niro, Weaver, Stiles, Ortiz, and the rest of the supporting cast are mighty nice, too. Kudos, especially, should go to Chris Tucker for his fine turn as a fellow mental patient of Pat's. The scenery in and around Philly is both lovely and gritty while costumes, make-up and photography are very worthy, too. Yes, the finale is a bit too pat while there is some bad language thrown about, too. But, all in all, get in line soon to buy tickets for Silver Linings.

This is a film that assumes the line of clichés precisely to avoid these distorted endorsements in the message. A story about finding love and yourself again!,"So, how to measure and quantify the madness that each one imprints on individualities? Losing control, being euphoric at a certain moment, only to cry profusely from depression afterwards. It cannot be explained. Each case is different. Initially, we meet Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper, from ""The Hangover"", ""Without Limits"") in a psychiatric hospital because of the aggressive crisis when he discovered that his wife was cheating on him. His mother (Jacki Weaver, ""Animal Kingdom"") is going to pick him up. Thus, the spectator is immersed in the protagonist's neuroses, agitations, hyperactivity, who discusses Hemingway, at three in the morning, with his father, who runs with a bag of garbage and who meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence, from ""Winter of the Soul"", ""The Hunger Games""), who lost her husband and who also cannot deal with the suffering. Gradually, they help each other, all without the cliché characteristic of a romantic comedy genre. The script for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" does not judge ""madness"", it just portrays it, trying to mitigate the hypocrisy and lack of understanding that one has about everything.The element of bipolarity is this source of conflict, but consequently, it is also the source of unity between Pet (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jeniffer Lawrence), characters that are sometimes misunderstood by those who do not have similar psychological problems, or who do not see and hide themselves. That is why Russel feels very comfortable using these established clinical deficiencies in favor of comedy, elaborating with them, clearly staged situations, with the ""Q"" of absurdity provoked by the shock of the explosive conditions of both. In a really dramatic proposal, these sequences would quickly remove their legitimacy as a realistic study of characters, but for the romantic comedy, they are great bridges that build an empathetic charisma to them. A charisma not to empathize with their condition, but simply to bring them together as a couple.Different from other projects, Russel's camera hardly elaborates a sequence with the most stylized mise en scene, that is, there is plenty of space left for him to take advantage of his talent, where in fact he is good, in this case, directing actors. Both Cooper and Lawrence have a very believable sense of unpredictability within the fixed idea of humor - the best, which comes from breaking expectations - for the romance involving the couple, but not only them, such as Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, Chris Tucker and the rest of the secondary cast, has a very efficient comic timing with the intentional instability of the text. An instability that speaks to the premise of bipolarity and the original principle that the couple understands each other by talking and understanding their common problems, unlike the others pointed out by the script who always seem to deny their deficiencies in favor of individualistic pride. In this regard, we can cite the most obvious example, which is the character of De Niro and his addiction to superstitions for sports betting that cornered his son for the same problems he suffers, but it is preferable to go to the character of John Ortiz and the scene that reveals how he relieves the stress of garage marriage problems. Realize that these small and relaxed insertions, also thought of humor, reveal the most critical side of the feature, by reiterating that in modernity everyone is subject to therapy. The difference is that society naturally creates hierarchies for this madness present in all of us, something exemplified in the first scene of the debate between the couple in formation, which basically has a disagreement over Pet positioning Tiffany as the craziest between the two.There are those who say that the film can be irresponsible even so, since it is implied in the happy ending that the therapy between two problematic characters solves more than medical or clinical treatments. However, the narrative seems well aware of this - the happy ending theme is repeated several times in the story and is the motto of the original title -, from the moment it establishes the barrier of the main novel with Pet's idealization of rescuing a marriage that already it was over for a long time before the outbreak that made the character more misunderstood by everyone. You see, he was betrayed, there was no love there between him and Nikki (Brea Bee). All his fight for her is in vain in the romantic sense and this will only be realized when he sees that she, like many others, submits him to the hierarchy of madness, considering that in moral purposes, she was the villain of the story, not he. In a very objective way, the film integrates this as the drama factor within the romance with Tiffany, because that is where, in fact, the romantic idealization characteristic of every romantic comedy film should be.After being nominated for an Oscar for ""The Fighter"" in 2011, David O. Russell finally completely satisfies me and proves his talent behind the camera. And from a boxing drama to a ""romantic drama"", the sudden change is surprising and I was impressed with the safe direction of O. Russell, who walks with camera in hand through the cast, uses zooms at the right moments (like the great scene in which the protagonist discovers something fundamental about a letter, for example) and even a dynamic scene in the first person in a flashback, which - being placed at a certain moment in the narrative - when applying such a resource, it becomes even more surprising. Such dynamics are maintained during the projection and the skillful editing by Jay Cassidy and Crispin Struthers guarantees a formidable rhythm to the film, providing economy to the scenes of passage in time (such as the quick readings of Pat, who opens a certain book and cuts later the we see him closing and throwing him out of a window) and speed in the dance scenes, without making them incomprehensible by exaggerating the cuts and maintaining their fluidity.The cast has several highlights. Famous for his Phil in ""The Hangover"", Bradley Cooper quickly ascended in his career as an actor, and now surprises with his incredible dramatic load, although he preserves - with intelligence - a large portion of his comic charisma.Embodying a guy diagnosed with bipolar disorder, it is remarkable to see the actor's naturalness in suddenly changing his mood, whether to ensure a fun effect, as when his anger suddenly turns into joy when having his physical form praised by another character, or to shock, where the simple search for a video by the character results in him attacking his parents (the great Robert De Niro and the friendly Jacki Weaver). But who really steals the show is the irresistible Jennifer Lawrence. In a nuanced performance (his angry expressions, and a wry laugh at one point, are superb), Lawrence succeeds in showing off Tiffany's notoriety as well as her strength - something he's already done extremely well in ""The Hunger Games"" - which makes the character practically invulnerable exciting. And when the script goes deeper into her soul, we realize her humanity (and hidden feelings) the actress assumes these characteristics with the same dedication, in a touching work.Pat and Tiffany's relationship is what makes the plot of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" so compelling and fun. Their encounters are unstable and at the same time redemptive. Pat needs subterfuge and a bond with his ex-wife. Tiffany needs a partner for a dance competition. It is in these apparently silly moments, but very close to real life, that Pat and Tiffany will build a fun relationship, with ups and downs and many quirks. ""Watch for the signs"" is what Tiffany tells Pat Solatano several times. Instead of reacting to any situation he should just watch trying to understand.It's funny to see several self-help elements built into the script of Silver Linings Playbook - including the title in both languages, since in English it is an expression for ""something good found in a bad situation"" - but that within the plot are only pertinent and amusing scenes for those who suffer from bipolar disorder, a diagnosis that is not uncommon nowadays. Bipolar disorder can go from one extreme to the other in a matter of a short time. The film shows the importance of the person always keeping in mind that everything is fleeting, including sadness and memories. But this exaggerated use of positivity can also be bothersome the spectator, mainly because of the repetition in the script of the belief that believing in anything can happen. Not that this is bad, but the film manages to preach a bit of exaggeration in the motto of ""everything is fine in the end if you want it that way"". But as stated earlier, the self-help scenes sound extremely sarcastic and cynical when placed in the context of the characters.""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a film that assumes the line of clichés precisely to avoid these distorted endorsements in the message. The choice of dance as the great climax is very significant in this sense, because it is the artistic movement that made possible the union of the two, just like the film itself, while another artistic movement - mainly taking into account its genre -, made possible the therapy of two bipolar being among themselves for love and there's nothing irresponsible about it. The climax is memorable and funny, not forced at all. A story about finding love and yourself again, focused on ""Excelsior"", Cooper's key word of positivity repeated throughout the film. Finding humor in depression, without minimizing the problem, O. Russel once again does a commendable job and it's hard not to sympathize with the couple's beautiful development of charisma, with the chemistry of Cooper and Lawrence's performances and performances and not cheer so that both of you have the pleasure of enjoying this good side of life with dignity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Last film watched: Silver Linings Playbook - 10/10,"Pat Solitano leaves a mental institution and attempts to integrate himself back into normal society. Bradley Cooper plays the leading role and he smashes it out of the park. In any other year he should be nailed on for best actor Oscar, Day-Lewis will win it of course. Jennifer Lawrence cements her reputation as the best actress working in Hollywood right now with her crushingly beautiful performance as the damaged Tiffany. Robert De Niro gives his best performance in years and has some of the funniest lines. The script has many laugh out loud moments but is also heartbreaking and up lifting, touching on mental health, alienation, longing, love, family, how sport and dance can bring people together and people's attitude to mental illness (particularly the authorities). As someone who worked in mental health for a while I felt that the issues faced by Bradley Cooper and his reaction to them were portrayed perfectly. No film has touched me on so many levels as this one did for years. It also has the most iconic dance sequence since Pulp Fiction IMO and a great soundtrack. Director David O. Russell has come a long way since Three Kings and it is going to be nigh on impossible for him to follow the huge success of The Fighter and now this. If you only watch one the films nominated for Best Picture at this years Oscars make it this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Pat and Tiffany are the love couple of the 2010s.,"This movie is not a comedy. It's about how mental illness impacts an entire family, and community. Bradley Cooper's performance is brilliant. He carries this movie. The movie is character driven; it's about a mentally ill person who is trying to come to terms with people he believes he hurt while at the same time trying to accept the fact that he is mentally ill. The movie deals with issues of noncompliance with medications, resistance to treatment, parent-child issues, marital discord, domestic violence, and personal redemption. Jennifer Lawrence is endearing as a vulnerable young woman who masks her vulnerability with bravado. Robert DeNiro is great as Bradley Cooper's father. His character has issues too, which is why this movie is so wonderful: everybody in the movie has issues, and isn't that what life is about - dealing with issues? The movie generates few laughs because it's story is too serious, too down to earth and too realistic. After all, what is so funny about somebody being released from a mental hospital? One other point: Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in the dance scene are wonderful. Two endearing characters that the audience can root for, this makes for a wonderful movie. And if the plot is contrived, so what? It's a movie, and it's about people dealing with issues. Mental illness is debilitating and the recovery process can be rocky. The movie dramatizes that without becoming corny. Bradley Cooper deserves all the recognition he may receive for a strong acting performance of a complex character. After watching this movie one can leave the theater feeling not only entertained but sensitized to the needs of the mentally ill. After all, Pat can be anyone of us, and what happens to him can become anyone's story. Pat and Tiffany are the love couple of the 2010s; they have replaced George and Martha and Oliver and Barbara as icons for the dysfunctional couple and for this reason: Pat and Tiffany ring true; their relationship is strained yet passionate without being theatrical. The mother signing out her son; the father struggling to connect with his son; a young woman who feels cheated by life; and a man who is coming to terms with his own vulnerability all make for an excellent movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Definitely a movie with replay value.,"Interesting and memorable dramedy about an emotionally scarred pair, one with bipolar disorder who is recently released from a psychiatric hospital (Cooper) and the other a young widow (Lawrence). The two leads do an excellent job of showing their characters' instability without ever being overly-dramatic or pity-party about it. The story is grounded in reality very well, but the romantic climax falls into place a little too easily. De Niro, Herman, Kher, Mihok, Ortiz, Stiles, Tucker and Whigham are all terrific in their supporting roles, but it seems like Weaver might let her Australian accent slip and is definitely not convincing as a Philly homemaker. Based on the book by Matthew Quick. Definitely a movie with replay value. Captures the difficulty of living with bipolar very well and how it also interferes with loved ones.***½ (out of four)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Silver Linings Playbook simple review,"Silver Linings Playbook. At first i thought this was a reference to something that Pat, Bradley Cooper's character owned. ""Silver Lining's Playbook."" I was proved wrong once i watched it but that is what i thought at first. Pat is mentally disabled and diagnosed mentally ill. We pick up on his life when he is released out of a mental institute. His father, Pat Sr. (De Niro) is also diagnosed mentally disabled. His mother is normal. He is taken home, his parents house, to try to restart his life. He aims to get his old teaching job back and his love life back on track. He meet Tiffany (Lawrence) and the story takes off. While watching this movie i thought it was great, cute but i didn't think it deserved a Best Picture award. It was a great story and great ending but i felt it was a little bit too much of a ""chick-flick."" The cinematography and and camera angles were very cliché. Although i don't think the film deserved the nomination i do think that it was great, it was the best possible way to tell the story. I couldn't imagine the story being told any other way. If anyone was to try then it might be horrible. The production was satisfactory. In my eyes they didn't exactly hit it out of the par. The acting was able to hold up where the production dropped. Robert De Niro played his character so well. So did Cooper with his character and i see a Leading Actor Oscar in his future. There isn't very much to say about the movie other than that if you liked it that is cool, if you didn't that is also coo. This film wasn't mean to be loved is what i think. I feel like this film was meant to show the versatility of the actors and actresses in it. So if you haven't seen it go ahead and watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Plastic Linings,"To start, I want to know first if this movie is a rom-com, comedy, romance, drama or what!! 'cause I didn't find neither romance nor comedy,actually. I read a lot of positive reviews and heard very good things about it; unconventional romcom, funny, honest,...etc. So, I went with high hopes and expectations to explore this so-called masterpiece.But what I actually found is it is not only a mere average movie, but also a shallow one with predictable incidents and a dragged clichéd plot. It is too busy; mental illness, sports, book making, dancing, positivity,...etc. Every thing you can imagine is found here, but you will come out with nothing. BY the way, I did not even smile except at a scene or two at most. It is not funny at all. At each scene I waited for the next hopping to enjoy the fun, but I was hugely disappointed.Even for the soundtracks, I think Danny Elfman has done better before.I am always moved by movies about dysfunctionality-mentally or physically- but this time I really disliked the characters; a man who hit his parents, a sex addict, a gambler father. What is more laughable is that these characters are supposed to be inspirational!I can't explain till now why all that hype around it, perhaps for Bradely Cooper who was the only savior out of all that mess, and Jennifer Lawrence who's already loved by the audience. Even those two I felt the chemistry between them is lacking. Every one of them did well but each on his own, away from each other. Or perhaps people were tricked by the the hype and media to the extent that they laugh at nothing.Truly speaking, it is unfair to rate it 1/10, but I did so just to lower its general rating on IMDb as it's much more unfair to rate this awful movie 8.1/10Hope I watched LIFE OF PI once again instead of wasting my time and money on this thing",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Love and football,"Silver Linings Playbook is kind of a Jerry Maguire for 2012. There's a lot of talk about love and a lot of talk about sports - well, football mostly. And it involves two emotionally wounded characters at the forefront. But these two have way more issues going on than Jerry Maguire ever did. Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a man who just spent 8 months in a mental institution. He's technically married but problems with his marriage are part of what led him to the institution, and he doesn't know if his wife has any intent of even seeing him again. His best friend tries to hook him up with his wife's sister, Tiffany, even though Pat's main focus is to work things out in his marriage. Tiffany certainly has a dark side, which Pat fails to realize is actually fitting for him. His own wife is scared of him after all. But he's the kind of guy who obsesses on whatever he focuses on. So when he realizes that Tiffany can speak to his wife for him, he starts to pay her more attention. It's apparent that Pat gets both his temper and his obsessive ways from his father. His dad (Robert De Niro) is a hardcore sports fan who seems to care about nothing more than his hometown football team, the Philadelphia Eagles, winning. In his superstitious mind, any little thing can affect the outcome of a game. And that can include his son's well-being and even who he's dating. So Pat generally feels a lot of pressure on him, and much of the film is about his attempts to cope with his surroundings as well as making an effort to better himself as a person. Jennifer Lawrence shines as Tiffany, showing an acting range well beyond her years. It's not only her and Bradley Cooper's finest acting to date, it's also the best acting Robert De Niro has done in at least 10 years. The film even manages to bring a funny Chris Tucker out of seclusion who hasn't been in a movie not named Rush Hour in 15 years. The fact that the film was actually shot in Philadelphia is very beneficial. (Bradley Cooper is also a native.) The movie truly captures the Philly mentality and attitude better than I've ever seen on film before. And as someone who lives in Philadelphia, I know just how crazy the Eagles fans in particular can be; there's no embellishing that here. The movie's got a little something for everyone. Die-hard sports fans can appreciate it as much as those who like a good ""chick-flick"". But for everyone who watches, they'll see that no matter how bad things get, they can always find another path to get back on track.

A thoroughly enjoyable film,"I hesitated a moment before writing, since other reviews already here seem right on target. But, I will say, briefly, that the movie kept me laughing, moved, and totally attentive for its entire length. The spontaneity moment by moment is striking to experience as a film viewer, and gives a feeling of overall vitality. Since I am studying psychology, it was refreshing to see individuals with emotional challenges portrayed coping and trying to grow. It seems portrayed in a realistic manner, neither too easy nor too depressing or defeatist. Just real.Bravo to the creators of this film. I give it a 9 not a 10 because it does not really touch on eternal existential themes of survival as the greatest classics do, but as a romantic comedy/drama it seems to be at or near the top of the category.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Rather different look at mental illness.,"Pretty weird film. It's about mental illness, but looks at it in both serious and funny ways. The first half was truly great, fit a lot of different things in it and was pretty fast-paced, but the second half started to focus on other things and stretched them out.

A romantic comedy with the heart of a poet and the brain of a movie genius,"I love David Russel. He is quirky. He is smart. He has style. He knows how to make a movie live, and how to make a story pulse. He knows how touch different cords of the heart. Most importantly, he knows how to make fun with weird characters without making fun of them, and this skill is the key to the beauty of Silver Linings Playbook.The movie deals with two broken characters, Pat and Tiffany, who suffer from mental illness (bipolar disorder and depression) and are recovering from traumatic events that changed their lives. They meet by chance, and they form a bizarre friendship when they agree of doing each other a favor, which results in them being tied in long-term project until Christmas. The story is told from the point of view of Pat, recently released from a mental hospital and also dealing with his troublesome return to his parents' house.Silver Linings Playbook is an odd romantic comedy between two broken souls. Its strength comes from the genuine mixed of two opposite strategies. On the one side, it follows the template of a romantic comedy, with its predictable twists and its reassuring plot resolutions. On the other hand, it subversively refuses to follow the beaten pat, not taking comedic shortcuts and not employing shallow characters. The director follows his characters with genuine interests and love for their human faults. It refuses to divide them in good or bad. It respects their emotions and their contradictions, which are beautifully brought to life by the actors. The pain of mental illness truly comes through, and although it makes for some funny moments, is never made fun at, but instead made part of the laughter with an accepting spirit.The entire movie follows the main characters closely with steady cams, letting a vast range of emotions come through. David Russell maintains this style even in the climatic dance scene---and his decision to film the scene this way, prioritizing the character's point of view instead of the choreography, show that he is a real auteur. His style is modest, personal, original, and functional to the story.So, following the template of a romantic comedy,David Russell creates a wonderful movie about the lack of happiness in life, accepting one's own problems, dealing with the turns of fortune, and grabbing the rare opportunities that life offers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

"Hilarious, heartbreaking and heart-warming","Bradley Cooper characteristically charms in David O. Russell's hilarious, heartbreaking and heart-warming story about an asylum-dodging manic depressive who eventually finds a silver lining.Pat (Cooper) radically alters his lifestyle, even promises to manage his anger without medication, in the quixotic hope of reuniting with his cheating wife. But then he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow and self-confessed loose woman who challenges Pat's assumptions about her, leading to an unbreakable friendship. Lawrence's headstrong performance I hope ensures her career will not be mired by the monstrosity that is the 'Hunger Games' series.Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver are noteworthy as Pat's parents, especially De Niro who gives a rare performance requiring emotional depth and comedic flair. With a film this impressive, it isn't necessary to mention that Danny Elfman composed the score (but he did).However derivative O. Russell's script (based on a novel by Matthew Quick) becomes, I cannot condemn any of it. It is transcended by acting that is so honest, you find yourself focusing not on the clichés but on cheering for Pat.

"Humble, emotional, hurtful, and touching it proves that damaged hearts have a chance at love!","""Silver Linings Playbook"" is one of those films that you could classify as a drama, love story, sports film or raw comedy and true the picture has all those mixtures. Still it's one film that's filled with emotion that when one watches they will like. And be like me just don't watch the film because your a die hard Philadelphia Eagles fan, because the picture has so much to offer in the form of a love chance and a second discovery of peace and life for two hurt young people. Based on a true story then done as a book the direction on the screen is near perfect from David Russell. Anyway set in Philadelphia, PA you have Pat Solitano(in a breakout role for Bradley Cooper)an ex school teacher who's just recently left a mental ward after being treated for bi polar disorder and it's clear he probably has no chance with his ex wife. So Pat returns home to his parents mom the laid back and soft spoken Dolores(Jacki Weaver)is still with dad that's the rough and hard nose fight you in your face Philadelphia Eagles fan Pat Sr.(in one of Rob De Niro's better roles in awhile)so is this all that Pat junior has to look forward to bleeding green on Sundays and trying to read literature. Well just when you think the expected the unexpected happens Pat meets a beautiful yet troubled still outspoken and brash young lady in Tiffany(in a mature and fine performance from Jennifer Lawrence). And along the way some relationship chemistry develops slowly but surely as it proves trust can develop between two wounded hearts with some time. Really enough words can't describe this film as one needs to watch it to feel the full emotions. It proves that damaged hearts that meet have a chance for love as time, work, and compassion can heal a damaged mind proving with anybody that love in the book can cure all as two troubled people together who love one another can produce a silver lining in the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Russell gets the best from his cast in this unconventional romance,"Look around Hollywood and you get the feeling that the art of the romance movie is either dying or has been dead for some time. Romance as a genre term has practically been replaced by the phrase ""rom-com,"" and the only alternatives are gooey teen-geared fare (""Twilight"" or a Nicholas Sparks adaptation) or the occasional period love story. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" doesn't fit any one category, and perhaps therein is its bit of genius.Although you can't exactly put label on and file away director David O. Russell's follow-up to his heavily awarded ensemble drama ""The Fighter,"" that's not to say this new film is completely unique. Rather, it tells a predictable romance in an unconventional fashion.As part comedy, ""Silver Linings"" has none of the dramatic weight of ""The Fighter"" or quite the same storytelling power, but both films share one critical thing in common: convincing turns from an ace ensemble cast. Russell loves familial dysfunction, and while the stakes never feel quite as high as ""The Fighter"" (that's the last comparison), the performances have this touching humility to them. Russell clearly has a penchant for getting the best from his talent.Stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence receive a special opportunity to take their already proved talent to another level as Pat and Tiffany, two people recovering from recent past traumas with diagnosed mental issues and boatloads of sexual tension. At the same time, as much of an excuse as they have to let their characters snap without warning, they still have to make it convincing and they do.Cooper's Pat comes home to live with his parents (Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro) in Philadelphia after the court has allowed for his release from a mental institution in Baltimore. Although he refuses to take meds, we meet Pat in a place where he's on the mend, or at least believes he has the tools to overcome his past: stay positive, work to make yourself better and and look for the silver lining. The trouble is he's still hung up about his wife, Nikki, who is directly connected to the source of his issues.In taking the steps that he believes will allow Nikki to love him again, Pat meets Tiffany, whose husband died recently. She has her own philosophy for coping, and becomes a major curveball in Pat's self-prescribed plan. Her connection to Nikki through her older sister Veronica (Julia Styles) further complicates her and Pat's relationship.""Silver Linings"" dances around a bit when it comes to its core thread. Pat and Tiffany's relationship and complicated ""romance"" (it becomes clear from their first scene together that they have chemistry and will end up entangled romantically somehow) is definitely the centerpiece of the film, but it constantly shifts lenses. At first it appears to be about mental illness, then it morphs into a story about acceptance, then it focuses on making connections, then it becomes about perspectives, etc. These are all valid and generally related ideas, but the film drifts through them and the script never makes any deep cathartic breakthroughs as a result.That's when you have to start peeling back the many layers of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" to see it as a romance story and family drama. As complicated as things are between Pat and Tiffany, the essence of their relationship can be identified as a need for an honest connection, to not let the past or the judgments of others complicate what is clearly pure chemistry.The parallels to the film's family relationships are clear, though the romantic and family threads aren't quite interconnected until a plot device at the end binds them all together. In his best role in years, De Niro plays a caring but emotionally distant father obsessed with the Philadelphia Eagles. He has turned to bookmaking after losing his job and it has brought out the worst of his superstitious compulsions. His own fixation mirrors his son's, yet they are both too blinded to see the similarities in their differences.Relationship dynamics are at the heart of any ensemble film and the praise tends to get limited to acting, but Russell's direction could be the unsung hero of ""Silver Linings"" among general audiences. His camera is particularly active for a film in this genre cluster and it results in several angles and takes that add to the relationship tension. There's also an almost frenetic pacing at times that he uses to capture some of the mental instability of the main characters. It can be a frustrating tactic, but it forces us to relate to the characters by experiencing the film as they experience the world, Pat specifically.Russell occasionally veers into comic territory as well with his technique. ""Silver Linings"" draws a lot of its humor from dysfunction between characters both in written dialogue and physicality of performance, but Russell — in a way that feels spontaneous — gives the humor an extra bite so we realize we're also supposed to be enjoying ourselves while watching the film.""Silver LInings Playbook"" could at any time take a turn for the heavy side of things given the material, but Russell's choice to lean a bit more toward his quirkier roots gives it a real crowd-pleasing quality. The decidedly romantic and satisfying ending definitely assures this, but arguably of more importance, the choice accurately reflects the film's message of optimism, to see things with a certain perspective.So despite not always being cohesive and movingly eloquent, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" entertains and never apologizes for what it is — or isn't.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Nice movie; Lack ""Wow"" factors","The experience was great, it was fun/ heartwarming/ humorous at time/ and well written and executed. Yet for me it still lacks that ""wow"" factor of many great movies. And at the end by a week or two I cannot quite remember or care about it anymore.I thought the movie was written really well but it was the actor's performances that really bring out the best out of this movie. The story of a man with mental illness tries to get back his life by trying to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things change when he met mysterious girl – Tiffany.I thought Brad performance as a mental patient was really good, much better than I give him credit for all this time. I thought he was even better than Jennifer Lawrence whom also did a remarkable job here (though not really an Oscar worthy). What they both did as for the rest of the cast is what really save this movie from going straight to DVD kind of movie.Apart from good cast/ great performance and well written lines and story I can't really pinpoint anything else that standout. It was fun to watch the first time, but somehow I don't quite crave for more of it. At the end it is just another good romcom.Recommendation: Worth rental, see if you will like it because I don't really see anyone will watch it repeatedly.Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
over-rated,"In Philadelphia, a young adult man (Bradley Cooper) moves in with his parents after he has completed an eight-month term in a mental institution in Baltimore. In his parents' neighbourhood, he connects with a young woman (Jennifer Lawrence) who also has mental health problems.The film begins well with some comical moments. It has some good scenes but also some troubling ones. The main character's father (Robert De Niro) is a betting addict - often a difficult plot point in any film - and a scene in which he goes over-the-top has too much hysteria (among other scenes).There are mixed feelings about the grand finale which includes a dance contest. In many ways, it was superbly executed but sadly, the outcomes were formulaic and predictable.Cooper is certainly a good actor and does a fine job in this film. It is a demanding burden for him, however, that he is in every scene in the film. As good as Cooper is, he seems over-exposed at times.Lawrence is credited with a leading role but she does not spend nearly as much time on screen as Cooper does. Her performance is the greatest asset to this film. She shows the same sharpness here as she did in ""Winter's Bone"". It is a delight every time she is on the screen. The great veteran De Niro also has some fine moments in reflecting on times when his children were younger.This film (written and directed by David O. Russell) missed an opportunity in exploring further into a neighbourhood couple who are high-achieving and materialistic while falling apart emotionally. This would have made a good subplot.""Silver Linings Playbook"" was finely directed and acted but, like many films, its script could have been better. - dbamateurcritic",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
who thinks this was good? Not me,"After finally watching this over hyped film, I don't get why people think it is really good. I thought it was barely watchable because it was so boring. I don't get all the award nomination nor how Jennifer Lawerence could win an Oscar for this role. There was nothing outstanding about her character, Tiffany, to warrant a stand out role. And the worst part was the lack of chemistry between Bradly Cooper and Jennifer Lawerence. First he looks 20 years older than her, and why would a depressed widow want to hook up with a bipolar manic who has melt downs. Simple, it wouldn't happen.The movie is about released mental patient, Pat, goes home and is obsessed with his estranged wife. He has mental break downs and meats Tiffany whom knows his wife. He agrees to be in a dance contest with her if she will give the wife a letter. And that's the story. Nothing much happens.FINAL VERDICT: A big waste of time and it certainly wasn't one of the best films of the year. Skip it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A breakthrough performance for Bradley Cooper,"Dramatizing mental illness has always been a tricky proposition for the movies. How often have we seen such attempts devolve into either freak show comedy or horror movie madness? ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is one of the few to get it right. It's not that writer/director David O. Russell doesn't see the humor in the situations he's depicting - there are some very funny scenes in the movie - it's that he sees humor as just one small aspect of what turns out to be a far more complex and multi- layered condition.In a tour-de-force performance that finally put him on the map as an actor of extraordinary talent, Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a young man who suffers from a severe case of Bi-Polar Disorder, so severe that Pat has been spending the past few months since the dissolution of his marriage in an institution. But Pat has chosen to move back in with his parents, who work hard at trying to understand Pat's condition and to cope with his often bizarre and incomprehensible behavior. While he nurtures the fantasy that he will one day reunite with his estranged wife, Pat meets Tiffany, a local girl who seems to have as many issues as he does when it comes to functioning in the real world.""Silver Linings Playbook"" makes the not entirely novel case that all of us suffer from our share of personal quirks and idiosyncrasies - Pat's dad's superstitious obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles isn't too many steps away from the irrational concerns that dictate Pat's life - but that BPD just ratchets them up to a much higher level. The screenplay, which was adapted from the Matthew Quick novel, goes from the comical to the serious to the heartbreaking to the romantic without any noticeable grinding of tonal gears. Ditto for the nearly perfect ensemble cast which includes Robert De Niro as Pat's father, Jacki Weaver as his mom, and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, who won a Best Actress Oscar for her work.But it is Cooper who makes the movie his own. There is scarcely a moment when he does not appear on screen and the actor casts a spell over the audience from first frame to last. He avoids the role-given temptation to chew the scenery, opting instead for understatement in his portrayal of a man whose desire to fit into the world is often at odds with his ability to do so. The result is a performance that elicits both laughter and tears from the audience, but which never feels contrived or manipulative while doing so. He draws us so deeply into the core of the character that we even accept his potentially trite belief that one must look for the silver lining in even the darkest of clouds since, when you think about it, what alternative does one really have? It's a career- defining performance for an actor clearly concerned with making the most of his time in the spotlight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Excellent but not very entertaining,"A film like Silver Linings Playbook presents perfectly the age old dilemma about film. Should film be good because it is entertaining, or because it has artistic value. Whereas in most cases entertainment value is inextricably intertwined with artistry, In silver Linings playbook, the two are distinctly bifurcated. The truth is that I enjoyed Silver Linings, but not because it is an easy or particularly exciting watch. The film is very dour, filmed very conventionally, and much Too slow, too tepid for my liking. It deals with a difficult subject matter unconventionally- whereas the film is never overtly unflinching in its portrayal of mental illness, there is always an uneasy tension between the central characters which permeates most of the film. The result is a movie that is largely humourless and very messy. I also find fault with the screenplay, which may get banal, and does not offer me new insights into the world of mental illness. For a film which is heavy on dialogue, this could be a disappointment. Artistically however, the film is a triumph, due in large part to its outstanding cast. Bradley Cooper , Robert De Niro, and many of the supporting characters like Chris Tucker are all superb. The film also delves into the father-son dynamic between the junior and senior Pat, which is interesting. Then there is Jennifer Lawrence, in a bravura performance which some her the Oscar for Best actress. Her portrayal of the assertive, domineering, but ultimately vulnerable and damaged Tiffany is finely layered, nuanced, and painfully believable. Lawrence is gifted with a deep mellow voice which she uses to great effect, combined with perfectly judged expressions and mannerisms. She is able to convey beautifully well a multitude of expressions- agony, pain, indignation, and of course, bliss, as the film progresses. First rate work from a first rate actress. Lastly, the ending of the film deserves praise. It is simply done but effective in its emotional catharsis- it does not overindulge on flashiness or long drawn suspense, rather opting for a straightforward approach that befits the two hours of film preceding it. It is memorable and a wonderful ending to a meaningful story. But my problem still remains- Silver linings playbook is a difficult film to watch. This is because it is earnestly and realistically portrayed- qualities which are normally good but in this case may sap entertainment value from this movie. It deals with a topic which may not resonate with many people. It is also quite slow in its pacing, very moody, and sometimes explosive. Personally, I like watching films because they make me happy, or make me excited, or make me anxious about what happens next. Which is why is can only admire, but cannot fully enjoy the excellent film which is Silver Linings Playbook.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Great acting; bad plot,"I guess I'm probably missing something, because I heard several people saying that this film was brilliant and unmissable but I really don't understand why. All of the acting is amazing, I can't knock points for that because this film changed my mind about Jennifer Lawrence, however I really think it's been hyped too much and rated too highly for what it is. I find it somewhat insulting to great films which are rated around the 8.0 that this film got anywhere near them because, despite the brilliant acting and the somewhat well done character building, it wasn't all that it's built up to be. Most of the film is slow and it feels twice as long as it actually is which makes it quite hard to sit though. The subplot with Pat's father feels unnecessary. In fact most of the film feels as if it didn't need to be there.Worth watching, but don't expect too much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Inspiring drama with plenty of flair from start to finish,"Truthfully, the only reason I watched this movie was to see how a seemingly cut-and-paste drama could land their director an Oscar nod above the more ambitious and creative Tarantino.Silver Linings Playbook however deserves its Oscar nods, and almost even deserved that Best Director nod. With a nice realistic script and fantastic performances to follow, Silver Linings Playbook is one of the superior dramas of 2012 by combining plenty of raw emotion with charm and even some humor to ease the pain.Bradley Cooper shines as a saddened bipolar man that moves in with his parents to try to get his life together. What follows are the interactions and behavioral changes amongst everyone around him after the several months he spent away in psychiatric care. And along the way he meets a woman (Jennifer Lawrence) that might be equally as much of a mess, but also equally in need of a good friend. Based off a Matthew Quick novel, it's much more drama than anything else but the characters will grow on you and will have you rooting for them on the final act.David O. Russell is getting quite good at pulling off great performances from his cast, as he got a couple Oscars from his last movie The Fighter. This time around Bradley Cooper gives the best performance of his career by providing layers of likability even during his worst of moments and moments of detachment, while Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNrio are expectedly but still undeniably electric.The chemistry amongst everyone in the film is what carries this movie throughout and past the dimmest and slowest of moments, when the movie starts to drag a bit in the final third. Russell doesn't have much to work with to flex the directing muscles, but gets the job done by providing calm basic cinematography while also tugging the heartstrings when necessary.Overall, this movie is a good drama, pure and simple. It never becomes overly complex and bloated, it's just a straight up entertaining drama with an assortment of standout moments that swings past all the issues of running time and some fluff scenes. Silver Linings Playbook is a grounded drama that stands as one of the best of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Good film,"Good film - the story is very well done, as is the cinematography, music, dialogue, etcetera, but above all else is the wonderful performance by Bradley Cooper and I never thought I would say that. I am not a fan of his; in fact, he was my least favorite character in the Hangover series. But, here, he gives the performance of his career. Notice how I didn't mention Jennifer Lawrence yet? Oh, of course, she's excellent. But, I expect that out of her. (I have yet to see her critically, and publicly, panned horror film of 2012, so in my mind, so far, that woman can do NO wrong.) Okay, I enjoyed her once again, but again, I already expected great things from her. I was shocked by how well Cooper played the bipolar hero of our story. Recently released mental patient, Pat (Cooper,) tries to put his life in order by being positive and reclaiming his lost wife at his side. All the while, he's unintentionally testing his elderly parent's (and the police's) patience with his uncontrollable outbreaks and being wooed by the great, and almost equally messed up character of Tiffany (Lawrence.) At probably too long of a length in running time, you know how this is going to pan out, but it's still suspenseful throughout because of the excellence of acting on the side of Cooper and his raging one moment to calm the next. I don't even know too many people with this problem, and yet, I know this is realism.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

It's self-aware but never smug,"It seems over the years that all romantic comedies have been stamped with the rather dishonest label of ""chick flicks"" due to their fluffy nature and their schmaltzy screenplays that seem to cater only to the needs of day-dreaming women that are looking for ninety minutes of simple escapism. Not Silver Linings Playbook. This is a serious and simultaneously entertaining romantic comedy that doesn't substitute antics for characters or reality for humor.History teacher Paul Solitano (Bradley Cooper) has just been discharged from a mental hospital and can no return home to his parents' home after he catches his wife in the act of infidelity eight months ago and completely lost it. He learns that his father (Robert De Niro) is out of work, and making money off high-stakes gambling on the Philadelphia Eagles, and his wife has moved away and gotten a restraining order against him. Paul must now begin the time-consuming task of rebuilding his life and repair surrounding relationships in his life that have no been dismantled because of his bipolar disorder.Paul winds up meet his friend's wife's sister Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), who has been going through the pain of losing her husband and then committing random sex acts down at her workplace. Meeting each other, we can see they strike immediate chemistry, but their personal albatrosses, Paul with his ongoing devotion to finding his wife, and Tiffany with her inability to keep consistent with her behavior and emotions roadblock them into forming a solid, sustainable relationship together.After spending enough time together, Tiffany reveals to Paul that she could deliver a letter written by him to Nikki and be the messenger between them if he agrees to be her partner in a dance competition. One of the several subplots, which is handled mainly in the final half of the film, is Paul and Tiffany trying to make a bet on a dance competition and a football game work out in Paul's father's favor, as he is facing impending financial trouble with another gambler, and another one involves Paul's father's OCD and superstitions to try and make the Eagles win games. With all this madness and little sub-plots thrown into the blender, you wouldn't believe that they work in unison.The catch is they do and they do so in a method I can only relate to writer/director Alexander Payne and his barrage of delightful human comedies such as About Schmidt, Sideways, and most recently The Descendants. Payne constructs his characters with layers, making them relatable and easy to like, and writer/director David O. Russell (2010's Academy Award winning The Fighter) follows the same blueprint for success.It also came to my attention that this picture further leads Bradley Cooper down the path of an A-list actor. His role in The Hangover is miles away from this one, and his character Paul is far off anything he's ever done, yet it seems he was born to play the role of a conflicted men who isn't all there from a mental standpoint. After coming off of the disappointing Hunger Games and the pathetic House at the End of the Street, I feared Jennifer Lawrence was on a path to mediocrity, but it took me about five minutes of her on screen before those two films slipped my mind. She embodies Tiffany in such a divine, confident way I was sure that she will continue to do more great things along this line of work. She is too not falling prey to the typical child-star Disney conventions, where young, mostly female actresses pick G and PG rated pictures that do not test them at all as people or character actors. Lawrence seems to be too good for that schlock. And it must be said as well that Robert De Niro, after a string of dismissible performances, has finally found his second calling in the film industry aside from breakneck mobster features and that is the sly, humorous father figure that is desperately trying to keep his troubled son close.Both Pat and Tiffany wind up having some sort of complex, emotional outburst that affects them massively and the people around them also. Both sequences aren't played for laughs, but for complete seriousness which works in favor of the idea that Russell is not playing for cheap laughs but for respect for those with mental illnesses. Even in his sequences, Chris Tucker, noted comedian and actor that can take a light setup and drum it into something completely silly, is portrayed in a sincere light and is not offered up as the butt of the joke or a lame-brained, obnoxious best friend to reiterate everything Pat says (unlike Kevin Hart's role in Think Like a Man). Silver Linings Playbook is a simple, endearing exercise that is along the same line as Safety Not Guaranteed, in the idea that it's quirky and self-aware, but it has more to offer than stale fodder that passes for uniqueness.Starring: Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Jacki Weaver, Robert De Niro, and Chris Tucker.

"Near-brilliant mixture of personal journey, family dynamics, and romance...a cinematic gift","Director David O. Russell also adapted this winning screenplay from Matthew Quick's novel about a young man from Philadelphia at a crossroads in his life; just out of a mental institution and living with his parents, he's determined to reconcile with his estranged wife while staying off medication and keeping a new, positive outlook in order to rebuild his world. Mercurial, chatty, funny, intimately-felt and acted comedy-drama could well be Russell's most commercial enterprise yet, though one which still contains enough prickly edges to make the shifts in tone both wonderfully erratic and unpredictable. The opening scenes are broadly drawn, however the characters are a likable group, and Russell does a terrific job at sweeping the audience up into this amusing and volatile scenario (with recognizable dialogue and behavior reverberating throughout). The cast is uniformly excellent, and Russell (as both director and writer) never drops the ball, keeping his pace lively right down to the wire. ***1/2 from ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Doesn't know what to do with itself,"I felt this film was a mess. It starts out promising, with Bradley Cooper's slightly off-kilter gaze proving quite unsettling. You know he's been through a lot, and he knows it, too. We wonder what his next move will be--as does he. In the meantime, he's doing meaningful work with his shrink, who takes his job seriously.But then he meets The Girl, and the movie slowly morphs into a madcap romantic farce. Goofy parents get involved, the shrink becomes a drinking buddy, and all sense of seriousness vanishes. The scene in Cooper's living room stretches on endlessly as subplot after subplot play out, and drama and comedy are mixed so you don't know how you're supposed to feel about any of it. Is this Rain Man or Abbott and Costello?The old saw in movies used to be, Boy Gets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Gets Girl Back. Nowadays, it's Boy Gets Girl But Is Too Stupid to Realize It Until She Knocks Some Sense Into His Head. Of course, this rarely happens in real life.

Unexpected Brilliance,"I went to see this film with a few friends really not expecting much, but came out with a feeling you really don't get an awful lot. It really made me think and feel, and that is ultimately what the best films do.It comes across through trailers and short synopses as a standard run of the mill love story. The fact its got Bradley Cooper in it merely compounded this for me; I was debating not bothering at all. But, but: Bradley Cooper is sensational. He delivers a performance I did not believe possible - I see him in an entirely new light. He is helped by the fact that Jennifer Lawrence is mindblowingly good. Fierce, funny and utterly believable, the two of them convey a chemistry that is not matched often.The story is so much more than meets the eye too. Like I said, at first I believed it to be a run of the mill love film, but it is intertwined with so much more emotional aspects, family crises, mental illness and even the progress of the Philadelphia Eagles. I really don't want to give too much away because it is so cleverly binded together, but safe to say it is so much more than I first thought, and I thoroughly loved it.They say don't judge a book by its cover and it could scarcely be truer in this instance.

What romantic comedies SHOULD strive to be like. An adaptation that beats its source material!,"Silver Linings Playbook is what all book adaptations should aspire to be like. Take a book that was good and turning it into a classic film. In the same vein as The Devil Wears Prada, Silver Linings Playbook outdoes its novel and creates a wonderful story and movie. The movie is close to the book to please fans but diverges enough to give you a fresh take and entertaining film. Even though I read the book, the movie kept me guessing and intrigued the entire time. The film wins with wonderful performances from Bradley Cooper, Jackie Weaver, Robert De Niro and Chris Tucker. A standout performance was given by Jennifer Lawrence, who reminds us why she was nominated for an Oscar before the Hunger Games. Jennifer Lawrence shows why the movie was rewritten to add her despite her age. The chemistry between the leads is impeccable. THIS is what romantic comedies should aspire to be.

family world,"David O. Russell's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is not a romantic comedy in the general sense of the term. Far from the movies featuring crazy situations while it's obvious how everything will turn out, this movie looks at the problems that have affected the main characters. The behavior of the bipolar Pat (Bradley Cooper) gives one a sense of how hard it must be to be around bipolar people, while it is understood that his behavior is unintentional. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) has also had problems in her life but is looking for a change. Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro) is the character that really caught my eye: he comes across as a damaged individual who just does what he thinks is best.The movie adds up to a really good look at what Pat has to go through to reach his full potential. It was also interesting seeing Chris Tucker in this movie, since we've gotten used to him playing silly roles. He's very believable in this serious role. Really good film.

A movie that knows just when to break the rules,"The problem I have with romantic comedies is that they are the most formulaic and hidebound of all the genres. If it's a comedy, then by definition it has to have a happy ending. And if it's a romance, the only happy ending is to have the two leads get together. So usually I'm just tapping my toe, waiting for the leads to get through the requisite squirming before the inevitable.Lately, we've seen a variety of crude gags thrown into the mix, presumably to distract us from this inevitability This movie does a great job of hewing closely enough to the standard romcom formula to keep an audience satisfied, while undercutting it enough to surprise us now and then and prevent us from seeing exactly where it's going at any point. The outcome of the big dance contest is a perfect example.It's not easy to write a movie that's this particular, this original and yet satisfying.

I can only echo what reviewer Pinko 2004 wrote:'This film contains a horrific depiction of mental illness that objectifies human beings as caricatures. Cooper's character, who is supposedly the film's primary protagonist, is portrayed in such a disturbing way that an uninformed viewer could not be blamed for thinking that those who are bipolar - a very real illness with very real, good people who suffer from it - are all miserable, violent people who obsess over others to the point of stalking them.'Absolutely!

The best film of the year!,"David Mamet blew me away with The Fighter. What looked like a generic sports drama from the trailers was really an intricate, overly entertaining, emotionally resonant character piece. I'm not sure how this came across in the trailers to me but there is no way it came across as brilliant there as the actual film is. Silver Linings like the fighter is an intricate character piece but even more evolved that film. It tackles complex, off the wall characters and story elements and combines them into a wonderfully unpredictable and emotionally endearing grade A cinematic stew. The film tells the story of a man named Pat (Cooper) who after an 8 month stint in a mental institution is released under his mothers care. You see he had a break because he found his wife cheating on him and was suffering from an undiagnosed bipolar disorder. Along comes Tiffany (Lawrence) a young woman who has just lost her husband and is living with a variety of personality disorders. They meet a rom com storyline forms but doesn't move in the way you'd expect. This is a film about damaged, imperfect people. People everyone of us can relate to if we are honest. There are scenes of such emotional vigor and astonishing rawness it's hard to tell you're even watching something that has been orchestrated. Bradley Cooper sheds his Hollywood image and opts for an intensely brave and personal performance. Jennifer Lawrence shows up reminding us why she was nominated for an Oscar for Winter's Bone. Her character Tiffany is so fully realized through her performance it's hard to put in words. It's so real and unhinged it hurts to watch. Robert DeBiro stars as Pat's father in his best performance in years he displays the emotional complexities of his character his slight OCD, the longing for a relationship with his son and the fear he feels about it. Jackie Weaver is also really amazing as Pat's Mom so maternal and not in a scary way like her other mesmerizing performance in Animal Kingdom. Chris Tucker even shows up for some light hearted fun, some of his best work ever. Also I would love to spotlight the inspired cinematography the constant tracking shots really freshened up the events and kept things feeling new. The thing about this film is that it's not perfect. But it's about those imperfections who make us who we are and form the relationships and experiences we have. It's an honest, funny, hilarious, endearing and memorable film.

Feel-good rom-com.,"I really enjoyed this one. Solid plot and some extraordinary performances (Robert De Niro above all: I would give him an Oscar for this one). The way the main characters are rendered throughout the film is natural: it feels like they could really be someone you know in your real life. Also co-protagonists are gorgeously portrayed: Pat's family, the doctor, the neighbours (John Ortiz and Chris Tucker's characters are hilarious). Once again, Robert De Niro at his best: love the way he manages to give such depth to minor characters just by...'DeNiroizing', I'd say...them.

Awesome Movie - A Must Watch,"I'm not really a great movie critic, but I like to think that I can appreciate the differences in styles of directing, especially how the movie is projected to the viewer.I don't really go for the classic rom-com, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence play exceptional roles in this one, in fact the whole cast do. From start to finish you're intrigued as to how the movie will play out, each step of the way you feel more drawn to the characters and the acting really pulls you in to the emotions that such individuals would be feeling.Honestly, my opinion is you must go and watch this. Yes there are 'cheesy' moments and it does follow the similar theme that any romantic comedy would follow, but with more subtlety (especially with the comedy).I have a medical background and I assure you that Bradley Cooper really nails the role right on the head.10/10 is maybe too much to award, but that's my opinion.

A warts and all look at mental illness, it's a film of unassuming beauty, pottering along with great ease during the two hour running length, but underneath the breeze is a resonating story of strength, courage and a love the likes of which we rarely see on the big screen.Annoyingly, if you take a quick glimpse at the synopsis, Silver Linings Playbook wreaks of Academy Award worthiness. Adapted from Matthew Quick's debut novel, it's the story of Philadelphia, bi-polar thirty something Pat (Bradley Cooper), a high school substitute teacher who's mother (Jacki Weaver) has just bailed him out of a mental institution – against doctor's orders – after an eight month residency. What caused him to snap? He came home one day to find panties on the floor, his Stevie Wonder wedding song on the stereo, and his wife Nikki having sex with another man in the shower. Traumatized, he beat the guy within an inch of his life, and since then has lost everything – the job, the wife, the life and his sanity.Pat returns to the real world and moves in with his doting mother (Jacki Weaver) and gambling addicted Eagles devotee father (Robert De Niro). Down but not out, he's convinced he can get his life in gear and win back his wife, even though she has sold their house, moved away and has a restraining order on his head.Along the way, he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow turned sex addict, fired from her job after sleeping with everyone in the office. Like Pat, she's a little bit crazy, and they turn their unlikely power dynamic into a therapeutic friendship. Spending every day together, the two compare medications, partake in public fits of rage, and find themselves trading favors – and dance moves – to get what they want.Whilst the young Lawrence has already put in some astonishing performances so far with Winter's Bone and The Hunger Games, Cooper is the real surprise treat here, finally matching his affability with a character of some depth.Together thought, they have a natural magnetic charge which drives the film and elevates it from being another harangued look at mental illness. De Niro puts in his best performance in recent memory as the negligent OCD father trying to win back his son's love. Even Chris 'Rush Hour' Tucker is great in a brilliantly muted performance as Pat's delusional friend. When that guy shuts up, he really has some screen presence.But all of these performances would be nothing without O. Russell's eloquent screenplay. Whilst his jolting hand-held cinematography suggests child's play, his words are that of a seasoned professional. Whilst it is no doubt a marketing catastrophe, the script makes the film unclassifiable, vigorously shifting between comedy, drama and tragedy, whilst never waning the audience's interest, or turning to the quirk/irksome like O. Russell's god-awful I Heart Huckabees.It's nowhere near the best film of the year acclaim I've seen it garnered with – the pacing can be off, and it doesn't really get moving until Lawrence turns up on screen – but Silver Linings Playbook is nevertheless a great movie. With just enough crowd-pleasing sweetness, sexiness and O. Russell idiosyncrasies, it's an empathetic and moving look at people in dire straits, on the search for a silver lining. Tiffany and Pat find it in each other, and you'll find it in this film.More reviews at www.366movies.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"Unconventional, But Could Have Been Ripped From Today's News","For one reason or another I don't see many movies these days, so I had never seen or heard of the two primary actors in this movie, Bradley Cooper and the beautiful Jennifer Laurence. Watching them on screen in this movie, though, has truly been eye opening. They are both brilliant, if not totally realistic, in this film in their depiction of mentally ill people trying to return to ""normalcy."" The only actor I recognized immediately was Robert DeNiro, and his performance was, I think, his best in may years. The supporting actors in the cast were also uniformly good, especially Chris Tucker. Severe mental illness and other neuroses are not a laughing matter, but this film uses fantastic humor to bring those problems to our attention. And that mentally ill people - rather beautiful people in this film - need love as much, if not more, that the rest of us is something to think about. Despite the subject matter, this is still a romantic comedy. It's poignant as well as terrifically funny. Go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Crazy in Love,"This film is recommended."" Every cloud must have a silver lining, Wait until the sun shines through, Smile my honey dear, while I kiss away each tear, Or else I shall be melancholy too! ""Lyrics from My Melancholy Baby by E. Burnett, G. Norton, & M.WatsonLove is strange. The search for Mr. or Mrs. Right comes with many obstacles and every relationship comes with its own special baggage. Some of its contents are neatly folded and with room to spare, nicely hidden in each fold while others are ugly and messy and filled to the brim. It's the latter type of baggage that we find in Bill O. Russell's dramedy, Silver Linings Playbook, a romantic comedy that always entertains, even if it willingly sacrifices realism in favor of that evasive feel good feeling.Meet Pat and Tiffany, both bi-polar and both in need of love. Pat is just off a broken marriage for nearly a year, the result of his angry issues. Recently released from a mental institution due to a nervous breakdown, he encounters Tiffany, a tough-as-nails promiscuous widow, hasn't quite made it in the world of dating. Neither have the social skills or reserve to be seen as followers of the norm. In fact, they're the type of person that one avoids at all costs. Quirky with a capital Q, to put it nicely.In fact, everyone in this Philadelphia neighborhood seems to be off kilter. Dad ( a solid Robert DeNiro ), an avid Eagles fan with anger issues of his own, has OCD and a heavy gambling problem. Mom ( Jackie Weaver, good but underused ) is the typical loving enabler, trying to calm everyone around her. All of their friends and relatives have less than happy lives. There's nowhere to go but up in this part of town.Director / writer David O. Russell takes a very familiar scenario, two lovable misfits battling the odds, and plays it a little too safe. He seems more concerned with making a crowd- pleasing melodrama without any real consequences to his well-drawn characters. Russell's dialog is insightful and clever, quite poetic at times. but his plot structure is all over the place. He places his characters in different situations to force their reactions which ring false. Their highs and lows are mere plot devices to advance the story, but never go deeply into their mental instability or fragile state of mind. His intriguing lead characters deserve more than the film's predictable (and far fetched ) outcome.However, it is the two main actors and their natural chemistry together that takes Silver Linings Playbook to a more honest and emotional level for the movie-going audience. Both actors lash out at each other, creating a commanding presence on screen. Bradley Cooper has never been better. He conveys the angst and confusion, that twisted sense of optimism that his character needs to survive. Jennifer Lawrence plays her damaged character openly raw and masking the internal pain. It is a remarkable portrait of vulnerability and inner strength. Yet what makes their performances so strong and memorable are the subtle glances, the silences, and words not shared between the cruelty of their actions.If only the film would have been more courageous and truer to the issue of mental illness and its effects on loved ones, Silver Linings Playbook could have been a great film. It scores periodically whenever it starts to think outside the box and not follow the winning formula of most romantic comedies. But more often, the film is content to settle on staying inbounds and following that norm.

Another film about mental disorders that CAN make viewers mentally-disordered,"Like The Descendants, this is another film that makes its characters shouts and screaming at each other all the time. But it doesn't work very well. Okay, if the main character has problems that is fine but his family, supposedly normal folks, doesn't look normal to me as they did not realistically try to keep things as low-profile as possible. As if they enjoyed the attention of them being the most annoying family in the neighbourhood. I am not convinced whether the movie is accurate in portraying the realm of clinical psychology, and it made even worse with a cliché and even more unrealistic ending. Maybe I am off-the-mark of what the film is trying to show here, but seems to me everyone (including the dancers which made a remark that I felt was really silly) and even the film itself is kind of dysfunctional and the only person that made realistic sense to me, despite her aggressive behaviour, is Jennifer Lawrence's character.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Silver Lining Playbook: Recipes for Success,"I won't beat around the bush and I will get right to the point. This movie is probably the best movie of the year by far. Every single actor in this movie played their parts perfectly and I couldn't ask for a better cast. Every performance blew me away. The directing and writing done by David O. Russell is great. I found absolutely nothing wrong with this. Well, there was this one thing. It made me nearly bite off my thumb nails in suspense near the end. Actually that's not really a bad thing, but whatever. I strongly recommend seeing this film. If you are torn between this film and Les Miserables, look at what you want to see in a movie today. Do you want to be involved in a journey through France and the craziness of that great musical or would you rather stay right here in America. You'll laugh. You'll cry.

Excellent Excellent Movie.,"I must tell you that through out the movie I was getting a little exasperated. By the end of the movie though, it all came together. That was just the superb acting/directing/writing/producing coming down on me. Jennifer Lawrence...WOW! Her acting was amazing, and Bradley Cooper was terrific. And such a great supporting cast. I won't give it away, but how you feel through the movie is exactly how you should as you live the characters scene by scene. It comes to a masterful conclusion and I have a great respect for Jennifer Lawrence(She is not just beautiful folks),even more so now, and Bradley Cooper as well.Not everyone can appreciate a well done performance such as this, but then there are some who made Honey BOO BOO popular too...just think about that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
524th Review: Easily the best rom-com of 2012 and better than that,"SLP is a very well-judged, beautifully acted and just plain entertaining slice of rom-com. With an outstanding ensemble team thisworks - it entertains, and uncommonly for a rom-com, it makes us use our brains and not just out hearts.The two damaged protagonists are just the right side of crazy, more deeply heartbroken and mad at it than psychiatrically gone, and as we share their journey we do so taking a little of ourselves with them.This really is one of my favorite films of the year - and it stands out by a mile in the cinema as being a film about the pursuit of happiness whereas we have a decade of maudlin films this mixes the sorrow and the joy just right.SLP is worth seeing for the performances and the killer script alone, but it is how it lingers after that will get you. Good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Uplifting and cleansing movie!,"After watching this movie, I can see why it has been nominated for and won so many awards. At first glance, it may just seem like a typical run-of-the-mill romantic movie, but it goes much deeper than that. The movie is about Pat (Bradley Cooper), who has recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a man who is working to improve himself to impress his ex-wife. He ends up meeting Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who also suffers from deep emotional issues. These two awesomely unconventional individuals fuel the flames that make this movie so unique and so great.Bradley Cooper's acting is incredible, portraying his bipolar and extremely straightforward character so well that you forget he is acting. Jennifer Lawrence also does a great job as Tiffany, showing incredible depth to her pain and the emotions in her life.Besides the excellent acting of the two main characters, another great thing about this movie is how refreshingly positive it is. Honestly, as messed up as Pat and Tiffany are, most people can probably relate to them in one way or another. It is really interesting watching Pat struggle through trials to become a better version of himself. And deep down, aren't most of us doing that everyday; working to become better?Maybe the reason this movie touches so deep is because it can speak to every one of us; to show us that you can be better. That no matter how messed up things can get, there is still hope for improvement. Excelsior!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Unbearably dull,"I was expecting to like this film sadly my hopes were dashed pretty early on. The film started badly and just kept on going down and down. This is without doubt one of the most tedious films I have ever seen and I can only congratulate myself on sitting through the whole two hours.I am struggling to see what this film was trying to be. Drama? Nope there wasn't any. Comedy? Nope not a chuckle to be had. Romance? I suppose you could make a half hearted argument for that one but watching two unlikeable characters fall in love is hardly romantic.This film was just two hours of inane and boring dialogue. The acting was weak, I find it incredible that the charmless, expressionless and limited Jennifer Lawrence actually won an Oscar for this. Surely one of the biggest travesties in Oscar history. Bradley Cooper was just plain annoying and even Robert De Niro could do nothing to save this turkey although he is by some distance the best thing about this film.There really is not one aspect of this film I enjoyed and it's rare I can say that about any film.

I was compelled to write a review on how good this movie was!,"I went to see this movie because of how many nominations it has garnered for the past month and also my one and only Ms. Jennifer Lawrence is in it. I loved it... I don't get when people say they were bored or the story was weird. It's supposed to be weird (They're crazy!!!) At first, I was skeptical with the Bradley Cooper and J Lawrence pair up but damn they fit quite well together. This is one of those movies that tell you how life gets so crazy you just gotta live with it. Acting was nothing under amazing! No one was out of place everyone did their job whether it be to provide comical relief or to add drama to the screen they all did wonderfully.This movie is ALSO NOT ONLY FOR GIRLS! I put it in Caps since most guys will probably think this movie (looking at its poster) is positioned towards women but no it is not. You'll enjoy it nonetheless.Kudos for a wonderful movie from 2012! And Congrats to all the nominations and wins this movie has gotten so far!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
A meaningful and entertaining portrayal of 'real life',"With De Niro on cast, how can you go wrong? I walked in with on expectations and very little known about the movie - it was all on a whim. I walked out with (admittedly) watery eyes and a renewed faith in the power of basic human relationships.This film was so well-balanced in its writing, exploration of micro and macro issues and quality acting that I was so engaged and drawn in I felt strong emotions for each and every character in the film. It has been some time since I have seen a film in the theater that so moved me to write an online review. Hats off to everyone involved in this film -you should be proud.

"Just a delightful film for those of us with bipolar disorder or depression, or the family members we can't help but bring along into our messy lives.","First of all, Bradley Cooper has blown my mind. He is SO good as Pat, so vulnerable and sweet, if also a little neurotic, anxious, and obsessive. When he speaks to his therapist and he says something about he has always known he wasn't quite right, and you can hear the palpable relief in his voice. It is so relatable to those of us who have been there, suffering from an undiagnosed mental illness, knowing something was wrong with us but not knowing what. To finally figure it out, it is a relief of epic proportions, because finally you know that the healing process can start.Robert Deniro gives a wonderful performance as Pat's father, who suffers from anger issues and is a bit OCD. He has never felt close to his son, but he is trying in this film, and whats more, we can see he is trying. They have a brief tender moment which brought tears to my eyes, as he tries to talk to his son about wanting to help him, wanting to spend time with him. It is moving and just a great Dinero scene.Jennifer Lawrence is great, playing Tiffany, a tough but vulnerable woman whose husband has been killed and lost her job from sleeping her way around the office, the way she deals with her depression. Lonely,and one of those people who likes to help others but wakes up in the morning realizing she's gotten nothing in return, she thinks she finds a kindred spirit in Pat portrayed best in a great scene around a dining room table having dinner with Tiffany's sister, Veronica (played by Julia Stiles) where she and Pat get into talking about all the meds they've been on and how they make them feel, much to the discomfort of Veronica and her husband.I don't want to say too much more, as it really is a wonderful film that should be experienced in the flow. Its funny, painful, and a romantic comedy of profound meaning. If you want to see any Holiday Romance film, this is the one to see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
"If you're crazy, you must be in love","If you are calling this a 'rom-com' you are misinformed. This is a dark comic look at mental illness, with the possibility of love.Bradley Cooper is Pat (who has an unspecified anxiety disorder)released from a facility after almost beating to death the man who was having an affair with his wife Nikki. He's lost his job, his home and is living with his parents. Dad (Robert De Niro)has trouble with anxiety as well. It seems almost everyone in this movie suffers some sort of disorder. Pat is convinced he can win back his wife if he can make his life manageable. His friend's wife sets him up with her sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) a widow also suffering. She says she will deliver a letter to Pat's wife Nikki (Pat can have no contact because of a restraining order), if Pat will dance with her in an upcoming competition. Pat believes his compassion for Tiffany and commitment to the competition will prove to Nikki he's ready for her to take him back.Bradly Cooper if fantastic. He conveys all the anxiety, confusion, mania and anger you might expect from someone a little out of step with everyone else. There is no wink, no subtle nod that 'I'm not really crazy, this is a game'. This is a very true performance. Robert De Niro is compelling as well in his belief that his son is somehow controlling the destiny of the Philadelphia Eagles football team. Jennifer Lawrence also does very good job.The Silver Linings Playbook says you can have a great fulfilling life with mental illness... but you need a strategy... Excelsior!

"""Silver Linings"" is a fantastically refreshing, Oscar-worthy screwballer","""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a rare kind of film. It's a difficult task to honestly and realistically present characters who are struggling deeply with heavy issues, without tipping over into emotional goo and sentimentality But David O. Russell is the man for the job, expertly leading four of his talented actors to Oscar nominations in a film that gives a delightfully raw edge to screwball comedy. Bradley Cooper stars as a recently released mental patient, trying to put his life back together and reunite with his estranged wife with the help of a similarly struggling Jennifer Lawrence, who is recovering from the death of her husband. Their relationship buds and grows around their practice for a dance competition that Lawrence wants to dance in, and around Philadelphia Eagles football. Co-starring Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, and Chris Tucker, ""Silver Linings"" is a quirky, affecting love story about the power of staying optimistic and the strength of family bonds, brimming with characters you want to cheer for. That I wouldn't be at all upset if this poignant comedy took home Best Picture, in a year of so many fine candidates, should be enough to get you to go see it today.-Thomas Bond",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Excellent Character Study,This film was excellently written and had solid performances by the cast. Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job in this role and is one of his best performances in my opinion. Equally matched by the stellar young Jennifer Lawrence this showcased her exceptional acting skills. I found myself drawn to the characters and emotionally invested in their outcomes. It is not a film for everyone with the heaviness of the content however for those who appreciate fine cinematic experiences then I would highly recommend you see the film. Chris Tucker added a lightheartedness to the film that showcased his great comedic timing and depth that I have not seen from him before. Robert De Niro just seems to keep getting better with age and this film showed sides of him that we don't get to see too often. David Russell did a phenomenal job of directing such strong players and from the man who last brought us The Fighter I would expect no less. He seems to have a talent in allowing the actors to stretch the bounds of their normal comfort ranges and elicit amazing and heartfelt performances that we just don't see elsewhere. Overall this exceeded my expectations and I wouldn't be surprised to see some nods come awards season.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"

Casey's Movie Mania: SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (2012),"Two years after his critically-acclaimed boxing drama in THE FIGHTER (which also won Christian Bale his first Best Supporting Actor Oscar), writer-director David O. Russell has finally returned to his roots (quirky comedy, that is) in SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK. The result is one of his funniest movies to date. That's not all -- SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is the ultimate feel-good movie of 2012, anchored by memorable cast and witty screenplay all around.Adapted from Matthew Quick's 2008 novel, the story centers around Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper), a former substitute teacher who is an emotionally troubled man returns to his Philadelphia home of parents Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) and Dolores (Jacki Weaver) after spending eight months in a Baltimore mental institution. Apparently he is ordered to stay there because he had nearly beating a man to death following an affair with his wife Nikki (Brea Bee). He is certainly a short-tempered person, where he suffers a severe case of bipolar disorder -- a condition related to manic depressive illness. And yet he refuses to stay on his medication and believes he can control himself. Now he vows to do everything he can to win back his wife -- starting by getting in shape and such. The problem is, his wife already filed a restraining order against him, which made him even more difficult to achieve his goal.During that time, Pat has unexpectedly making friend with an emotionally troubled widow named Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a self-proclaimed ""crazy slut with a dead husband"". Then Tiffany offers to pass along a letter to Pat's wife, since she sees her regularly, on the condition that Pat will help her as a partner to compete in a local dance competition.Judging by the premise, there's actually nothing original about the story. But yet, it was the way of its execution that made the movie so compulsively watchable. Thanks to Russell's entertaining script, the plot is constantly funny and involving while the quirky dialogue are razor-sharp. Russell's direction is also top-notch especially the way he play the situation about the subject of mental illness and of course, two psychologically unstable protagonists (Pat and Tiffany) for genuine laughs without resulting into cheap mockery or mindless slapstick.Apart from Russell's awesome piece of work, the cast are remarkably ace as well. In his best performance to date, Bradley Cooper has never been this charismatic before. What's more, his neurotic acting is often fun to watch for. As Tiffany, Jennifer Lawrence gives another tour de force performance in her career. No doubt she projects a magnetic screen presence here. She can be tough, vulnerable, sassy and sexy (love her dark hair) and most of all, an amazingly funny actress rolled all into one. She's a completely perfect acting package. Other supporting roles are equally captivating as well: Robert De Niro has never been this spontaneous in a long while as Pat's father who is particularly superstitious with football; Jacki Weaver is delightful as Pat's caring mother while Chris Tucker appears in a memorable cameo as Pat's best mental-ward buddy. It's nice to see him playing a well-balanced comic relief without exaggerating his larger-than-life persona we used to find him in movies like RUSH HOUR trilogy. Even smaller roles like Anupam Kher as Pat's therapist, Julia Stiles and John Ortiz as Pat's neighborhood friends, Veronica and Ronnie, have their own share of limelights as well.Technical credits are well-calculated here with great use of its Philadelphia setting in the suburban area that you almost feel like home. Masanobu Takayanagi's zooming hand-held camera-work and Jay Cassidy's hyperactive editing combined well together to mirror the twitchy effect of Pat's whirlwind mindset. Completing the tech package are Danny Elfman's music and a perfectly-chosen soundtrack supervised by Sue Jacobs (especially that Stevie Wonder's evergreen love ballad My Cherie Amour).SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK could have been a five-star comedy masterpiece, if not for its minor flaw. Too bad the middle part sags a little as if Russell is struggling to maintain the perfect momentum. But once the climactic finale kicks off with a local dance competition involving Pat and Tiffany (a memorable one, indeed), the movie is certainly exhilarating enough with a highly-satisfying payoff.So if you are looking for a current movie that puts a big smile on your face and characters that you can root for, look no further than SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
perfectly cast actors - superb!,"Casting director hit gold with choice of actors. Can't imagine anyone else playing their respective roles more perfectly. Especially Jennifer L. who never looks like she's acting. Conveying deep emotional expressions naturally, (which you just can't teach in acting school), she may very well covet an Oscar for her performance. Ditto for Brad C. and supporting actors. The dancing sequence was a bit too short for me. Now I want to see Jen in ""Dancing with the Stars"" because she really IS a star! I'm sick of these, ""WHO? WHA? never heard of them"" celebs.

Best movie of 2012,"Been wondering all year when a truly good movie would show up, and this one is it. The subject matter of the mentally ill was not all that different or special, but what made this film special was the screenplay first and then the marvelous dead-on acting of the entire cast. Jennifer Lawrence will surely be the next big name in female actors, as she was so natural and real in her demanding role that you never saw the acting, just the character. Bradley Cooper played well the lead ""problem person"" in this film of many, his riveting blue eyes nailing to the wall any he looked at and spoke to. Robert DeNiro, in yet another role as an off-center parent, was his terrific self in much more than just a supporting role as he was integral to story development.But, above it all was the truly great David Russell screenplay, as we have all seen stories with similar subject matter that were harmed or even ruined due to out of place and/or flat comedic elements and collective bad acting or a low quality script. This movie not only had the gravitas of truth and honesty in it that most don't have a clue about, but it also glowed from the very rare and intangible inner magic of a screen writing gem that resulted in an ensemble triumph most films would not even hope for, much less obtain.In your lifetime, if you have ever felt marginalized or on the sidelines or not really ""in"" life due to personal issues, and that covers most of us at one time or another, do yourself a true favor and see this wonderful movie of initial anguish and despair that eventually becomes one of believable hope and triumph.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
More Mature Than the Book,"I have recently read the book by Matthew Quick, admittedly in preparation for watching this movie. While the book had a decidedly child-like tone being told in Pat's mentally-disturbed point of view, this movie is a lot more dramatic and serious in tone. The romantic comedy is still in there, but this film is more mature than the book.From the onset, you already knew that this was not going to be an exact depiction of the book. A lot of changes were noted in the transition from book to film. For some reason, the surname of Pat's family was changed from Peoples to Solitano for some reason. The tune Pat hates was changed from the really cheesy ""Songbird"" by Kenny G to the less cheesy ""My Cherie Amour"" by Stevie Wonder. All the football stories in the book were summarized into one tailgate party scene in the parking lot of the Philadelphia Eagles' stadium.The story progression and development and the climax is totally different from the book but decidedly more effective cinematically. These changes made were in no way insulting or disappointing to the fans of the book. It did lead to an ending we have seen so many times before in several a romantic comedy in a scene not even in the book. But for the sake of the goodwill built up by the very effective chemistry of the two charismatic lead stars, audiences will love it and cheer.It is truly remarkable that a romantic comedy could garner nominations in the top 5 Oscar categories and then some. Aside from Best Picture, Director, Screenplay (adapted), this film had the rare distinction of having a nominee in ALL 4 ACTING categories!While I read the book, I already had Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in my mind in their respective roles as Pat and Tiffany. While I can fully imagine Cooper as Pat, I simply cannot imagine Jennifer as Tiffany. However, while watching the film, Jennifer could not have been a more apt choice. She pulls off this very mature role convincingly with a ferocity and sexiness heretofore only hinted at in ""X-Men First Class.""Bradley Cooper so far we remember only for his stupid ""Hangover"" movies. He gave us a glimpse of his acting versatility in ""Limitless"" in 2011. But this role as Pat seemed to have been written with him in mind. He had embodied this role of the troubled bipolar guy to a perfect T. He remains likable despite his condition, as Pat was in the book. As portrayed by Cooper, audiences will root for this guy.While the book had a more dominant role of Pat's Mom, Jacki Weaver had to take a backseat to Robert de Niro in the meatier role of Pat's Dad. Ms. Weaver can count herself lucky to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as her role had been considerably edited in the final screen version. Glad to see De Niro back in good comic form as Pat's supportive Dad. As originally written, Pat's Dad hardly had any dialog nor much to do. I guess this role was rewritten to deserve the talent of the actor they signed for it.As for its quest to be the first contemporary romantic comedy since ""Annie Hall"" (1977) to win best picture, I do not think that is completely impossible. However, win or no, this movie will be a favorite of many audiences, even for guys only forced by their significant others to watch with them. It will make you feel good and smile when you leave the theater, and that is what we all like.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Hollywood marketing at work?,"I did not want to waste my time writing this. Is this the result of some sort of new marketing scheme? Was the book really THAT good? Because if it is, then people should be in outrage about this film.J. Law missed it and she had a pretty good track record til now.Acting wasn't horrible but certainly not ""award winning"" materials.Story's not interesting. screenplay has potholes.grrrrrrrrrrrrrrh... this frustrates me.People! Do not become manipulated by these marketing whores.This is a B movie. Not even a great B movie at best. It should have been a TV movie.Not even worth the DVD rental.You've been warned.Thank you and disregard this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
My favorite film I've seen in years.,"My best friend who is a female in her 30's and my 22 year old little brother are both bipolar. Watching not just Pat struggle with his disorder but everyone who is in Pat's life also struggle with how to deal with it definitely hit me close to home. The presentation was so true and real that it resonated with me, the way you sometimes hear veterans talk about a perfectly done a war movie. This film captures the struggles that go along with loving someone who is affected by mental illness. You're not just watching these characters live their lives but you find yourself completely filled with empathy as if you just received an adrenaline shot. Having watched my little brother throw out relationships with people over the years, I found myself rooting for both Pat and Tiffany in a way that I almost never get caught up in modern movies. Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Chris Tucker are all absolutely perfect. I recommend this film to anyone from any walk of life but you especially have to see it if you have anyone in your life that you love who wrestles with mental illness. I haven't FELT a movie like this in years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
Deserves all the accolades...,"Pat Solatano ( Bradley Cooper) is serving a mandatory eight month sentence in a mental institution. He feels he is now ready to leave and reclaim all that he has lost.his wife, his career, his home, his life. His mother Dolores (Australia's Jackie Weaver) has agreed to bring him home and as part of his release, he must live with his parents. His father Pat Sr (De Niro) is unaware of this agreement. It doesn't take long before we realise this is a family fractured by their son's mental illness. It is not an angry, bitter fracture but more a silent resignation of how things are.Pat Sr is recently unemployed and is attempting to make enough money to start a new business via bookmaking. He bets mostly on the Philadelphia Eagles football team. The entire family are unswervingly loyal Eagles supporters and the rituals and superstitions that go hand in hand with this obsession. well let's just say that it is easy to see where Pat Jr may have inherited some of his ummm quirks.Pat does not want to take his medication for bipolar disorder because he doesn't like the way it makes him feel. This causes some interesting moments, some amusing, some rather serious and as anyone who has lived with family or friends who are 'off their meds' can attest, it can go either way at any moment. One of his biggest goals is weight loss. It is never addressed exactly how much weight he has lost during his stint at the institution but as most people comment on how well he looks, one can assume it is rather significant. To this end, Pat runs every day wearing a full tracksuit and a black plastic garbage bag..the garbage makes him sweat thus hastening the weight loss.It is during his daily runs that he is consistently 'ambushed' by Tiffany (Lawrence), a young woman he was introduced to by a friend at a recent dinner party. Their initial interactions are awkward and mildly hostile. Tiffany has issues of her own and she seems to instinctively know how to push Pat's buttons. The two form an almost unbearably uncomfortable relationship with the most basic of social interactions difficult for them. Yet it's good for both of them, this much is obvious and thus gives the fledgling relationship momentum.Tiffany agrees to help Pat win back his wife and he in turn agrees to enter a local dance competition with her. The relationship changes and flourishes as the pair prepare for the competition.This movie is touted as a dramatic comedy and there are some laughs but it is heavier on the drama. And this is a very good thing. The developing relationship between this emotionally damaged pair is lovely to watch. It did take me a little while to warm to this movie but in hindsight, this was possibly because it was very real.The reality is that most of us are damaged in some way and just because you are not diagnosed or on medication is irrelevant. Too often in movies the dialogue between couples is fluid and clever and witty. This rarely happens in real life, despite what those dating website advertisements want us to believe. There are awkward pauses and confronting comments. The wrong things is said and reacted too. You try to be on your best behaviour but why should you have to be? Why should someone not accept you for who you are? And that is the secret to this movie.It is about relationships that are not perfect between people who are not perfect. And that is okay. We learn to adjust and live with and love these non perfect people and if we are very lucky, they will love us right back. We can try and fix ourselves and try and fix those we love but when all the superficial stuff is gone, love is just love. Sometimes the one we love is not the one for us and we have to deal with that before we can see clearly. Most of us have been in this situation and can relate to the frustrations and pain that it causes. To lose the one you love, no matter how it happens, is painful. It's what you do next that is important.Try and see this movie because it does live up to the hype and all the awards are richly deserved.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Drama, Romance"
