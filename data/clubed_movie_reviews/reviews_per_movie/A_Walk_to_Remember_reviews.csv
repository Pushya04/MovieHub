Shining stars....,"This was one of the best films I've seen lately. Mandy Moore shone in her role as Jamie Sullivan, although never to the point where she became unbelievable. Her singing was fabulous, but it was clear that this was not a film about her singing - too many pop artists starring in films wind up in films about their pop careers, whether real or inferred.The storyline was VERY good. I can't say too much without spoiling it for everyone else, but take my word for it. You absolutely must watch this film at some point - make sure you grab plenty of tissues though, because if you don't get emotional towards the end, you must have a heart of stone.All in all, fantastic.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Most touching movie I have seen in years,"Though I do not often make comments on movies I see, for this one I was compelled to do so. I guess I saw this movie DVD on a shelf of the DVD rental shop for a long time but I was not interested in renting it; may be due to fact that the leading character is played by Mandy Moore as mention in the cover. I had never disliked her but I just thought she was just a good singer and couldn't be a good actress as well. However, accidentally I saw a comment by a viewer in the Youtube under one of Mandy's videos appreciating her acting in this movie and the next time I went to shop I bought the DVD.I saw the movie last night and Wow.. Even today whole-day I felt as if I was living in the movie. This is why I am writing this. Though it feels like a typical teen movie in the first half of the movie, story evolves into some deeper territory which is not common in teen movies.I was awfully wrong about Mandy. Her acting is much superior than most renowned actresses specially since she's playing a character with qualities totally opposite of her pop singer image. Shane West is also making a superb blend. Expression of feelings by both of them makes the audience thoroughly sentimental.I guess that is wonder of this movie; for which most of the credit should go to the director and the screenwriter. I guess it's kind of magical ability making people so emotional and tearful. This is a movie that describes the true meaning of love at best. AWTR is by far the best romantic movie I have seen.You will not be disappointed seeing this one if you still haven't seen it. This is highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Every time I watch this, I cry.","I am a guy, a man's man even. I like movies with action, and explosions and death. I love horror and sci-fi and mysteries. I do not like a lot of romance or chick flicks. I especially hate Nicolas Sparks. With all this being said, I freakin' love this move, and I am reduced to a blubbering mess each and every time I watch it. Perhaps it is the hopeless romantic that dwells deep within my jaded heart. I could not tell you, except the selfless love demonstrated in this movie is what I hope we can all find one day. I have not read the book, so I cannot say how well it is translated from one medium to the next, but the screenplay is very well written and it is supremely acted. Mandy Moore stole my heart with this film. Great little movie here.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A punch in the stone hearts,"Intense, with the intensity of the teenager heart.Emotional, with the purity of the untainted feelings.I will miss the day I saw it for the first and last time, since I'm not usually watching any great impact movie again for years. 9 years have passed since then , and the image of the two leading characters is still fresh, my heart is still trembling of emotion and sympathy whenever I remember of this title. There are things that help us live and things we have no desire to live without.This movie helps us remember that it's not all about the life's length, but of its quality as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Purity and beauty for the traditional romantic.,"I don't know - I'm way too old for a middle life crisis, maybe its the onset of dementia, but this film really got to me. Never in all these years have I come across as beautiful and pure a character as Jamie Sullivan - and to think I gave MTV the flick whenever Britney-clone Miss Moore, started up her song of the month. Call it manipulative, unrealistic, contrived, saccharine, whatever your pleasure - but I absolutely lost my heart to Mandy Moore's character here.  Perhaps the deep-rooted protective instinct in my nature, maybe a reminder of what I never found but always desired, but I would be lying if I did not admit to falling totally in love with Jamie, matter of fact that would be an understatement.An impossible blend of strength, integrity, natural beauty, youth, feistiness, femininity and vulnerability - Mandy Moore delivered a performance so genuine and moving it totally stunned me. She was utterly spellbinding in every scene she was in - which was most of them. I thought her rendition of ""Its gonna be love"" during the school play was cinematic magic. She was for those moments, every man's dream and the epitome of virginal translucence.I was impressed too with Shane West's performance who at times was so reminiscent of a young Kevin Bacon somewhere around his FOOTLOOSE days. At times I agree, the film seemed to be headed down THE MAJESTIC path of over-sentiment but I'm sorry guys, I don't care. So long as Jamie was on-screen ripping my emotions apart, the rest really didn't matter!  What a stunning performance from so young a girl with barely any acting experience. The mere fact that this flick has pulled an everage user rating of 6.6 would suggest a LOT of people liked it. It blows LOVE STORY totally out of the water. On reflection, it is the film's very simplicity, lack of  pretension and strong supporting actors that serves it so very well.By the way, it does so help being a hopeless romantic!",,Anonymous,Romance
Succeeds where it counts,"I'm a 17 year old male teenager who happened to stumble upon this movie two years ago at school during a free day in math class (when I was 15). I liked it then, but the math class ended before the movie could be finished. Finally, on the WB a few days ago, the movie aired and I saw the conclusion. AWTR contains a heartfelt conclusion to a story where you get to care about Landon and Jamie, two polar opposite teenagers who face peer struggles and the perils of love and death. The situations that occur are very real, and very sad. Once the movie finishes, you'll be left wondering what happens to everyone (heck, even though it doesn't make sense, I want a sequel!).As a maturing male, I couldn't help but cry inside, and I'm someone who felt indifferent toward movies like Titanic. I found myself wishing I were either Landon or Jamie, because they represent the real virtues of life and love. Aside from the movie's undying message, there are some slight flaws. The ending could have been expanded a bit more (you'll see when you watch it as I don't want to spoil anything) to include more emotion. Otherwise, the acting done by Mandy Moore and Shane West is superb and top notch - these two actors have quite the career ahead of them. You'll see as these two characters develop that you can't imagine any other people doing the job.This isn't your typical love story, because when it comes down to it, the love is only part of the whole scheme. While I never expected this to touch me so much, AWTR enters as perhaps my favorite movie of all time. You will feel as if you're a part of the movie, you will be able to relate to them, and you will love it. AWTR succeeds in delivering a great experience. Available on DVD now, you'll be wishing the release had deleted scenes, et. all. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Decent movie, even if it tries a little too hard sometimes","I love the writing of Nicholas Sparks, I find it very heartfelt and honest. When it comes to the book A Walk to Remember, it was good with a heartfelt ending and characters and the story did touch me, but some of dialogue was occasionally lazy and repetitive for my liking.The movie is a decent one. It does try to stick to the spirit of the book even if one or two of the details aren't as coherent, and it mostly succeeds. The pace can be a little too mannered though, and although most of it is genuinely touching there are other times throughout the movie when the story and subject matter tries a little too hard to evoke emotion. There is the length too, I personally felt it could have been shorter.However, A Walk to Remember is beautifully filmed, with beautiful locations and striking photography. The soundtrack is poignant and beguiling, the script tries hard to excise some of the more lazy and repetitive dialogue of the book and while some of it is still a little too repetitive for my taste it is also very honest and heartfelt. The story was enough to warm and break my heart, and the ending touched me hugely. The direction is eager as are the performances. Shane West is very charming and Mandy Moore is convincing, but Peter Coyote and Daryl Hannah are the ones who really impress.Overall, while it does try too hard sometimes A Walk to Remember is a decent movie. For other movies based on Sparks' work, I recommend The Notebook and Message in a Bottle over this both of which genuinely resonated with me, but as a film A Walk to Remember is much better than the forced and predictable The Last Song. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A personal opinion,"Let's get this straight:It's not an artistically excellent movie. It is not a movie with performances that are going to constitute landmarks in the acting profession. It is not a movie with high-end special effects, storming action or astounding scenery. It is not a story that copes with the deepest causes of adolescent misbehavior / frustration / desperation in the sense of a purely sociological cinematography. It can be characterised light (although it includes sadness as a feeling) and shallow (because in its limited duration the director does not have the convenience of ""looking"" deeper into the characters and - at the same time - include an extensive plot which must be given in order to see a considerable change in Landon's personality)I could go on giving cons about this film but I am sure you can find many in previously posted negative reviews - and many of these reviews, more or less, hit some quite substantial spots about the film. BUT...I gave it 10 out of 10 for a single simple reason: whatever its flaws, it made me cry unashamedly and that's something that not a lot of movies can claim, in all honesty. And despite the sadness it inevitably brings (which is not necessarily bad) it also brings innocence, sweetness, optimism - yes, that too - and faith in life and love and the ability of every single person for change, the ability - and the obligation - to become better. It is a movie-edition of an adorable book, and as always, it cannot be better than the book. However, in its own scope it brings out the message quite clearly, quite beautifully, and quite optimistically. It is a film that I have watched repeatedly and will continue to watch with joy. And melancholy.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hard Not to Feel It,"This is quite formulaic, but it is skillfully done and quite provocative. It is the story of a ""cool"" kid and his relationship with a classmate. Peer pressure causes him and his friends to mistreat her in the cruel way teens often do. She falls for him and then he betrays her. That's where things really start in this film because this young woman has a secret. What evolves in the relationship with the two is pretty real and quite poignant. The peripheral stuff is a little too contrived to work very well. Sometimes, script writers try to wrap all things up in a package. It's not necessary. All in all, it's a very touching film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A great tear jerker, and Mandy Moore's best film.","What can I say? it's one of my favorite movies. It has everything: love, romance, action, sorrow, and happiness. Shane West and Mandy Moore have wonderful chemistry together, and it shows. It makes you feel like you want to become a better person, and not be so selfish, self-centered, and makes you realize that there more important things in life.Another reason why it's such a great movie is because you see the transition of someone who I guess you can say was ""heading on the wrong path"" given another chance to make something out of themselves, and that makes you feel good. You have to give a lot of credit to the young main actors in the film (Mandy Moore and Shane West) they did a great job for both of them just starting their movie careers only a couple of years ago.Although for anyone that has actually read the book, like myself, you catch a lot of the differences between the book and the movie, and in your own way you can note what could have made the film a lot better than how good it was. This was definitely Mandy Moore's best movie, and think it left a big positive mark for her in having a acting career. I undoubtedly give this movie 4 1/2 stars out 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"So predictable, so corny, SO LAME!!!","**** WARNING ****  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WATCH THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU ARE A 15-YEAR OLD GIRL!!!Every single movie of this type is identical, they don't so much as change one iota of the plot.  I can't believe the number of stereotypes this movie has.  The coolest guy in school (Landon Carter) is a misbehaving rich kid who has divorced parents, the virgin girl nobody likes is the preacher's daughter, the cool kid fights with his best friend when he finally decides to stand up for the girl, his ex-girlfriend is nasty to the point of playing a dirty trick on the good girl (but of course regrets her actions in the end), and the lamest of all?????  After showing the bad rebellious kid the good side of life, the angelic chick tells him she has a terminal illness!!! AS IF!!  Just like in every teen romance/tragedy ever made!  Did they crib this stuff from Harlequin romances???  After 5 minutes, I said out loud, ""Guaranteed she will have a terminal disease.""  And she does!  And that wedding scene at the end, could that be any cornier???Of course there is redemption in the end for the previously heading-down-the-wrong-path hero, of course he reconciles himself with his estranged father, of course all his friends see the error of their ways and embrace the new Landon Carter.  The cool kids are mean to the dweebs, but of course it takes the ugly duckling to show them the error of their ways (and of course she is not really ugly).  This movie is so boring, so silly, so lame, only teenage girls could ever find any interest in it at all, but I guess that is who it is aimed at!Even the angst the lead character supposedly experiences with his parents' situation is so contrived it is liable to make you sick.  There is a hilarious scene where he asks his cardiologist father to save his leukemia-stricken girlfriend.  When his father explains that he is a cardiologist, Landon replies ""Never mind, I knew you wouldn't help!"" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA!  This movie has so many bad points, maybe everyone should rent it for a laugh!  Oh well, I suppose I got my 4 bucks worth just making fun of it all the way through!  LAME! LAME! LAME!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
surprisingly good,"This movie doesn't have an original plot, but it is good because of the 2 leads give wonderful performances.  Mandy Moore is especially good as the straight-laced preacher's daughter.  And I liked how they showed the transformation of Shane West's character.  It was very believable. Of course, the ending won't leave you dried-eyed.  It's sad, but we get to witness a sort-of ""miracle"" as the film puts it of how a wayward teen turns his life around.  The music was great too.FINAL VERDICT:  I definitely recommend this. It isn't just some teen movie. The film has depth and the acting is much better than you would expect.",,Anonymous,Romance
Not for the cynical.,"I saw this movie last Sunday night, and I have to say that I was deeply moved by it. I do not think that it had the cliches of teen films at all. If anything, the movie has a new perspective on teen love. Teen films today are mostly focused on ""getting laid"" or ""turning the ugly girl pretty"" (one way or another), just rent American Pie or She's All That. Not that there isn't a special place in my heart for these movies, but A Walk To Remember is in a class all by itself. The movie did have it's share of cheesy moments, due mostly to the overbearing dramatic musical score in certain scenes. Other than that, the characters were very genuine and the performances were most definitely heartfelt. Mandy Moore definitely holds her own in this movie as Jamie Sullivan, showing lots of emotional depth and making a complete transformation from teen pop goddess to modest southern girl. Shane West is a talent that should not be overlooked by Hollywood. He gets better and better in every film that he's in. He can do comedy (watch his underrated supporting comedic role in ""Get Over It""), and he tackles drama with ease in this film. Great supporting turns from Peter Coyote as Jamie's father, and from an aged Darryl Hannah as Landon's mother.On to the topic of this review. This movie is not for cynical people, or people who do not believe in love. This movie's core message is that love can and will conquer all obstacles. This is a movie about teens who love each other in a very adult way. I can relate because I have had the same girlfriend for the past two years, ever since my senior year in high school. We love each other immensely, and we believe that we have a deep connection. People didn't think that we would last, because we just didn't act like all the other teen couples on campus. So when Landon would say these deeply loving things to Jamie in the movie, I cried because someone had said the same things I had said not too long ago to my girlfriend. So, if you don't believe in love, don't see this movie because you won't like it.If you have a bitterness toward religion, especially Christianity, don't see this movie, because you will just be bellyaching about the manipulation of religion on the youth of America. I am a Christian, not a hardcore one, but I do believe in God. There are Christian overtones in this movie, faith is spoken of many times in this movie, and faith is the cornerstone of Landon and Jamie's love. This movie is not preachy, it does not try to hammer home topics of Christianity with words. The movie prefers to use examples in real life situations and medaphors as well.I have to say thank you to the director and writer for not including a sex scene or a drunken teen party scene in this movie. It is a tasteful family film, and I'm glad it did not try to be too adult with it's content. The love that Landon and Jamie share is pure, and it is what makes their relationship unique in comparison to the other kids in their town.People may hate this movie because of the amount of sap or cheesiness. Well, I think the movie is very sugary and sweet, and has plenty of sap. But it is realistic sap. The situations warrant that amount of sap. You wouldn't make a scene where a guy is confessing his love for his lady all dark and gritty, would you? This movie also does have its share of grit, especially in relation to Landon's transformation. But you'll have to see the movie for that.People may also think that Mandy Moore is not believable in the role of Jamie Sullivan. This is complete hogwash. The point wasn't to make Jamie a real ""ugly duckling"", but a swan who does not care to spread her wings and show off for the rest of the world. Jamie carries a wisdom manifested from her faith and her life experiences. But her peers can't seem to get past her clothing choices and hairstyles to take her seriously. I just wish that in real life, people wouldn't look at beautiful as the equivalent of popular and ugly as the exact opposite. I knew quite a few beautiful girls in high school that sat at the back of the cafeteria and read books or did homework. That's just the sort of life they chose to lead, not because they were forced into it by being picked on, but because they simply existed on a different level. Jamie is exactly that type of person. Landon is that way too, but he just doesn't want to find that out, until he meets Jamie.Bottom line, you may love this movie for many reasons, or hate it for many more. This is a movie about soul mates. This is a movie about believing in people, especially in the ones you love. This is a movie about tolerance and not judging a book by its cover. This is a movie about friendship. This is a movie about two people who know they are right for each other. But most importantly, this is a movie about how true love can lift up even the most unreachable souls in this world, and save their lives.I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pure Love.,"I picked this movie as a usual Friday night movie and I didn't expect that I was gonna cry at all. But to be honest, I cried so hard. and let me warn you, this movie MADE YOU CRY OUT YOUR EYES.If I'd describe this movie in a word, that would be ""Pure"". The love between Jamie and Landon was so sweet and pure, and all the beautiful scenery used in this film made their relationship look more pure and lovable. Their pure love reminded me of my young love in high school and made me realize how the relationships I'm getting into lately is messed up and not that pure anymore.BTW, Some people might think these kind of movie is cheesy or too romantic, and I agree with those opinion, this movie could be cheesy and ""try to make audience cry too hard"" kind of movie, but still, considering those aspects of this movie, I'm telling you this film is absolutely worth to watch.Great scenery, great music,great cast, and great storyline. What else do you need? just watch it!!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Dated & Cheesy, but it Mostly Succeeds","In an age that lacks Romantic Comedies or Romantic Drama's of great quality, sometimes you have to take a step back and view some old 'classics' to remember when cinema consistently pumped out rom-drams and rom-coms with great success. While A Walk to Remember won't nearly go down as the top Nicholas Sparks romantic adaptation, it's more than sufficient to satisfy a majority of its audience. A tad dated and melodramatic at times, it may not hold up as much as you'd like, but not many romances do.6.2/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very touching movie.,"First of all, I want to preface this review with the following disclaimer: I am not a 14 year old girl who is crazy about Mandy Moore and waiting for a knight to carry me off to his castle.  I am a 29 year old male with a real job and life.  In fact, when I first saw this movie, I barely knew who Mandy Moore was.  I consider myself fairly well educated in the arts, having studied primarily theatre design, but film and music as well, in college.Regardless of the technical merits of the directing or the script, this is the first movie to actually get to me emotionally in years.  I simply fell in love with Jamie. To portray a such a character in a manner as to make her real and believable took real talent on the part of Mandy and real guidance from director Adam Shankman.  Her ""goodness"" could have easily been taken over the top.  Also to her credit, Mandy was sixteen when she took on this role.  While this may have made it somewhat easier for her to relate to Jamie, often actors twice her age do not portray characters with this much depth.  I believe she shows tremendous potential as an actor.Landon, as played by Shane West, while showing tremendous growth within the film, appeared at times lack complex motivation.  However, I feel that the character is still strong and that Shane is a fine actor.  While the remainder of the supporting characters sometimes felt oversimplified and one-dimensional, I still feel that the actors overall did a fine job.The real triumph of this film is the chemistry that exists between all of the characters, especially Jamie and Landon.  This is evidence of a director who knows what he is doing and a well-written screenplay.  While the film is by no means perfect, I barely noticed its imperfections  because I was so involved in the characters and the story.For any story to be considered great, it must take its audience on a journey.  We must share in the discoveries of the characters and empathize with them.  ""A Walk to Remember"" takes its audience on that journey.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
horrible,"This movie is pure drivel.  It's cliche'd nonsense and it stuns me to hear people praise it as much as they seem to be.  There is no depth to any of the characters, they are all cartoon characters.  There is a father-son subplot which becomes key to the story but is very poorly presented (it's virtually ignored for the first 90% of the movie).  I can see people appreciating the moral and religious undertones of this movie but that doesn't excuse the filmmakers from putting an original thought or well-developed character in the film. Again, I am stunned that anyone liked this movie it was horrible.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A beautiful, powerful movie.","This film was such a wonderful surprise.  While I was expecting a moderately lightweight piece of teen fare, the film came in with truly profound depth, impeccable performances, solid direction and good pacing through a difficult story.  Mandy Moore is a certifiable superstar.  And Shane West is really good, and a big surprise was Lauren German, who is not only a very good actress, but so beautiful it is pure joy to watch her. The religion elements of the story are effectively interlaced into the narrative without feeling like the viewer is being force-fed a theological viewpoint.  And bring tissues- this one is a real tearjerker which leaves you feeling uplifted and optimistic.",,Anonymous,Romance

Sweet and endearing with its shortcomings,"Nicholas Sparks' A walk to remember is one of the many book to big screen adaptations of his novels. I have not read this book so I won't be able to make comparisons between the two, bit I'll just give a summary on why I think this film deserves a 6/10. First of all, I liked the cast, Mandy Moore and Shane west do a good job at carrying the lead roles and the romantic relationship that forms with them, their chemistry also works really well, it just flows naturally between them. I also like seeing Daryl Hannah playing Landon's mother, loved her from Steel Magnolias (1989). The movie is fairly predictable except for one sad twist at the end, other than that it's pretty run of the mill. The romantic scenes between West and Moore are very cute and they do their job well, it achieves the desired goal. Some of the scenes in between the beginning, romance scenes, and the ending can drag a little, be kinda lifeless. If the acting hadn't been good, west and Moore had poor on screen chemistry, or the romance scenes hadn't been good, then I would absolutely hated it. But those three factors saved this movie from being a complete and utter disaster. I'll summarize it briefly like this: it's a cute well acted teen romantic drama that has some boring scenes that drag. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Miss this and you miss out...,"As far as teen movies go this was delightfully surprising. A tale of two North Carolina teens it was both touching and inspiring.The story is beautifully crafted and Mandy Moore's portrayal of Jamie Sullivan is enchanting enough to bring the character to life for any audience. Her shyness and lack of acting experience make her ever more believable as Jamie and a sweetness and innocense naturally shines through. Likewise, Shane west is no let down either. He is perfect as the bad boy in search of better things. Completely believable and at ease with this character his charm and charisma sail him through his role.Concurrent to being a love story this movie also envoques more interesting topics - so far relatively untouched in teen movies. Having Jamie as the reverend's daughter is a wonderful twist and presents new problems for Landon (West).All of this contributes to the very effective bitter-sweet ending of the movie and one is left both inspired and with feelings of hope as well as affection for the main characters.This is by far one of my favourite teen movies and if you miss this one, you will most certainly miss out. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Total Chick Flick, but above average for a teen movie.","I thought this movie was very sweet, it does have some of the cliches of a teen movie, but at the same time it had a much deeper and more powerful story than most teen movies. Some of you are saying that it's a typical ""pretty ugly girl"" movie, where the popular guy takes on the mousey girl with glasses, big clothes and a bad haircut and underneath she a babe. And yeah, it's clear that Mandy Moore is no ""ugly girl"", but it's not like she changed her clothes and cut her hair, she was still the same person at the end as she was at the beginning. Can you name any other ""pretty-ugly"" girls who didn't change their entire being by the end of the movie?And I would also like to inform everyone that being pretty doesn't make you automaticly popular in highschool. I knew plenty of girls that were a pretty as any of the ""popular"" girls and their Friday's night were always free. And many of the ""popular"" girls are popular because they play a lot of sports, wear trendy clothes, have nice houses to party at, and it didn't hurt to be a little bold with boys. They weren't necessarily popular because they were nice or pretty.Anyway, I'm done preaching. I liked this movie pretty well. I think Mandy Moore's a decent actress and may have a promising career when she done teen bopping (I think she one of the better teen queens and she's not a ho, unlike a certain singer whose upcoming movie was previewed at this one, and after the 30 seconds I feel like I saw the whole thing)Shane West was also really good, and real cute too.

A Walk To Remember is a story about a guy who unexpectedly falls in Love with a girl who is going to die during her teenage bcoz of a disease.

By the word everybody, I mean to say not just guyz, but all kinds of people. Each and every scene in which if i see Jamie, she made me cry. That was the first time i literally cried while watching a movie.It has left an undelible impression on me which, i cud not able to get over for 2 or 3 months.Guyz, I don't know whether u believe it or not, its not at all exaggerating to say that I am completely changed after watching this movie. I really came to know what exactly LOVE means. This movie has taught me the real meaning of LOVE - A love for a life time.I am spellbound with this movie in every aspect.

Highly recommended!!!,"This is and will always be my absolute favorite film. It is so beautiful, and i cried through the end the first times i saw it. This is totally something that everybody should see at least once.short of the film: Landon Carter (Shane West)is this cool teenager who's hanging out with the popular school kids. Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) is a very self-confident Christian and talented girl who has no interest at all in clothes and all that normal teenagers are interested of. A total outsider.When Landon gets caught doing something he wasn't aloud to do (+ causin injuries on another student)he is forced to participate in the spring play, help toodering a little challenged students on Saturdays and help with janitor work. The play and toodering brings the two very different teenagers together. After some complications they find there selves in love with each other. They have a hole future in front of them, what could possibly bring the two a part? Under there 'walk' together she changes him in a special way, making him wanting to make something of himself, showing him he can trust others and most of all himself. And Jamie isn't left unaffected herself. Together they shaped each other. Another good thing about the film is the music.Watch it... and for the record, out of 1 to 10 i gave it 15",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Definite tear jerker..!!,"I recently watched this movie over again on TV and I realized I didn't have it on DVD. So I rushed to the store and bought it. Here's what Hollywood may not know.1. Relationships can be that pure and WITHOUT sex 2. Christians can actually be moral and non-hypocritical and follow their beliefs 3. Actors/actresses who weren't known as that before can actually give great performances...even if they were pop stars...4. A Walk to Remember is a sweet, lovable, romantic story that can tear at your heart strings. I don't ever cry at movies. This one made me reach for tissues!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
NOT what you'd expect,"When I went into the theater, I expected to sit and watch a movie with an ugly girl with the popular guy that changes her into the prettiest and most popular girl in school.  This is not the case for A Walk To Remember.  The girl never changes her look, she isn't even ugly to begin with, just wears clothes that doesn't reflect the ""popular fashion.""  The guy doesn't change her, she changes the guy into a better man.  I think the acting is great throughout the film.  Although I really wish that they could have a singer/actress that doesn't have a singing role.  I feel for Mandy Moore because I feel that it does take away from her charactor.  But overall, I really did enjoy this film through an through.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
amazing movie,"This is one of the few movies that I can't get tired of watching it. It is absolutely amazing. The theme and story is just WOW! I was very happy when I first watched it, and I think I've watched 20 or more times after that. Every time I watch it, I cry like a little baby. Plus Shane West and Mandy Moore play their characters extremely well! I just can't get enough of this movie. The whole begins with a stupid little joke that turns out bad which leaves Clay Gephardt (Matt Lutz) in the hospital, and popular kid Landon Rollins Carter (Shane West) in a whole lot of trouble at school. Landon is then forced to participate in different school activities which included the drama club. While in the drama club, Landon is forced to work with Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan (Mandy Moore) who is a very shy, quiet, and book smart girl at the school. Jamie is the daughter of Rev. Hegbert Sullivan (Peter Coyote); Landon and Jamie have known each other for a while but because of their social statuses at school they have been in different spaces. Landon seeks help from Jamie when he has trouble with his lines and that is when they started to get close. Jamie was resistant in the beginning but slowly started falling for Landon. On the other hand Landon tried to hide his relationship with Jamie from his ""popular"" friends but later on when his friends disrespected Jamie, he defended her in front of the whole school. As they grew closer to each other, Jamie reveals to Landon that she is suffering from Leukemia and that she had stopped responding to the medication. Landon is upset at first but later on changes his mind, and decided to help Jamie fulfill her wish list (this is when the movie gets so good). After a while Landon and Jamie get married, and they live for a while before she passes away. Landon then goes back to see Jamie's dad, they have a little talk. Landon then leaves and is seen smiling at the sunset. The theme of this movie is love clearly. It is a very romantic movie and also sad. The theme was portrayed in a couple of scenes. The first one was when Landon defended Jamie in front of the whole school, which just showed that his love for her was strong that he was willing to confront his friends for her. The second was when he built her kaleidoscope just so she can fulfill her wish of watching a comet (extremely beautiful). This movie can be compared to the Notebook in my opinion. I personally haven't watched the movie but from what I've heard it seems like they are very similar. Lightning technique in this movie was used very well. Every time Landon and Jamie were having a beautiful moment, the light would be very bright, warm and actually peaceful. However during the rough times it would be a little bit gloomy just to match the mood.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

a must see movie for all those hopeless romantics,"A Walk To Remember is my favorite movie. i thought it was excellent. the hot shot popular guy and the nobody girl who everyone makes fun of fall in love and shane west and mandy moore do a great job of portraying landon and jamie as in the book, and also do a marvelous job of getting you to fall in love w/ them too. it is a definite feel good movie that makes you smile, laugh, and cry. i read a review on this movie and the bottom line said it was forgettable. well me, being a movie buff and all, could not forget about it. it was said that mandy moore sings ""only hope"" on stage with only a piano for music and on the soundtrack she's backed by a string orchestra, who cares?! i never agree with movie critics and some say a movie stinks if one little thing is not realistic, that doesnt mean the movie is horrible, i mean it is a movie, not real life, who cares!? this is a must see movie for all those who are hopelessly romantic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's better the second time around,"I read the book before watching the movie. I have to say, the book isn't very good. The style of writing did not fit in with the mood. So, it wasn't very thriller, although some parts of the book were tolerable (like the relationship between Jamie and her father). I watched the movie right after reading it, and i hated it (it was better than the book for sure). I couldn't imagine how someone who is going through so much could have so much faith in god, in life. I certainly wouldn't. So I decided to watch it again this weekend and I have to say, I get it now. This is a story about how two people learn and sort of complete each other. Some lines are very corny and it's mixed in with some bad acting, but the story isn't half bad. You will either sob through the movie or turn it off half way. It really all depends on what sort of mood/light you watch it in.I would give this movie 6.5/10, but I can't.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is a huge insult to high school outcasts everywhere,"A girl looking like Mandy Moore would not get treated at all poorly at all in suburban high school.  It's discouraging that the kids with real social problems see movies that are supposed to represent people like them, only to find they cast someone like Moore for the part of the outcast.  This contradicts what the messages in these movies are supposedly supposed to be: you shouldn't care what others think of you.  It's almost offensive.  You don't hire white actors to play African Americans in a movie where they deal with prejudice all the time, so why is it I never see a heavyset girl in roles like this?  If it's about the money, why even bother to make a movie like this at all, if you're going to do it wrong?  All of you arguing that it shouldn't matter, obviously don't notice the kids that have few friends. I've seen movies with male characters that aren't what society would consider attractive and are odd, or eccentric... but never even see a ""dorky"" female at the theater.

excellent,"I heard of this film by a friend a few months ago. When going round to her place i spotted it on her shelf and thought i'd go home and watch it due to the pure fact i was bored.I usually class myself as a pretentious, fashion obsessed ***** that loved legally blonde and mean girls. . .i now see the error of my ways. I never understood how people got effected by films, now i do. This film influenced me in so many ways. i expected a chick flick and got something totally different. i actually cried not only because the portrayal of the story and acting is excellent but because one of my best friends was diagnosed with cancer recently.after extensive chemo she lost her hair and i quote ""her femininity"".She was originally the most vain person i know but after spending the past few weeks with her i have valued life so much.And back onto the film. My point is, whats the point in wasting time on putting people down and trying to make yourself look better when in fact they could be the most fantastic person that could influence the rest of your life.

It's really a must!,"A Walk to Remember is a 2002 romance film based on the novel with the same name by Nicholas Sparks. The movie stars pop singer Mandy Moore, who plays Jamie Sullivan- the only daughter of the minister, and Shane West - one of the popular guys in the school (Landon Carter) . The movie was directed by Adam Shankman and has many nominations and wins.The story begins when Landon nearly kills a fellow student when he and his friends play a prank on him. As punishment, Landon has to participate in after-school community service activities - help the staff in school, tutor kids and take part in the school's yearly play. This faces him with Jamie - a girl who he has known all his life but ignored. He gets to know her better as she helps him with the school play. Unexpectedly, Landon finds himself falling in love and this new friendship brings him many problems with his old friends, while Jamie is forced to deal with her strict father and a secret that she's keeping from her schoolmates.The script is very exciting and the movie ends very dramatically. The actors are great professionals and their acting in the film proves that. The soundtracks of the film are so influential and the main song - ""Only hope"" by Mandy Moore is a really catchy tune. The movie is full of memorable moments and thoughts like: ""Find out who you are and do it on purpose."" or ""Love is like the wind. You can't see it but you can feel it."" Story like this was played before, but this movie does it much better than most.Those who love teen romances will enjoy this film but not only they - this film will please a much wider audience, including adults and also men.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

It is refreshing to see that the film industry can still produce such a tasteful and wonderful work.  I have encouraged my family to watch this movie and to try and be like Jaime-full of faith, hope and charity and like Langdon-willing to change, willing to learn to love and be committed.

"I'd like a star named after me. Maybe..um, Demi Parker?","""A Walk to Remember"" spins an old tale for a new generation of young people. A touching, sentimental love story, not  unlike the  ""Love Story 1970"", this unpretentious little film offers some even performances by some fresh faces, keeps the melodrama in check, doesn't waste much time with Kodak moments, and pushes the right buttons with minimal schmaltz as it goes for the heart and ignores the viscera making for an easy buy-in to its heartwarming story.

Overall, this movie was decent and had good music like New Radicals and such and such. Daryl Hannah was also good as the mother but looked nothing like Shane.

This is NOT another teen movie!,"I read this book and it is SO good! It's not like other teen movies - and trust me I know, b/c I've seen them all! You shouldn't judge this movie before knowing what it's really about. Yes I know it's about people from opp. sides of the track and it seems so cliche, but there's so much more than that. And even though I don't like Mandy Moore, she's a great actress. Honestly! Much better than Britney. But anyway, this movie will make you cry and laugh and there is such a great message. It's about first loves and opening up to people, saying goodbye, miracles, growing apart, destiny, and letting yourself become something you never imagined, but it won't end the way you think it will. Besides, Shane West is hot. So why shouldn't you like this movie again? Oh, and go out and read some more of Nicholas Sparks books. They're a must read, trust me!",,Anonymous,Romance
Touches your heart,"Providence brings together two opposite souls, each to rescue the other - one with no constraints, the other held too tightly. Despite warnings, they helplessly fall in love. Time, as is its nature, reveals the bounds the star-crossed lovers face. Despite their youth, they cope with the barriers to their future together with poise and assurances far beyond their ages. Their comportment recalls that of lovers with far greater experience, dignity and grace than might be attributed to such young spirts.The casting is perfection and the acting even better. All characters are extraordinary yet somehow unquestionably believable. The film moves with grace and style. At no time is the viewer left waiting for or wanting more sentiment or passion.This under-rated film is worthy of so much more than it has claimed and deserves to be watched over and over.If this story doesn't touch your heart, you don't have one.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love hurts...in so many ways,"A Walk to Remember....I remember this one. I saw it about 3 years ago, when it came on HBO. I was surprised at how good it was. It's about a teenage girl named Jamie(Mandy Moore) who is the nerdy kid at high school. Landon (Shane West)gets into trouble, and has to do community service to make up for the mess he got in to. Also, he is chosen as the lead role in the school play, Jamie in the play also. So..this is where the movie ""jumps"" off. The two get to know each other, and guess what! THEY FALL IN LOVE! Who knew?! After all the name calling, teasing, and ""you've had the same sweater since middle school"" picking, Landon starts to see Jamie in a new light. Worse comes to worse, when Jamie's father sees her with Landon. Jamie's father is a minster and doesn't approve of the ""new"" boyfriend. This movie is a must see in my case. It isn't the best love story of all time, but it is a good movie. It's a sad one too...get ready to cry ladies.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie will break you,"Well, this is the first time I've written a film review, which you will probably gather as you continue reading! I felt I needed to write about this film just to get some of the emotion out of me and into some words. So this review may be more for me than for you.I don't know how this movie escaped me in the first place for so long, but when I saw an ad for it just a couple of days ago I wasn't too sure it was my kinda thing, especially since 'that Mandy Moore girl' was in it. But seeing there was nothing else to watch I'd give this a try.Boy oh boy oh boy.... I fell in love with this movie. It brought me to a hyperventilation of tears. It was innocent, simple and so so beautiful. The acting was right on. I was shocked my Moore's amazing rendition of Jamie Sullivan, I couldn't believe this girl could act in this way. All this time I had her pegged as the run of the mill Disney 'pop star' plastics. I was WRONG. This girl (now a woman) is very talented indeed.The character of Jamie Sullivan will break your emotions into a million pieces, if you have any soft bone in your body she will find it. I have never been much of a crying person but this movie, that character, really borough it home for me. Taught me a few home truths - to be true to who we really are, to be kind, thankful for what we do have and to live like it's our last day...Though this film has religious (Christian) undertones, I thought it was very subtle and never forced, so regardless of what your beliefs may be this film will leave you reeling and get you thinking about life and how we should treat each other.It's impossible not to fall in love with Jamie Sullivan whether you're a guy or a gal. She is angelic. The epitome of what we all strive to be, what we want to see in each other.All I can say is dang you Nicholas Sparks for writing this story and dang you Mandy Moore for breaking me into a million pieces with no mercy at all!!! All in a good way of course.Watch this movie. It will be a movie to remember!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
a cheesy collection of clichés,"No one has warned me about this, so let me tell you straight away: it's one of those movies where the girl walks out of the theater with tears in her eyes and has no words to how deeply she has just been touched, while the poor guy she was with feels like vomiting. Why is it so? Because the film plays heavily on female psychology: the insecurities, the bad guy syndrome (oh... but he CAN change), the love conquers it all etc. - all the right buttons. It's almost cheating.And if you happen not to be a member of the fairer sex then the storyline is as disconnected from reality as earth is disconnected from Pluto. You've seen it ten times before and it's just soooo cheesy. Acting is mediocre - Mandy Moore is slightly above average while Shane West is too busy looking good to even care about it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Most beautiful movie I've ever seen,"As I write this, I've just finished watching A Walk To Remember for the first time. I feel as if so many different emotions were pushed and pulled inside of me, but by no means was it in a bad way. Everything, and I mean everything, from the actors, to the script, were perfectly arranged so that every little moment in this movie takes the viewer on a journey, a journey through the lives of two lovestruck teens. This was no ordinary, sappy, teenage love though. The love portrayed by both Mandy Moore and Shane West was more than words could ever describe.All in all, I've seen countless movies throughout my twenty-one years of living, but this is BY FAR, the most heartbreaking and sentimental movie that I've ever laid eyes upon. Well done, well done.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fair as a date movie and chick flick, but uh...","A Walk to Remember is puzzling as well as corny even if at moments it seems like it could be a decent movie.  It brings puzzlement to me how Mandy Moore who plays the lead girl in the movie is the ""plain Jane"" type in her community.  I'm not saying she did a bad job in her role, but in any real community (yes even in Virginia where this story takes place) does anybody really think that somebody who looks like Mandy Moore would be the outcast from all the preppies?  Maybe if the film had flashbacks of her as a kid being the outcast it might be not as undoubtful to see her as an outsider, but come on.Truth be told, there were times in this movie when I thought it wasn't half as bad as I thought it would be from the trailer and commercials.  In this Nicholas Sparks based story, West plays a popular kid who gets in trouble and is sent to do some community service type things, and Moore is there volunteering and soon it unfolds with them getting sort of romantically involved, then more so, then she changes him forever, and, and...In total, I can see a group of teenie-bopper girls feeling and not feeling the way I did after seeing this movie and it depends more on the person whether or not they like this.  As for me, I won't watch it again unless I'M the one on the date and know I'm getting action afterwards.  Grade: Between C+ and C",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sentimental cliché,"This is by far the worst movie I have seen in years (and I watch a lot of movies).It is full of sentimental clichés, 100% politically correct from a conservative Christian point of view, and it has one dimensional characters that I don't find believable at all. The Jamie character is annoying (I am pretty sure that anyone who resembles her in real life are hippocrits or brainwashed), and the change in Langdon is ridiculous and unrealistic.I would have appreciated that this movie was labeled with ""christian content"" or something like that when I purchased it, because I cannot understand how anyone else could enjoy it...Stay away is my recommendation!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

a sweet little film with a few big flaws,"Okay, everyone's got a right to their opinions, and when it comes to this movie people either seem to love it or hate it. I suppose I'd be in the middle to lower end of the ""love it"" category, as this wasn't really aiming to entertain a woman in her late 30's.I suppose one of my bigger beefs with this movie is that I'm not sure who gave the young African American man(Eric) the go-ahead to play his character as an oversexed, hip hop homeboy. He's like one of a handful of minorities in a small predominantly white town...not saying he needs to act like Carlton Banks from the ""Fresh Prince"" show, but as an African American woman who grew up in a similarly small town, it was kind of embarrassing to see him acting out that way.I'm not trying to make this a big racial statement; actually, it's more to the contrary. Not all of us who grew up in those circumstances turned out to be one extreme or the other-we just found somewhere that was comfortable in the middle. I mean, come on...the kid's name was ERIC for crying out loud! Was he over compensating for not having a more ethnically oriented name? The only time that I witnessed Eric as more as an honestly portrayed teen and less as an ethnic caricature was toward the end when he and Landon were having heart to heart chat by that lake in back of Landon's house.Granted, guys his age are little more than totally raging hormones walking upright in society, but he seemed to be embarrassingly over the top compared to the other guys. It made me cringe.And as for the play-within-the-movie...shouldn't the dialogue even remotely have made sense? There were times that it did, but then you were just like, ""What is Landon talking about?"" And what was up with the cloak on the ""mysterious female singer"" Jamie was portraying...was that cloak supposed to add that element of mystery? It just felt like the movie was trying too hard to accomplish something and ended up basically killing time to set up for the beautiful song that Jamie sings.Again, remember these are comments made by a woman who is nearly old enough to be the mother of the target of this movie's audience, so my comments should be taken with a grain of salt. But truthfully, as I turn up my Switchfoot CD and reminisce, ""A Walk to Remember"" makes it in under the wire as one of my favorite celluloid romances.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gorgeous,"I saw this at the movies three times when it was first released!I think that it is so romantic and so beautiful and i think that the movie was made very well and Nicholas Sparks novel was transformed into one of the best movies that i have ever seen!It's not like all the other chick flicks; girl meets guy, they fall in love, something bad happens, they live happily ever after and they have a happy ending.This movie goes much deeper and touches people. It's Landon bad boy from school, the 'pop' and everyone loves him and he knows it. After a prank gone seriously wrong, he is forced to spend more time with the right kinda people. Jamie, the school nerd, no one dislikes her but everyone laughs at her, her father is the local Reverend and she is the right kinda person.They have been in all the same classes since Kindergarten but have never been friends. the first time they talk she makes him promise not to fall in love with her. he laughs, not a problem! But as they spend more time together Landon starts to realize that it is harder than he thought!To his friends disgust, they start to date, but then Jamie's secret is revealed and things will never be the same for Landon again.It's about true love and becoming something that you never thought that you could. it's not about teenage crushes and lighthearted teenage fun. It will make you laugh, and cry as you see Jamie and Landon fall in love against all odds, but will the odds catch up to them?I loved it and i think most people out there will, it really touched me and i think its one that you can watch with anyone, your mum, your friends, even your boyfriend would like it!

"disappointing, book is so much better","Well what can i say, this movie was good, but disappointing. I didn't actually think they were in love and i didn't really see he cared for her. I read the book before i watch the movie, and fell in love with the book the minute i read it. After watching the movie shortly after, i was disappointed. I have the DVD and watch it multiply times to see if i can figure a way to think it's good, but to me it's disappointing. Nothing they do shows that they really care for each other. Unlike the Notebook which i read and didn't like i thought the movie was great understanding and had some scenes from the book. This did not. For example, the writing was badly written(for the play). didn't they know this movie takes place in 1958 not 2002? and didn't they know that Landon and Jamie had more moments, and more sad moments. Didn't they know that Jamie asked him about the grave yard and she didn't go. and she didn't have a list. I was disappointed that's all. I wanted the movie to be similar to the book.

Heartbreakingly beautiful,"First off i have to admit that i am an action movie guy and i usually hate teen movies having seen enough unfunny comedy, pitiful acting and dirty jokes. The only reason i watched this one is because i ran out of action movies. In the end i was absolutely blown away by the beautiful story. No movie has ever gotten to me like this before! I actually came close to crying at various points in the movie and that is a first, and i am no 10-yr old teenage girl. This is a movie for all people.The beginning of the film was fairly close to that typical full-of-hormone teen movie and i was beginning to get upset. But as i watched on i realized that it lacked the usual corny storyline and dialog. Instead i found a wonderful love story done masterfully by Mandy Moore and Shane West. The movie is sincere and touching, the characters are realistic and believable. Every scene in the movie has a purpose, unlike in some other ones i feel like people are shooting scenes just for the sake of filling time. I have to praise the acting of the leading characters again here because they really made this great movie become even more unforgettable. I can tell that the lines come from the bottom of their hearts mixed with emotion, not just memorized from the script and read out as done in some other films (i don't want to mention names here). The changing relationship between Jamie and Landon is just heartwarming. When the sad news came it got even more touching. I also realized that the seemingly bad beginning is there to show how powerful true love can be (to completely transfer a character 360 degrees).One place in the movie where i THINK some MAY think is cliché is Landon's friends (especially the guy who ate Landon's fist) all becoming supportive of him. However given the circumstances of the storyline, only people with stone hearts won't do that.At the end of the movie i was left in my seat stunned, my mind can't think of anything except replaying scenes from the movie. This is truly a great different movie-seeing experience for me, and my rating for it is 10/10. Yes, 10, a rating i only gave before to mega-blockbusters like LOTR and The Matrix, because i can't find anything wrong with it except that i didn't want the movie to end. I recommend it to all people who desperately want to witness a good teen movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Read the Book,"Although this movie was okay, the book, as always is much better. The idea of the movie was the same as the book, but the details i.e. town setting, reason they start seeing each other, the preacher's involvement, etc.- all of that was much better. IN the book they walk everywhere, ergo the title of the book. In the movie they drive cars. It takes away from the relationship because Landon should be walking her home all the time. Again, the title has a meaning. I must say I loved Peter Coyote. A great actor. And Many Moore was unexpectedly good. The part fit her, or she fit the part. I thought the movie's soundtrack could have been much more mellow considering the plot. Too much ""hardness"" and vulgarity when the book had none. I loved the book so much I wanted to see the movie to experience the feelings again. It was a bit of a let down, but I am glad I saw it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A beautiful romance film without any sex content!,"A Walk To Remember, starring Shane West and Mandy Moore. They both have very strong chemistry so their acting looks natural and nothing is exaggerated. Starting from the film, now the film A Walk to Remember players reunite and have a romance in real life. In this film there is no element of expressing love by having sex only a kiss and for me that is normal for western culture. This film also provides a lesson that not always someone's bad past will be bad in the end, some people can change for the better when he has found the right person. This film is worth watching for teenagers and I highly recommend it to you guys.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mandy Moore is Sweet,"Basically the only reason people saw this was to see Mandy Moore in her debut performance. The popular teen pop star was put to the test to provide a decent performance in a romance movie loosely based on the bestseller by Nicholas Sparks (it's a great book, highly recommended). And to everyone's surprise, she's actually quite good. A lot better than most modern teen actresses in fact. The movie is a bit overly saccharine with it's teeny bopper appeal, but the romance that blossoms between her character Jamie and the bad boy at school Landon (a touching performance by Shane West) is believable and heartbreaking. Of course there's a catch. Even though everything seems to be great because a barrier between popular and unpopular is broken with their love, it turns out that Jamie only has a short amount of time to live- she's dying of Leukemia. The movie becomes unbearably sad but Moore and West carry it perfectly, with heartfelt performances in a truly convincing manner. I guarantee you'll cry by the end of this, and if you don't you'll at least appreciate the sweetness and purpose of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great,"I just saw A Walk to Remember at a special premiere yesterday and it is a really good movie. Whoever says it's bad movie, is some sour critic who has bad taste. The book was good and so was the movie too. It has good music, great cast, and more. And there's all these comments on how the ""ugly"" girl is pretty; just remove the glasses and fix the 'do...well if she was ugly how many people do you think would want to see the movie? It just attracts more people to the movie so don't say it's bad because the main character is good-looking, that has nothing to do with it!",,Anonymous,Romance
"Sweet, Inspiring,Uplifting","Well, this movie has received mixed reactions from the critics.There have been efforts to thrash the immaturity level of the movie as well as Mandy Moore's acting skills.However both are unjustified.In fact, the director succeeds in making one of the most romantic tales of our time.And Mandy Moore manages to deliver her role brilliantly, bringing on screen the cherubic look the role demanded.And her expressions were simply loving.I was not sure whether I really wanted to watch this movie or not.Was thinking that it might be just another movie about the college going teens, their ""American"" way of living and some torrid affairs.Hell, I was wrong.This movie is an inspiring tale of love, of unfailing faith.Its about sacrificing.Its about rising in love.Just finished watching the movie with my wife and I must tell at the end we were just holding each other and silently shedding tears.Then we realized we have many things to do for each other,: things which we had promised to do long ago but could not do.If you have watched it, well and fine.If you have not yet, then you are really missing something which should not be missed at least by them who still believes in the power of love, believe in something "" which can't be seen, but can be felt""Forget about the critics, forget about movie making, go and watch this movie.It is surely gonna make you feel a lot better at the end and make you realize that you still have many unfinished things in your list.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A wonderful film,"Although this movie is for high school students, I found something that really imspires me. I guess it really doesn't matter the age.When we were young, we dreamed about a wonderful love. It happened to someone but not everyone. I don't believe that there is a person like Carter exist on this planet. Perhaps I am too skeptical. But who else can be so loyalty and faithful to their lover when one knows the other is dying.Especially they are young that they are too young to know what is life.The director or the author of this book is somehow drawing a picture of our future life style. Whatever the religion you believe in, it is obvious the form that we should approach. In this century, we are facing the bigger and even worse problems are our new generation. We are desperately searching the solution to solve this so-called ""hopeless"" disease that causes all the parents in digging the hole of depression. This movie is a good one to think where we can really hold the line but not to sacrifice too much our joyful and of course moral sense. The most important is freedom.From my point, this can never be satisfied without certain rules applied. Imagined that if our new generations can behave like in this movie, this world can never have a chance to get worse.On the other hand, we should have a simple living environment. When people don't have not much choices to make, life can be easier. That is to say, life can have less all kinds of darkness power to poison our mental condition.The young actor is acting perfectly and naturally. Especially when he said ""I love you"" to the actress, his eyes showed the greates sorrow and the compassion. The most attractive moment I've ever seen. Perhaps he is young so the passion within his eyes does not pollute much.When you get older and your dreams never fulfilled, it would only come to the real in the movie. That's why this film is so wonderful to bring you back to the past and your dreams without space and times limit.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Objectively a better story than The Last of Us 2,"Now why am I talking about a game in a movie review? Well because The Last of Us 2 is a disappointingly dumb game and there are disappointingly dumb people who think it isn't. It's so easy to make people sad and angry, to make them happy and laugh is the hard part. The game went for the lowest hanging fruit (story wise), and disguises itself as a good game with its aesthetic and its predecessor's good responses. Hence my disappointment. This movie has done more than make me hate itA Walk to Remember 2002 is a teen drama that was done fairly well given what it was.There's a lot of cringe I can forgive mainly because they are teens, but still, it annoyed me. The movie made me smile and it made me care about the charactersThe play was very enjoyable. The best part of the movie imoThe movie could have done w/o the melodrama. It shouts generic from 2 decades ago. It had the minimum character development I thought and it was predictable too. Other than that, it had many time lapses and stereotypes every other corner.Like I said, BETTER than The Last of Us 2.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
How can you say anything bad about this movie?,"A walk to remember.... Well let me start by crediting the film producers and directors for hiring the two most perfect looking actors for the main parts.Mandy Moore, well what can i say Mandy, not known as one of the most great actresses or singers but she is my favourite celebrity, she pulled off the part of Jamie Sullivan like no other would be able to, many people slag off her voice and her acting skills but what is actually wrong with any of her skills?. Mandy Moore has a sweet singing voice which suits Jamie's character, would a voice like Anastasia's, Britney Spear's or Christina Aguilera's really be suitable as the role of the caring, sweet, church girl?. Mandy's acting also was very good, you actually admired this girl, and even though she dies at such a young age is this film you can't help having a slight wish that you were her.Shane West, not some of the best films i have to say, get over it, liberty heights and a 20 second part in Dracula 2000, but still this film was what really showed off what was inside of him, his acting as the typical bad boy turns good was enjoyable to watch, i genuinly believed that without Jamie's help he would of never been able to turn good, but still you could see the good inside of him.The songs of the film were absolutely fantastic, including of course Mandy Moore, The New Radicals, Switchfoot, and Top Loader just to name a few. I have read endless bad reviews on this film but when i watched it i didn't see it as predictable like many people thought you have your typical teen movies Pretty In Pink, She's all that, and 10 things i hate about you, all good films but all good long winded ways of the guy getting the girl, but a walk to remember i found different, you saw their love grow but not only that you witnessed their lives together and believed that they genuinly were happy, and while i was left in floods of tears as Jamie left with her unfailing faith there was still part of me smiling.I agree none of this would ever happen, but most films are the same... and if they are realistic not many people want to watch them. I have rated this film a 10, i think it is great and was not comercialised enough, if you have seen this and enjoyed it....:)... if you have seen it and disliked it then watch it again and if you haven't seen it.... yup watch it...!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sappy,"Although the movie was well scripted and fairly acted, it was very mushy and predictable.  Those of you who didn't read the bestseller when it first arrived on bookshelves had no idea what you were getting yourself into, but for us we were quite surprised that the great book was adapted into a movie. This was an excellent choice for Mandy Moore to pick as her first starring lead role in a motion picture, and she is a fine actress with great learning talent.  Shane West was excellent as the heartthrob/ bad-boy, but not a far departure from his current character on ""Once and Again"".  All and all the movie was moderately good, but needed more substance and less reliability on the romantic element.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
U have to see it!,"Its a movie of life time. It makes u laugh and cry. It engrosses u completely and u are unaware of what happens to yourself. Its a must watch for everybody. No age differences for the cleanest movie of Hollywood. I loved Mandy Moore like anything. The expressions of Shane West were really great. The scene in which he confronts his father a second time was heartening. The love story was superbly picturized. I loved the environment in which the movie was taken. I can't say anything about the sound track in this film, as i'm obsessed with it. The song Jamie sings is unbelievable. The ending was a little hasty but well taken. Finally its the softest and loveliest movie ever taken.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Walk To Remember (truly a film to remember),"I had never seen ""A Walk To Remember"" at the cinemas and I had never read any of its reviews in the mags or papers. All I knew about the film was it was a ""teen film with singer Mandy Moore'. Yeah that's all I knew. So when I got this film for my birthday I do admit to wondering if this would just be another film with a singer trying to do her best in a film and stumbling her way through it. So when I put this video into my machine I kind of did expect that it would just be what I thought it would be ...But I was pleasantly surprised.Mandy Moore plays Jamie Sullivan. And Jamie (the preachers daughter) who isn't exactly in the popular crowd in fact she's far removed from them as you can get. Mandy is such a great actress and watching this film and knowing this is her first lead role makes it even more amazing because seeing her in this film you would think she's been acting forever. She has the ability to make the audience believe in the character that she's playing and that is something that not many people can do. She also makes this role her own and I don't think anyone else could have played Jamie because Mandy does it so brilliantlyShane West plays Landon Carter. Landon is the popular one and is surrounded by friends and is very much in the in-crowd. Shane's performance is brilliant in this. I admit I had never seen anything with Shane in it before but after watching this film I will definitely be checking out his other roles. In this film He plays the role of Landon brilliantly and switches from the bad guy stuff to the sensitive stuff with ease. Just like Mandy he makes the role his own.The pairing of Mandy and Shane (Jamie and Landon) was a good choice to make. There is so much chemistry there, which is what makes the film so great to watch. They work well together and there is no denying it. I really hope these two will have a chance to work together again because partnerships like that don't come along oftenThe film is so great, it had me hooked all the way through and Jamie's secret (I'm not gonna say what it is in case nobody has seen the film) comes out of the blue. It is totally unexpected and you don't see it coming. This film will make you smile and laugh at the good times that happen and also cry (like I did) at the circumstances that nobody has any control of.Did someone say there was meant to be a deleted scenes version of the DVD? I hope so. I got the video and it was so good and when I heard that there were extras on the DVD I went out and got that too. The only thing that wasn't on the DVD was the ""cry"" video that Mandy sings. Are Shane and she in the video too? Also the soundtracks brilliant too. Its not often that there is a soundtrack out there that you can sit and listen to it all the way through and say that is every songs great but with this you can because every songs great. It even makes me want to buy the book too which I probably willI would recommend this film to everyone and not just for teens. It appeals to everyone who basically wants to watch a good film. Because that's what it is.... actually its not just good its EXCELLENT lol. It isn't the same story that most films have, its very very different and that's why it is so unique. Movies like this don't come along very often so I recommend you buy it because it's not one to miss",,Anonymous,Romance
How the movie touched my heart.,"To me I thought the movie was great! It really touched my heart. It also broke my heart because the things I saw in that movie are still true today. Kids can be very cruel, and do things that can scar a person for life. This movie has brought back memories for me when I was in high school and middle school. I was a joke, and the popular kids made it worse for me everyday. And they took the liberty of letting me know that I was an outsider and that I was not good enough. If only they could see how life is so beautiful and precious that they shouldn't waste it on being so mean to others. Still till this day people are the same... the movie was beautiful and I hope it showed and touched people like it has touched me. Just because someone is not up to date and showing there body off or because they like to learn how the world goes round doesn't mean that they should be pushed aside. The movie gave me hope that one day I can end my sadness and there is a beautiful person out there that can accept me for who I am.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Potentionally could have been great but....,"This movie is a prime example of ""Commercialism vs. Artistry""The story has a ton of potentional, but falls into the typical trap of trying to appease a certain target audience. The sub plots are not developed in the slightest, and The characters seem to have little depth. Really folks, are teenagers these days suffering from ADD this much that we have to have films with the ""no Ridilin required"" label?Mandy Moore looks the part great, but let's understand that ""looking"" the part does not mean one becomes ""the part"".. For The most part, she delivers an inconsistent performance. Sometimes she is right on,(crying scenes and romantic intimaticy) other times I got the sense she was forcing lines without characterization.Her Character she plays in the movie seems contrived, even selfish at times. Jamie might try asking Landon ""what would you like to do today?"" Jeez, as if EVERYONE that is terminally ill needs more patronizing, and enjoys being catered to ""hand and foot""  Honestly, yes, it is fine and well that Landon wishes to fufill her ""wish list"" but each and every second? There is a fine line between compassion and patronization.What is missing here is obvious; ""can we get to know you guys first before we see your pain?"" ""Jamie, tell us about your faith,"" not that you ""have faith.""Well she can't, because it seems like the film makers did not want to ""offend"" anyone who is not a Christian. This is film making honesty? Jamie is A Christian correct? Isn't The head of Christianity someone named Jesus, then how come his name is never mentioned ONE TIME? Btw, Nice ""Head Ornament of Jesus"" in Jamie's home. I was not aware that ""Southern Christians"" had similar little ""statutes"" of The tortured thorn crown wearing Jesus as Catholics do. This is not a Christian film. Enough comments on how it is.I have not read the book but I will wager the book goes into Jamie's faith just a tad more than the movie does.Did we as well need a Mandy Moore Music video here? Her singing skit could not be more contrived unless she was a male midget at a ballpark urinal ""tryting to measure up""  This is out of character for Jamie, plain and simple.There is perhaps something worthwhile to this movie. At least it is not the typical teenage flick in the sense that not every teenage idiot is a bad person. They are still idiots, but not ""evil idiots"".Is this a tear jerker? Well, I felt sadness to a degree, but a small degree. Folks you want tear jerkers? Try The Green Mile. At least that film has characters clearly defined to love and hate. How about ET?..I just feel this film was targeted at teenagers who cry if their parents won't buy them a new car, and/or new shoes. JEEZ.If The film makers just really focused only on a good movie, without caring about just who in the hell might see it, they could have had a really good flick here. They should have gone for Anne Hathaway, who shows a good deal of acting ability and actaully looks 18 instead of 14. like Ms. Moore does. Maybe for The Male lead, they could have nabbed Ralph Machio,(The Karate Kid) he still looks like a teenage idiot, and he is like 50 years old.Actually, all kidding aside, Shane West does an adequate job.. Mandy Moore? Well, she is certainly a nice looking young woman. Perhaps she will take some acting lessons because she does show potentional. At least she was better than those other 2 ""singers"" who tried acting. That isn't saying much.Overall, not a bad film. However, could have been a great film. Peace",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

No clichés... no flicks. Simply what the true power of love is capable of.,"I had heard about this movie when it first came out. I had always thought it would be one of the usual flick, teen-like and full of clichés. The sort of movie you regret having paid for, that will only touch the superficials. But I was wrong.This movies holds a great many resemblances with The Notebook. Most probably because they are both based on novels written by Nicholas Sparks. A man who, in his life, clearly has experienced true love to be able to write about it so beautifully. If you have ever tasted true love, you will feel it during this picture. You will see the sparks between Jamie and Landon, because just like between Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling in the Notebook, the chemistry between Mandy Moore and Shane West is heartbreakingly real. This is without a doubt Moore's best movie and one of West's best performance.This movie is all about true love, and its power. A power so strong, that it can change you inside forever, change your life forever. Shane West portrays that very well, and Mandy Moore truly delivers an enchanting performance. You see it, and you believe it. Those who reproached The Notebook to be too long will definitely find A Walk to Remember better as it is significantly shorter. The essence though, remains intact. It would be hard to believe this picture will not bring tears to your eyes. At the very least, it will touch you, for sure. Just like after I finished watching The Notebook, I couldn't stop feeling serenity and warmth. Something so beautiful is truly rare, and anyone who will ever taste this will be lucky. This is what you understand from all of this, and the message is well and clearly delivered without the need of sex or nudity, which is a pretty rare thing NOT to see nowadays.Of course, it isn't perfect. Thankfully the usual they lived happily ever after cliché is non-existent here, and it wasn't the point. Some might find it too romantic, too unrealistic, cheesy even. As I said, those who have tasted this kind of love will see it this movie from a different angle. The score doesn't compare to Hans Zimmer's work (or The Notebook's for that matter), but it good, appropriate, and Mandy Moore's gentle voice can be heard a few times in the movie.I am very happy I gave the movie its chance. I shed quite a few tears, and wished the movie would not yet end. Although the level of complexity of The Notebook isn't present in A Walk to Remember, it touched me more, and it definitely stands in the league with The Green Mile of the biggest tear jerkers.All-in-all a great movie the romantic will purely and truly enjoy. If anything, a picture that will touch anyone who makes the effort to watch it with an open-mind, that such love exists. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sweet Movie,"It's funny because this movie has been out for almost 10 years now, and I had never taken the time to really sit down ad watch the whole thing in one sitting. From the bits I had seen, the movie was cheesy and predictable. But when I sat down yesterday, and watched every scene from start to finish, I realized that this is actually a really beautiful movie. Its a story about love and faith. At times, Mandy Moores acting skills were a little gigglerific, but as a viewer you almost look over it, because the character she plays is such a beautiful person, both inside and out (I can't tell you how many times I commented on Mandy Moore's beauty in this movie). It's really a good movie, about the power of love. I would recommend it to any romance lover.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I have already seen it 7 times, and I'm not tired of it.But I have to say, that my mind keeps racing every time I watch A Walk To Remember. The thing I really think about when the last words of the movie are said, is that there are some people that accept you for who you are, even though others don't... That what makes the world such a cruel place. It makes me cry to know that people are waiting to meet just one person like that. I find this story believable Every act made, every word said seems true. The chemistry between Mandy Moore and Shane West is incredible. They make people cry, just thinking about the story.

A masterpiece,"A masterpiece of patronizing, manipulative, short-sighted, teenage dreamy world absurdity. I'm amazed of how cardboard, insincere, and cookie-cutter all the characters were able to become with such brilliant direction.This movie was beyond compare in it's ability to expose deepness and richness of human experience (of how goody-good people are good and baddie-bad people are bad in a black and white world with easily defined borders, predictable outcomes and obvious mannerisms). Dude, Shakespeare would of been proud!!Great Christian values by the way, it so reminds me of the bible story where the goody-good guy said yes to his father, did good and saved the day, and the baddie-bad guy said no and did baddie bad stuff. Plain and simple. Just like in 'REAL' life.We all know that wearing crucifix's and conservative clothing and crossing our t's and dotting our i's with 'Jesus' and 'Mary' make us much much much much better than everyone else. That's why I read the bible, go to church and act like an asinine self-consumed jerk all the time. How else could I feel good about myself? Like keeping busy with my own personal salvation and profound spiritual perfection is going to give me time to be humble, sincere and truly care about the little people at the same time. Right. Whatever!I'd give it a 0 out of 10, but the scale doesn't go that low.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

A nice surprise.... absolutely loved it.,"Came home from work, fed up, flicked on Sky, saw listing for AWTR and sat down thinking, oh well, another teen romance, I'll give it the first 30 mins and switch over. Being a fella in his his early thirties who had grown up on Brat Pack movies didn't help.Had seen Shane West previously in 'Get Over It'(not his best work!) and knew of Mandy Moore but had never seen a review of the film, read the book, nothing.First five minutes I thought, nothing new here. But then as the minutes went by and the first scenes between West and Moore came on screen,I couldn't get over the chemistry between the two leads. I thought both Moore and West were excellent throughout even more surprising when I find out since, it was Moore's first lead role!The 'She's All That'clone thought did enter my mind worryingly at one point but that was refreshingly put to bed.It was lovely to see a film like this for once taking a different track. I expected the usual that you typically expect in a film like this, Jamie ends up looking like a beauty queen, Landon gives into his mates and stops seeing her, Jamie falls out with her Dad as he forbids her to see Landon etc. How wrong was I? Without giving the game away it was such a change to see a relationship being allowed to develop before our eyes for once.As for the twist I won't spoil it but I too have been personally effected by a situation such as Jamie's and I have to say I broke down a bit at that point. OK, it was handled in the movie 'Hollywood style' but at least it was done in my opinion sensitively, it did try and show the immense emotions you/friends/relatives find yourself in such a situation.Since seeing the movie I've read lots of critical reviews and I have to say I've been really annoyed by some of their inane comments and opinions. Clearly most of the critics went in to review this film with their minds already made up. However Roger Eberts review on 'external links' I thought was an honest and accurate description of the movie. Sure, corny in parts, but hey what movie isn't.It's nice to see I'm not alone in that a lot of people seem to have come across this gem of a movie by accident on cable or satellite etc and been really moved by it just like me. I cannot recommend it highly enough.I understand the film is a pretty good adaptation of the book, slightly updated, so I'm off to buy the DVD and the book!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not spectacular, but it reaches the heart","What i liked about this film so much was how i was able to relate to the character that Mandy Moore played. Although the directing, script and overall ""movie"" overview isn't that great, the good story line by Nicholas Sparks makes for a good movie. This IS a chick flick. There are many parts where i had to take a deep breath and hope that the movie would ""hurry up"". However, this film is worth seeing for a change from the traditional teen movie. I didn't feel that Shane West's character was all that deserving of Mandy Moore's. The ""love"" happened too quickly. NO i'm not jealous of Shane West or anything! I'm not that attracted to Mandy Moore.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The only spoiler here is my dark little secrets...,"I bought this movie at the local supermarket, at a substantially reduced price. From the cover and the resumé, I figured this would be a decent flick to have handy in the event I got some female company for a movie night.Now I find myself watching it alone.Repeatedly. By CHOICE.At first I tried blaming it on the presence of Mandy Moore. When that got old, I tried blaming it on the songs she sings in the movie (some of them are quite brilliant ballads). When that lie also faded, the truth stood clear; I simply love this movie.As a previous comment stated, ""You'll hate yourself for loving this movie"". How utterly true this is. I DO hate myself for loving it, but I love it nevertheless. It will make you smile, frown, laugh and cry. It is like taking an emotional roller-coaster, but you find yourself not wanting to get off. That said, director Adam Shankman elegantly avoids spending three hours telling the story, even though the story itself easily could justify it.Mandy Moore and Shane West both perform superbly, where I have yet to find significant flaws in their performance even after the n'th viewing. Supporting actors Peter Coyote and Daryl Hannah both deliver the goods with seasoned timing.I watched this movie again this evening, on TELEVISION, even though I have the DVD on the shelve next to it... I even get emotional reading the QUOTES from this movie on IMDb.com (which by the way contains a few spoilers - do not read until you've seen the movie!!!).All in all; I fail to see how anyone can be totally unaffected by this diamond in the rough. Watch it. Rent it. Buy it. Even as an ""aging"" flick by relative standards, it will prove well worth full price.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This 1s my favorite!,"Technically I've never read any of Nicholas Sparks books, I started to read the 2nd part to ""The Notebook"" called ""The Wedding."" But I never finished it. Out of the 11 movies he's written, I've only watched 9. & I don't think I could ever watch them. Mr. Nicholas likes to make u cry, so I already know if I watched the 1s I have yet to, ""Message in a bottle"" & ""Nights in Rodanthe"" I'd ball my eyes out. ""A Walk to Remember"" it's not the absolute saddest 1, but it's a sad movie I can handle to watch over & over, like I already have throughout the years! Nicholas Sparks is such a talented writer! Of course ""The Notebook"" was the 1st 1 I watched. To be truthful, there are some movies that u love but find it hard to watch alot. ""A Walk to Remember"" it's beautiful, it's sad, it's just incredible! If not 1 of Nicholas Sparks films doesn't make u choke up & cry, I suggest seeing a specialist about ur heart.... There is 1 I can NOT watch more than just the 1 time that I did, ""The Best of Me."" Paul Walker was meant to play the main guy but we lost him, so James Marsden was asked. He's eh...ok.... But that movie's story, it's just too beautiful to watch again. Maybe 1 day.. But A Walk to Remember, if u haven't watched it yet, then I have 1 thing to say, ""Why the HECK NOT??""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not enough words to describe such a beautiful masterpiece...,"I´m writing this feeling like I have not enough words to describe how amazing and beautiful this movie is. I first watched it when I was 16 or so and I loved it and it was always in the back of my mind and I kept thinking that I had to watch it again someday and I did, a couple days ago, at 21 and I felt it in such a strong and powerful way that I didn´t at 16. I cried so much it actually hurt. I can´t get over how pure of a movie it is, how beautiful and effortless. I absolutely fell in love with the natural amazing chemistry these two have and how real it all seems, so real it´s hard to remember it´s just a movie and it shouldn´t hurt as bad. It´s difficult for me because it´s possibly my favourite movie and I can´t watch it that often because it´s too sad but so beautiful I keep watching some scenes here and there.
For me it´s the best romantic movie, no matter what anyone says. I´ve watched a lot of movies and there is not a movie that´s had suck an impact in my life. It just feels different from everything else. There is not a soul with love inside of them who isn´t compelled to cry. I don´t cry that easily with movies but there is no way you won´t cry watching this. I guess the vulnerability I now have that I didn´t at 16 helps making this movie so painful to watch but I don´t care. It´s perfection on the big screen and I can´t get enough of it. The world needs movies like this. Devoid of malice, just a pure representation of the true meaning of love. I desperately want a love like that and I want to love and be loved like I´m in a movie. 
This movie has an eternal hold of mt heart and my soul.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Better than I thought it would be,A Walk to Remember is one of the films that I talked about negatively before I saw the preview and didn't wanna see it. I recently saw the film twice on HBO and I really enjoyed it. Shane West and Mandy Moore both give great performances and have good chemistry. The film is a tear jerker but the tears in the movie are earned and not forced. I give this film *** stars.,,Anonymous,Romance
A Movie to remember! When simplicity is all! (dvd),"This movie is so good, that it made me live its exact story while watching it.Indeed, it talks about how a bad feeling can turn into something beautiful & unforgettable by the power of love.So, when I picked the DVD, I thought ""Another boring teen movie!"". But, when I put it on my player, the title song (Cry) struck me. It is all I asked for music: easy listening & moving, so I can't put it outside my head. Then, I watched the bonuses (I know: every people tells I should invert my habit). I found Mandy Moore to be a lively actress, as well as Shane West (a good Anakin he may have been). Then, I watched it. And frankly, it didn't caught me until it answered two of my questions:1.Will the gift of his pink shirt be used in the continuity of the storyline?2. How this storyline could evolve as it kept going stronger & happier?The answers I received was so respectful & surprising, that I was won over. At this moment, I liked this movie and couldn't put it down until I watched its end!Now, with a little time, its simplicity gave me a feeling of my ""Must Do Dreams"". Those families live in a community, they lead simple life, express simple feelings, which are for me all definitions of Happiness.In conclusion, one of the few ""adaptation"" which gave me the desire to read the original book!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Emotional Movie. Predictable? Yes, so what?","I am not a person who likes chick flicks, but this movie is different. There's something about it that leaves me with a smile on my face - and a few tears in my eyes - every time I watch it.
This is a fairly predictable movie, but so what? Not every movie out there has to be as deep and profound as relativistic quantum mechanics. The lead characters acting was very good, Mandy Moore did the role of her life in my opinion. Other players were good too, but there wasn't enough room for their characters to assess fairly. I especially liked the dynamics between Landon and his father.
And one more thing: many say they don't like this movie because it tries to shove religious doctrine down people's throat. I am a non-believer, and still I didn't feel this way. It presents a classic 'even a disbeliever needs some kind of faith', not necessarily faith in a supreme power, just like Dr. Ellie's faith from Contact, but that's a different story.
For those of you who like to have their brains picked by watching movies, relax and enjoy this one, you can return to your nuclear engineering research later.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good romantic comedy.,"I enjoyed A Walk to Remember. It was certainly a good romantic comedy, with great performances, nice cinematography, natural and fluid dialogue, a good plot, and a well written romance. Really, their romance wasn't really forced or awkward at all. It was genuine and sweet. It was quite fun to watch. However, it is quite predictable. Good girl, bad boy, fall in love until disaster strikes, threatening to tear them apart. It is stereotypical, I've watched movies exactly like this countless of times, and it's a bit cheesy. Some parts seemed a bit too long, stretched on for too much, but I guess it builds up the gradual tension. I suppose some people enjoy those types of romantic comedies, but I don't really. In the end, I still enjoyed watching this movie, and I recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Extremely emotional and good movie. I give a score of 8,"I have seen certain comments that put equality between this film and ""One Give"". All parameters are on the side of this movie. First, the concept of the whole story is brilliant. Secondly, the whole stream of the film deals with the monitoring of two young people, a guy who is extremely problematic and a girl who is a person for the case. This film shows that it is possible that the ""bad"" guy for love changes and shows how much for real love there are no limits. The movie is easy to watch, it fills. The film ""Give it"" gave me the grade 7. This certainly deserves 8. What is ""flawed"" is that these stories are too screened with the subject and the viewers will not see much of the new one.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Moving,"A dark-haired, shabbily-dressed Mandy Moore stars as a high school gal with a deep dark secret in A WALK TO REMEMBER. Costar Shane West plays a bad boy who gets himself in trouble and is forced to do community service. This includes acting with Moore in a school play about shy lovers. Predictably, West falls in love with Moore even when she warns him not to. Then her secret comes out (it starts with a ""c""), and he loves her even more, enough to ask her to marry him. The film is a tender tale of the redemptive powers of faith and love, and forgiveness. It is frankly very moving for such a hokey plot. Peter Coyote and Darryl Hannah costar as parents. Hannah is almost unrecognizable under a dark wig and little makeup. A must-see.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overrated and hackneyed,"""A Walk to Remember"" was one of the most un-original movies I have ever seen in my life.  This movie uses Tiger Beat stars such as Mandy Moore and Shane West to attract it's core teenage audience and instead of trying to create a movie worth their dollars, they crank out a piece of garbage that actually achieves a level of deception.  The people responsible for this ""movie"" aimed to create a semi-adult type of sob story for teens.  They aimed to make teenagers believe it was a good, well-done, heartfelt, touching movie when it actually was a poorly made movie with a hackneyed plot. I strongly do not recommend this ""movie"".",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Finally I can forgive Mandy Moore for ""Candy.""","By rights, I shouldn't have cared for ""A Walk To Remember"" - not only does it scream ""painfully predictable sapfest"" but it prominently features pop starlet turned movie starlet Mandy Moore, the tall maiden responsible for the skin-crawlingly bad single ""Candy"" and one of the problems with the otherwise quite appealing ""The Princess Diaries."" And it does start off badly, with our hero (Shane West) getting arrested after a dare out by a factory goes wrong and everyone runs for it. It also doesn't help that practically everyone he goes to school with is some kind of stereotype (especially his black best friend - there are black guys who don't like hip-hop, you know). And then there's the quiet, almost saintly girl who he has to do the school play with, and who's his polar opposite, especially in matters of faith.And yet... and yet... The movie is, in fact, pretty affecting. True, everyone but the two main characters is pretty flimsy; yes, Mandy's solo number in the school play does have ""gratuitous"" written all over it; indeed, it doesn't add up to all that much in the end; but the movie's too sincere in its approach to really despise, and while it does have a pro-faith agenda it doesn't take a Jehovah's Witness approach to its story, thanks to a lot of restraint in its telling and acting - no Big Dramatic Moments (even though some of the story turns would almost justify it), just plenty of heart.""A Walk To Remember"" actually did better at the US box office than Britney Spears's ""Crossroads"" - while I'm a Britney man, I have to admit that this movie deserved to do so. It may be sentimental drama, but it's pretty good sentimental drama. (And yes, Mandy Moore can act.)",,Anonymous,Romance

One of the most touching movies out there...,"This movie is exceptionally better than what some critics have given it. I had never cried to a movie before, but this movie is that good. I've watched it a few times now, each time it brought tears. A beautiful and heartbreaking story about two high school students (Shane West and Mandy Moore) that go from one end of the spectrum to the other. The boy starts out to be a tough guy with a group of friends only to be changed... The acting is good, and Mandy Moore has the rare talent of being able to act and sing well. This movie deals with real-life issues and that's a big reason why this can be so personally touching. This is definitely a must see. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone - one of my favourites!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"If You Don't Like This Movie, You're An Insensitive Jerk","The story is simple: a rebel boy with a broken childhood (Shane West) gets placed with a good Christian girl (Mandy Moore) and she begins to change him into a better person. Yes, the plot is really that simple.I have seen this movie a bit more than a handful of times and would go so far as to say the film is my third favorite movie of all time (behind ""Mallrats"" and ""Waterworld""). So if my opinion is a little biased, my sincerest apologies.The star of this film is Shane West, who went on to be a big star on the television show ""ER"" and the mismanaged film ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"". I was convinced that he was a rebel, a lover and a confused little boy. He seemed very good at expressing a wide range of feelings and it was easy to identify with him. Excellent casting, especially considering at the time he was an unknown.Mandy Moore also stars, but she is clearly following Shane's lead. With the exception of her solo scene (where she will amaze you with her vocal beauty and stunning good looks), she doesn't really do very much. She walks with her head down and talks in a monotone voice. There are times where I wasn't sure if this was bad acting or a poorly written character. But maybe you won't notice. I didn't notice until my third or fourth viewing (and I think it helps if you're watching with someone you care about). Even in her solo scene, the director seems to be unsure of what angle he wants to work with, which seems to distract from the whole. My friend Shannon also found the song a bit long, although I disagree.Multiple viewings are required to pick up on all the subtle hints left throughout the film about the twist. You might catch some, but others you will completely miss. I guarantee.I think the budget went almost entirely to the soundtrack. Daryl Hannah (""Kill Bill"", ""Blade Runner"") and Peter Coyote (""Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis"") must have worked for free, because there are something like thirty songs in this movie (including at least three by Mandy Moore, but a variety of other things like Jars of Clay and ""Big Pimpin"" appear). If you pay attention to just the music, you'll notice very few scenes aren't loaded with some song -- so again, is the movie selling the soundtrack or is the soundtrack selling the movie?But anyway, yeah, watch this with someone you love. You might cry your eyes out. I did on my first viewing in the theater with my girlfriend at the time. Of course, if you're a girl, you might cry anyway. And that's cool. Guys like chicks who cry. We totally dig that. Why do you think we let you watch Lifetime? This film, like Lifetime, is a guilty pleasure -- maybe nothing Oscar-worthy, but a fun and emotional movie. Also, it makes a great precursor for the much bigger and much sadder Nicholas Sparks masterpiece, ""The Notebook"".",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Formulaic rubbish,"I taped this from late night TV because I thought something with Shane West might be interesting, after seeing him on ER. He did well, but was wasted in a trite, clichéd and completely unrealistic film. I at no time believed in any of the characters - the lead girl's 'acting' was just looking doe eyed and purse-lipped and as for the rest of the 25year old 'teens'...... Embarrassingly bad, even for an afternoon movie. There's nothing wrong with a redemption movie - but it insults our intelligence to have such a simplistic narrative, trying to push all the emotional buttons without any real thought or conflict. These aren't the issues real teenagers face, nor are people's reactions that predictable. That said, it doesn't work as an idealised form of reality either. Very forgettable.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's Been Done Before... Hundreads of Times.,"Just your stereotypical lame teen flick -- with major religious undertones, which, by the way, was quite annoying at times. It's all been done before, and much better than this.The ""bullies"" were so one-dimensional and unconvincing. They failed to show any genuine interest in Jamie (the bullies in ""Carrie"", for instance, were far more involved), so it made Jamie look almost like a paranoid drama queen.Landon's ex-girlfriend's character was horribly underdeveloped, not to mention the rest of the ""cool"" clique -- they were just cardboard cut-outs with screen time of about 10 seconds. 95% of time time, the focus was on Jamie alone -- she was supposed to be likable, but so much emphasis on a single person renders you fed-up with - annoyed by - her.Mandy Moore was kind of miscast anyway. She doesn't pass for an outcast.The good thing is that this movie is not irritating or overly dumb (it's actually more or less watchable); the bad thing: very clichéd, too predictable, and becomes boring very quickly.I'm giving it a rating this high, because Mandy Moore turned out to be surprisingly decent at acting.

More Peer Pressure,"It's pretty good, with some draggy spots and the predictable outcome.  It would be a good film for family night (WARNING:  some swearing, slight violence) with teens/pre-teens, as it would give you a good starting point to talk about peer pressure and the junk that can go on in schools. Beaufort was a lovely background for the film.  I'm surprised that more filmmakers do not use the Carolina coast more often.One ""goof"" in the film was the post-date trip to the Virgina border.  The movie implied that they did that the same night of the first date, but for them to just reach the border would take at least 2 hours (or longer) ONE WAY.  I don't think the Reverend would have been too pleased to have his daughter back home after 2 am.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A walk I'll remember....,"This movie is a movie that is thrashed upon by many, and loved by the rest. I am on the fence. I love to hate this movie and I hate to love it. I own both the VHS and the DVD of this movie, but that could just be my obsession for Mandy Moore. Plus, they were both gifts to me. I have seen this movie countless times now and I can say after viewing it that many times, the movie has many flaws. To the viewers who see this for the first time it is an amazing tale that is (yes) highly predictable. Mandy Moore's performance in the movie is one that couldnt be done better by anyone else (maybe my obsession for her once again), but she did such a great job in this movie and the chemistry between her and Shane West was incredible. The scene where she comes back and says ""to death"" when Landon (West) asks her if she is scared gets me everytime. The emotion displayed by both leads (Moore and West) is not overdone nor underdone, but perfect. The plot, for a movie, is great, but realistically no. When you sit down for a movie, unless you are planning on reviewing it you never look at it with a selective eye. You like the movie or you don't, and there are no IN DEPTH real reasons why we do or we don't---we just do. So, as a NON-avid reviewer, I liked this movie and I'm a guy...I've seen it as I said countless times and I will probably watch it again. I do not recommend seeing it 7000 times, but I recommend seeing it at least once. And everyone who hated it---watch it with the perspective of you being Shane West. Wouldnt you be the luckiest guy in the world?? :) The movie rates a 9/10 in my book. Because it is predictible and nothing really new out there, I had to slash off a point. The cast was great and the movie was great. Read the book too....",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Themes, sex and staying true to morals...","A Walk to Remember is a beautiful film which stays true to Nicholas Sparks' best selling novel of the same title. I found that the themes of the movie were brilliantly exhibited. Everything does ultimately come down to who is by your side. Mandy Moore's character, Jamie Sullivan, is inspiring as she never once, through all obstacles, turns from her faith. She stays true to it and preaches the powerful word of God to all who are willing to listen. She humbles herself to those in need and wishes for nothing more than to do good. Her soft but strong character helps Landon Carter (Shane West) grow from a rebellious teen to a ambitious young man at the end of the film.In the scene where Jamie and Landon meet at her telescope and they make a quick reference to sex, my ratings on the film boosted. I thought it was amazing that Jamie did not give in to temptation and stayed true to what she believed in. I thought the best part about this was the fact that i saw a beautiful romance movie which did not involve any sex scenes, something very rare in the world today as you can not even turn the television on without seeing sex advertised.I believe that A Walk to Remember was a brilliant movie sure to move the hearts of anyone who truly believes in the power of love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

what I think,"All in all, as a movie, it does well on its own. A bit sappy but good nonetheless. This Nicholas Sparks (I've recently come into his books) adapted film wasn't quite the tear-jerker that ""The Notebook"" was, but it pays its due to his book I suppose.However, it doesn't really follow the novel at all. (I watched the movie first as I wasn't really into Nicholas Sparks; actually I'm still unsure) SPOILER ALERT! (I suppose, but more so for the book, if you haven't read it yet.) They did cover the wedding scene in the Special Features on the DVD so I won't go into that.Jamie never has a list of things she wants to do (the one most outstanding is being in two places at once). Her father writes a play called ""The Chrimstas Angel"" which gives Jamie a MUCH more wholesome look than in whatever the play is in the movie. Landon doesn't kiss her then and he only realizes he's in love with her after spending time with her at an orphanage she has devoted her life and work to helping.And although Landon's best friend Eric makes cracks, he accepts Landon's decision and makes the comment that he's finally ""growing up"", which shows something different than the punching scene in the movie.Jamie never lets Landon in her home and the father disallows too much unsupervised contact between the two. AND they never work on the lines from the play together.Jamie doesn't have that awareness of being ""special friends"" where no one can see; she's just her own person doing her own thing and helping others. And the reverend announces the fact that Jamie has leukemia to the congregation and everyone starts to feel guilty and at one point Eric breaks down because he doesn't feel someone like Jamie deserves this outcome. (Bible-toting do-gooder; AND there's a specific special reason why she carries a tattered Bible everywhere) Basically, READ the book. You'll find it's quite different from the movie.Oh and Landon's ex-girlfriend barely gets any mention except for when she gets drunk and pukes all over the bathroom and herself and Jamie and Landon help her clean up and go home. There's no jealousy or resentment.When Mandy Moore (Before she filmed) had ""A Walk to Remember"" as a favorite book, I assumed she'd want to stay true. The movie is completely different, but like I said, it holds its own.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Though the film is like four years ago, way back when I was seventeen. I still believe that this film offers more than just a teen movie. More than just an ugly-duckling-Cinderella plot. More than just a teenage-courtship love story. There's more to that... Lessons not only teenagers should learn. It is for everyone who yearns for their own walks to be remembered.

Touching story.. Excellent acting..!!,"Based on the book by Nicholas Sparks, this movie falls under the genre of Romantic Dramas. Beautiful acting, beautiful screenplay and some very good direction makes this a must watch if you like romantic movies with a lot of clichés and an ending that leave you feeling miserable.But if you are a fan of romantic comedy, then I would suggest you give this movie a gentle pass no matter how much people rave about it cause let's face it, the more beautifully sad movies are shot, the more emotionally effected the audience gets.A big shout out to the cast and crew for an amazing effort that pays off through the screen, whether big or small.Bottomline - Even though I personally am not a fan of the romantic drama genre, it did not stop me from noticing exactly how excellent the walk to remember actually was as a movie in itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's my Only Hope,"This has always been one of my favorite movies of all time. As a hopeless romantic, sappy does me in. But there was something more about this movie. It wasn't sappy. It was all mushy gooshy that-would-never-happen kind of thing. It was real. It felt real. It was moving and powerful. It makes you want to appreciate life a little more. The casting was perfect. Mandy Moore shined as Jamie, the quiet, intelligent, hard-working but unsocial minister's daughter who doesn't care what anyone else thinks about her. Shane West was a perfect Landon, making the smooth transition from Bad-boy of the school, to the sweet and sensitive love of Jamie's life. It seemed like the perfect story for Jamie to turn Landon into a man strong in faith and values. She is his inspiration and guide. She teaches him how to live life to the fullest and see things in the proper light. If only. Just as Landon begins to see that Jamie is his ""Only Hope"" he learns a gut-wrenching secret. The strong, loving, caring, sweet, intelligent love of his life is dying. In a race against time, Landon is determined to find his place in the world and his place with Jamie. He shows her the world. Tries to make all of her dreams come true. And if the thought of being with her the rest of his life strengthened his faith, then the thought of being without her made it even stronger. Although this movie is very different from the Novel written by Nicholas Sparks, it does have some advantages. The setting in the Nick Sparks book is 1956. The more modern setting of A Walk to Remember made the story more understandable for the younger generations as well as the young high-school love. The list that Jamie makes of all her hopes and dreams isn't in the Novel either, but it's a good way to show the gestures Landon made to help Jamie with her dreams. The play was written into the novel, but the play was a Christmas Play and she was an angel. In the film, the Play becomes a musical when Jamie sings ""Only Hope."" Although Jamie is not musical in the novel, it gives a nice touch of a sweet girl who has talents just like anyone else, but chooses to use them in different ways. Overall, this movie is incredible.

A Grown-up Teen Movie,"A Walk To Remember is a grown-up teen movie, it still holds the usual traits, but the narrative is more mature and is handled in a more adult way. Mandy Moore's starring role will surprise everyone, she embodies her character perfectly, her acting is right on the mark, she definitely has more talent than your average pop star. Shane West shines too as Landon, the bad boy who looks deeper inside of himself, aided by his love for Moore's character Jamie, and changes the way he's been living.It's a very moral packed movie. Jamie is a devout Christian, and Landon puts his life back on the straight and narrow. It's a journey, that is somewhat rushed I must add. The book is full of content, which has had to be fitted into a movie, and so the love between the characters develops very quickly, and the ending is even faster, and not as poignant because of this.But overall, an excellent film, I cried, I laughed, and I enjoyed it.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Walk To Remember,"""A Walk to Remember"" a film based off of Nicholas Sparks best selling book. Staring Mandy Moore as Jamie Sullivan and Shane West as Landon Carter. The film opens with Landon and his gang being rebellious landing a ""new member"" in the hospital, and Landon in the police station. Jamie, a girl from high school, is the complete opposite; she is known as the preacher's daughter and plays this role very well. She does a stunning job of acting innocent and pure. Her path collides with London's when he is thrown into the school musical as a part of his punishment for his behavior. Landon does a fine job of showing that he doesn't care about this play or about life. There is a small portion of singing in this film done by Mandy Moore. She hits all of her notes. While watching you can tell that this song was previously recorded and that she is lip- syncing. This also might be because it was filmed in 2002. Landon soon falls in love with Jamie after hours of rehearsal. As their relationship develops Landon turns a corner and becomes a new person full of life. During this time Jamie breaks the news to Landon that she is leukemia and has stopped talking treatment. Landon along with Jamie's father deal with her death and he grows as a person. There are times in this film where the acting isn't up to par, but over all the cast is chosen very well, and they all do a great job in this journey together.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Formula teen melodrama,"Landon Carter (Shane West) is a popular self-obsessed top dog. He is uncaring and when one of his pranks goes wrong, he puts a fellow student in the hospital. As punishment, he is forced to be the lead in a school play. Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) is the reverend's daughter who has nothing in common with Landon. She is also in the play, and Landon ask her for help. Only he won't let anybody know.This is a predictable teen melodrama based on a Nicholas Sparks novel that has all the stereotypes. I'm just surprised that the formula works yet again. All the characters are stock creations. It moves along the well traveled tracks. Both leads are likable and solid but uninspired. Of course, this being a Nicholas Sparks movie. There has to be a secret or twist. I do wish there was something more profound and original dialog.

Mandy Moore's Breakout Movie - Must See,"The beginning setup scene looks like any other teen party flick, but if you stay longer, you'd discover a gem. How long ? Just long enough for Mandy Moore to show up! A pastor's daughter, she is the studious, uncool girl in school. But Moore's Jamie is also intelligent, articulate, wholesome, anchored in her faith and illuminates a natural beauty. You see girls like that in school. Guys go for the wild type, the type who just want to have fun. Jamie is unfazed by the slights of the ""cool"" cliques and carries herself with poise and grace. She has just enough attitude to fend off the infantile jokes without being like the others when provoked. Landon, Shane West's popular heart-throb character, was put into a school play and he sought more drama tips with Jamie who was his female lead. she agreed but told him ""you must not fall in love with me"" portentously. Engrossed in teenage male popular boy ego, Landon replied with ""that's won't be a problem"". Landon was blinded to the beauty in Moore in the beginning like hiding the fact he was meeting with her from his friends. ""You mean we are like secret friends ?"" Jamie tautly countered him. All that changed after the school play in which he saw her natural elegance and beauty. You know the rest of the story. Boy smitten with girl. Girl likes boy. They hung out - there were nice scenes of night sky and star gazing through Jamie's prized big telescope. But there was a dark cloud coming. I will spare the spoiler. Peter Coyote and David Lee Smith turned in seasoned supporting performances as the fathers of Jamie and Landon, respectively. Especially touching was the moment the divorced father of Landon done a good deed and Landon returned to hugged him father and son; they had been estranged before. But everything all points back to Moore. This was her first breakout hit and established her as a solid actress, setting up for more films in which she played teen princess roles fittingly.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A great movie to fall asleep in,"It's late. You've just seen Not Another Teen Movie. Now you want to go for drama. A dramatic teen movie. A good one. Then, you come across this. A Walk To Remember is the definition of teenage movie. Unfortunately, it's not very memorable, especially when you see your favorite insomniacs sleeping for the first time in weeks.It's the usual plot. Not much changes. Some guy falls in love with a girl (Mandy Moore). The ""ugly"" unfashionable girl just happens to be Mandy Moore. Set in the South, and their times are just the whole movie.Now, if someone did have acting lessons that would be useful for this movie, it wouldn't help. The plot is overused and shot up, it's not even funny to poke fun at. The dialogue is so cheesy, you might as well bring a tub of macaroni with you. It helps if you're a teenager who couldn't care less, being a Mandy Moore obsessed fan, enjoying such movies as The Mummy Returns and you really want to preserve On The Line in theaters forever. But, unlike the rest of the world, these people don't pay good money to see this movie.No good points, really for this movie, except that it has people who can't see it's Mandy Moore playing the ugly girl. Bad points are countless, including the unrealistic setting. The only real accomplishment is when a teen movie really does TRY to win America's hearts. If you are dying to see it, rent it, or better yet, forget it.This movie wants to make you laugh, cry, and experience every other emotion a teenager can have.

"A cliché romance, but with good remarkable scenes and good characters. ""A Walk to Remember"" is one of those films that the tissues end, but the tears do not!","""A Walk to Remember"" is one of those films that the tissues end, but the tears do not. The feature is based on the book of the same name by Nicholas Sparks and at first it seems like a simple teenage novel, somewhat cliché, but it went far beyond that, even having a hint of religion in the plot. There is nothing innovative about this production and, when watching a cliché, it is clear that we do not expect something new. So what makes ""A Walk to Remember"" above average? The most important factor is the point that some elements that appear in the film, such as the exacerbated devotion of the protagonist, which is not portrayed with spectacle throughout the film. Usually in clichés, these devices tend to base the exploration of arches. However, narratives become easily boring for the target audience, who want to see a cheesy novel and not a family or social problem. The luck of the film is to be behind the curtain of cliché. Thus, some actions, such as Landon changing personality from one scene to another or characters stereotyped to the extreme, are forgiven by the genre of the work. In other genres, these elements would be somewhat harshly criticized, but here, they are acceptable.Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) is a religious girl and her father is a minister. Totally unpopular, the girl ends up falling in love with the rebel Landon Carter (Shane West), who, when involved in an accident, is forced to do community service. Landon has to participate in a school musical as lead singer alongside Jamie. Obviously, at first Jamie doesn't care for the boy and neither does he for her, but living together makes the two fall in love.There are changes in relation to Sparks' book, to set the story for today and facilitate some passages, and these changes, in general, are favorable to adaptation. The character Landon, for example, in the film is an inconsequential bad boy. The Landon of the book is far from a rebel without a cause. He has his little group and a not very exemplary behavior, but he doesn't make any highly questionable mistakes as shown in the film. His family is portrayed differently. In the feature he is the son of separated parents and has a life without luxuries and his relationship with his father, who is a doctor, is non-existent, since he thinks he was abandoned. In the book, on the other hand, Landon's parents are married and his father is a politician with dubious attitudes and his life is comfortable. The relationship with the father is distant, but it is not as difficult as in the film.Jamie's character doesn't change much. She is sweet, selfless, kind and always responds to offense with a smile. Her unshakable faith is inspiring, and we cannot finish this book without reflecting on our own faith and asking ourselves what God's plan is for us. In the feature with Mandi Moore, the character has a list of things she wants to do - be in two places at the same time, help someone she doesn't like, have a star named after her, witness a miracle... -, not in the book. There is none of that... The book is narrated by Landon, 40 years later. Now 57 years old, he begins to remember his adolescence, how Jamie changed him and his gratitude for the moments he lived with her, thus becoming a better man and the way he remembers his love with her. Young, a rare jewel makes even the hardest heart move with so much affection and gratitude.The plot has enough revelations to focus on how Jamie's quiet example makes Landon a better person. The film treads a fine line with the character of Peter Coyote, whose church Landon attends. Movies have a way of stereotyping reactionary Bible scouts who are hostile to teen romance. There's a little bit of that here; Jamie is banned from dating, for example, although there's more to her decision than instinctive rigidity. But when Landon goes to Rev. Sullivan and asks him to have faith in him, the minister listens with an open mind. Yes, the movie is cheesy at times. But corny is good sometimes. Director Adam Shankman and his writer, Karen Janszen, working from Nicholas Sparks' novel, have an unforced confidence in the material that redeems and even justifies the broad strokes. They only go awry three times: (1) the subplot involving the paralyzed boy should have been dealt with or dropped; (2) It is tiresome to make the black teenager use ""brother"" in every sentence, as if he is not his peer, but transported from another world; (3) As Kuleshov proved over 80 years ago in a famous experiment, when the audience sees a deadpan close-up, it provides the necessary emotion of context. It can be fatal for an actor to try to ""act"" in close-up, and Landon's smirk at the end is a distraction at a crucial moment.The film's driving and pacing are also far from perfect. The first and second acts follow this traditional cliché. However, from one hour to the next, it is revealed that the protagonist has cancer, and then a great unexpected drama begins in the tape. It would be preferable for the film to maintain the line it was following. This is because, as the disease is only mentioned in the middle of the third act, the drama is very drawn out, so there is not even time to feel any empathy for Jamie's illness. If it was something quoted from the beginning, it would be more appreciable for the viewer.Right at the beginning of the film we get the feeling that those teenagers would be murdered at any moment by some psychopath. It's not very common for a romance movie to start in such a dark way. But the world is not fair and what we watch next is a number of shameful scenes and sequences. As much as we know that there are disputes to see who will listen to a certain song on the car radio, these things could have sounded more natural instead of being played and trying to force the viewer to accept and feel moved by that innocent fight. ""Um Amor Para Rememberar"" lacks the construction of the story too much. Everything is too shallow and simplistic (especially Landon's change) and the result is clichés and weak scenes like the one mentioned above. However, these are small flaws in a moving film.The film still has well-constructed and impactful scenes, such as Jamie appearing singing in his church choir, how Landon taught all about triangles to the uninterested boy he was teaching and Landon helping to fulfill Jamie's wish list. Moore and West's performances are so quietly convincing, it reminds you that many teenagers in movies seem to think like 30-year-old comedians. That Jamie and Landon base their romance on values and respect will surprise some viewers of the film, especially as the first five or ten minutes seem to follow a familiar teen movie trail. ""A Walk to Remember"" is a little treasure.Can Adam Shankman's film, especially in this day and age, be considered outdated, cheesy, unrealistic and immature? Yes. But to some extent it has to be since it's a romantic drama for teens. It does not go so far as to insult the intelligence of its audience. It's heartfelt and well-written, and its characters are extremely memorable. It's one of those simple stories where the setting and stakes are so clearly defined that most of your viewer time is spent watching the character develop. Something that really stands out in this film is Jamie's purpose as a character. Many of these stories involving disease patients make them absolute, flawless cherubs whose sole purpose is to inspire those around them before they die. But while this story is mostly about Landon, Jamie has his own fleshed out story with a remarkable character arc and his own real struggles to overcome. At the beginning of the film, Jamie is quite antisocial, trying so hard to repel people by wearing old-fashioned clothes and being an overbearing conversationalist. Landon makes her realize that her illness has made her afraid to prioritize relationships or trust anyone other than her father. It is overcoming these fears that creates her own character arc for Jamie and a beginning, middle and end to her own story. It makes her feel like a real person with her own problems to overcome, rather than a character whose illness drives the story.Dramatically, it's easy to criticize this development and what follows; yet, despite the glaring difficulties, the theme of one individual's sufferings having a redemptive effect on another still retains some power. (It is particularly interesting to see this idea, more characteristic of Catholic than Protestant spirituality, in this Bible-belt conversion story.) At times, too, the story seems to vacillate uncomfortably between the original 1950s setting in the book and the ostensibly modern setting in the film. Still, overall, the positives outweigh the negatives. ""A Walk to Remember"" is not a great movie, but it's worth it, especially for its target audience. The themes it deals with certainly deserve more careful and nuanced treatment, but the fact that they were treated in a major studio release is noteworthy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazingly beautiful movie.,"A walk to remember is simply amazing movie.Artistically it is not a brilliant movie.It is not a movie with performances that are going to constitute landmarks in the history of acting or something that has high- end special effects.It is a simple movie that has brilliant performance by Shane West & Mandy Moore.Mandy Moore is specially too good in the movie.It is one of her best till date.The film brings too much sadness but I don't think people would have disliked it.Despite the sadness,AWTR inevitably brings innocence, sweetness, optimism and faith in life and love and the ability of every single person for change.The movie is an adaption of a book that brings out the message quite clearly, beautifully, and optimistically.I have never read the book but I have watched this movie repeatedly umpteen times and will continue to watch it.And I'm sure I'll never get bored of this beautiful move.People who have not watched this movie are seriously missing on something truly amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good performances in an average movie,"Movies like this live or die on the performances of the leads. If you believe them, you can overlook the typical responses people have to teen romance stories, ie. They're trite, clichéd, rely to much on coincidence to keep the characters together, and blah blah blah.It's almost a problem when you love the characters but don't love the movie, as I did here. You particularly have to love Mandy Moore's understated performance, though I was distracted by the stupid scene where she finally reveals to everyone how beautiful she actually is - as if they wouldn't have been able to tell - and has a professional-quality singing voice. That scene is so forced and out of place that it almost derails the movie, but luckily we get the old Jamie (Mandy Moore's character) back after that silliness.The twist in the relationship - which probably everyone watching the movie for the first time today already knows - is also revealed perhaps too late, with a conclusion that is rushed, but I still enjoyed the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good Movie,"A Walk To Remember was on my hard drive for a month now, but I never got the urge to watch it. But then the other day my friend recommended me to watch it and that took me by surprise since I never thought he, of all people, would recommend me a romantic movie. So I thought it must be a really good movie if he recommended it to me.And it was.By the time I watched half of the movie, I knew that this is that type of a movie which divides opinions like few others. By the time I finished the movie and saw my earlier Facebook status regarding it, the comments proved me right - as there was no ""in the middle"" view on the move, it was either very good to some or very bad to the others.I fall in the category who think this is a very good movie. This movie depicts the strength of love - that it could turn even the biggest of jerks to genuinely caring people. The acting of both the lead characters was incredible; especially Shane West's evolution from a popular-bully jerk to soft-heart and caring guy.The movie could have been better in some aspects though; like it was too swift at some points, thought it should have panned out a bit more slow by adding some romantic scene before the heart-breaking revelation by Mandy Moore-played Jamie. I may be cruel, but I also think adding a final scene with Jamie and Landon would have given more emotional pain to the viewers, but may be the director didn't want that and hence avoided showing a scene like that (wanted to be more elaborate, but that would include spoilers and I can't do that).Overall, a good movie which I would rate 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Horrible portrayal of a Wonderful book,"Let me start off by saying that Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author. I have and have read all of his books, including his most recent, A bend in the Road. I have read A Walk to Remember, twice. I cried every time I read it and LOVED IT. However, I can not say the same about the movie. If you read the book, you understand that characteristics of the characters, what they say, do, wear, the location, time period and feelings toward other characters DEFINE the book. In the movie, it's like they took the characters and the main ""part"" of the book and used it, but forgot about everything else. It was a horrible portrayal of the book. The book was wonderful, I loved it. But the movie was just lacking. I am not saying it was horrible in the acting criterion; it was horrible in terms of following the outline of the book it was based on. If you do want to see the movie, please pick up A copy of the book before you see the movie. It does makes all the difference.

A bit saccharine but better than some sugar.,"I think I can fairly say that as an agnostic man rapidly approaching his mid-thirties, I'm not exactly the target audience for `A Walk to Remember'. That alone is its own disclaimer: I need not even add that I'm cynical, jaded, and universally unmoved by the machinations that filmmakers (and novelists) use to tug at our emotions. Most films in this genre send my eyes straight to the back of my skull immediately to rest there for the next two hours. It's not even the type of film I would normally find myself attending were it not a bout of  whimsical nostalgia. I think my even being in the theater may take a bit of mercifully short explanation:When I saw the trailer, I was struck how much young Miss Moore reminded me of a girl I loved the summer before my senior year. That was lure and when I sat in the theater and saw this story mirrored my own - good, moral girl takes a chance on the wild guy - it made me think about things I'd not considered for years. Unlike Landon, I was not wise enough to appreciate the gift I was given and she gave up on me, to my immediate regret. Two thousand miles and seventeen years later in a Los Angeles theater I was surprised to find that I still regretted it. On the drive home I even found myself taking stock of my life and the way I live it. The movie made me think and it made me feel. No one could have been more surprised than me.Still, I can see the faults with `A Walk to Remember'. Though Shane West manages to convey some solid emotion as Landon and Mandy Moore's Jamie radiates despite both inexperience and a frumpy wardrobe, these characters are one-dimensional and seem slaves to the sheer unoriginality of the story. Typical is a scene where Landon's ex-girlfriend cruelly passes out flyers with sweet Jamie's head pasted on a Club magazine covergirl's body. Sadly, it is overdone with all the attendant movie clichés: Close-ups of school kids laughing like hyenas, close-ups of Jamie's sweaty mortification, a heartbeat soundtrack, all of the above moving at half-speed. A better (and ultimately more difficult) scene would have shown us a Jamie capable of standing up for herself in the moment, perhaps breaking down only when it had passed and she was alone with Landon, enabling him to return and still throw the punch that estranges himself from his friends. A viewer that lacks a personal connection and therefore the ability to fill these missteps with the emotional shorthand needed, could certainly point to this scene and others as a reason to dismiss the entire film. However, with the possible exception of professional movie critics and some members of the reptile family, I think most of us enjoy a level of intercourse with our poor battered hearts. Hopefully enough to allow ourselves the occasional emotional manipulation even when it is as nakedly applied as in this film.As teen love stories go, `A Walk to Remember' may deserve some points for trying to transcend the genre even if it doesn't quite make the climb. Certainly, it might be more beneficial to our culture if we were given more young female characters like Jamie. If girls like her were given some equal time among the teeny-bopper bimbettes that permeate entertainment, it might just open some young men to the reality of what they should be finding attractive and start looking not only with their eyes, but with their hearts and minds. At the very least, it may spare some of them a surprising and unnerving feeling of deep regret, years later, when they least expect it.If you have a serious sweet tooth, the film is a 10. For those who have loved and lost at a young enough age where you can still manage a pang when you think about it, it's a solid 7. If you can't give it at least a four, get on a transplant list - your heart is about to go.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A little bland but shamelessly is what it is.,"Shane West is the principle reason why I ended up liking this film. He plays the redeemed bad boy turned caring partner so well. Landon-like a lot Spark's characters-is a walking archetype but West makes him feel just real enough to be engaging. The same is true for Moore, abet not as much. The leads are appealing enough that if you take the film as it is meant to be taken it is a successful tearjerker.The film-thanks in part to the direction-is shamelessly and fully committed to being an earnest tearjerker; it is not worse than bunch of other sick kids in loves stories and it has the decency to not dwell on the illness. The script-the dialogue at least-is a lot crisper than a lot of other Sparks films. I might watch this again.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Timeless,"A Movie to Remember.

A Crock To Forget,"LOVE STORY for the Tiger Beat crowd.  Okay, that's harsh, but A WALK TO REMEMBER is exactly what it is - a painfully earnest soap opera aimed directly between the eyes of fourteen year old girls, an excuse for them to get all weepy and cling to each other as the lights come up at the end.Bad boy Shane West is ordered to pull some community time tutoring and acting in a high school musical (uh, okaaay.).  `You can't make me act!' he vows to the judge, and then spends the rest of the movie proving it. Along the way he is given a chance to pull off wallflower Mandy Moore's eyeglasses to reveal how beautiful she'd really be if only she'd accessorize properly. `Don't fall in love with me' she demands.  Uh, oh.hanky alert.The perfect date movie for nice, upstanding Christian folk, anathema to anyone with a cynical bone in their body (and admittedly, my whole skeleton works that way).Utterly shameless and completely predictable -- essentially, NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE without the laffs.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Pure innocent love, one of the best romantic movies","""A Walk to Remember"" is a heartfelt and tender coming-of-age film that resonates with the power of love and the impact of personal transformation.

The music, including the iconic song ""Only Hope,"" adds a poignant layer to the story's emotional depth. Its strength lies in its sincere exploration of love, faith, and the significance of living life to the fullest. While it may have moments that tug at the heartstrings, the cinematography frames the coastal setting with a nostalgic beauty.

"Predictable, wooden and uninspiring","This movie reeked of a large-scale Mandy Moore advertising campaign. (With several songs by Moore.) Moore's acting has little range and her character (Jamie Sullivan) didn't seem like a real person with real emotions. Rather, her portrayal of Jamie is wooden and Moore almost seemed to be reading predictable, stilted dialogue from a cue card.Shane West plays troubled youth, Landon Carter, part of the high school's popular, yet rebellious crowd. He's a typical misunderstood, tough guy with a heart of gold. Unfortunately, West's portrayal isn't believable. He comes off as more of a metrosexual, tough guy wanna-be. (The name Landon itself seems more fit for ""The OC"".)The love story between the Jamie and Landon is clearly forced. Whether it is due to bad writing or bad acting, we never really care about the characters. Also, ""A Walk to Remember"" offers countless cringe-inducing lines. This is a typical case of the dialogue working better on the page than on the screen as spoken by an actor.Everything in this movie is cliché. (From the slang to the overly-used ""high fives"".) The ""touching"" moments lack poignancy. And the moments that could really illicit emotion were mishandled or missing from the film. The films finale is anticlimactic and the resolution is unsatisfactory.Aside from that, it's hard to tell what audience the writer is trying to target. On its surface, the film seems to be aimed at high schoolers with its liberal use of mild profanity. However, the story plays off as more of a Nickelodean production meant for 13-year-olds.One perplexing point to note: the film never makes it clear what the ""Walk to Remember"" is. There are several possibilities, but we never really see any particularly memorable ""walk"". Overall, ""A Walk to Remember"" is forgettable and uninspiring. This film rates as one of the worst I've ever seen.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
THE MOST ROMANTIC TEEN MOVIE IN AGES,"So many movies about teens show the immature side of kids. But A Walk to Remember is about real people, with real problems and joys and sorrows, and love - the characters just happen to been teens. Mandy Moore was most impressive in taking over a roll and not coming off like a popstar making a movie. Though new at acting, Mandy was just incredible in the role of Jamie - convincing on every level. There are many more experienced actors and actresses that could take a lesson from Mandy on how to get into the persona of a character, as opposed to just playing themselves over and over in every movie. And the music - the AWTR CD is the best movie soundtrack I've ever heard. All the songs on it blend together so well, and the song ""Only Hope"" is one of the most beautiful love songs I've ever heard. I expect we'll be seeing more of Mandy Moore the actress.

Good team work produced a great movie,"As a 40 year old man, I have seen this movie 23 times -- in a week. I did not know who Mandy Moore was when I got the dvd. It touched me so deeply that in one day I watched it for 7 times. The performance of Mandy is a real surprise on me. The makeup and dress did make a beautiful Mandy to be an ordinary, plain looking girl who has a faith in God and confidence in herself. She was so believable and so real. I loved the movie not only by the two actor and actress but also the whole team. The screen writer did a good job to transform a novel -- verbal communication to be a movie which is a non verbal communication in a such of rewrite instead of substracting. Good job. Mandy's singing was great. I can not imagine if another young pop singer can do the same as Mandy did in this film. I can not say Mandy is perfect in the film neither Shane. But the chemistry between these two as professionals was great in this movie. I could not say enough about it. Now I became a big fan of Mandy.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

simply amazing...worth watching...........,"I watched this movie by chance....i'm glad i watched. I never thought i'll watch or love any Hollywood romantic movies. My likes were confined to mostly action,sci-fi,mystery movies. But after watching AWTR i was shocked to find that i was missing a big part of movies....or rather a big part of life. This is a simple story of first love which is pure and innocent...how love can transform a person to a more better person. Landon is a high school guy who has got no aim in his life,takes fun in tormenting others,etc. By some turns in life,he gets to meet Jamie who is just the opposite of him,who help others & a strong belief in miracles. He didn't know when he fell in love with a girl like jamie. But the story not ends here...Jamie has a secret. Now comes the emotional part...which also made me cry,which even surprised me the first time... Mandy moore was fabulous in the role of jamie. I don't think that anybody could do her part better than her. I simply love her. She made me love the character Jamie. Shane west also played his part well. He is a lucky guy to get such a great part to play in the movie. I have watched the movie over and over again. I like it more and more each time i watch. After AWTR i searched for more romantic movies but couldn't find a movie like this. I will give this movie 10 out of 10. It is one of my favourite movie.

A GREAT LITTLE FILM WITH HEART AND WITHOUT LOW BLOWS,"Landon is a wildly popular and rebellious boy at school. One day he meets Jamie, a shy and beautiful daughter of an evangelical pastor. Both are literally opposites but when they both have to perform a student play together they become a great friendship. Little by little Landon discovers Jamie's innocent and good world and falls in love, but her father opposes his daughter dating a bad boy. He does the impossible to show that he has matured and that thanks to her he has completely changed his rebellious character. But one day Jamie confesses his terrible secret, and that is that he suffers from terminal leukemia. Destroyed, Landon fulfills one by one all the dreams that Jamie had in his heart as they share the last moments of their lives. A Walk To Remember is a beautiful, humane film, full of noble feelings and despite being a romantic drama it is also a hymn to life. The most important thing is that the director does not appeal to any kind of low blow or cheesy dialogues or scenes to impact the hearts of the public. Mandy Moore is perfect playing the sweet Jamie making a charming character that crosses the screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Heartfelt - One of my all time favourites,"The first time I watched this movie I rented it from the local video store many years ago. I remember it leaving me with a deep connection to the movie and the characters (especially Jamie and Landon). Mandy Moore and Shane West did such a wonderful job of this and they should be very proud. I had the opportunity to re-watch it recently and it brought back the same wonderful feelings I had when I first watched it (hence my first IMDb movie review). I look forward to watching it again and again. I have put the movie soundtrack on my portable media player and each song brings on a different emotion related to the movie.

To see him transform himself from bad boy to someone that does everything within his power for the woman he loves is just heart rending. Look out for him as he's going to be HUGE!!!!!This has to be the greatest love story since the original ""Love Story"".

It makes me want to always embrace ""Love is like the wind.

Bad Movie-making,"This is an example of bad movie making.  The director didn't bring out the best in the lead characters.  It was just plain flat.  No interest and predictable.  There was no continuity in the editing. And why the frequent cross-fade?  I can understand the lapse in time when called for, but this was too much.  Most of the transitions should have been a straight-cut.  As for the cinematographer, I can't believe with all the credits on his list you can see the change in quality of lighting from a long-shot vs. the close-ups.  Lastly, the book was a best-seller but this dialogues script is absolutely bad especially in this day and age.  There were so many unnecessary scenes which don't drive a point or haven't been developed much further.  I'm guessing there were a lot of deleted scenes which we will see in the DVD version. I respect Ms. Moore for trying out different roles, though.  And the supporting casts were great.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"WoW, I love this movie!!!!","I only watched this film about 2 weeks ago, I saw the trailers for it when it first came out but my boyfriend wouldn't go and watch it with me. I finally decided to buy it for myself and I can't believe how much I've fallen for this film. I've watched it at least a hundred times, I can't get bored of it I absolutely love it. I thought it was going to be another cheesy 'She's All That' type films, I thought Mandy Moore was going to play some nerd that gets a makeover and becomes the best looking girl in school. So, to my surprise when I watched the film for myself and discovered this was totally not the plot I could not believe it. I cried all the way from half way till the end of the film, when she told Landon she was dying oh my god I couldn't even focus on the screen for all the tears. I never liked Mandy Moore before but from this film I'm her number 1 fan I thought she was great in this, she played her role brilliantly. And as for Shane West, well I think I might be in love with him, he was brilliant. I recommend anyone to buy the soundtrack it's pricey but just as good as the movie. P.S.

Yeah its cheesy in parts and the love between Jamie and Landon is just a bit too perfect. But so what? It's a movie and no one ever said that anything like this could ever happen in real life. What i liked about this film was that it was different to most films like it.Personally, I thought this movie was a real tearjerker but I understand that everyone has different opinions. I mean i'm only thirteen so maybe that's one of the reasons why i enjoyed it so much.The soundtracks pretty great as well.

In meantime he meets the reverends daughter, and old fashioned girl who's out of the style of most people. By meeting her he experiments an awesome change. The movie greatly inspires anyone and its main romantic line can make cry even the strongest man. The movie always surprises you and there's no way you can guess was next.

Another FAILED Nicholas Sparks Movie!,"For those of you who don't know, Nicholas Sparks wrote the book version of this movie.  I read the book with my girlfriend a couple of years ago, and we loved it.  Nicholas Sparks as an author is one of my favorite authors of today, but when he agrees to let his books be turned into movies, the movies generally suck.  Case-in-point:  Message in a Bottle (with Kevin Costner and Robin Wright-Penn).Mandy Moore and Shane West are no better at acting than Britney Spears is at writing her own music (or acting for that matter).  Compared to the personalities and emotions conveyed in the book, I'd say that these two teenage meatheads never even come close to getting their characters spot-on.If you have an opportunity to see this movie, don't go see it.  I saw it by accident on a movie channel and once the movie ended, I called up my TV station and demanded a month of free cable in order to make up for the time I lost to watch this movie.If you want a real drama, read the book by Nicholas Sparks.  Movies like A Walk to Remember and Message in a Bottle do nothing but harm the reputation of Sparks as a writer, because each movie based on his books is done horribly.Score:  1 out of 10 (IMDB should allow for negative scores because this would get a -50,000).",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

And after seeing it, my opinion was completely changed, changed to one that was a mix between wonder, awe, amazement, excitement, sadness and sorrow. I found myself wishing that that kind of love would happen to me as well, wishing I could really be like one of them.Shane West's and Mandy Moore's performance was unmistakably perfect. They were just made for the roles, and everything seemed so natural to them that it was breathtaking.I thought, like many have, - after seeing the first 30 minutes or so - that the plot would be very predictable - popular boy, looked-down-upon girl get to spend time with each other and fall in love with each-other, and they live happily ever after. For a while it seemed like that, and maybe that it is a bit, but after Jamie's 'announcement' of her problem, everything had a turnaround... and it turned to be like a fight under pressure, until the last 'tic' of the clock.Definitely a 10 from me, and I recommend it to anybody.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Its by no means the best movie ever made or anything but it is indeed very watchable and has a unique quality which is that it made me really like it even while knowing that it is not necessarily the greatest film ever, which is why i gave it a rating of 8. For me not a lot of films have that qualityWell sure there are a lot of Korney anticipated love gestures throughout but hey its a romantic drama for teens there is bound to be a few here and there. In saying that i never expected the dramatic secret which Mandy Moore's character is holding to be anywhere near as tear jerkingIn my opinion both main actors (West and Moore) played the roles perfectly and were a great choice as Moore's beauty is such an innocent one she is really breath taking in parts and West is a really convincing lead man and really makes the audience that he is sincereGreat movie for girls and if your a guy with a sensitive streak like me its also a good movie",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a pleasant surprise,"I started watching this movie late one night, expecting it to be another silly teen movie, but after the first half hour I was hooked. Unfortunately, my wife wasn't watching with me, so I was pleased to see that it was airing again the next day. I taped it, and today, we sat down to Sunday breakfast with A Walk To Remember.And what a perfect movie for such an occasion - a story about love and decency in which somebody, everyone actually, decided to sweat the details. It was better than good, it was riveting. It was the way life should be - the way people should be, instead of the way they are in real life. For 101 minutes, you feel like you're in a better world.Well, make that ninety minutes, anyway...There's a line in the movie Arthur after a prostitute tells Dudley Moore that her mother died when she was six and her father raped her when she was twelve.

Pure Magic,"As previously mentioned it does help if you are a bit of a romantic going into this film, however I challenge anyone not to be moved by both the story and the characters involved. Mandy Moore I am ashamed to say I had no prior knowledge of.... that said you could not help but be drawn into falling in love with the character she portrayed. Also as previously mentioned her performance of a song within the story was spellbinding, I can not possibly put into words the innocence, feelings, and range of emotions she expressed so convincingly in the performance of that song although by this point you already have a feel for her character. As I suspected this was a singer acting and not the other way round. I can not think off the top of my head of any other singer/actor giving a performance of this calibre, Mandy Moore in this movie has an innocence, beauty and charisma of a woman we would all fall in love with. I am officially a Mandy Moore fan and will look out for any other movies she does.

This film really made me question myself and many aspects of my life and spirituality. ,  Miss Moore is so perfect for this part.",,Anonymous,Romance
So pure... So perfect... So romantic...,"This movie is an excellent blend of Landon Carter's (Shane West) love for Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) and his issues with his father, Dr.Carter. It is impossible for not to fall in love with Mandy Moore. She gives an excellent performance in this movie. Slow movie, but very romantic. The background score is awesome. Merwyn Warren had wonderfully brought out the emotions through his music. The author Nicholas Sparks has given a wonderful journey to love. I fell in love instantly with the movie when Mandy Moore said this line, ""Do not fall in Love with me"".It was so moving that I cried at some parts. I felt the pain of Jamie and Landon in this movie. I felt the happiness. I felt the love. I felt the miracle.Watch this movie and you'll know what I mean. You'll love it. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
amazing film,"Call me late or whatever but i only just watched this movie, and oh my gosh. This film is one of the most saddest and heart-breaking films i have ever watched, it doesn't try to make you feel sad, it doesn't try to make you cry, but this film has the power of doing so without trying. You can imagine the usual trouble-maker 'i think i am so cool' kind of guy you see in other movies, and then you have the sweet, innocent girl. this film is the story between them, but She has a secret. the story is beautiful, as is the acting my Mandy Moore, Shane West and everyone else in the movie.

"OMG, OMG, OMG! (not a spoiler, i swear)","So there i was, my dad watching a football game and i was in the other room watching TNT.

A picture to remember...,"The first time I saw ""A Walk to Remember"" I was blown away, but this second viewing helped me analyze each element of the film separately. I'm not talking about a deep analysis, but about an analysis this movie deserves, because it appears as a romantic teen drama, but it is truly a great film; and it deserves a great film's analysis.The story of ""A walk to remember"" is about a popular high school boy (Landon) who hangs out with a popular group and a self-exiled high school girl (Jamie) who hangs out with the telescope and stars, the bible (her father is a reverend played by Peter Coyote) and religion and the retarded students she tutors for fun. They are portrayed by Shane West and Mandy Moore, and the plot line says they are ""thrown together"" so make a guess. Sounds familiar? Well, it's not: it's different; just about every other thing in the movie.When Landon screws up and gets to be in the high school play, he ends up asking Jamie help with the lines. ""Alright"", she says. ""But with one condition: promise me you won't fall in love with me"". ""That won't be a problem"", Landon replies. What happens after Jamie's warning is nothing else than a story of true love courtesy of Nicholas Sparks; author of the book the movie is based on and author of another true love story: ""The Notebook"".It was the job of Karen Janzsen to turn that love into a screenplay, and she did her work very well, considering the little number of screenplays she had written before. It is Janzsen's screenplay (with the main help of Sparks' novel) what makes this movie so different; because the reactions of the characters in the crucial moments, which should be predictable, are not. The simple words we are expecting them to say are changed by other words as simple that become surprising.This fact is supported by the labor of the castA labor of wondrousness. Shane West, a now grown up actor I admire very much and who has divided his career between the series ""Once and Again"", the bad guy in ""Get Over It"" and a better act than Sean Connery in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen""; achieves here what's still the best performance of his life. His sarcastic commentaries, his anger and his happiness are flawless.Mandy Moore's performance is just remarkable, and mostly inspiring considering her situation (her first and in my opinion her best lead role of her career). She transmits sweetness and tenderness in her voice that when she sings it doesn't even seem out of place. Al Thompson's and Clayne Crawford's parts as Landon's best friend are very solid and more credible than most of their ""characters"" in other films.But what I hadn't appreciated was Peter Coyote's portrayal. His character seemed so typical and obvious the first time I saw the film that I didn't pay attention to him. This time, I carefully watched his manners. His lines are so carefully spoken, so well appreciated; and his looksHis looks are so honest that you care about his worries.Adam Shankman, a choreographer and probably not the best option for directing the film; astounds with his measured view of the strong events the story tells and leaves behind the regular ""The Wedding Planner"". In one scene, during the high school play, his camera slowly observes each of the main characters in the audience to contrast what's happening onstageDaryl Hannah is there, and even David Lee Smith's short appearance becomes noticeable.Their expressions say a lot for a romantic teen drama; but much less for a great film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Yuck,"My girlfriend loved this movie. One of her friends cried (a good cry). From about halfway in, i was itching in my seat for it to end...perhaps this is the epitome of feel good CHICK FLICKS (and the rest of the world cringes. - If you're a guy and you liked this movie i'd love to read your review!). Predictability isn't a bad thing, that wasn't what wrecked this movie. This movie was wrecked during scripting.  I haven't read the book and quite simply, I won't.  If you want to believe in a farcial type of love and romance, well give this movie a go, it'll stimulate you in the farcial way you may desire.There is nothing new about this movie, and the characters are all stereotypical.  Don't see this movie if you want to be intellectually stimulated, don't see this movie if you want to see anything decent about film what-so-ever.  There are but two reasons you should see this film and they are that you are a girl who enjoys soft and lovely yet vomitingly unrealistic soppy teen films, or you are looking to completely bag a film that should've been made a comedy, but for some reason the director portrayed it seriously (also check out ""Turbulence"" if you fit into this category- my friends and i have special memories of that the worst movie we'd ever seen at the cinema).",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great movie,"I recently saw rented this movie. I was iffy about seeing it because it had a singer turned actress(Mandy Moore) and in my experience has never been a good thing. I loved the movie though. The acting was incredible and seemed very difficult due to the situations. The music was choreographed into the movie making it timeless, ( meaning they didn't use music from one specific era but were eclectic). I really enjoyed how they tied everything together and how they put parts in that unless you paid really close attention to, you probably wouldn't notice. I give it two thumbs up and recommend it to anyone who loves romance.",,Anonymous,Romance

The acting is very good by Shane West and Mandy Moore, Mandy Moore who also sang the songs in the movie. This film will really touch you, I can guarantee that! A Walk To Remember is an excellent film by Adam Shankman. Everyone should check this movie out! It's amazing!

This Is My Favorite Movie Of All Time!,"I'm a hopeless romantic, so the storyline naturally attracted me to it. The character Jamie (Mandy Moore) resembles the sort of girl that any gentleman would seek to spend their lives with.Mandy Moore plays a powerful character that affects the lives of anyone she comes in contact with. She affected Landon (Shane West) in a very strong way, despite his initial stance towards her.There are some cool things Landon does in this movie that I would do for my girlfriend. He becomes a likable character, although he did not start off that way.The ending, though sad, had a positive element. That's all I can say without ruining it but it was encouraging to realize how one life could affect so many others. This one comes highly recommended. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

There's no more story to tell."" But then, something happens and all changes. It may sound very usual for romances, but this change is very surprising, at least for me. Speaking of romances, you know that they aren't always shiny and happy, and this one isn't happy at all, but it's real. You never think about it, but, sometimes, in real life there isn't a happy final. Also, the couple is really sweet and they both look so good. They are really good actors and they're amazing playing their roles. To finish, I have to say: if you see the movie and like it, you'll cry like a baby watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

This has been my favorite film since I first saw it & I know it always will be. I read the book, and while it was good, I would rather watch this movie. Shane West did an amazing transformation with the character of Landon Carter. I could not see how some people hated this movie. Not only is it an amazing love story, but it shows how one person can truly help change someone for the better. It's just a shame that such a wonderful love story had to end so sadly This is the best story of love, faith & hope out there. I would highly recommend it to anyone.

Best movie for me,"I can't remember how I felt the first time I saw it on DVD in 2002. I was totally surprised and blew away after the second time I watched it. I couldn't believe such a simple love story could touch my heart so deep down inside! The movie was not released in China and I've never thought it would, so I went to HK Records to buy the movie and soundtrack in early 2003. I just want to keep it for years to come. In the years afterwords, I watch it every chance I can and never get bored. I always watch it alone and try to find something new from the movie, and I did. I frequently go to IMDb message board to see comments from people all over the world and figure out how people see it from different angles. Despite some negative comments, I don't mind I am the only person in the world who love this movie, I am glad that so many people like it and I'm not alone.

excellent film,"A Walk to Remember is without a doubt one of the best romantic dramas of all time. I will admit, that although sometimes the lines can be perceived as a little 'dry', it adds to the character of the film. Mandy Moore and the gorgeous Shane West really highlight that teen romances do happen, and despite differences, do flourish, which enables the film to provide an inspiration and hope for all. Although initially the film appears to be aimed at a 'teen audience', the film provides something for everybody and can be enjoyed by all. I would definitely recommend this film. Some might say that films such as 'crossroads' (Britney Spears), is a far better film. However, although 'crossroads' is a pretty good film in itself, for me, AWTR, leaves it standing, as it is one of the only films that can make you smile and cry at the same time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

On the other hand, I am a super fans of Mandy Moore, I like the beauty of her in the movie very much!!! Mandy Moore is a born singer. I am crazy about the song ""Only Hope"". ""There's a song that's inside of my soul.It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again."" That's one of the shining parts of the drama and also the movie.

A Walk to Remember this Autumn in New York Here on Earth in Sweet November,"OK, that title I used can sum up the script if you wanna see those movies, I feel bad saying that, but honestly, it feels as if they have used the same script over and over again just with different characters. In some ways I was looking forward to seeing A Walk To Remember because it had a decent rating and actually looked like a cute movie. Unfortunately, I got fluff, fluffy fluff, in fact this movie is what I would name as the ultimate fluffinator. This was Here on Earth all over again, which I do despise that movie as well, but however, I thought I was in for a treat with some of these movie comments here on IMDb. Seriously, I don't understand what is the appeal of these movies, they only attract the googly eyed teenage girls who think that this kind of love exists, don't mean to sound bitter, just this story was incredibly predictable and unrealistic.Landon Carter is the handsome popular jock at his school, one night after getting a boy injured, he has to do community service. He then meets the good girl conservative Christan, everyone teases her, but she doesn't care what other people think. They are together in theater, they have nothing in common, but Jamie feels as if she sees something in him. She does her best to get him to loosen up, but he just refuses back, until he sees that she's hot one night, then he gets interested and falls in love with her only to find out that, gasp, she's dying.Seriously, this is one of the biggest ""huh's"" when it comes to IMDb ratings, this movie is just a fairy tale when you think about it. It's a cheesy love story that really doesn't have any likable characters, I know that there isn't anything to dislike about Jamie's character, but there's nothing to like in my opinion. If you wanna see this movie, I am going to warn you that if you've seen Here on Earth, Sweet November or Autumn in New York, you've seen this movie, but it's just the more innocent goodie two shoes version.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

No. I didn't even know what it was about until I watched it. I just put on a random movie to go to sleep and this was that movie. But I didn't end up going to sleep I ended up crying my eyes out instead. So there for I recommend this movie 100% if you would like to cry. But I do not recommend it if you're trying to go to sleep and don't want to cry for the rest of the night wondering what would have happened.

Sweetest Book and Movie,"When I first saw this movie several years ago I didn't enjoy it. I had just finished reading the book several days before and some of the storyline was changed. For one, the book is set back in the 60's? (If I am recalling correctly) When I watched this movie again it became an instant favorite. I thought the quality of the filming was not as good as it could have been and it seemed like it was made on a cheap budget. Besides those factors, this movie is a tear dripper and one that makes you want to jump into the screen and hug the characters when they are having hard times. It's unlike other teenage movies and if you are a Nicholas Sparks fan, you know all of his books are unlike any other. This film makes you want to do everything on your ""to do"" list and to tell everyone you care for that you love them. It proves that you can be the same person as you have always been before, maybe even stronger, when you are faced with a terminal illness.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The bravest plot in a long long long time,"I remember seeing this movie in the theaters several times. As I get older the exact number I am not sure of. At least 3, maybe more. I love the chemistry between the primary actor Shane West and actress Mandy Amanda Moore. You can feel the angst and yearning of two young people growing up. While Jaime Sullivan knows the leukemia will not permit a normal life, that is not an excuse for her to be someone less than who she is. Her pleasant maturity and grace is so refreshing and sincere that I can never forget it. That the plot was based on a great short novel that was based on a real life character simply blows me away, Danielle Sparks just wanted to be able to grow up and get married. In the atmosphere of American culture today you would find that nearly ludicrous for anyone to admit, yet Jaime has no problems admitting this to Landon because ""she sees something good"". There is the power of developing/valuing another soul in the movie, of faith in God that is genuine and vibrant. I see myself growing up and finding a young man who actually loved me for who I was. And I bought the DVD and watched every single permutation of the film until it made my family ill. I pray for Mandy Every single day. Because anyone who can act and sing like that needs to be in the arts, I sincerely hope that she stays in films and acts on Broadway. I think this film renewed my faith in humanity.Irma",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Walk through the Spiritual Woods sans Bill Bryson,"Is love an instantaneous combustion? Can two nobodies, living at opposite ends of the social Earth, suddenly fall in love, change their lives, and live a happy co-existence together (well, not forever in this movie  but you get my drift)? This is the question that I tackled while watching another cookie be cut from the Hollywood bakery  this time it was called ""A Walk to Remember"". An adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel by the same name, it focuses on the fairy tale blossom of love between quintessential bad boy Landon Carter (played dramatically by Shane West) and bible-thumping, dust in the wind, cliché bookworm Jamie Sullivan (played by first timer Mandy Moore). As always, we begin with Landon's hijinks, followed by consequences which bring Jamie and him together. Sparks fly? Hardly, but they continue to encounter each other, each imposing their lives into one another, and finally  through Hollywood magic fall in love. What happens in the following acts is classic Sparks as tears begin to play a pivotal element in the closing moments. As I mentioned in my review for ""The Notebook"", one cannot help but wonder if the Kleenex corporation doesn't keep Mr. Sparks, or these films, on retainer.I do not mean to be so harsh with my opening, but one needs to realize that this film, to me, felt stale. I, as well as anyone that has ever watched a full length film, have seen all of these elements before. With ""A Walk to Remember"", I was not impressed or surprised. Perhaps a bit jaded knowing what would happen before it did due largely in part to whispers by huge fans of this film, but I walked away from this as I had with other Shankman films. There could have been potential, but instead it suffered from Hollywood similarities, which ultimately left me with quite a bit of Hollywood boredom. Gasp! Did he say that? Yep, I was bored with this film. The lack of humor, the randomness of chance, and the simplicity of the plot left me wanting, desiring, desperately waiting for something imaginative, creative, or unique to happen. Alas, nothing  I repeat  nothing of the sort occurred. From the cliché play, to the reuniting of family, to the forced tear-jerker of an ending, ""A Walk to Remember"" proved yet again that one could make film cookies out of the same, overused batch of cookie dough time and time again while consumers will still stumble across the counter to grab. Why is this? Was it the hunky-ness of Shane West, who did provide with at least a glimmer of acting ability (though his tear scenes were hysterical at best)? Was it that we were hoping for something from Mandy Moore, who only proved that speaking in a small voice and wearing pasty make-up will make audiences cry? Personally, I believe the hype surrounding this film arrives from the name Spark, Nicholas Sparks. It was his name that carried this film, and I cannot say that the new translation fit his story well enough to matter.As I watched this film, it was the secondary characters that really attracted my attention. Daryl Hannah must have just signed for this ""gig"" mainly for the paycheck, as she looked especially man-ish in her role. I was a bit startled when I saw her at first, then transformed into confusion as I tried to figure out what sort of mother-role she was attempting. The same can be said for Jamie's father, whom in my eyes, carried this film. I wanted more dynamic between her and him, their differences and their personal loss  as only you could find in Sparks' story. He fit the mold of what this film represented. He was a father  one that nearly anyone could relate to. There was Landon's friends, which played out like a horrid 80s film completely filled with sucker punches, unfunny jokes, and that snobbish ""popular"" behavior that seems to drench any teen film head to toe. How did Al Thompson get all the jokes for the film ... could anyone else be any funnier? While I appreciated the levity he brought, there wasn't much to the film to make one feel sad. I say this not because of what happened in the final act, but because there wasn't enough emotion brought to the characters for me to be compelled enough to let my tear ducts express themselves.Overall, I cannot suggest this film to anyone except small teens that are not allowed to go to PG-13 films yet. Throughout the commentary (which, subsequently, only addresses the childish nature of the film), Shankman et crew discuss how this was about to be a PG-13 film, but had to be cut  language and nudity  to appeal to a larger audience as well ensure that the religious sect would not abolish this film. Again, I would like to point out that the makers of this piece of cinema do not consider this a ""religious"" film, but instead, a film about faith. I didn't see that. Faith was important to Jamie, but as the film closed, that wasn't the topic of thought. Instead, the question of combustible relationships came to mind. I will have to ask you to pass on this film, unless you are in middle school and have never seen a movie before in your life.Don't let your faith flame get too close to this combustible relationship -- ""A Walk to Remember"" could be the result.Grade: ** out of *****",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Beautiful Story that made a great Movie.,"Shane West and Mandy Moore are wonderful in this movie and look great together. They are both very talented actors and they really made the movie feel real. The story is sweet and inspiring and I encourage every romance lover to see it. I hope to see more movies such as this one, and more of these two wonderful actors.",,Anonymous,Romance
Not what you would expect coming from a teen film,"When I first watched 'A Walk to Remember' I never thought it would be so wonderfully created. Adam Shankman directed such a fine group of cast members that made this film terrific. Shane West and Mandy Moore had enormous chemistry in their characters and produced qualities to each other that most teenage couples would not experience let alone fall in love in such a way that the love can only be shown as of adult perspectives. I found that Landon and Jamie have a unique bond that goes beyond all circumstances, without the cliché of teenage boyfriend/girlfriend lovey dovey. My perspective on this film really gave me a sense of hope and long lasting appreciation that couples like these two characters can come together with different backgrounds and who both are in different worlds can fight for their love to be together, really shows the true meaning of everlasting bond. The film has impacted me in so many levels that I would not describe the emotions I was feeling when I was watching it. It's one of my favourite films to watch that I would really watch over and over again. 'A Walk to Remember' is what any viewer should experience watching because it will give you love, laughter, sadness and most of all the intense build-up of these characters that are shown from beginning to end.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best movie I've ever seen,"I've watched this movie a billion times and every single time, I learn something new. This movie will touch your soul. Im absolutely in love with this movie and the characters.I have to say, I did not like Mandy Moore, but this movie proved me wrong. She is a very talented actress along with Shane West. She portrays the faith within Jamie and the faith that came out of Landon.MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think this movie is SO wonderful because the music ties in with all the scenes. Especially sad when Landon goes to see his dad.BTW-this is not a typical teen movie. Watching this makes you wanna just fall in love and have faith. I own the book, soundtrack and movie. It's crazy but I watch it everyday and it never fails to disappoint me. Also, I love switchfoot! Amazing music, amazing talent, amazing people, amazing quotes, amazing movie period. I totally recommend it for those who want to see a brighter side of life, love, and faith.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Heart warming story- must see,"This story is about teens but the way it is presented, it doesn't target any particular audience. I am 37 and male and I enjoyed the movie. The characters were very nicely written and interacted with each other seamlessly. This is a must see but be careful its a real tear jerker. Mandy Moore proves that she is more than a pop singer. Her looks were very much downplayed in the movie which caught my attention in letting you concentrate on the character as opposed to teen sex. Which I may add there is none of. Also there are no curse words no inappropriate scenes, nothing like that at all. A true family movie that isn't a cartoon.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
WARNING: This movie may cause diabetes,"""A Walk to Remember"" is an incredibly boring, predictable teen ""romantic drama"", that it makes me wonder why so many people were captivated by this damaged sugar-lump. Before AWTR fans call me ""cynic"", I say: I'm a romantic teenage guy, but I wasn't moved at all by this crap. Why? Because all the clichés of silly melodramas are here; Shane West is a terrible actor and Mandy Moore is bland as hell (Gwyneth Paltrow and Keira Knightley are Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore compared to her); the screenplay sounds like Mexican soap opera and Adam Shankman is NOT a filmmaker. Peter Coyote and Daryl Hannah should get better agents.If you want to see a beautiful drama with a refreshing touch of romance, go rent ""My Life Without Me"", with Sarah Polley.My vote is 2 out of 10 (not 1 because Moore's character got what she deserved by the end).",,Anonymous,Romance
great! filled with emotions,"the movie is at the beginning, i thought was just another simple movie. but as i watch on, i realize that i was filled with emotions for this movie. it is very passionate & sad yet happy. its a movie that may make me cry. but i was filled with other emotions beside sadness. but alas, i cant anymore prevent myself from crying. i love this movie & have watched it nearly ten times. this movie become one of inspiration through life. it taught me a lesson. but i cant find the words for it. i just can feel it. this is a good movie for very passionate people like me.this the movie that hit my sad spot. it is the greatest movie for me. this is just great!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I just saw this in the weekend and I was super surprised that I didn't watch it in 2002. This movie makes you laugh,cry,gasp for breath,and best of all it's not far-fetched. It inspired me.

Portrays human as spiritual being.,"Mandy Moore couldn't be more adorable than the scenes she bestow in this movie.Her character was in a such a shape that was hard for a teenage girl to maintain,highly concentrated with strong moral concept of a spiritual being.

The same old story,"Hands down, the corniest movie I have ever seen in my entire life! Mandy Moore plays the typical dork who nobody likes and Shane West plays the dynamic character in the story, the typical popular jerk...can't you already tell what is going to happen?!?!?!?!!! In some twist of fate, popular jerk ends up being forced to be tutored by the dork and surprise, surprise, he ends up falling in love with her. How unoriginal can the plot be!!! How many times have I heard that story before? The writer's must have sensed it's overwhelming predictability in the beginning so they decided they had to come up with some sort of way to give the lame story a twist. I'm not kidding, half-way through the movie, I leaned over to my friend and whispered, ""I think she's going to die..."" My friend replied, ""I was thinking the same thing."" So, low and behold, after the popular jerk had gained some depth to his character and learned the important lesson of why you should not judge a book by it's cover, Mandy takes a turn for the worse and her secret illness she was trying to hide is exposed. And...ugh, God help me...they get married...ugh!!! I wanted to barf!!",,Anonymous,Romance

Tearbreaking ---SNiff..Sniff,This movie is the most brilliant movie I've ever seen. I know you probably heard that its sad. But I'm gonna say it myself its a tear-breaker and no matter how may times you watch it you're still gonna cry. It's the best movie and I rate it 10/10. The actors/actresses were great. This movie was unpredictable and I didn't expect the ending at all. That makes it so good! Shane West and Mandy Moore's best movie yet! Watch it. Bring some tissues with you! I advice everyone to watch it young and old. Its also inspiring! Some will probably say its kind of cheesy but its not. I love it. I love it. Mwwaahhh....,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
For the Romantic in all of us.,"A Walk to Remember. A Walk to Remember is a teen movie for the ages based on a book by Nicholas Sparks. It goes beyond time and space, and it leaves the viewer in awe. This movie is more than words can define or expound. It captures the viewer where it counts, the heart. It yanks and it tugs until the viewer is left on the floor with a tub of ice-cream crying unashamedly. This movie is a masterpiece in its own right, not because of the acting, but because it is believable. It takes the plot of every new movie to a whole new level. It is a story of two North Carolina teenagers from different walks of life who are thrown together by the perils of life, and they fall in love. The love that they share is unending and undying. The love that they share is one that everyone wishes they could experience. It stars Mandy Moore as Jamie Sullivan, the preacher's daughter who is very reserved, and Shane West as Landon Carter, the popular boy with no specific plans for the future. The performance of Moore and West makes the movie much better and believable. It was developed on an $11 million budget and shot in thirty nine days, but it grossed over $12 million on its opening weekend. It was met with negative reviews by professional reviewers, Rotten Tomatoes called it ""a walk to forget"", but it received positive reviews by general viewers. The production time was short because it was filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina, at the same time that Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood and the TV show Dawson's Creek were being filmed there. This movie spends all 101 minutes of airtime making the viewer believe in its characters. It helps the viewers sympathize with them, and it sheds a light on the struggles and the plight of every teenager. The tension between the young couple and society is one that most people have experienced. The entire movie makes the viewer believe that they are the characters. They viewers feel the pain and the hurt that Jamie feels as an outsider, and the viewer surely feel the weight of the love that Landon has for her. This movie prevails because it does not participate in the lackluster sex scene that most teen movies present to the audience, rather it portrays a wholesome teenager managing the commotion that is her life, and the man who loves. Many critics failed to understand that the point of the movie was not to make Jamie a real ""ugly duckling"", but a swan that does not care to spread her wings. Jamie carries a wisdom manifested from her faith and her life experiences. But her peers cannot seem to get past her clothing choices and hairstyles to take her seriously. This movie inspired many movies that came after it, movies like; The Notebook, The Vow, and Dear John. The climax of this movie occurs when Jamie dies; this is because it leaves the viewer in complete shock. But end of this movie is the highlight because it leaves the viewer wanting more. It leaves the viewer begging for a sequel or imagining an end. I personally love this movie because it makes me want a love that the two main character share. My favorite part is when Landon takes Jamie in-between state lines, and helps her fulfill her dream of being in two places at once. That scene struck a chord with me because it showed just how much he loved her. It sends a message that true love is possible at any age and it knows no bounds.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why u should see this movie...,"I'm a sucker for sad movies and this is one of the best. If you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh, its not for you. Jamie is the school's laughing stock. On the weekends she tutors kids, works on science fair projects, and hangs around at home with her dad. She doesn't care what people think about her though, and is really into reading the Bible (her dad's a pastor). Landon is one of the most popular people in school-also one of the most common people to pick on Jamie, but when he's reported drinking on school property, he's subjected to community service and the school's upcoming play, which Jamie is pretty involved with also. Landon stinks at acting and Jamie is the drama club's pride and joy, so Landon decides that she can secretly help him. She agrees as long as he promises not to fall in love with her. Of course, this gets a laugh out of him. Well as you may imagine they fall in love anyway... Then tragedy strikes. Landon discovers a secret that Jamie's been hiding from everyone for years.If you see the movie and absolutely LOVE it, then you HAVE TO READ THE BOOK. No matter how good this movie is, the over-used stereotype that the book is always better than the movie, is true for this too! Except this time the book is FIVE times better. BUT YOU HAVE TO SEE THE MOVIE TOO!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Movie - A timeless story,"One of my favorite love stories. It is possible to find true love in the strangest places as experienced by the characters in this film. I saw this movie when it first came up and didn't expect much but I was pleasantly surprised. Movies like this often go under the radar and don't get enough credit. Though similar stories have been told in the past, I'm sure, this one seems fresh and up to date for this generation.A definite must see especially for those of you who have almost given up hope. Good for anyone - students, bible study groups, couples, friends, those looking for love, etc. Rent or buy it (I own it) soon.Great soundtrack as well. Mandy Moore sings many of the titles as well as Switchfoot and a few others. I'd also recommend ""Where the Heart Is"" featuring Natalie Portman. Another uplifting story that complements A Walk to Remember.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A surprisingly good teen movie, but not without its flaws.","Like most guys I probably wouldn't have been caught dead watching A Walk to Remember at theaters or renting it without a date (perhaps even with one). But thanks to nine channels of HBO and one long, boring night I stumbled on what turned out to be a surprisingly solid and inspiring presentation about a popular rebel teen (Shane West) who is changed by his experiences (read PG movie) with the Reverend's ""less than socially desirable"" daughter (Mandy Moore).Moore's acting is amazingly convincing, near flawless, which came as a huge shock to me because I was prepared to laugh at it from the very beginning. West's performance is also excellent, although his acting in the later half of the movie outshines the earlier, possibly due to the fact that his involvement with the supporting cast of his clique lessens as the movie progresses. It is hard to distinguish whether his group of friends seems unconvincing at times because of sub-par acting or poor ""in-crowd"" scripting.The book is set in 1957 but the movie takes place in some indistinguishable decade in the later 20th century. And whoever was responsible for this theme, which involved vintage cars, clothing, wall decor and other props (black and white television programming), almost pulled it off perfectly. But then there is a small scene where students use Adobe Photoshop on a computer that removed this sense of timeless past generation blending that, until then, had been achieved and greatly narrows down the time frame that this movie could have taken place during.Overall, despite any shortcomings (and there are still a few I have not touched on), this movie delivers an convincing emotional performance and a return to innocence that can be unexpectedly refreshing.

good movie,"This is a wonderful movie...I'vie read the book by Nicholas Sparks and I'vie seen the movie 3 times....it is the best movie ever...made me cry, and Landon is so sweet to Jamie...and Mandy Moore is gorgeous especially when she was doing the play, talk about gorgeous. Two thumbs up for the movie! so romantic...why did she have to die?...but then again, I guess that was the point of the movie right? Because if it she didn't it wouldn't be called A Walk to Remember...because she wouldn't remember anything. But what they did to that guy in the very beginning of the movie was really mean...making him jump off the water thing,that was so mean...Jamie was so outgoing, she has a great self-esteem, not caring about what other people think about her, I do care what other people think about me, because thats just how I am..but yeah...anyway I think this is a romantic movie...and I cried, if you want another cry, I think The Notebook which is also based on a Nicholas Sparks book is The Notebook! I'vie watched that 3 times too and it still makes me cry! In fact all his books make me cry! Big two thumbs up for Nicholas Sparks! Keep going with your romantic books!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just bad,"I gave this a fair shake. I remember it being a very popular movie when it was first released, and the soundtrack sold like crazy on CD. This was at the height of Mandy Moore's popularity.I understood that this wouldn't translate so well 20+ years later but wow. This whole premise of this film is so ridiculous and poorly done. I did not read the actual book so I can only hope that it's better.The acting was to be expected, but even with the accommodation of time, it's just so lousy.

Not standard teen fare,"I went to see this film somewhat sceptical about how good it would be,(the not another pop-star tries to be an actress syndrome).  I admit that I was suitably impressed.  This may not be in the same league as Crazy/Beautiful but it does the job better than most.Although this contains the standard teen fare, wild child in search of redemption and uncool geek, the central performances from Moore and West plus supporting cast from Coyote and Hannah make this an enjoyable fare. Yes Moore does sing but it is all in context.  This is what Spears needed to do in Crossroads.The sound track is one to add to the collection.Ian",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good...but it lacks a pinch of surprise,"To my mind this is a wonderful story about two teenagers that find love in the most unexpected way,and in the meantime they learn important facts about life...and death...and the true power of their feelings. It is one of my favorite movies, but i must say that it lacks something...many can actually tell what is going to happen next. If you are in the mood for a romantic movie, this is the one you should see. It is an unusual movie concerning the fact that we live in a modern world that does not believe any longer in God, love or the necessity of helping others. Jamie is the perfect girl, although she is ill and i think that we all have something to learn from her. Maby we can actually find a little part of her in ourselves.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
NOT the same old story.,"Here's the thing I don't understand. You know, opinions are opinions, to each his own. But at very least, I'd like to know how you people can group this movie in with ""teen flicks"" or ""chick flicks"". Trust me, I hate sappy teen flicks pretty much with passion, and this is my favorite movie of all time. Maybe your idea of these kinds of movies is different than mine, but to me, chick/teen flicks usually consist of things like sex, a desperation to be popular, changing oneself to fit a mold, crazy drunken parties, the skanky popular girls, the jocky football players, the nerds who'd do anything to be/date them, oh and a little more sex if there's time. All set up with a backdrop of a cute little California high school where everyone knows their place on the social ladder and in the end, it's all about how the unpopular finally defeated the popular. You know, stuff like that. Maybe you'll laugh a little, but you end up walking away with nothing more than some funny(ish) quotes and the same old story. I have several movies in mind now that I've said all this, don't you? OK. now...moving on to AWTR. Let me just say...NOT the same old story. Whoever tells you that it is wasn't quite paying attention, either that or their mind just doesn't work with the ideas that come across in this movie. (In less nice terms, they're shallow and don't think about things much.) Read the book first, really liked it, so of course my next step was to see the movie. Since I knew the story already, I wasn't expecting (I really couldn't) the whole overused cheesy ""sappy teen flick"" thing. I'll admit then when the beginning music started up and I started seeing people getting out of their cars I was confused. Wasn't this like 1958? But it the movie version it's not, and it didn't take away from the story at all. If anything it made it more relatable, seeing modern day teenagers in situations that are honest, realistic (if you disagree, go watch Mean Girls or She's All That and compare them to this) and very moving. Very.Don't, PLEASE don't make the mistake of ignoring this movie because of Mandy Moore. Jamie Sullivan is easily my favorite movie character of all time, just because of who she is. And guess what? It never changes. Never once does she come close to even wanting to change who she is for anybody else. Instead it's pretty much the opposite. She changes them, without even trying. Even as the ""plain Jane"" she is so beautiful. This character just grabs your heart and holds on. Watching her is just incredible...I wish I could describe how amazing she makes this movie experience the way some of the reviewers on here have. Trust us- she is just amazing.Landon's transition is also amazing to watch. I mean..ahh, I can't even describe it in a way that does it justice. Just watching the people, the emotions in their eyes, the tears, the joy, being overwhelmed, everything like that...you feel it, and you believe it. You just do. It's nothing I can really describe perfectly, or make you grasp unless you watch it for yourself.Yes, there's Christianity in this movie. But whether you believe or not (and I know some nonbelievers who absolutely love this movie), the idea that it's possible for someone's entire life to change by being exposed to faith when they least expected it, can and definitely does affect anyone, as I have personally seen.As for me...you know what? Never in my life has a movie affected me like this, it just hasn't. It doesn't matter if some people don't believe me when I say it...it's made me want to change. It's that believable. I won't give anything away obviously (duh), but it brings about things that you will not expect. Maybe this movie is in a way, like Jamie Sullivan herself...you think you know what it's all about, but once you really understand it, it will change everything for you, and it's quite possible you'll fall in love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A beautiful and innocent love story,"A walk to remember is a sweet innocent love story that is hard to come by in this era of cynicism and brainless teen movies such as American Pie and its numerous sequels. This movie is a small treasure and works not only on teenage audiences. I'm 34 and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised when I finished watching this.What really sets this movie apart from many other teen movies, is its boldness in telling a traditional love story a la Romeo&Juliet. It shows how two young people from the opposite side of tracks fall for each other. And yes, this plot element is somewhat of cliché, but this movie gives it a different spin and actually manages to tell the story convincingly. The most important plot twist (I won't reveal it here)is also something we have seen before, but who cares when it's done believably and West and Moore give great performances.The movie has some of the most romantic scenes I have seen in ages. I understand that some viewers will find them maudlin or even cheesy but I certainly didn't. Some moments in the movie seem almost magical, like the scene where Moore sings in the school play or where the lovers study the night sky together.This is a movie that has been needlessly mauled by almost every critic (the late Roger Ebert being an exception, that man knew a good movie when he saw one) but appreciated by the audience. The audience has it right. Don't believe the overtly cynical reviews by critics and give the movie a chance. You will probably like it just as much as I did.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of my favorite movies of all time,"It's so refreshing to see Christian characters who aren't the bad guys. Besides Ned Flanders, Jamie Sullivan is about it. Recently, I grabbed this movie on Tivo for my wife, who'd never seen it. She was so ready to hate it because it got panned by the critics, and during the opening scene made several comments like, ""I don't think I'm going to like this."" The movie gradually won her over. By the time Jamie sang ""Only Hope"" (her song during the school play), she was hooked. So often, good movies have nothing to say, and movies with something to say aren't very good... This movie is that rarest of exceptions, managing both. For anyone who believes that there is such a thing as redemption, that even unlovable people have value, and that faith has power, this movie is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best romantic movies I've ever seen,"Oh,i love romance movies ,they take you to another world where you live moments full of love and feelings.I meant it when I said that this movie is one of the best romance movies I've ever seen , it's perfect in every thing , acting, story, events, and in the selection of heroes especially the beautiful, innocent Jamie.I saw this movie several times and yet, it still has the same effect on me.The only thing which is not OK with this movie,at least for me, is the end despite any other end would let it down, but what can I do? I don't like sad ends, I love happy ends when they live happy ever after.I enjoyed this movie so much and I think it worth more than 7/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
it sucks ...,"i've seen this movie in a sneak preview last monday and i must say ... it really sucks.i like love movies and other film of this category. but this film combined all kitschy plots i've ever seen in only ONE movie.even my girlfriend and her friends said it was kitsch.and during the audience all the people in the theater couldn't stop laughing about it. no joke. but the best part was, when my girlfriends cousin - he is from los angeles - shouted out loud: ""american movies suck!"", because he was so much frustrated about that movie.so ... this movie isn't a good deal. spend your money rather for a nice diner with your girl-/boyfriend.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Touching Movie,"I was browsing through Hollywood Video, debating what movie I should rent. There were many movies that were good, but ""A Walk to Remember"" caught my eye, since I read the book when the movie first appeared in theaters. My brother said it would be weak and was trying his best not to get it, but I opposed and told him he gets his movie and I get mine. I am glad I didn't listen to him.This movie was a real tear jerker. People say Shane West sucked at his acting, but I never seen any of his other acting and he did really good to me. I don't think he was trying to act like this big stud or anything. Mandy Moore did very well being the sweet good girl, but in some ways, I think it comes naturally to her too.Anyways, this movie was good because of how Jamie Sullivan helped Landon become a better person. He wasn't too bright of a guy before coming close to her. He was rude and wasn't really going anywhere. Jamie helped him realize the important aspects of life, and he grew to love her. One of my favorite parts was the first time Landon told Jamie he loved her, and Jamie replied ""I told you not to fall in love with me."" I thought that was just beautiful! lol.When Jamie told Landon she had cancer, it really mad me sad. I wanted them to be together, but I had to keep reassuring myself that this was only a movie. The part that finally made me cry was when Landon hugged his dad in thanks of helping Jamie. That really showed Landon's love for Jamie, and his forgiveness to his father.Another thing I liked about the movie is how Jamie's father realized that Landon really did love Jamie. Jamie's fathers' opinion about Landon was wrong, of course all loving fathers are erie of letting their little girl go away. I was happy to see that Landon and Jamie's father became good friends, and that her father even was proud of Landon for getting into medical school.This is one of my new favorite movies. I could watch it again, probably am before I bring it back in. I will even buy it. 10/10If you haven't seen it, make sure you do.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A rare love story that fill you with warmth.,"I think this movie is such a beautiful story about two people's love for each other. You get to see a very rare kind of love. A love which not many people get to have. I can admit that I am kind of weak, when it comes to love-stories, but there is something special about this one. Many movies has the same story only with some differences, but not this one. This movie has it's own story. There is so much love and joy that it doesn't take you long before you feel this warmth inside of you. This movie proves that there is so much more to a person than her/his looks. This story makes you see that you can not be shallow, that you have to look inside of someone, to find true love. This is such a great love-story and such a great movie. I advice everybody to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a fantastic film!!,"I can't believe how great A Walk To Remember was. I admit when i hired it out (it's not avaliable to buy on DVD in the UK yet :( ) i was really expecting another chick flick with a perfect ending! But i was so shocked! Shane West and Mandy Moore were both great in it & Shane is so HOT too! I've watched it 3 times out on rental and i'm going to buy the soundtrack. I cried buckets (okay im a girl) but any guy i know would have been moved by that film (& i'm mates with a rugby team!) It's such a beautiful and well acted movie and is such an inspiration to how people should live their lives, i think we could all learn something from it whether old, young, male or female you should definately watch it!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An astonishing drama,"I simply can't understand how this movie is not rated with at least 8.0 and it's not in TOP250. Maybe because there are in this world, a lot of people like the one who said that a real movie is ""Blade"". Anyway, I really think that it has its place in the TOP I mentioned, instead of the Japanese animations.This is certainly one of the best movies ever made. In this category are, to be sincere, a lot of movies, but this one is somewhere in the top. Also, the truth is that it will never compete ""The Godfather"" or ""Schindler's List"", or even ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, but it's still one of them.CONCLUSION: a wonderful film, an astonishing drama and love-story, a way of teaching people what life/love can be/bring.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic movie!,This is a fantastic movie. I reckon that its extremely romantic and a movie that every Christian should watch.The movie is about Landon who meets Mandy Moore - both on the opposites of this world - one is a bad boy and the other is a good little Christian girl. The girl gets diagnosed with a disease and the boy holds out.It includes a Christian theme and promotes good family and Christian values.If a good family romantic movie is what you're looking for - this will be it.A movie I would recommend to everybody.-Jeremy,10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Walk To Remember,"Adam Shankman is the director of the movie, A Walk to Remember. It is based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks. There are two major actors and actresses. Jamie Sullivan, who is played by Mandy Moore, is an outsider, who has Leukemia. Landon Carter, played by Shane West, isn't too friendly towards her. He is one of the most popular kids in High School and is also constantly in trouble. Landon's careless attitude leads him towards the path of Jamie. Faith brings these two people together to save each others lives. This movie is so touching; it will make an impact in your life along with changing your view of life.Is there a movie you want to see that is unique and touching? Go and rent the movie, A Walk to Remember. This is an excellent movie to recommend to anyone. In this movie a viewer will notice the outstanding performances of the actors and actress, the cinematography and the music.The acting in this movie is magnificent. Everyone in this film finds a way to touch the viewer's heart. Shane West starts out as a schmuck then transforms to a gentleman, and does it perfectly. Furthermore, he pulls off the double life between his friends and Jamie and him. When Landon's two worlds clashes, he stays with Jamie leaving his friends to back stab him. Mandy Moore does not lead on that her character has cancer. Jamie is an outsider but she doesn't fit into the same crowd as Landon and prefers to spend her time enhancing the lives of others instead of partying. Also, she lived everyday to the fullest. Being alone does not bother her.The cinematography in this movie is phenomenal. Before faith brings Jamie and Landon together, Jamie is always wearing pale colors. Half way through the movie, Jamie wears a bluish grayish sweater until Landon buys her a pink sweater. There is a warm and lovely look to the small town of Beauport, North Carolina. The images are never lacking in sharpness. In this movie there are exterior and interior scenes. The exterior scenes look thoroughly gorgeous and really give the viewer the sense that they are right in the middle of the action. The interior scenes seem softer. It appears that Jamie looks paler then rest of the cast. When each scene ends, it will fade through the back to start the new shot, making it look like a black screen.The sound track was excellent. At the beginning of the movie, the music is very suspenseful. Immediately, the viewer knows something is going on. Each dramatic scene starts with up-beat music. For instance, Monday morning at school exciting music and it is catchy. Some of the music matches marvelously with the scenes. In the shot of Jamie talking to Landon on the bus, the music comes to make sense later on. Once that song gets louder the viewer hears ""all the things you try to do, throwing your life away"" is hinting towards how Landon is living his life. The most touching and unforgettable music came at the end. It just added to the sorrow of the scene. In addition, the music does not overpower the movie. Adam Shankman used the right amount of music.In conclusion, this movie is worth watching. Shane West's and Mandy Moore's performances were exquisite. Meanwhile at the same time, the cinematography was beyond compare. Alongside with that the music added to it. None of these were lacking in any means. This movie will be an instant favorite for romantically hopeless people.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie/book makes me want to be a better person,"The only reason I give it 9 out of 10 stars is because it is a chick flick through and through. I had NO desire to see this movie but all of friends voted on it, so we did. I was pleasantly surprised. So much so that the next time my husband traveled out of town I rented it. Then I bought it. Whenever I feel like I have been wronged or something in life hands me lemons, I watch this movie. It is a simple story of life and love, and the human capacity to change for the better. This movie makes me want to be a better person. I never paid much attention to the actors before, but I would consider this to have beautiful breakthrough performances by Moore and West. I work with High School students, and I think the classmates actions and behaviors are portrayed quite realistically. Great movie, a cross between ""Footloose"" and ""Fried Green Tomatoes.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Absolutely wonderful,"I absolutely loved the movie! Yes i admit that i was about to stop watching when i first saw the beginning, but i was so lucky that i didn't. My heart was aching to know what was going to happen next. I couldn't stop watching. My sister thought i was weird because i didn't want to play with her. I was completely intrigued. The singing, the conflict, the scenery. I could go on, but the best part was how it ended. The ending didn't make me want to ask for a sequel. It made me feel like the movie was complete. Most films would just leave it abruptly and leave us wondering why? Why did it have to end there. They leave us on a cliff hanger every time. But not this one. It's special. It hit home. This is one of the best movie i have ever seen and trust me have have seen quite a few. This movie is beautiful and entices you. I don't how they did it but it did.

Worst movie ever,"Walk To Remember was the worst movie I have ever seen.  I came expecting a love story, but it was more of a comedy gone horribly wrong.  The first half hour was the most boring half hour of my life, I would have walked out, but I didn't want to waste my money.  One good thing about this movie, is that Mandy Moore's acting is so bad, it's laughable.  The story is so predictable and cheesy it made me want to vomit.  Even if you have not read the book, you can quote them before they say it. I used to be both a Mandy Moore fan and a HUGE Shane West fan, but now I can't stand either of them. This movie was truly horrible, only see it if you're in the mood for a laugh or you don't have to pay for it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
this movie is terrific,"Hmmmm..... finally i was able to watch this film by Adam Shankman, at first i thought it was like one of those teen movies i've watched before i even hesitated borrowing the DVD from my cousin not once but many times. and so as the film was starting i've read who the director was and found out it was none other than the director of message in a bottle starred by Kevin Costner, this caught up my interest. i wasn't familiar with Shane West until i saw his movie ""whatever it takes"" with Spiderman star James Franco. i find Shane as a younger version of Chris O'Donell; smooth, matinée looking cool guy who's character shifts from one to another. he has carried the character of Landon Carter very well, a teenage boy who's life is actually being mislead by the group of people he calls his friends and so after being punished by the school's principal (he was to make tutor during Saturdays, joining the school play & other community service)he met Jamie Sullivan (played by none other than pop star Mandy Moore), which actually and eventually changed his life forever. So from being a bully, Landon was transformed into this goal-oriented person, i feel the passion and the power of love, a love so unselfish that even i, yes me! cried for this movie. its so amazing to see and experience the power of love. As what others usually say love is what makes this world go round and it is true. Inspite the trials and conflicts between the two, they manage to pull it through and have the best summer together as husband and wife. i find this movie very useful and very entertaining. somehow, i found a refreshing meaning or definition of what love is. it is not bounded by obstacles around us because by faith in God nothing is impossible. it's a miracle, this movie changed me.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

touching and very inspiring teen movie.,"considering Mandy Moore as a young sexy actress, and taken all the awful teen movies thats been released in the last two years. there would be no surprise why this one should be any different. girl meets guy, guys meets girl etc. 'walk to remember' surely stand above your 'typical' teen movie as unexpected twist and turns will arise between the two most uncommon characters in the movie. better yet not only it is aimed at your teen moviegoers but adults can also relate to the touching yet inspiring storyline of the film.even though the movie can be predictable audiences still wont be able to help the fact that to struggling character can come to term with the situations ahead of them, which then the audiences will appreciate it more. although the screenplay can have improvements, the story itself has built a stable platform to make audiences weep and sober. -",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Heart-wrenching, but I wish it was more like the book","This is a pretty good movie, although I have to say that I was a bit disappointed it strayed so much from the book. The issue of spirituality was toned down SO MUCH in the movie. In the book, Jamie and Landon get through the hard times because of their faith but in the movie they get through it because of each other. I really didn't like that unnecessary change. There were a few additions to the story that I though just made the movie unforgettable. Jamie's list of things to accomplish really touches the heart, especially as they are completed one by one. This really is a sweet story and it was well done. If you have read the book and have not seen the movie, do not expect it to be word for word, because it isn't. I think the movie and the book were both really good, but not by any stretch the same. You just have to view the book and the movie as separate stories altogether to really enjoy it.

This is the kind of girl you want to marry. Anyways Im not gonna go over the plot as there's hundreds of posts that have already done that, but do not mistake this for a regular teen movie. There's no comedy, sex, and plot which revolves around and culminates in the prom dance. I usually don't like love stories either, movies I watch include Scarface, Boondock Saints, 7 Samurai, Good bad + Ugly, Yojimbo... well you get the point.Anyways Im going out today to buy the movie so I can watch it again and see the scenes that super station always cuts out.

"brief summary of the movie, and my personal opinion","Love Your EnemiesA Walk to Remember, filmed in 2002, is a heart warming story between two teenagers, Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) and Landon Carter (Shane West), who find each other and battle the road of love as they struggle with acceptance, strength, courage, and hope for one another. Jamie, a young quite girl with a strong heart for God, fights for her life as she struggles with leukemia. Determined to fulfill her biggest dreams before she dies, she works hard everyday to take care of her father, Revered Sullivan (Peter Coyote), do well in school, and complete a list of things she has planned for her life. On the other hand, Landon is the complete opposite. Part of the popular crowd, Landon tries his best to fit in and be cool with his friends as he shuts his family out of his life. After encountering some trouble at school, Landon's parents and principal believe that he needs to fill his free time with some better activities which leads him to a punishment of being part of their high school annual school play, therefore creating a common bond between Jamie and Landon. While Jamie plays the main character and shows strong understanding to her script, Landon tends to struggle to remember his lines. In an act of desperation, he ask Jamie for her help in which eventually bring the two together in ways that we wouldn't think possible. As they put their differences aside, the two see the positive influences of one another and fall head over heels in love.I believe that the director Adam Shankman, brings the idea of acceptance into this film. He is reaching out to show that even though two people may have completely different lives, views, or values on things, there may always be that one common bond which brings a pair together. As we watch Jamie struggle with her leukemia, we also see Landon as he learns what's important to him though the eyes of Jamie fighting for her life.To me the most important part of the movie is at the end when Landon goes by Reverend Sullivan's house to return Jamie's poem book. This is a symbol in the movie of how Landon had changed and the impact that Jamie had left on his heart. As he moved forward in his life, he showed the drastic changes he made to become a better person than the bully he was in high school. The love he had formed for Jamie had done more then make him smile -- it created a whole new person who succeeded in his future as he completed his own list of life expectations in which he planned for himself.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"WAY above most teen movies-- Authentic, sweet, and very real!","Great for what it is, and what it sets out to portray. ""A Walk to Remember"" is a well made, thoughtful movie. It is dramatic in a manner one might think is aimed at adolescents. But what makes it appealing to adults as well as kids is the ""truth"" of the drama. That is, unlike many teen movies that seem to capitalize on the angst-y, overblown melodrama and theatrical nature of teenaged fantasy, ""A Walk"" touches on very real and important (albeit sometimes very quiet) issues that everyone deals with throughout their life.""A Walk"" is also very sweet, but avoids sentimentality. Overall, it is a very authentic and meaningful depiction of some of the big issues facing us all: Our choices, self and social identities, and having a vision of who we want to become, and how we go about becoming that. Perhaps this is a bigger issue to one who is 16 or 18 or 19 years old, but it certainly reappears over and over to some degree or other throughout our life span.The performances were especially great. Peter Coyote is a strong, skilled, and delightful presence. Daryl Hannah (Sp?) is unrecognizable as a brunette, so we get to experience a wonderful aspect of her character-- which is totally on-target and deep here-- without being distracted by her glamor and stardom. I was enjoying her as the mom for the first 2/3 of the movie, wondering to myself, ""Where have I seen this amazing actress before?"" before it dawned on me that it was she. Good job to both of them!Mandy Moore was grand, avoiding all cliche of the ""ugly duckling"" female character we have seen so many times before. The male adolescent lead, Whats-his-name, at first struck me as a bit young Charlie Sheen-ish, and therefore a tiny bit of a rip off. But upon reflection I saw his portrayal as 100% appropriate. After all, isn't this what 17 or 18 year-old boys are like in real life? Especially the confident and popular ones? You know, a bit of posturing, a bit of performance, a bit of bravado, and a bit of uncertainty and fear. And yet in the end, the better ones are capable of change, capable of personal breakthroughs and transformations for the better.Overall, an excellent movie! I gave it a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A movie to remember,"Growing up in the 80's, I realized that many romance movies (especially the tearjerkers) spawned from the 1970 movie that started it all, ""Love story."" Whenever I watched a 'love story' on the big screen, I always compared it to the original Love story movie. Looking back at Ryan O'Neal & Ali Mcgraws 'love story', I always thought their story was the pinnacle for all movies to follow. Last summer I viewed ""Me, Earl & the dying girl"" (not that great) another take on the original Love story but this one about friends. I have yet to see ""The fault in our stars"" but from what I read, just another take. I have seen many romance films throughout my years. A few months ago for the very first time I watched ""A walk to remember"" and it is a true masterpiece of the 'Love story' genre for ages to come. This film leaves an imprint on its viewers, almost mesmerizing! Unlike Ali Mcgraw's character, who is an atheist, in the original ""Love story"" film, Mandy Moore's character,Jamie Sullivan, is the polar opposite, a young woman who was brought up by her father with virtues, ethics, morals, a sense of responsibility and most importantly, a deep love and belief in GOD. Even though Jamie is deeply religious and strong in her beliefs, she isn't portrayed as a ""Jesus freak."" The positive effect (putting it lightly) that she has on Shane West's character of Landon Carter, is truly remarkable and something to behold, to cherish and remember. It goes to show just how important the people we associate with can have a profound effect on our lives. Landon wasn't necessarily hanging with a 'bad' crowd but rather some typical teens who try and look and act cool, maybe make fun of others who don't 'fit in' but they're definitely not bad people. No drugs, no gangs, etc. So when Landon gets a good dose of Jamie Sullivan, it rubs off on him, opens his eyes and makes him want to be the best person he can possibly be for not only himself but especially for Jaime. For the record, all the performances in the film were terrific, but I truly don't think anybody else could have nailed Mandy Moore's portrayal of Jaime Sullivan's character. As far as I'm concerned, Mandy Moore is the academy award winner for best actress in 2002!The song Jaime sings during the school play, entitled ""Only hope"", was not only inspiring but indelible. Ironically there's a line in the song, ""I know now you're my only hope"", turns out to be exactly what Jaime was for Landon and Landon for Jaime. Being a father myself, I found the expression on Peter Coyote's (Jaime's father) face at the end of the porch swing scene (where Jaime receives a gift from Landon), absolutely priceless!What a great film to display how the good of one person can affect the life of another forever. That's what this film is all about, and of course let's not forget the great love these 2 share. What made me love this film even more is the simple purity of the film. I haven't read the book, A walk to remember,(I'm looking forward to getting my hands on a copy) by Nicholas Sparks but from what I've read about the book, the movie is more contemporary to appeal to this generation but at the same time, the movie does something very unique for this day and age. It pretty much keeps the 2 main characters at arms lengths most of the film, a throwback to the books' time. And when we do see the 2 main characters engaged in a kiss, holding hands or hugging, or in one another's arms, it's all the more special. No sex, no drugs, no profanity, no Landon seeing someone on the side or vice versa. Such a warm, gentle and once again, most of all pure film, and it's truly amazing. I remember seeing the movie ""The Notebook"" and thinking to myself what a great love story. But after seeing A walk to remember, I will be hard pressed for the rest of my days to find a love story that truly captures pure magic the way it did between Jamie Sullivan and Landon Carter.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst chick flick I've ever seen,Definitely not worth watching unless your highly religious and love awkward cheesy moments that just wouldn't work in real life,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great movie,"A Walk To Remember is a very nice movie.I will start by saying that yes, this is a chick flick. But it's not one of those ditsy blonde films about teenage crushes and all of that, it has a lot more substance than one of those crap-tastic Hilary Duff screen play that's in theaters every single day. Mandy Moore played the role excellently, and so did Shane West - those two were very convincing as a couple.In addition to being cute and thoughtful, it was also pretty sad. Drama, angst, romance, and character development definitely reared their heads in this film, no doubt about it. My only complaint on the movie was this: it was a bit slow paced. Not excruciatingly slow like Inventing The Abbots or anything, but definitely not an action packed gore fest of sex and violence.In conclusion, if you haven't seen it -- see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Amazing movie, a wonderful drama","This is one of the best movies I've seen. It got everything. I got comedy, Mandy Moore was really funny, It has a really beautiful love story, Mandy Moore and Shane West looked so cute together.

Mandy Moore is really amazing considering that this was her second movie and her first leading role !!!

A walk to remember,"This is one of my favourite movies so far. I have seen a lot of romantic movies about teen love, but this is the one impressed me the most! It is not just about love, you can find many things much more than that in this movie. My mind was heavy after watching this movie, i never expect such a movie to touch me so much. I did not cry, oppositely, i am very happy, because they experienced true love once in there life, and this is enough. Jammy not only changed London, but also me. I started to reconsider what i am doing now, what are my dreams, what is my faith. Anyway, highly recommend this movie, every teenager should watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

OK maybe I'm just easily influenced by films, but is that a crime? why should we have to sit through a 3 hour long cult indie movie just because its supposed to broaden our minds? surly we'd all prefer to watch a chucklsome movie, (with perhaps a little eye candy!) and walk away with a smile on our faces and an ambition to become whatever the lead character in this movie was!

amazing,"This is a masterpiece, in a word. This is a breathtaking and inspiring film it shows that if your love is strong enough, you can get through anything. The film inspires and encourages people to have faith and to never turn their back on somebody they truly love as the outcome is so rewarding if you stand by them. Although 'Landon Carter' has to incorporate into his life that he has lost the love of his life, his soul mate, his everything, he knew that Jamie would always love him for 'being her miracle' and for not leaving her side when she truly needed him, and this helped him go on and continue to smile. Overall this film is truly amazing and breathtaking, it is inspiring to those people who believe they should change (i.e because they are a criminal) as from this film they can see that life will be much more rewarding in the future if they do.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I never will forget this...,"Truly a thing to remember...this film will stick in memory as THE most trite of christian white American fantasies ever - full of pathos, blind obedience and 'better-than-thou' messages. As a european I couldn't decide wether to die laughing or crying as to how horribly boring and predictable this movie was. laughing, because of the bad acting and terrible stereotyping. crying, because if this movie and the viewer comments I have read are any indication, then I pray to whatever deities are out there (or not) that such attitudes never come to europe. I wasted an entire euro on renting this DVD - a euro I will remember forever as the worst spent money of my life.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A fair review?,"'A Walk to Remember' is perhaps a cheesy film with a typical teen-movie storyline, but the story is truly romantic and of course, based on the true story of (author of the novel) Nicholas Sparks' sister. For those of you who have seen the film, you either loved it or felt indifferent towards it. I am yet to meet someone who didn't like it, and most shed a few tears, even those who do not consider themselves 'teen-movie' fans. The basic story is very similar to another film, called 'Here on Earth', and I would recommend it although only as a second rate 'A Walk to Remember'.Mandy Moore sizzles as Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the minister in Beaufort, North Carolina. She is deeply religious and a grade-A student, about to feature in the town's new production, a play written by a local student. Landon Carter, played by the slightly less good Shane West, is roped into appearing in the play after getting into trouble with the law, and things develop from there. The emotion and romance scenes are well played by West and Moore, and actually believable.Moore and West are backed up by experienced actors Darryl Hannah and Peter Coyote, along with some younger actors who range in ability from good to poor, although I won't go into details...Cheesy, yes. Predictable...no. Be surprised, go on!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The scenes that made me well up were Landon and his father hugging when he tells him thank you and also when Jamie tells Landon she has leukemia.,"I'm not a trained critique but having spent 27 years in 9th grade, I feel I am partially qualified on the subject of teenagers, peer pressure, etc. A Walk To remember has become one of my top five movies of all time--and that's quite a few. The message in the story is great(which is #1 with me). Shane West and Mandy Moore are absolutely fabulous and carry the story in simple, well-acted scenes. The support cast could not have been better. Wish I had them to pass out International Star Registry Certificates at the end of the month. Kudos to all the young people writing in. If you enjoyed the movie and shed a little tear you are on the right path in life!! In summary, I can say that this movie has touched me deeply and will never go out of style with its message!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A movie about pure faith and love.............,"A walk to remember is an excellent movie, it is about a girl who has faith in its purest form, about a girl who believes, who knows what her priorities are and she makes you feel like world surely does have good people left in it. A sad ending movie, but still every time i see it, it makes me feel better. It is one of those movies which empower you, if you try to learn something out of 'a walk to remember' you will certainly learn a lot. Having seen the movie dozens of time and after reading the novel too, my opinion is that it is a very sweet, inspiring and romantic movie, it surely makes me happy every time I see it.The character of Landon Carter comes off very well. Surely his acting skills are excellent but it is Jamie which actually wins your heart. The change in Landon and the trust he then shows in Jamie is commendable. The songs are good too. One of the songs that is 'Only hope'is very beautifully done, in fact the whole play sequence is nice. One can say that the characters are very well framed.Though the book and the movie are quite different still the emotions are as strong as they were in the book! Surely a remarkable movie and no doubt my best!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

If only it followed the book...,"I read the book A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks before I want to see the movie.  I am unfortunately disappointed with the movie because of its lack of direction in accordance with the book.  The movie left out a couple of key points that were in the book.  I thought Hollywood changed A Walk to Remember in order to fit the ""Hollywood"" status that movies have become today.  Is Hollywood to afraid to put the Bible in a movie that should have it in it?  Was Jaime's faith not important enough to really leave it out as they did.  They missed the mark on the movie dealing with the real meaning behind faith and salvation.  I also think they misinterpreted the character of Jaime for most of the movie.If you have not read the book yet and go see the movie, you will probably really like it.  It is very entertaining and worth the viewing.  If you really want the whole story behind the characters, read the book because it is much more emotional, romantic, and developing than the movie.  I would just have to conclude with what I have emphasized earlier:  This is a great story that Hollywood missed the mark on and really ruined it all.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

The things Landdon does for Jamie and the journey he makes is heart warming and beautiful. Watch it. The script is wonderful and also while very different from the original book, was overseen by Nick Sparks who wrote the book. You'll wish Landon was your boyfriend by the end of it.

Very good!,"This movie was surprisingly good. I thought it would be a teenage movie (I'm 26...) but it really is great for everybody. I don't know anything about Mandy Moore except she sings, but now I know she can act, too. Anyway, this movie was very good. Jamie (Mandy) is a daughter of a ""priest"" who falls in love with Landon (Shane), ""the bad boy"", after they start learning an act together. This movie was beautiful and heartfelt, deep. Towards the end you find out that she has a leukemia which she dies from in the end after she gets married to Landon. The reason I gave 9 stars out of 10 is because of the sad ending (otherwise 10 stars). And the last 30 minutes of the movie really keeps your eyes wet, at least mine, and I don't cry that easy. Well, you just have to see this movie if you like to reach out for tissues.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Just Beautiful - Really Heartfelt,"I don't have much to say about this movie other than that it's one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have only seen it once - but I plan to watch it many more times in the near future. What perfects this movie is the actors great performances, the great settings, the script, the music - everything about this movie was great. I can't describe it, but the movie triggered sort of a sorry/weird feeling inside of me that I have never experienced before - a very new perspective on life, a beautiful perspective on life. One can say safely say that I fell in love with Mandy Moore's character and it's sad, but I don't believe that you can find girls like that in the real world. I haven't actually read the novel - but if it's anything like the movie, it must be a best seller. A definite recommendation from me to anyone who hasn't seen this movie!

Love blossoms almost too late.,"Sometimes a little sappy and very predictable, but a decent vehicle for teen singer Mandy Moore. The charming Miss Moore gets her first chance to carry a movie and she does so with ease. A romance slowly grows between a high school romeo(Shane West)and a quiet preacher's daughter(Moore). Peter Coyote plays the girl's bitter dad and revered man of the cloth. The couple manage to get around some of his stern rules about life. Also in the cast are Al Thompson and Daryl Hannah. A modest soundtrack allows Moore to sing four songs, the best being ""Cry"" and ""It's Gonna Be Love"". Pleasant, but no great shakes.

I could see how this kind of cod, two dimensional, moralising pap might go well in The States - especially the Midwest - but over here the religious over tones really jar (not to mention the ropey acting and simplified to the point of the ridiculous charcters).OK I'm not the target audience (being an embittered, European, urban 29 year old man) but I'm sure there are better movies out there for this demographic (I love Dirty Dancing for example, Footloose anyone?)Do yourselves a favour and avoid.",,Anonymous,Romance

Film - A walk to Remember,I watched this film last night and really enjoyed this. It is a lovely love story but at the same time I found it really sad. The film was definitely better than I thought it was going to be. The only thing I would say is that the ending could have resulted in Jamie recovering from her illness. I am glad that Landon was able to take up his dreams of a place at Medical School. The wedding scene was the most saddest and I cried a lot until my face was all red and blotchy and I was still crying when I went to bed that night. Jamie made a lovely bride and Landon looked very nice looking in his wedding suit.I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone that needs a good cry.

Also, I do appreciate Jamie's attitude toward death. The day before yesterday while I was sharing this movie with my students in my audio-visual classroom, I could not help finding tears in my eyes again and again.

It is a fairly corny teen flick, yes, but it's ABOUT something. I left the theatre thinking how some 18-year-olds focus on today, believing that they have all the time in the world to worry about the future, and others are faced with situations that make them grow up fast. People in the second group tend to realize that 18 is not to young to do something valuable, to change another person's life.This definitely wasn't Shakespeare, but I was gently entertained, and it made me think. That's good enough for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is definately A Walk I'll Remember!,"My rating on this movie: 11/10 It was a sensational, uplifting film that I walked out of the theatre saying ""I want to see that again!"" Most movies I'll wait to see when they come to rent after seeing them in the theatre, but this one I will probably see at least once more in the theatre! It made me laugh and made me cry.The story started out with a sigh in the opening scene and I thought ""Oh God it is the teen movie from Hell!"", but as it moved on I began to fall in love with it. The camera work and direction is simple and the dialogue is perfect. My goal is to make the girl that I like as happy as Landon did in the movie. I hear the book is so much better than the movie, and if that is true I am definately getting the book!Mandy Moore was SENSATIONAL and can definately act (much better than the looks of Britney Spears' new movie CROSSROADS which looks so incredibly stupid, but I'll give it a chance as I do every movie). Shane West is also very good as the co-star and Peter Coyote delievers an EXCELLENT performance.Please see this movie....everyone in the theater from myself to the father with his daughter next to me was in tears throughout the movie. It is uplifting and adds just enough humor to keep you interested. Take this walk...and remember it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Guy meets girl, corniness ensues","Altogether an average movie. If you like Shane West, Mandy Moore, sappy love stories, Switchfoot, bad acting or any combination thereof or are a girl aged 7-14 I would recommend watching this movie. Otherwise, stay away.

Refreshingly told love story,"This film is about the unlikely first love between a reverend's daughter and a young man who is up to all sorts of mischief. After their chance meeting, their lives are changed forever.I really liked this film. Despite the predictable story, it is told in a refreshing manner. Character development is great. Both the main characters change subtly, bit by bit, after being influenced by each other. Cinematography was good, and the cameraman's skill is already fully shown at the first scene, where the camera moves in different directions and at different speed to focus on various things that are going on in the youngsters gathering.I particularly respect the fact that Mandy Moore is portrayed wholesomely, without having to resort to using skin to attract other boys (or the movie goers). There was even not a sex scene, which I have no complaints about. This down-to-earth girl-next-door is attractive without being sexy or glamorous. Sex does not equal love. I think it is an important message to be told to young people.This movie is touching and I do recommend it!",,Anonymous,Romance
The best movie in the world,"A Walk to Remember is a kind of movie that you could bring your parents to, but don't want to.  While watching the movie, you'll be wondering why your boyfriend can't be like that.  'A Walk' is a movie about a rebellious teenager who gets in trouble with the law and is charged with, what seems severe to him, is minor punishments.  Landon, Played by hottie Shane West, is the eighteen year old on the wrong path of life who in the end, finds out what true love really is.  Pop sweetheart Mandy Moore takes a break from her singing days and tries acting.  In conclusion, she was great(better than both Mariah Carey and Britney Spears).  Ms. Moore plays Jamie, the sweet and ugly-beautiful daughter of the town's southern baptist church. She helps Landon with his lines for the school's spring play which is one of his punishments.  When the play is over, the most unexpected thing happens, Landon falls in love with Jamie.  When his friends find out, they play a lame joke on Jamie but end up losing Landon as their friend.  This is only part of the movie and the rest is the parts of the story that give the movie away. To sum it up, A Walk to Remember is a sincere film about two teenagers who find love that some people don't find in a lifetime.  I recommend that you see this movie and love it as much as I do. It is a true 10 out of a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Different, but touching","I read the book first, not before the movie came out, but before I saw the movie. I have to say it was quite different. Not bad different though, actually it was a great different. The plot was very well down and very sweet, just loosely based. Mandy Moore is so excellent in this part and Shane West shows a side he never portrays. The soundtrack is very good, with songs from Switchfoot and the staring actress herself, Mandy Moore. Overall this is an wonderfully done, beautiful film. A Romance and a tear jerker. It's like a less wet Titanic. Love it!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Jamie was so sure of herself during the movie and proved that miracles can happen. i can watch this movie 100 times and not get sick of it! its not like other movies. you get attached so much and when she tells him about her leukemia you feel what he feels. their actions really brought the movie alive. i think everyone except teenagers should see his movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Squeaky Clean Does NOT Equal Good!,"I've been told that 'A Walk to Remember' should be forgiven for its multitude of faults because a)It has a positive Christian message for teens, and b)It's a 'Chick Flick', and, for some reason, that makes leaps of logic somehow acceptable. Personally, both arguments, to me, demean the groups referred to. A good film stands on its own merits; a bad film, and this one is a stinker, should not be rationalized away by saying it's target audience expects less!'A Walk to Remember' opens with the world's most clean-cut 'gang' of overprivledged kids busting into an abandoned warehouse complex at night (shades of 'Footloose'), then daring a kid as a rite of initiation to dive from a tower into a sinkhole of water (shades of 'Breaking Away'). Conned by the charismatic leader (Shane West), the kid jumps, and is badly injured. Naturally, the police immediately arrive, and West is busted, for staying with the kid. As punishment, he is given probation, community service time...and he has to JOIN the DRAMA CLUB!!! (This is PUNISHMENT for nearing KILLING a kid???) In the Drama Club is school geek and Born-Again Christian Mandy Moore, who you can tell is 'The Good Girl' because she carries a Bible, doesn't wear makeup, and is wardrobe-challenged! From her soulful glances at him, and his arrogant smile in reply, you know that True Love is only a few plot-twists away. It takes Opening Night to provide the catalyst, though...apparently, this club doesn't believe in dress rehearsals, because when she walks onstage, in makeup, and a slinky dress with no underwear (one wonders how her minister father approved of THAT!), and sings to West, as the male lead (yes, despite having no acting ability, or experience, he gets the lead in the play), he sees how hot she is for the first time, and falls for her.She warns him NOT to fall in love with her (ah, could there be a secret she's not sharing? DUH!), but he follows her around, anyway, even to the cemetery where she stargazes with her telescope at night. (This sets up one of the most brain-dead scenes of the film; he asks to see Pluto, to which she replies that it doesn't rise until two hours before sunrise. ""I'll wait"", he says...In reality, Pluto is impossible to see in a small telescope...it wasn't even discovered until 1930, in an amazing piece of detective work...and this supposedly brilliant astronomy hobbyist doesn't know this??? As a Born-Again Christian, you KNOW she wasn't lying to get a night alone with West!)Eventually, Moore collapses, and it is revealed she is dying of cancer (shades of 'Here on Earth'), and, on her deathbed in the hospital, West proposes to her. His estranged doctor father pays to get her Home Care, for her last days...and the next scene, the couple are walking through the woods together, with Moore looking better than ever! (I believe in Love's healing powers, but this is a stretch, even for me!) The couple marry, and share a Summer of Love, before she finally dies (shades of 'Love Story'), and he, redeemed, goes on to ace Medical School (shades of 'Magnificent Obsession').The acting is uneven, at best; Shane West does a credible job, certainly better than Chris Klein did in the 'Walk' clone, 'Here on Earth'. Peter Coyote, as Moore's minister father, does what he can in a role that seems to have been 'lifted' from John Lithgow's in 'Footloose'. Daryl Hannah, nearly unrecognizable with dark hair, is quite good as West's mother. But the rave reviews Mandy Moore has received as the dying girl seem unjustified; no makeup and stilted line readings do NOT equal a great performance! In order for a film like this to work, you must believe the heroine, and the bittersweet nature of her love. I never got beyond the 'golly, look, Mandy Moore is acting' stage, and her delivery often had me wincing!There ARE some great tearjerkers out there, both classic and contemporary...'A Walk to Remember' is just NOT one of them!",,Anonymous,Romance

Surprisingly Moving and Touching,"Yeah, yeah...the storyline's been done before.  Even some of the dialogue sound familiar.  And yes, the score at the end dripped with too much melodrama to be effective.But you know what, despite all that, the movie still works.  It had me, and a good number of the audience, teary eyed at the appropriate moments.  It had me smiling like a dork in the joyous moments of the film.For me, what made this movie so effective was the performance and chemistry of the leads, Shane West and Mandy Moore.  They made celluloid romance look real and sincere.  Their emotions and feelings were palpable. The film and the actors gave one of the best depictions of real love.  There is maturity and innocence in their actions.  And that's what makes this movie different from other run-of-the-mill romance movies.Mandy Moore really surprised me at how effective she was in conveying Jamie's innocence and  strength of character.  Her sweet face and graceful manner make her almost otherworldy, but she still manages to reach out to the viewers and tug at their emotions as if she was someone they knew all their life.  I believe we'll be seeing more of Mandy in Hollywood which I think is a good thing.Shane West is another revelation.  He had the difficult task of showing Landon's growth from aimless youth to self-assured adult capable of self-less love. And he pulled it off.  His subtle performance made Landon's transformation believable and does not suffer a single awkward moment. Like Mandy, I hope we see more of Mr.West in Hollywood.Others have complained that the story is too squeaky clean and it's totally impossible that two teeners could be so controlled when it came to sex. Well, guess what...there are responsible teen-agers out there.  They just don't get enough attention since most of Hollywood think that only sex will sell to a young audience.  The box-office performance of ""A Walk To Remember"" certainly disproves that.  Young people, adults and grannies alike enjoyed this movie. It's about time that Hollywood showed another kind of teenager. The kind that you can admire.As for the comments that this one was just another ""Prety-ugly-girl"" movie where the heroine is just waiting for a make-over...well, I don't know what movie you were watching but ""Walk"" was definitely not it.  Jamie was never ugly to begin with.  She just didn't dress right and did things that were ""unusual"" for other kids.  All that branded her as an outcast.  And where is it written that being pretty ensured popularity in High School?  That's  a fallacy.  Lots of pretty girls in high school but they weren't popular since they didn't have the right friends, the right clothes, the flashy attitude or other things that made one popular.  The Jamie character was that kind of pretty girl.  She had the pretty face but had a strong sense of self to not be concerned with superficial things.  Again, that's what made her different.    And she never had a make-over in the movie!  She stayed true to herself til the end.Congratulations to Shane, Mandy and the filmmakers of A Walk To Remember! It was a risky move to go against the mainstream of sex and violence in films.  But judging from the user comments in this site, you guys did the right thing.  This is simply one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.P.S.  The soundtrack is excellent as well. Listening to it brings back images from the movie and one can't help but be emotional when hearing the tracks.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"This movie gives a bad name to the term ""Chick Flick""","This movie has themes that almost completely differ from my own beliefs.  Do you remember as a little kid the color wheel that they taught you, as if everyone in life was to become a natural painter?  Well, if I was red, this movie would be a teal sort of green.  A Walk to Remember features a) a high dosage of Christian faith, b) a celebration of teenage marriage, and c) Mandy Moore.  I'm not sure why no one shot me before the movie started, because they should have.  The only reason I didn't give this movie a 1 out of 10 is because of the inclusion of two New Radicals songs on the soundtrack.  To say that Mandy Moore's acting was stiff would imply some sort of action (a derivative of emotion).  Mandy Moore's acting was ... nothing.  It was nothing!  There is no adjective to describe how bland she was.  There are also several characters who are completely unnecessary, like the ex girlfriend and Shane West's father.

Sugar-coated dreck,"About the only thing I came away with that I could stand was Ms. Moore's song ""Only Hope,"" a pretty song that tapped my sentimental streak. Nothing else tapped it, though the movie tried mightily with a series of tearjerker clichés. Guess I'm tired of seeing beautiful young women dying of some wasting disease that doesn't go much deeper than hollowed eyes. Landon Carter (such a cool name) turns from bad boy to furrowed- brow earnest--and the message is that not getting any from the pure but dying Janey Sullivan is what causes this transformation. And because we all know where the movie is heading, the story requires an improbable twist that temporarily divides Landon from Janie--just so we'll stay in our seats and see how they work it out in the end. Not whether, mind you, because whether is too painful apparently for viewers. Even the protestant Christian layer of the story aims not to hurt--faith is equated with solace. I suppose it is, or can be, for some, but doubts and arguments about god often accompany faith, though you'd never know from their ""walk to remember.""",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

THIS is the kind of relationship girls should aspire to, not the back and forth crap of 'the notebook'. I can't say how good this film is without giving things away but it is more than your typical 'bad boy turns good'. first of all, because as we learn in the movie and it's even a line essentially said, that Landon's not even that bad, he's just pretending. West's transformation from this wanna be bad boy to this sweet, sensitive but most importantly VULNERABLE teenager is a sight to see. it's a heartbreaking twist that feels almost like karma to his character. the beauty of this film and its acting is in its subtleties so play close attention.

Not Another Teen Movie,"I don't usually like this type of movie. That is, the teenage romance that tries to have underlying messages about how we all have a soulmate and that these two people are very lucky because they have found each other so early and now if they'd just realize it.The premise is something you would see on Lifetime if you had chosen to stay home instead of going to the theater. In essense, the plot is the same as everything you see on made for TV movies but the plot is not what's so special.Both Mandy Moore and Shane West giving either career best or career making performances. They take the cheap story thrown at them and they develop a chemistry between their different characters that people of all ages can appreciate.I read the book about year after having seen the movie and I still think they did a good job adapting the novel. The movie contains all the needed parts of the book and does not drastically change anything.

I think you should read the book then watch the movie!! Yes, the book and the movie are different, but they are both sssooo good!!!! Mandy Moore was really good as Jamie Sullivan and Shane West was a really good Landon Carter!! The movie is funny, sad , and inspirational . This movie is to die for!!

Great romantic movie,"If you're a fan of comedy and not serious movies, then this movie is not for you. A walk to remember is one of the epic romantic movies of the 2000s. The movie has depth and is for people who see the realness behind the whole story. As such tragedies happen in real life, it makes the movie even sadder. I favor the acting of both main characters, Jamie Sulivan (Mandy Moore) and Landon Carter (Shane West) because they both played their parts perfectly. After watching this movie, I changed my standards of a great romantic movie because it is unique and the newly produced romantic movies are just copies of the old ones.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A definite must see!!!,"I absolutely loved this movie.  It was one of those movies that you come away from wanting to see again and again.  Sure I am a hopeless romantic, but this movie had so much more than romance to it.  It definitely was not your typical predictable teen movie.  Mandy Moore and Shane West, I thought, did a terrific job.  I was pleasantly surprised by Mandy Moore especially. So for all of you out there who like that feeling when you come away from a movie that your money was well spent and for those you are looking for a great date movie especially, this is the movie for you.

A movie to remember!,"This movie was by far one of the best ""teen movies"" I've ever seen!  It showed a girl of integrity with an awesome faith in God that all of us should wish that we had.  This movie is a MUCH MUCH better movie for the 'pre-teen' crowd than cross roads, because it shows a MUCH better role model for girls, and guys alike.  All guys who go see this movie....take notes! Shane's character Landon is the perfect kind of guy.  I'd say the book is better than the movie in this instance, but a lot of my friends who have both read the book and seen the movie disagree with me....see for yourselves! This movie is definetly a 10/10 in my book.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not a dry eye in the audience,"This movie was so sad.  The packed audience I watched it with was blubbering three quarters of the way through it.  I know this is kind of a hybrid of She's all that and Here on Earth, but I really enjoyed this movie.  And no, I'm not a thirteen year old girl.  I'm a seventeen year old guy who was semi-dragged to see this by three of my lady friends.  At the beginning we were all making fun of the movie and stuff but by the end we were all silent.  A perfect date movie and one of the better teen movies of recent years.  Who'd a thought Mandy Moore could act?  And, yes, she does sing. But it's in the school musical so it's not all that outlandish.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Sappy, Predictable, Unoriginal","I have nothing against watching a romantic movie from time to time, but this movie made me want to vomit. First of all, how much more unoriginal and cliche filled can a movie get? This made the movie completely predictable and incredibly laughable.Mandy Moore herself wasn't all that bad, except the scene of the school musical where she transforms to herself and comes completely out of character...but I suppose that's more of a script problem there.  The rest of the actors in this movie were atrocious.  It's almost if they were putting little effort into their roles and that lack of sincerity smacks you in the face over and over again.Mandy Moore and Shane West had absolutely no sparks between them.  There's was nothing that really made you care if the their relationship worked out or not because it just seemed to be void of all emotion.  And what attracts the two characters together in the first place is beyond me as they had nothing in common and all they ever shared were a few terribly sappy moments.  It leads me to believe that it was only a physical attraction and that they weren't really in love and it was just infatuation.  As a result, I couldn't care less about their relationship.Even my girlfriend who loves chick flicks just as much as the next girl puts this movie up with some of the worst  she's ever seen.  I gave this movie a 2 out of 10 only because it featured a few decent songs throughout the  movie and it was good for some cheap laughs.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
this film was truly brilliant,"Well what can i say this film was truly excellent from the beginning to the end and really captures the true meaning of love. i was a little l8 in watching this movie i only watched it like a week ago i was flicking through sky and saw it listed i thought y not check it out i mean u never know right. so anyway i watched it and i was amazed i was in tears 4 ages. it was such a beautiful film, it was so sad i thought that the acting was excellent and Mandy Moore was a gr8 actress alongside Shane west who i thought was wonderful. this may sound kinda corny and cheesy and there maybe sum of u who think oh god get a life its just a stupid movie, but this film changed me in so many ways and has opened my eyes up and yes it has changed my life. I'm only 17 so i have my whole life to live and I'm not going to take anything for granted as from now after watching this movie its made me realise that when you find sumthing gd grab on to it with both hands and never let go. my advise to those of you out there who have not yet seen this film plz plz sum point in Ur lives sooner rather then l8r WATCH IT because i guarantee you u will become a better person. this film will make you cry but also make you laff and is definitely by far the best movie I've ever seen and i can watch it over and over agen and never get bored.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fantastic film,"I just watched the film again for the countless time.  This film, as well as the book, is wonderful.  The story is very touching.  It is very nice to see a film without violence, sex and  explicit language. I was very impressed with the two main characters, Jamie and Landon.  Their relationship was a breathe of fresh air and watching the relationship unfold and grow impressive was in today's society.  The actor's that played them were excellent.  Mandy Moore and Shane West had a on screen chemistry that was intense, feeling with compassion and understanding.  Hats off to Mr. Shankman, the Director, good show!!

Not at all what I expected.,"I wasn't intending to view this movie. I assumed it was just another vehicle for an up and coming pop diva.  In fact when I tuned in to it, on the Movie Network, the opening credits had just past.  I didn't realize what I was watching until I was hooked.Mandy Moore gave a fantastic performance for her first lead.  I was immediately captivated and awed by her presence.  The story is a simple formula of unwanted love, opposites attracting, but as usual finds a way to blossom.  I am glad I stumbled across this movie.  It inspired me to purchased the sound track and I still consider it a favorite.  I am looking forward to future endeavors by Miss Moore.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Surprisingly Good.,"I was very shocked by how much I enjoyed this film.  After watching the previews I anticipated a very ""Lovey Dovey Teen Movie,"" I couldn't have been more wrong. I was very surprised by how well Mandy Moore portrayed the character.  She did an excellent job, I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of her in films in the future. Shane West was also phenomenal.  He can play both good and bad guy, again I think West will breakout with an excellent movie career.  The story line was very well written.  I highly recommend this film, even for those who oppose watching teen flicks will enjoy this heart warming film.  The story is how love can concur all, and how one person can change another persons whole life.  You leave the theater with of sense of happiness, it helps you appreciate the beautiful things in the world (Believe it or not).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stunning and truly memorable,"I only came across this film very recently (within the last year) and was completely hooked by the storyline from my very first viewing.Since then I have lost count of the times I have watched it, yet on every single viewing the film impresses me more and is definitely one of my favourite films. The script and monologue within the film is powerful and emotive which is greatly aided by the amazing chemistry between Shane West and Mandy Moore's characters. I cannot truly express in words how this film makes you feel, you are taken in by the story and the characters and become a part of the trials and tribulations they face in a relationship that occurs against the odds.A refreshing film that really encompasses the true meaning of romance and the traditional values of courtship. Its impossible not to completely fall in love with the characters and the storyline.A Walk to Remember is a simple yet powerful and extremely emotive story of love and the traditional values of romance. A truly inspiring and amazing film that you will not forget, a 'must see' film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mandy Moore played a plain Jane well,"I was at first hesitant when i heard Mandy Moore was playing the lead female role in this movie.  Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors and I remembered how great the book was and just wasnt sure about seeing Mandy as a plain Jane.  When i saw the movie i was amazed.  She played the role so well!!  I couldnt believe how well she did, she is a girl of amazing talent and I hope she does take more roles on like this.  When she sang in the movie thats when i realized Adam Shankman really did have the right girl casted for this movie.  I couldnt see anyone else playing Jamie Sullivan. The movie is sad but well done and Shane plays Landon Carter well. The bad guy turned good seems to fit him well.  Over all the movie was well acted and is by far my favorite book turned into movie, movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A sweet, romantic love story (beware guys)","'A Walk to Remember' is a sweet, romantic love story about a young girl who knows who she is and is labelled as a nerd for it, Jamie West played by Mandy Moore, and a troubled young man who finds his way because of her, Landen Carter played by Shane West. During the movie, you watch Landen transform into the good person he always was deep inside, but was too ""cool"" to show it. This movie can be corny, but not as often as you'd think, and plus, corny is good at times. Besides, most of the time the girls are too busy imagining what it'd be like to have this handsome and kind young Landen as their perfect boyfriend to notice. Guys, you just might want to watch this movie to take notes. You can't really say much more about this movie without giving away the plot, but I agree with Roger Ebert: 3 stars out of 4.

Ambitious but not convincing,"The first 2/3 of this movie reminds of ""She's All That"" (popular guy falls in love with a wallflower) and many scenes would be quite interchangeable.Instead the last third deals with some really serious things (I don't want to spoil to much here) rather then giving an everybody's happy-ending like ""She's all that"" does. Anyway - depending on your attitude - you may find this part kitschy (and if you do, you're going to find it *really* kitschy). Other may see it as a demonstration of true love or even interpretate it religiously, however it was definitively to much kitsch for me to like it.The characters, their development and their interaction weren't believeable to me at all (not the cast's fault, they played solid). In my opinion this film trys to be deep but goes for story development and character's action instead of focussing the characters themselves. That doesn't work out and so I saw a - without doubt ambitious - but in the end only average teen love story, most of the time lightly told and with some serious elements which just doesn't fit in.If you liked ""She's All That"" then you'll probably like this one too, if you didn't, save your time and watch something else (concerning love storys ""Der Krieger und die Kaiserin"" would be a good counterpoint to this film).5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Mandy Moore was great in her starring debut as Jamie.

From the point in the alley where she tells him something, I cried. It takes an amazingly powerful movie to do that for me because I am usually not one to cry at a movie.

You should Run from A Walk to Remember,"A couple days ago I went to see ""A Walk to Remember"" starring Mandy Moore and Shane West.  And I must say it had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (In my humble opinion).  Mandy Moore was good in ""The Princess Dairies"" because she looked like the cheerleading type.  Here, everyone knows she's a very beautiful woman, so the idea of her playing an ugly duckling is hard to get over.  I don't see the point of wasting $8 on a movie when you can just rent ""She's All That"" and basically get the same movie.  From what I stated earlier, ""She's All That"" was a good movie because very few people heard of Rachael Leigh Cook before the movie came out, so few people knew what she looked like.  Also, movies should throw ""curveballs"": plot twists that keep the viewer guessing.  I've always tried to guess what would happen in other movies and have been wrong.  In this movie I predicted what would happen SIX different times (and no I didn't read the book and didn't find out what happened from someone else).  Mandy Moore is a great singer, and while she was good in ""Princess Dairies"" she lacked something in ""Walk"".  Shane West did have some bright spots in the movie, and I think he has a career ahead of him in acting.  Otherwise, I believe this movie lacked heart and was too predictable to be enjoyed by a general audience.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not loyal to the book at all,"I don't understand why movie makers feel they have to add to a well functioning story. In the book Jamie has a big, forgiving, unprejudiced heart of gold. She sees the best in everyone. That is what makes her see the best in Landon when he doesn't even see it himself. Jamie in the movie is nothing like the Jamie in the book. Her Reverend father keeps her close in the book because he was an older man when she was born and he lost his wife. He is nothing like that in the film. I really miss some good strong characters. Jamie of the book would never have said ""Prove it"" to Landon about their friendship. She brought out the best in him by being true to herself; a warm and giving person. Not every viewer is a person with Zap mentality. A slow build up often gives the best results. I thought this movie shallow and superficial.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

As a non-practicing Jew, i am made very uncomfortable by faith-based movies and messages, and I felt like, rather than focusing on the love story, and even Jamie's reliance on faith to pull her through, it sent the message that Jamie converts Landon, and the only thing lacking in his life was religion.Overall, I think the basic plot line is very beautiful and riveting, however, some of the topics that the movie covers have the potential to make viewers uncomfortable, and draw away from the main story.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Good Story, needs better acting and directing","I thought this movie could use a lot better acting. West was only partially convincing into the true love story, and the same goes for Moore. However, the plot of the movie itself, I felt to be spectacular. The idea of true love is an idea that is grossly abused by Hollywood, and only this movie has been able to accurately capture true love within such a context. The director could have done a better job coaxing the actors to bring a more cohesive work together, which would have resulted in a 10 rating rather than an 8. Of the mediocre cast, Mandy Moore did the best job in her portrayal of the noble female. In summary, great story, but needs better acting and directing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Best Chick Flick,"I'll be the first to admit that I am not into Mandy Moore or the chick flick scene altogether... so when my friends asked me if I wanted to go see ""A Walk to emember,"" I said ""sure-I'll have a great time laughing at you guys when you're crying."" So I went (resentfully), not knowing anything about it.  Midway through, however, I was crying more than I have ever cried at a movie.  Afterwards, when my friends and I were talking, I decided that this was by far the best tear jerker I have ever seen.  I liked it so much that on Sunday I bought the book and read the whole thing that night. (crying the whole way through)...Now, although it is weird for me, I am obsessed with the movie... I am going to see it again for the 2nd time with my friend this weekend (and I can't wait)... So kudos to mandy and shane on a great movie!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Movie.,I saw this on Saturday and I thought it was great.  Manday Moore and Shane West both did a great job.This was probably also the closest I came to crying at a movie.  This and Titanic are the saddest movies I've ever seen.Bottom line: Excellent.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A bit cheesy,"I liked the first half of this movie. I felt like the character development was interesting and it presented some intriguing characters. Once they really fell in love, all the dialogue was just so over the top and cheesy. It lost the believability for me. I am a 40 year old male so maybe if I had seen this as a teenager it would have made more of an emotional impact but I started to lose interest near the end. The male lead seemed very stiff to me in his acting. I think novels have their own vibe. And maybe in the book the dialogue comes off as amazing but when it's real live actors delivering the same lines it just doesn't come off the same.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An amazing journey of faith, love & growing up.","I absolutely loved this movie.  It has moved to my list of all-time favorites.  Landon does an incredible job coming across as the typical guy jerk, but he realizes there's so much more out there as he learns to love completely and give of himself.  As a result of Jamie's love and faith, he grows into a man, instead of just a bigger version of a little boy, which is the direction he was headed.  Jamie also is an amazing role.  She stands by her faith and beliefs, despite the pain and sometimes ridicule it causes her from her peers.  She portrays a Christian teenage girl, without coming across ""preach-y"" or ""holier-than-thou"" or totally out of touch with the world.  Which is the way it really is.  Also, who says she is the ugly duckling turned beautiful.  In my opinion she was beautiful right from the start.  Glamour isn't synonymous with beauty.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
the best film ever not a tipical teen flick,it is the best film i have ever seen. the actors Shane West and mandy moore played and got into the charactors very well and no-one could have done a better job. i loved the song and scene where only hope was sang by Mandy Moore. and i also like that scene because Shane West was in it and that was when they fell in love.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Love story that beats ""Romeo & Juliet""","Through all my life, I've been watching so many movies, so much love and pain I have seen that Romance became my favourite style and ... every time when I saw a romance movie - it looks like something touches my heart. I am not so good in English, so I can't explain what I am feeling after watching this movie but I want to tell you one thing - when I saw ""A Walk To Remember"", I was complete in tears, feeling my eyes burning like on fire and crying because of the deepest thrill of the Life - The pain of Love !!!You just....must see this movie !Regards:  CiNEMAN®",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
best movie ever,"i loved the movie a walk to remember, from the very first time i watched it, all those years ago, right up until today and for a long time into the future it has, is and always will be my all time favourite movie ever of all time....i have never seen a more beautiful and compatible couple on the screen in a teen film, as mandy moore and shane west....and i think they were the absolute perfect choices for their roles. every time i watch it i cry, even though i have watched it, probably over a hundred or even more times...all my friends are the same, and if you haven't watched the most beautiful movie ever, i suggest that you watch a walk to remember, you will never forget it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
