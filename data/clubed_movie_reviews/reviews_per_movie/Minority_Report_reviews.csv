Underrated & A Film To Think About,"This gets high marks for being an involving film that, despite a long length of almost two- and-a-half hours, keeps ones interest all the way. Being a Stephen Spielberg-directed film, it's no surprise that the photography is first-rate. This is nice-looking movie. Tom Cruise also was very good in here, not the obnoxious character he sometimes portrays (or did more often in his younger days.).The film is a good mixture of action and suspense. Only the one chase scene was overdone with Rambo-like mentality of the good guys not getting hit when they should, and vice- versa.The subject matter is interesting, too: what would do you (or the police) had very reliable information on crimes that were about to be committed, that you could prevent things from happening before they actually did?I recognized two people in here who went on shortly thereafter to become recognizable in TV series: Kathryn Morris (""Cold Case"") and Neal McDonough (""Boomtown""). Add Colin Farrell, Max Von Sydow, Samantha Morton and you have an interesting cast. I am of the opinion that this is one of Spielberg's underrated gems.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Looks great, interesting story","May be this film has some flaws but while watching it I wasn't too distracted by that. Here we have one of the greatest directors alive (Steven Spielberg), a very big star (Tom Cruise) with a great ensemble (Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Peter Stormare, Samantha Morton, Tim Blake Nelson) around him, a good cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and a nice score by John Williams all packed in a great story (based on the novel by Philip K. Dick) with perfect visual effects.In the year 2054 murders can be predicted and stopped before they happen. If you were about to kill but stopped you are locked. Tom Cruise is one of the agents who stops those murders. Then he discovers the next murder they have to stop will be committed by himself.I will not reveal more of the plot. The story itself is great. It is intelligent, but also exciting with great action scenes. The visuals are truly beautiful and perfectly support the sci-fi story. If you like action thrillers and you don't mind they are set in the future (with some futuristic gadgets) this is your film. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Minority Report is one of the top films of 2002,"I read a lot of previous posts about this movie. This is one of the best films of the year, and of recent years. This is a perfect blend of action, suspense, thrills and film-noir. The plot is intelligent and fresh. People saying it is not original must have slept through the movie. Tom Cruise is fantastic, Colin Farrell is amazing, as well as Samantha Morton. Spielberg again proves that he is the master of cinema. A truly great director. I'll agree, the ending was a little too happy, but not worth complaining about. This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may look like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive. The film creates many moral questions and issues, and should leave you thinking. Is being arrested for doing something you actually havn't commited yet fair? It is worth seeing again and again. As a film lover and critic, i can say it is one amazing movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
What must film makers do? This was GOOD - believe nothing else.,"I think some people just write reviews for sites like this because they like to complain. I actually find myself wondering if all the gripers here have actually seen Minority Report, as I just have, because I have to say that is one of the most gripping and involving movies I have seen in quite a while.The content is amazing - all the little details that put the audience firmly in the middle of the 21st century. Personally I can absolutely believe that technology will have advanced in the kind of ways portrayed in the film within 50 years. Just look back 50 years into the past and you should be able to see why. The lives of everyday people in the film, where they are scanned and advertised 'at' all day every day, apart from an excuse for product placement (and why not?), certainly make you think about a world where 'they' know your every move (a future towards which we are already hurtling with some speed).The style is amazing - why the wooden balls? Because they're cool is why. I like to think that as we progress as a civilization we will keep a few such elegant idiosyncrasies knocking around. The plastic, chrome and glass sets, objects and architecture all looked clean and functional and the way that they suck the color out of a scene worked well and gave the film a distinctive palette. The cars are the best looking vehicles I have ever seen in a film. I have only one criticism here - why do all the computer displays look like Macs? Surely a touch unrealistic ;)The story is amazing - complicated, yes, but also engrossing, exciting and scary. There are elements here that are only hinted at, but which give the plot a depth increasingly lacking in modern action flicks. And it asks the kind of questions about morality, justice, exploitation and society that'll keep you thinking for much longer that the film's two and some hours.The direction and performances are amazing - the pre-visualization on this movie must have been a nightmare and yet all the incredible special effects blend perfectly into a visual style that is completely natural and assured, as might be expected from Spielberg and Michael Kahn. There are, of course, numerous references and homages to the work of Stanley Kubrick, which have given a hint of the edge and flair of 'Clockwork Orange' or '2001'. I hope it will continue to be a big influence on Spielberg.Cruise delivers a first class performance as usual, but the discovery of this film is Samantha Morton as Agatha. Who saw the film and didn't share her terror and vulnerability? Little touches such as the way she clings to Cruise, almost like a baby's reflex, make her a character you immediately care about, innocent and tragic.Anyway, if that's not enough to recommend the film, then you'll probably never find another one you like again. But if you need another reason, go to see it just for another fantastic soundtrack from the master, John Williams.Full marks, five stars, a must see several times and buy the DVD movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Looks like I'M in the minority here...,"Based on the mostly positive reviews for this, it looks like I'm in the minority here (wink), because I don't think that this film quite worked the way it should have, or the way it could have. It's quite rare that I leave a moviegoing experience feeling dissatisfied, but I think that the movie set high expectations with a very cool premise, but then lost it in a mess. I can break down my thoughts into two categories:1. PlotThe notion of ""precrime"" is pretty slick, and I don't mind that the first 20 minutes of the movie spend time explaining and demonstrating it. But it sets rules and guidelines that are ultimately broken by the end, leaving me quite confused as to why I should buy into these plot points in the first place. I don't really find myself feeling like they are plot holes, but more that the premise becomes loose and messy. To be reductive, in a movie where beings are predicting the future, there really shouldn't be too many surprises or plot twists, right?2. ToneThis is what stuck out to me first. This movie plays it pretty straight, and doesn't have comic relief characters (like Goldblum in ""Jurassic Park). So when the first big fight scene breaks out, the tone shifts and things start to get quite silly (bumping a breakfast table, interrupting a student practicing saxophone), and then all of a sudden it feels like ""Men in Black."" I welcome moments of levity, but the ones here did not feel earned. Any cheerful or ""funny"" moments really stuck out from the rest of the film.I won't dock it any points for weird SFX or anything, even if I think that the ""conducting"" while using touchscreens looks super forced and unnatural.Ultimately, its 145-minute runtime allows it to explore more plot twists. The movie doesn't necessarily feel long or slow, but it does have a moment towards the end where it felt like it should have ended. I think the script was trying to do way too much, and resulted in having four separate stories that barely dovetail gracefully.I don't feel inclined to give Spielberg or a Williams much credit here. I think there are some cool sci-fi moments, and some good performances (though I don't think that anyone delivers a Top-5 performance here), and that's why I feel like a 6/10 rating is appropriate.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Full of imagination.,"Before they joined forces to give sci-fi fans their hugely disappointing version of War Of The Worlds, Spielberg and Cruise worked together on Minority Report, a near-future tale based on a short story by Philip K. Dick in which violent crimes can be predicted and prevented from occurring, the perpetrator intercepted before they can carry out the deed. Star Cruise plays pre-crime cop John Anderton, who finds himself on the run after it is predicted that he himself will commit a murder.The good news is that Minority Report is a lot more enjoyable than the duo's H.G.Wells debacle, with an engrossing murder mystery plot, lots of great visuals, excellent production design, and some well executed and extremely fun action set-pieces, all of which help detract from the story's inevitable paradoxical issues and Spielberg's occasional, frustratingly unrestrained direction (Cruise leaping from car roof to car roof on a towering vertical road stretches plausibility a bit too far, but at least it's not 'nuke the fridge' bad).7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the 'sick stick' a police baton that makes the victim projectile vomit.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Minority Report,"So - can you be arrested for a crime that you haven't actually committed yet? I suppose that is conspiracy - but this cleverly crafted crime drama questions even the morality of that stance. Tom Cruise is a policeman in the ""pre-crime"" unit who uses information from three people who are able to see into the future, to arrest the spiralling crime rates by intercepting the perpetrators on the cusp of their criminality. Murderers, rapists, bank robbers - you name it, and this has a profound effect on the crime rate. All looks plain sailing until Cruise ""Anderton"" becomes embroiled in a potential killing of his own, and his erstwhile colleagues - not least Colin Farrell (""Witwer"") and Max von Sydow (""Director Burgess') are on his trail using his own techniques against him. Steven Spielberg has concocted a plot that, though complex, is relatively easy to follow with plenty of action and thriller elements that do exactly what they are supposed to. The ending is maybe just a bit disappointing - far too tidy for my liking; but Cruise, Farrell and von Sydow combine well to generate a fair degree of menace and suspense to keep it interesting. The CGI hasn't really stood the test of time so well and I hope Bulgari (amongst others) got their money's worth - I wouldn't rush out and buy one, but I would watch the film again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
You still have a choice...,"Steven Spielberg is one of the few directors around today who can still manipulate an audience in one sense while dazzling and daring that same audience with storytelling and character skills fused with ingenious visual effects.  Minority Report is a shining example of that, which also has the grace of having an intelligent concept to start with, which so many sci-fi films lack much less summer sci-fi films (look at MIB2 to see what I mean), and also better than average acting.Cruise takes the lead role here as John Anderton, who leads, more or less, the agency of police that prevent all murders on the basis of predictions from three Pre-Cogs (one of them Samantha Morton who has the most important role of the three).  The system is presumably perfect, until to the surprise of Anderton, he is seen to commit a murder and so starts his quest to try and find out if there is a flaw in thirty six hours.  This could be the basis for average sci-fi fodder (Impostor, a film based on another Philip K. Dick story that came out earlier this year, is an point of that), yet Spielberg elevates a story and creates a unique atmosphere to coexist with his characters; by the time the film is HALF way through you'll be exhausted in entertainment.Bottom line, this is the type of picture to see twice, first to get the feel and presence, and the second to clear up any misunderstandings in the plot (or maybe to avoid Scooby Doo and Windtalkers), since this is indeed one of the best pictures of the year and one of Spielberg's best recent pictures. Grade: A+ or A",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Wasted Opportunity,"This film has elements to it that could've made it a dystopian masterpiece, yet it failed due to its at times unrealistic writing and unamphatic character development and lack of deep conclusion.Action scenes are great and the idea out there is pretty great it just has its missing pieces.Tom Cruise is doing a good job as the leading action hero as he always does - his bread and butter.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
One of the best/most complex science fiction films,"Steven Spielberg sets Minority Report in the near future of 2054, in which the technology is advanced, but not far-fetched. Cars can drive themselves and ride up elevators, computers come with holograms as a user interface, and stores recognize you from your eyeball scan. As all science fiction fans know, however, the genre is not about technology but about ideas. The big idea for Minority Report is based on a short story by the venerable Philip K. Dick. In this future, there is a ""pre-crime"" unit in the police force, which revolves around three psychics who are able to see violent crimes before they occur. These visions are projected in a flat screen panel and manipulated by detectives with the grace of a symphony conductor. Equipped with futuristic stun guns, jet packs, and search robots, these cops then arrest and intern the criminals before the crimes are committed.We learn all this in the first ten minutes of the movie. After this introduction, the plot really starts when Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) finds out that the precogs saw him kill someone, someone that he has never met. He finds himself in a race. With the forced recruitment of a precog, Agatha (Samantha Morton), he must clear his name before the predetermined murder. All the while, his old buddies, now helped with a special agent from the FBI (Colin Farrell), are trying to track him down.Spielberg, with Janusz Kaminski, his cinematographer for many films, have crafted a visually stunning movie. The special effects are seamlessly incorporated of the world they created. The muted blues echo the style of black & white film noirs. John Anderton is similar to noir's morally ambiguous characters--a good cop with an illegal habit that is forced (by circumstances and desire) to betray the very things he loves.But this is not just a special effects or mystery movie. The characters, all well drawn, are supremely acted by the cast. Tom Cruise is a good physical actor and he shows it here. By the way he sits or walks, we can intuit the grief and confusion that's going through him. Samantha Morton does a good job of portraying a haunted young lady who has seen too much. Colin Farrell skillfully balances the ambitious and professional sides of his character. As always, Max von Sydow authoritatively plays the respected father figure.This is one of my favorite Science Fiction films. I would also recommend the following films. These (I think) influenced Minority Report.""The Maltese Falcon"" ~ film noir ""A Clockwork Orange"" ~ science fiction ""Blade Runner"" ~ science fiction (also based on a Dick story)***** out of *****",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Amazing concept well made by master filmmaker,"It's 2054. Crime has been virtually eliminated from Washington D.C. area due to the Department of Precrime. They use three Pre-cogs to predict future crimes and arrest the criminals before any crime actually happens. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) investigates the precrimes. However one day, the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will murder and the system is now coming after him. He kidnaps the most powerful pre-cog Agatha (Samantha Morton) and discovers a flaw in the system. Federal agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is on the manhunt as Anderton tries to prove he's innocent of a crime he's yet to commit.The concept of free will vs determinism from Philip K. Dick is amazing. The production from Steven Spielberg is terrific. The movie is so well made that it maintains its tension with all the crazy ideas being thrown at the audience. Tom Cruise is the perfect protagonist for this movie. He has a touch of that boy scout with a dark edge. He matches the intensity of the material. There is a good mystery, compelling performances, and expertly made all growing out of a great story. It does wrap up a little too neatly. I'm not sure a Spielberg movie could have gone that dark.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
A rare dose of true brilliance,"In the year 2054, Washington DC is run by a new type of crime fighting system - PreCrime. Using sophisticated computer and neural technology, the police are warned of crimes that will occur (via ""previsions"") in the future and they try to stop them. With a 100% success rate and no murder in their jurisdiction for the past six years the system looks flawless. A coming vote, which looks very hopeful for PreCrime, will instill the system nationwide. But when Chief John Anderton, a loyal and decorated PreCrime cop, is seen to be killing someone in one of the previsions he suspects that someone set him up and that not everything is as perfect as it has been made out to be.It doesn't happen very often that a big studio production with a big name star produces such a great movie. But here it is. Spielberg and his team have crafted an engrossing vision of the future that is not only good looking with its top-notch special effects, but thought provoking and actually interesting on a pure story level. Adapted from one of science fiction's cleverest authors the story is complex and thought provoking on many levels. Not only does it get you thinking about the possibilities where the film can and cannot go, but it will get you thinking about what you yourself actually do.The direction is also among Spielberg's best with a terrific pace and nail biting tension in some scenes that almost recalls Hitchcock. Backed up, of course, by a great score from John Williams. The movie's vision is also great - the whole futuristic world is shown in what are not just money/eye candy shots, but shots that really place you in the film's world and take you for a terrifically exciting ride. Also of note is Peter Stormare, who has a brilliant, but brief, appearance as a whacko surgeon.One of the best science fiction films to come out of Hollywood in a long while. 10/10Rated PG-13 for violence",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Minority Report,"Minority Report is a scuzzy futuristic action thriller based on a short story by Philip K Dick.John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is law enforcer in a pioneering Pre Crime unit in Washington D.C. He catches murderers before they commit the crime thanks to some psychics called Precogs who can see these future crimes.Anderton is an ace cop who is also part Judge Dredd. He he also takes drugs. The after effects of losing his son in an abduction that resulted in his marriage crumbling.Murder rate has gone down in DC and the system is about to go national under the leadership of Director Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow.) Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is the Federal agent who arrives to examine the system. He is sceptical and is also out to get Anderton.Anderton's world falls apart when Precogs saw a vision of him killing a man that he does not know. Now his colleagues wants to arrest him. Anderton needs to see if the system of pre crimes he believed in has any flaws. He thinks Witwer has set him up.Steven Spielberg after his second Best Director Oscar win attempts to be a different type of filmmaker. Eschewing Ridley Scott's dark neon look of Blade Runner. He has gone for washed out colours and hi tech. Characters get tailored adverts but it also allows the film company to introduce product placements. Some of the brands ain't going to make it into 2054.Minority Report is also a murder mystery with religious symbolisms. The three Precogs are seen as religious deities by some. One man immediately kneels and starts to confess his sins when he sees one.The screenplay also plays around the ideas of Isaac Asimov. What if this perfect system have flaws and it can be exploited?The movies works better as a sci fi mystery thriller. I just felt that the action sequences were tagged on, allowing for Tom Cruise to run like a rabbit. The clever scene was when one of the Precogs Agatha (Samantha Morton) guides Anderton in the mall.However there are a few weak links in the narrative which resorts to cliches. Witwer begins to have doubts about Anderton's guilt but then he makes a clumsy error, surprisingly for someone who was also an experienced homicide cop. The comparisons to Judge Dredd makes the villain easy to guess.The ending was also a little too pat especially when the villain is publicly revealed but still gets to have a showdown with Anderton.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Interpretations,"It's the year 2054 and mankind through the good graces of pioneering criminologist Max Von Sydow we're about to abolish crime all together. Von Sydow employs three psychics, no doubt the three best in the world and while it looks life is a pretty dull thing for them, spending all that time in water the better to receive images they're doing yeoman service to mankind anticipating murders to come. Right at the beginning of the film we see them in action as police are dispatched to capture Arye Gross as he's about to murder his wife and her boy toy.But some disturbing images come in regarding police chief Tom Cruise murdering a man who he doesn't even know. Now Cruise is a Richard Kimble like fugitive and he hasn't done the terrible deed he's supposed to do. But one of the water bound psychics turns in a different interpretation of the images she sees. It's that Minority Report that Cruise is interested in so Samantha Morton is taken by Tom who wants very much to find out what's going so he can alter his destiny if possible.I won't say more other than destinies can be altered and images can be manipulated and wrongly interpreted by some malevolent forces at work.Cruise and Von Sydow and the rest of the cast turn in some fine performances for Steven Spielberg. And Spielberg's own vision of the future is fascinating. I did love those images of horses making a comeback as a method of transportation. I'm guessing that fossil fuels had polluted the planet enough and we wanted biodegradable waste once again.Science fiction is always interesting, even the worst future films offer us someone's vision of the future be Steven Spielberg or Ed Wood. Spielberg at least has the talent to bring it off.And maybe crime prevention taken to its ultimate is not such a good thing.

Dick's Paranoia Watered Down to Hollywood Chase Flick,"I went to see ""Minority Report"" as a Philip Dick fan, not for Tom Cruise.As soon as I heard he was cast, I knew he was either mis-cast or the movie would substantially change the original story. Ed Harris would have been a brilliant choice for Dick's intent in showing a mid-life crisis of faith with bureaucracy, and more logically setting up the conflict with his older (Max von Sydow as his usual craggy self) and younger (terrifically aggressive Colin Farrell) competitors.In Dick's story the titular discovery is a shocking revelation of the bankruptcy of policy-making behind bureaucratic intent, whereas here it's just a means to an end for Cruise's character to clear his name. Instead we get an action story that grafts Dick's story outline onto a tribute to George Lucas's brilliant student thesis project ""THX-1138,"" which he himself later expanded into a feature film; I always cite those films as the best visual analysis of bureaucracy. I guess Spielberg wasn't satisfied that we never really knew what the politics were in Lucas's films so he provides explicit reasons via a personal rather than systemic conspiracy theory for the chase and an optimistic conclusion.On its own, we get a rippling Hollywood chase movie with a soupcon of the old ""The X Files"" paranoia, now newly relevant about our Justice Dept. arresting people, and even several laughs.The cinematography for the future is wonderfully metallic and there's so many clever CGI's that the long credits list three ""in memoriam""s to colleagues.Lois Smith is very effective as a cynical inventor, reminding me of the last time an older woman made a key appearance in a sci fi epic, ""Outland"" in a role not necessarily written for a woman.John Williams's music is interferingly bombastic.(originally written 7/5/2002)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Dark Spielberg,"Steven Spielberg continues to channel the late Stanley Kubrick in his latest film, ""Minority Report.""

Minority Report dazzles with it's visuals, great action scenes, urgent story-line, and topical issues.  To say any more would give too much away.  This is unlike any Spielberg film to date.  Not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Action/thriller with Signature Highlights from Spielberg to Cruise,"Minority Report is the latest film from Stephen Spielberg that stars Tom Cruise as a cop from the year 2054, who works in the pre-crime division of the Washington D.C police department. The division's ability to stop murders before they happen is based on the psychic ability of three people who were mutant byproducts of a failed genetic program designed to help babies born from drug-dependent mothers. Cruise's character, John Anderton, is motivated by the loss of his own son, who was abducted and murdered six years earlier. Accordingly, he's a strong supporter of the controversial program, whose opponents feel it could potentially make an error and people might be wrongfully convicted, if not potentially rehabilitated. That action begins when Anderton is identified as a future killer, and he hits the road running. This may sound a little like The Fugitive, but in this case, you don't know if the man on the run is--or, rather, will be--guilty.Based on a short story by futurist Phillip K. Dick, author of Blade Runner, the atmosphere of a dark world with high technology having gotten out of hand, almost as though it snuck up on us without our knowing, remains the theme. To remind us that we aren't controlled by technology, but are nonetheless overrun by it, there are frequent references to current-day familiarities, such as department stores and restaurants, such as The Gap and McDonalds, where impressively entertaining high-tech mass marketing gadgets know what you've purchased before and offer new suggestions for consideration. (Sounds like a visit to amazon.com?) Spielberg lightens up the tone with his signature wit and humorous quips and visuals now and then, as opposed to Ridley Scott's more serious and consistently dark visualization portrayed in Blade Runner.As a plotline, Minority Report is intelligent, has a good consistent flow, isn't always predictable (at least not that long before it happens), has many twists and turns with legitimate dead-ends, and above all, tells a plausible story (even if the basic premise itself requires considerable suspension of disbelief). As Anderton begins to unravel the true story about the corruption behind the pre-crime program, he is lead even further towards his destination as predicted by the `pre-cognitives' who predicted his crime. To tell any more of the story would disclose too much; besides, it isn't necessary. You know all you need to know here.The best parts of the movie are so good  from the high-tech special effects to the light-hearted humorous moments to the good, steady flow of the action and plotline  that the problems with the film are easily forgiven. That said, my main gripe is the presumption that, in the future, anyone convicted of a crime before it happens is immediately sent to a state of suspended animation, an alternative form of the death penalty. This is obviously one of the main sources of controversy within the storyline, but anyone can see that, in almost all cases, the predicted murders were not premeditated, if not potentially accidental, in which case, psychological counseling and some form of probation would be enough. There's nothing to suggest in the film that the context is a police state, which would allow the premise to make sense. Yet, so much of the movie is based on this premise, that may be bothersome to the discerning viewer. There are many such similar oversimplifications, each of which could be quite easily solved with a minor change or a quick dialog line or two, hence a mild sense of sloppiness in direction.Still, in the end, these didn't bother me that much. I still had a great time, and enjoyed it as the frivolous and wonderfully playful action/thriller it was intended to be.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"One of the rare, great science fiction movies","It's an open secret: the Oscar is jinxed.  Spielberg's triumph with ""Schindler's List"" was followed by the longest hiatus of his career, which was broken with ... ""Jurassic Park II"", a lifeless sequel of the kind you'd once have sworn he'd never make - the single worst and most anonymous movie he's ever directed (""Hook"" had its moments).  His next two films were improvements (there was nowhere to go but up): the first anonymous but not bad (""Amistad""), the second bad but not anonymous (""Saving Private Ryan""), but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after ""Schindler's List"" that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with ""A.I."" in 2001).But he's well and truly back now, and I'm happy.  I've even learned to welcome it when he makes decisions which infuriate me, so long as he makes them with the right kind of self-assured arrogance.  I didn't like the voice-over at the end (we didn't need to be told that stuff; we could have worked it out), or the way he caved in to the modern tendency to be needlessly revolting (at least he don't play his gross-out moments for cheap laughs), or even the style of photography (it's easy to manipulate us into thinking the future is a grim place, if you push-process the film until even the images which in the normal course of events would be luscious and rich, are grimy and desaturated - there are other ways of getting colourless images, as Spielberg well knows, and many of them are better).  Yet, in the end, big deal.  The story is a knockout, the action is taut, the future rich, dazzling and believable.  Spielberg is to be particularly congratulated on how completely he has avoided the unimaginative dystopia of ""Blade Runner"".  The future we see here is a MIX of dream and nightmare, so convincing a mix that we can't always tell them apart.Here's a measure of how good the movie is: in an interview, Spielberg revealed that he completely misunderstood the issues which drive the stories - and there's simply no way of telling this from the finished product. Unless Spielberg was just opportunistically latching on to the hook forced on him by a dim-witted journalist, he THOUGHT the movie was about how much freedom we are willing to give up in exchange for safety (in order to prevent terrorist attacks, for instance).  This is interpretation is strained.  Three people (the precogs) do indeed give up their freedom in order that millions of other people may be safer, and yes, there is an issue here.  When one of the Crime Prevention officer says, ""It's best not to think of them as human"", I was surprised to find myself nodding in agreement.  The benefits of the system are so great that OF COURSE I'd rather not look too closely into the burden that must be borne by three - just three - individuals.  Aside from the three unfortunate precogs, nobody is asked to give up any freedom at all.  (Except, of course, the freedom to commit murder.  But under the law we are already unfree to commit murder, and a good thing too.)The interesting issues that DO fall naturally out of the story concern the futility of revenge.  After people who would otherwise have committed murder are prevented from doing so, they're sent to prison anyway, presumably on the grounds that that's what they deserve - and no doubt it IS what they deserve.  But it's clear enough that locking these people up, however much it may be in the interests of justice, serves no purpose.  It's exacting revenge on criminals for the sake of exacting revenge - which is exactly what the U.S. justice system is committed to doing at the moment, which is why the future is a realistic one.  (Apart from the precognition, that is.) Anderton's mistake is to believe in the value of revenge, and he's never more admirable than when he realises his mistake.  (THAT was a great scene; it's a pity I can't tell you exactly why.  Suffice it to say that when we think we know where the story's going, we may indeed know where the story's going - but Spielberg is only allowing us to see so much of what's coming up in order to obscure the rest of it.)The final sign that Spielberg is again at his peak lies in the performances. They're all good.  Tom Cruise's weakness as an actor is that he is only ever as good as his director, and the fact that he's so good here means that ""Minority Report"" was directed by the real Spielberg, the old Spielberg, the Spielberg with the same ability Charles Dickens had to make even his most grotesque creations, and even his LEAST grotesque, come to life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Good, but very, very flawed","Steven Spielberg has made a couple of clunkers in his career, that's for sure. When sitting through Hook or The Lost World: Jurassic Park II, it's difficult to believe that the same man who made Jaws or E.T. or Close Encounters had a hand in them. Most of Spielberg's output, though, has been fantastic. Despite the occasional 1941, his films, even when flawed, soar above the average film. Minority Report falls into the category of fantastic and soaring, yet deeply flawed.Minority Report is, above all else, an enormously entertaining film. I personally like actioners and thrillers and sci-fi, and Minority Report fits well into all these categories. There are a couple of action set pieces that are simply amazing, like the chase through the car factory or the spider scene. Unfortunately, in the idea department, the film is kind of a dud. Critics have immediately pointed to the politics of today to show how prescient Minority Report is, but no matter how large and powerful the intelligence industry gets I seriously don't believe that we'll ever live in a world where, even if it were possible to predict crime, law enforcement could arrest someone for a crime they were about to commit. And then, without a trial, apparently, they not only imprison the pre-perpetrators, but they encase them in suspended animation goo, apparently forever. At least they never say whether these prisoners are ever to be released. I mean, what happened to correctional institutions! And, what's worse, almost every perpetrator chooses to murder for reasons of passion since everyone knows that it's impossible to commit premeditated murder. That means that a man who was about to stab his wife and her lover with a pair of scissors - a horrific but understandable crime - is doomed to never see the light of day again (apparently). And I haven't even mentioned the time frame: this story takes place in just over 50 years from now. It specifically states that the ACLU still exists. Perhaps if the film took place a hundred and fifty years from now and the ACLU had been disbanded or something (with some heavy explanations in that department), I may have bought the story. The screenwriters never come close to making the situation believable.And even if it weren't so unbelievable, the film has dozens of flaws besides that, and several poor, not very well thought out scenes. For example, the crimes are predicted by three psychics whose origins are dubiously explained. Part of the plot of the film is that this Pre-Crime department is supposed to expand nation-wide. The three pre-cogs are supposed to be the only ones alive, so where are they going to get others to predict the murders of every other city in the United States? These three only cover Washington D.C. I assume they aren't going to now cover the entire country (and soon, the world!). Okay, so maybe more exist. Perhaps I misunderstood that part of the exposition (which is generally very bad in this film). But if these three cover a populace only as big as the capital, they're going to need hundreds if not thousands of pre-cogs, and the three that they show in the movie seem to be so important and irreplaceable that the logistics of the project seem completely unfeasible. Then there's a scene where Tom Cruise kidnaps one of the pre-cogs to help him avoid the murder that he is accused of having been about to commit. First of all, you must know that the three pre-cogs are kept in a sort of sensory-deprivation chamber where they are suspended in a vat of liquid nutrients that is supposed to foster their psychic abilities. So Cruise kidnaps Agatha the pre-cog and escapes from the authorities in a ridiculous manner (there's apparently a drain in the bottom of the pool big enough for two people to slide down; the Pre-Crime division must have a hell of a time preventing the pre-cogs from accidentally being flushed in the first place!). Agatha, for the first time in a long while, begins to exist in the present. Then there's this scene in the mall, where she is able to protect Cruise by predicting every second of what's going to happen. She couldn't even do anything near this in the nutrient bath, and even there she could only see one thing: murders; but outside of it she sees every single thing that's ever going to happen. It just doesn't make any sense. And then there are the poorly calculated scenes. The scene with Peter Stormare (Fargo) as a black market surgeon makes little sense. It's completely ridiculous and also rather foul. The writers set up a whole history for this character, but don't follow up on it at all. And Cruise's whole backstory is very lame. Has every single individual who works for any law enforcement body had a child or wife who was murdered?All the good stuff in Minority Report is technical. It's often beautifully done. Spielberg's direction is often fantastic. The set designs are miraculous - it would be insulting if it didn't get nominated for an Oscar in this department - as is the cinematography (a very beautiful, bleached look). The acting I would rate as merely adequate. Tom Cruise's character is not developed well enough, and therefore the performance isn't anything special. Max von Sydow, as nice as it is to see him in a summer blockbuster, has a very stereotypical role. Tim Blake Nelson (O Brother, Where Art Thou?), as Gideon, the warden of all the criminal tubes, should have been axed. Nelson is totally wrong for the movie. The only great performance in the film comes from Samantha Morton, who plays Agatha. She is amazing at times.Many critics have praised this, saying that it's a great rebound after the failure of A.I. That's so incredibly insulting. A.I. is by far the superior of the two. Overall, Minority Report is a fun movie when you're watching it, but the more I think about it, the more my opinion shrinks. I give it a 7/10. Good entertainment, far too many flaws to even count. I think I could go on for days pointing them out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"""I have to know. I have to find out what happened to my life.""","I've tried to watch this a couple times now and even with a top cast, Spielberg directing and great special effects I still found it a slog to get into. Its just kind of dull and meandering. Towards the end it finally came together for me, I got into the conspiracy and unique plot, also at this point Tom Cruise starts running for his life and Cruise + running never fails. He's good and gives his all to the role.Story goes; Its 2054, Cruise is a cop in a hi-tech pre crime unit. He goes on the run after being labeled as a future killer by the psychic ""Cogs."" In order to prove his innocence he kidnaps one of them who predicted his imminent crime.Notes; This didn't ever feel like Spielberg movie, why has it been filmed entirely in fuzzy blue tones? Colin Ferrell... I didn't see that coming, cool gadgets, the surgery sequence is neat but very weird, the ""cogs"" have gotten annoying fast, why are they living in a pool? How can they live submerged in water indefinitely? Eyeball gags also got old fast; rolling down the hallway and falling through the grate, just silly.Overall a good sci-fi crime thriller but I wouldn't watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
I always loved this movie,"This is a movie I adored when I watched it as a kid when it came out in 2002. I came back to it a couple more times and saw that the film lost absolutely nothing, on the contrary, it seems to me that it has gained in value. Great winning combo by Spielberg, Cruise and Williams. Visually the film looks incredibly good, even 19 years after the film still looks extremely fresh, the CGI effects are perfect. Our possible future (the plot is in 2054) seems so real and achievable (I repeat, the film is from 2002). Cruise gave the film one of his better roles thanks to the script as well. His character is not some perfect positivist who will save the day but he is a layered character with his good but also bad sides, gloomy past and dubious future. Also the film does not have the expected and straightforward action like some solid average action blockbuster but brings twists to the film, gives a clever story, but also poses a moral dilemma. The only objections to the film go because of some scenes that seem unnecessary to me and that they have absolutely no impact on the story, as well as the relatively expected ending where everything ends in a positive tone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Entertaining blockbuster,"Great concept, one with themes of predeterminism vs. free will, as well as the use of advanced technology to fight crime with the drawbacks of loss of privacy and potential for abuse. There are some pretty cool moments, but overall it's flawed in execution; you'll have to suspend disbelief too many times, and there are lots of groan-inducing moments. Maybe the biggest one for me is Tom Cruise's character weepily saying ""I want him back so bad"" in a scene about his son, and there are several others where Spielberg should have trusted his actors to deliver emotions nonverbally, instead of having them say cheesy lines.For my taste, the film would have been better pared down and darker both visually and in tone. Think of what it could have been if it had focused more on the weightier philosophical or police state aspects, as opposed to settling for the sentimentality of a personal story amidst an excessive number of plot twists. Think of the possibilities for an ending with either a skyrocketing murder rate or an injustice, something ambiguous or chilling. Think of what it might have been like delivered ala Blade Runner (1982), which was also based on a Philip K. Dick story.With that said, Spielberg targets a blockbuster popcorn movie and there's a certain appeal to that, and it's reasonably entertaining. I also loved seeing 73-year-old Max von Sydow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Big ideas and action film is worth it, even being dense and overly long","""Minority Report"" (2002 release; 146 min.) brings the story of Chief John Aderton. As the movie opens, we are at the ""Department of Precrime, Washington, DC"", and Aderton and his team are getting ready to make an intervention to stop a double homicide from happening before it does. It's a close call, but with seconds to go, Aderton arrives at the house and stops the perpetrator-to-be. We then learn that the Precrime program started 6 years ago and not a single murder has happened in DC since then. It's now 2054 and a national referendum on Precrime is set to take place soon... At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this Steven Spielberg-Tom Cruise collaboration is nearing its 20th anniversary. I saw the movie when it came out in theaters but haven't seen it since, and the other day I watched it again. I had forgotten many of the plot points, and frankly it was almost like seeing it again as if for the first time. What struck me is that the movie wants to be both a movie of big ideas (which it certainly is) and an action movie (which it is at time), at the same time. This makes for some awkward back-and-forth. Second, the movie's plot is dense, frankly too dense. There are so many side bars that it's hard to keep track of them all. It also leads for the movie to be overly long. There is no reason this needs to be 2 1/2 hrs. On the other hand, I was surprise dhow well the movie holds up being technologically relevant after almost 2 decades. And I was also amazed how similar the overall tone is between this film and :Blade Runner 2049"", which takes place just a few years before this (and both of course are based on Philip Dick short stories).As mentioned, I saw it the other day on Showtime. I certainly don't regret seeing it again, but neither was I blown away. Still, if you are into science fiction or are simply a fan of Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Slow to Start, Electric until the End","Whilst slow to begin with, Minority Report builds into an absolutely epic sci-fi adventure. The premise is interesting for sure, but to begin with the now-dated effects and backdrop hinder what would ultimately become an excellent plot. As it progresses it's complex but explained well without spelling anything out to you. The twists come thick and fast towards the end and after what can only be described as the first climax, your attention is really grabbed, you're kept guessing until the end.Acting cannot be complained about for anyone, and Cruise was the perfect casting for the lead. Again, the only thing that is needed is patience, as the story breaks out of what initially just looks like 'Future Mission Impossible'.The only thing which takes you out of the moment a little is the CGI/effects. It's always difficult to get any level of accuracy when predicting the future in film, but still the cops look a bit taccy and daft. Everything is that little bit too perfect which feels like a 1970s imagining, and relies too heavily on CGI.However, as far as adaptations of Philip K Dick's work go, this is right up there with Blade Runner, and for me it exceeds it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Should have been much better...,"This was an enjoyable movie, but ultimately disappointing because it should have been a truly memorable film.Steven Spielberg should simply steer clear of any story that contains the slightest element of film noir.  His directing style is completely unsuited to this type of project.  This movie careens wildly between noir imagery and heartstring-tugging sentimentalism, between stylish action sequences and bubble-gum.  It never builds any lasting tension.  It never takes the time to revel in its glorious futurish sets.  The camera rarely steps back from its claustrophobic POV to give us a sense of atmosphere.  Spielberg is always more interested in pushing his viewers' emotional buttons than in creating a coherent work of art.  This impulse serves him well when making family-oriented movies, but it has haunted him in his recent efforts to make serious adult-minded films.To the extent that ""Minority Report"" succeeds in engaging us, it owes a great debt to its source material.  Phillip K. Dick's short story, upon which the movie is based, was one of his classic brain-teasers.  In the future, murders can be predicted in advance and prevented... but only if people are willing to cede many cherished safeguards of freedom to a creepily totalitarian government agency.  It's a thought-provoking concept that the movie fleshes out fairly nicely... until a completely unnecessary and haphazardly tacked-on ending sequence opens up mile-wide plot holes and dilutes the impact of Dick's message.This film worked best when it stepped away from its narrow storyline and engaged us with its its vision of 2053 America.  The billboards which scan people's retinas and deliver individually-tailored ad pitches were a nice Orwellian touch.  The oddball side characters (especially Peter Stormare as a creepy black-market eye surgeon) lent a unique character to the movie. The cyberpunkish set design was generally quite good.  Unfortunately, the strengths of ""Minority Report"" were consistently undercut by its uneven direction and the weaknesses in the script.This is what happens when a good film gets Spielberged.I think most people will enjoy this movie, just don't set your expectations too high.  And don't think too hard about how much better it could have been in the hands of a truly edgy and daring filmmaker.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
The PreCrime Police,"In 2054, the PreCrime Police Department commanded by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) reduces the crime rates in the violent Washington to zero, using a system based on three humans called Precogs designed by Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith) to the company owned by Director Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow). Anderton is addicted in drugs since her lost his son in a swimming pool and separated from his wife Lara Lara Clarke (Kathryn Morris) and was recruited by Burgess to run the department. The Precogs are mutants led by Agatha (Samantha Morton) and capable to foresee crimes in the near future. The agent from the Department of Justice Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) comes to PreCrime to audit the system and out of the blue, the PreCogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder. He flees and becomes a fugitive while he tries to prove that he is innocent. But is the system fallible?""Minority Report"" is an intriguing Sci-Fi film based on a short story by Phillip K. Dick and directed by Steven Spielberg. The plot is based on the debate between free will and the philosophical determinism, reflected by Burgess' dilemma in the end of the movie. The happy ending is satisfactory and commercial. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Minority Report: A Nova Lei"" (""Minority Report: The New Law"")",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Interesting SciFi-Action-Thriller,"I was curious to see Minority Report mostly because I was curious to see how someone like Spielberg would handle this type of material. I guess he handled it as expected - the bad guys were bad but not really all that evil. The visuals and score/sound were rock solid. It has a lot of teeth but not quite as much bite all those teeth would suggest. Still, the story was solid and some of the affects, (spiders) were pretty cool. One discovery from Minority Report for me was Colin Farrell. This was the first time I've seen him on film and he was good, as was Tom Cruise and of course Max Von Sydow delivered too. I feel Minority Report was a little light on the scifi and more on the thriller/action genre but either way it was a fun viewing and worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
My 100th review!!!,"For my 100th review it could not of gotten any better than this. Minority Report proves when Tom Cruise keeps his out-landish behaviour to him-self why he is probably one of the best actors to come out of the past century. From the surface Minority Report seems to come across as a super futuristic action thriller but once you check it out you come to the realisation that nothing is what it seems as this is a story with a lot of complex human emotion rolled into it with lots of philosophical arguments on both sides which all in shows both sides of the coin and what it feels like for the hunter to become hunted. The acting was completely flawless from all corners whether it be Cruise, Farrell or Sydow with a pacey story which wastes no time and plenty of twists, turns to keep you moving and guessing. Words are not really that are used to describe Minority Report because it tends to open it-self up like a flower and one has to watch it for him-self . To conclude put Minority report on your '100 films to watch before I die list' as it is one of those movies which will make you think after its done my only complaint was that it was just a little bit too long but the film kept on moving at a quick enough pace and there was quite a bit to take in but the arguments presented to you in this movie really make one wonder what is moral and what is not giving the situation of the world we live in.MINORITY REPORT : 9 OUT 10IN THE WORLD OF THE BLIND , THE ONE EYED MAN IS KING!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Try not to see the holes,"Knowing the pedigree of this film (original concept by Phillip K. Dick and directed by Steven Spielburg) I had some pretty high hopes for it. Sure, I could see that it was an action vehicle for Tom Cruise, but Minority Report followed a recent Hollywood trend of hiring supporting good actors for action movies, so I knew that everything wasn't going to rest on Cruise's acting shoulders. The previews also showed an interesting set-up, so I had some high hopes for this film. Having seen it, my opinion of Minority Report is this:It is a good film providing you don't think about it.Once you start to think about it, you start uncovering plot holes of varying sizes. And every plot hole niggles away at the premise of the film. The pacing of Minority Report is such that you probably won't have time to think about the plot holes as the scenes flash by and you are distracted by the gadgets and narrative twists. Once you leave the cinema, you'll start to go, ""Hey, what about...?"" and the credibility of Minority Report will drop.I can appreciate that adapting a short story for a feature film is hard and that social metaphysics often don't translate well in action films. But for every review that mentions Bladerunner in the same breath as Minority Report, consider that this appears to be Spielburg's Bladerunner, where even the dark and dingy areas of the District of Colombia (the film's setting) appear sanitised.  Where Bladerunner contained a number of metaphysical issues about the nature of humanity, Minority Report adds in a cool looking gadget. The issue of Precrime (stopping murder before it happens) is brushed over with no discussion of substance - it exists, just accept it.Minority Report does require a huge suspension of disbelief on behalf of the audience to maintain its credibility. This suspension is aided by the fast pacing of the narrative and by very good acting performances (Samantha Morton as Agatha and Max Von Sydow are great to watch). But as soon as you start to think about it...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Reasonably Good Sci Fi,"A great deal must have been spent on this film. I was hesitant at first. For one thing, the whole issue of prior restraint, that 1984 sort of thought police thing. It's also dependent on a unique group of young people who are being exploited for their visions. When they realize that a murder is going to be committed, they produce a little ball with the name of the perpetrator on it. This is a bit odd. It seems they could have come up with a little different way of presenting this. If one thinks too much, this all falls apart, but if we are going to enjoy, we need to dive in and accept this. It moves along at a nice pace and provides reasonable satisfaction at the conclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Bland and predictable,"This unimpressive science fiction film has an interesting premise, but ultimately fails to deliver anything more than an average cinematic experience. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, an expert cop in the field of pre-crime. Pre-crime is a method of catching criminals before they commit murder through the use of psychics. The society has been using this technology for some time and crime rates are at an all time low. Ironically he discovers that he will commit a murder in about a day, and the movie follows him as he tries to determine what will lead to this impending act, all the while his fellow comrades are hunting him down. It is a fascinating premise, but it just did not pull me in like other science fiction movies, such as `The Matrix'. The futuristic designs are impressive, and the acting is okay, but there was not enough to keep me immersed in the film due to the underdeveloped characters. Most of their actions and their motivations did not make any sense, and the plot seemed designed only to provide twists. It is almost like the writers thought of the plot twists before anything else, and then wrote the rest of the movie around them. It did make me think about the possible moral issues that would be raised if such a system crime was used to put people in jail, but the movie merely skimmed over these issues. Overall it was an okay film, but the plot twists were somewhat silly, and it dragged on because of pointless subplots.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

"""The question you have to ask is what are you going to do now?""","Minority Report (2002) -Tom Cruise's character Chief John Anderton was another one of his typical cocky, arrogant ones that was hard to take and he talked really fast at times.And I love him, but Colin Farrell was too young for his part of Policeman Danny Witwer. The part needed the gravitas of a more proven older actor.The story however was really clever, another of Philip K. Dick's interesting ideas about the dystopian futures that we could find ourselves living in, especially with a world as crazy as it is now.In some ways it was a bit like a precognitive 'The Fugitive' (1993) or any of those films where the wrongly accused goes out of their way to prove their innocence, whilst, certainly in this case, beating the crap out of their friends and co-workers and breaking loads of other laws to prove their innocence, regardless of public safety and collateral damage.And it was a film that was quite clearly paid for by a number of sponsors - Bulgari, Lexus, Gap and Guinness to name but a few. There logos were plastered throughout the film, but in a way that showed humans up for their consumerist attitudes and a possible direction for marketing to be driven at us with even more intrusive methods than ""Cookies"" and so on.The story made the point that even in the most safe and secure societies with crimes being stoppable before they're committed, corruption and interference can still take place at the highest of levels, which was a horrible indictment of human nature and it's worst attributes, but it delivered it in a new and polished way, using Dick's intelligent plot and Spielberg's practiced style.The volumes of the backing music track versus the casts vocals was terrible however and I had to keep turning the volume up and down to deal with that. I sometimes wonder if the filmmaker ever thinks about how well a production might work on a smaller screen without HD speakers or whether they just think about the Dolby surround sound, etc of a cinema, because the balance is often out of sync.There was also a scene with some milk and a sandwich that I really could have done without and sadly will live in my head rent free for a long time. There were little touches like that which clearly came from the source novel, but could have been omitted for a more general appeal and accessibility to a younger audience.It's a good film, but not great and it might benefit from a reboot/remake with a more advanced and thoughtful film making process available that could enable an artistic, considered and enlightened emotional viewing experience more akin to this films time setting and less about glossy filters and shouty Cruise.685.39/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"A ""Minor"" Success for Spielberg","Preventative maintenance can go a long way in getting a lot of extra miles out of that new car, and without question, applying the same principles to health care can add years to your life.  That's what `prevention' is all about; averting disaster and tragedy by taking measures to stop it before it happens.  It's certainly not a unique concept, by any means (at least when it comes to things like cars and health care), but what about in terms of crime?  Murder, for example; can there possibly be a way to anticipate and prevent even that?  It's a proposition that director Steven Spielberg addresses in `Minority Report,' a drama/thriller set in the near future, in which a kind of `HMO for Crime' has been established that does just that:  A system that unerringly predicts and prevents murder.  But just how accurate is it, really?  Can such an operation be infallible beyond any doubt? That-- as they say-- is the question.In Washington D.C., 2054, a `PreCrime' unit has been in operation for some six years now, under the leadership of Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow).  Using a system whereby murder can be detected before it happens-- and thus averted-- the unit has successfully eliminated that particular crime in the D.C. area.  One of the driving forces behind it all is Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise), who has something of a vested interest in making this system work:  Just before the inception of this revolutionary unit, Anderton suffered a tragedy in his own life; the kind of tragedy he hopes that no one else will ever have to endure again because of their efforts here.Anderton's unit has been something of a prototype, however, and with the success rate they have enjoyed, the U.S. government is interested in taking the project nationwide.  But they want to look a little deeper into the operation first, and so agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is dispatched to investigate and root out any potential flaws that may have been overlooked on the local level.  Burgess and Anderton maintain that the system is infallible, but then something happens-- Anderton himself is `seen' committing a murder in the near future.  And it's going to happen in about thirty-six hours...With films like `Schindler's List' and `Saving Private Ryan,' Steven Spielberg has long since established himself as one of the `Greats' among film directors.  Much of his success comes from the fact that he likes to tell stories about `people,' and he always manages to find the human element within the story that make his films so engaging.  Even the best filmmaker, however, is not going to produce a work of genius every time out; just as within every human being there is `good' cholesterol and `bad' cholesterol, so it must be with the films of an artist of Spielberg's magnitude-- it is natural that his resume will include both.  And this film-- which, without question is a good film-- is just not as compelling as some of his previous efforts.  One of the reasons, I think, is that it is an inherently dark tale, and Spielberg is by nature too positive to take it to the depths that would have really made it emotionally absorbing.As good as Spielberg is at exploring the complexities of human nature, he tends to get distracted by the environment within he must work to tell certain stories (like this one).  He seems to have an innate aversion to things too dark, at which times he seems to turn to the gadgets, toys and myriad F/X at his disposal for diversion, and quite frankly, his vision of the future in this film fails to evoke that necessary sense of disquiet or foreboding in the way that Ridley Scott did so successfully in `Blade Runner,' for example.  The `look' of this film is more `amusement park ride' than the gritty realism of Scott's film.  Compare and consider the differences between this film and `A.I' (another film with a dark, decidedly `non-Spielbergian' theme), and `E.T' and `Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'  The latter, while falling within the Sci-fi genre, are basically upbeat, positive stories, with `E.T.,' especially, focusing on the characters rather than-- or at least equal to-- the events as they occur. And nobody does a film like that better than Steven Spielberg.This film was written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, and If only Spielberg (and the screenwriters) had been more willing to embrace the dark side of this story, he may have been able to create the kind of suspense that made `Jaws' so on-the-edge-of-your-seat riveting.  But, again-- though this is a decent movie-- it simply is not the taut thriller it could have been, like Tony Scott's `Enemy of the State,' which in many ways is similar to this film.  There again, the sense of paranoia and suspense Tony Scott achieved with his film was due to the fact that he embraced the darkness and immersed himself (and his film) in it.As Anderton, Tom Cruise gives a convincing performance and (as evidenced in `Vanilla Sky') he is continuing to mature as an actor.  His trademark smile is there, of course, but he is relying on it less and less, which is helping him to develop his characters with more depth and detail, as he does here with his portrayal of Anderton.Max von Sydow, as usual, turns in a believable performance as Burgess, but the character is intrinsically stereotypical, and he simply isn't afforded the time to develop his portrayal much beyond that.The standout performances come from Colin Farrell, who lends some real nuance to his character and manages to make him truly three-dimensional; and from Samantha Morton, who creates the most emotionally involving character of the film with her portrayal of Agatha; and it's part of what makes `Minority Report' (like any Spielberg film-- even the `lesser' ones) worth the price of admission.  7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Another half-baked, cheezy, expensive Spielberg film","I really do not understand the critical acclaim this film is receiving. (I may give away some of the story, so only continue if you know it.)  It started big, and then fizzled away into nothing.  People claim that it is intellectual, that it makes you think-but I can't disagree more.  After A.I., Spielberg is now attempting to take the place in our cinematic world of Stanley Kubrick, stooping so low as to add a lame pastiche of Clockwork Orange.  Spielberg is not Kubrick, and this film is far from intellectual. The strands of the plot, such as the entire concept of the minority report, fizzle out and are not picked up again.  The correlation to the current terrorism problem is cute, but not really there.  This is a situation where people can actually see the future (and I might add that their ""slavery"" to this cause is also not addressed-the Pre-cogs are completely de-humanized into alien-like, pale-faced victims that are not really treated like victims).  At the end of the film I really didn't care about the girl whose mother was murdered by the leader of the Pre-Crime organization.  Sure, it was kind of cool to watch, but I think this is another Spielberg film that wows us with really cool effects, what turns out to be a cheesy plot, and the usual happy-dappy American ending.  I am constantly amazed at how Spielberg seems to fool the critics into thinking he is good, that he produces work that makes you think-when it never does.  Maybe if more Americans knew how to read.....",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
* * * * out of 4.,"The best film to date so far this year as of 8/02! This film is about a John (Tom Cruise) who is haunted by the disappearance of his young son many years ago. To cope with the grief he works at a crime pervanetion network founded by Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow) that can predict murders and stop them before they occur. However, one day while at work Tom Cruise is shocked to discover that it is saying he will be the next person to try and commit murder. John thinks that an agent named Danny  (Colin Farrell) who is investigating the the unit is trying to set him up. To add to the problems, the person John is accused of trying to murder is a person he does not even know and it says John will kill him in 48 hours.Fast paced, exciting and deeply moving & thought provoking film. Tom Crusie does good work here. Colin turns in a deliciously nasty performance. However the film belongs to Max Von Sydow who is absolutely genius here. Director Speilberg treats the audience to some highly original and creative visual effects and has presented us with a fun story that covers all the bases. The ending is especially good.Rated PG-13; Violence and Profanity.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Great sci-fi thriller,"This film is an intelligent sci-fi murder mystery with a twist... we know who the victim is, we know who the killer is but neither we nor the killer have the faintest idea why the killing will take place. Set in a future where the future can be seen by three ""pre-cogs"" murder is a thing of the past as the would be killers are arrested before they can commit their crimes. One day the head of this police department has terrifying shock when the pre-cogs tell him there is going to be a murder and he will be the killer.From then on the hunter becomes the hunted as Chief John Anderton must run from his own officers to determine why he is destined to kill a stranger before they can incarcerate him. He is never fully sure who he can and can't trust and only has thirty six hours to find out if his destiny is truly written.The acting is pretty good with Tom Cruise being believable as the fugitive police officer, however the best performance comes from Samantha Morton in the role of Agatha; the pre-cog who Anderton turns to for help and who in turn seeks his help in solving an old case. Steven Spielberg did a fin job directing this. Using just the right amount of special effects he never lets the story be overshadowed by explosions and excessive CGI. When I first watched it I wasn't too sure about the washed out colours used in every scene apart from the few flashbacks it the more of the film I saw the more I thought they suited the tone of the film. If you are a fan of slightly dystopian science fiction I'd certainly recommend this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

A sci-fi milestone,"Science fiction is all about discussing the possible futures of humanity, and this is what Minority Report does perfectly well. The story may not be based on facts and physics, but in this way it manages to raise questions on topics intertwined with everyday human behavior.The production side of the movie is also well-done. Spielberg's directing, despite being considered obsolete, really helps communicate the little story details and the action. As for the vfx work, the level of photorealism that they managed to achieve is commendable, and plays a huge role in bringing the futuristic set to life without distracting with flashy or bad-looking compositing.As for the visual appearance of Minority Report, it is different to any conventional film looks. The colors are extremely pushed, with lots of blooms and artifacts, all of which contribute to a striking cinematic experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
A nice visualization for a movie with no Vision,"In the summer 2002 ""everybody run"", so I ran to see Minority Report the 42nd movie of Mr. Spielberg (as a director) after the disappointing A.I. in 2001. Mr. Spielberg is part of those directors to whom you will always give a chance no matter what. Unfortunately this ""no matter what"" just happen once again with Minority Report. The main concept of the movie is the obsession of vision / visualization. In fact the dynamic between vision and visualization is the dialectic, the key that we need to take the movie a little step further. The movie describes how a vision is generated then visualized and finally how this visualization is rationalized and used: triplets mutants lying in a bathtub filed of amniotic fluid generate visions of future crimes that are visualize on a screen and organized by John Anderton (chief police Tom Cruise) in order to find clues that will help the pre-crime department to arrest the suspect/convict before the crimes are committed. Obviously Mr. Spielberg tried here to raise some fundamentals questions: 1)Isn't the concept of Justice linked (in theory) with the concept of certitude? In other words is what we see always certain or subject to interpretation? 2)Isn't Justice supposedly ""blind"" but however subjective in essence? 3)What degree of freedom are we willing to give up in exchange of safety? Meaning, who is suppose to watch the people who are watching us...isn't it a dynamic base on a ""vicious circle"" principle? The positive thing about Minority Report is that the movie lays out pretty well those questions and do so through an almost perfect visualization on screen. The picture is perfect: very nice bleached blue grain reinforce the ""cold techno"" ton of the movie. The acting is nothing special but still can be ranked as good. Some scenes are just a jewel and are very powerful: to note the floor by floor identity check by the robot spiders. However Minority report has 2 major problems. The first one is the lack of originality. The picture grain is the same as in ""A.I"", the cars reminded me of ""Tron"", the police squad erupting from the roof are straight from ""Brazil"", even the ""film noir"" atmosphere that Spielberg wanted to impose is a re-creation from ""Blade Runner"". The second problem lies in the scenario itself. The concept of the triplets who can visualize the future is a little bit hard to believe: their visions are limited to a certain area (why?) and they can only see crimes (why?). Above all the personal story of John Anderton (Tom Cruise) completely lacks of depth and ends in a fire works of cheesiness with a sparkle of ""zero-creativity"" stained with ""uselessness"". I mentioned that this movie is about vision and visualization. Mr. Spielberg is a master of visualization, unfortunately he did not have any vision for this movie. The same way he invited the audience to run he ran for an easy success but forgot that in sci-fi, Vision is about re-inventing the genre. As a result we have a nice movie but not a masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Spielberg and Cruise combine for a winning Sci-Fi thriller,"Based on a Philip K. Dick sci-fi short (as seems to be the case with every second Hollywood sci-fi entry), 2002's Tom Cruise starring Steven Spielberg directed sci-fi thriller Minority Report is a ripping yarn that remains a blast to watch these close to 20 years on from its initial successful release, as well as being an intriguing predictor for technology that has now come into existence thanks to its forward thinking components that have seen it feel more relevant than ever in today's Big Brother like world.One of the most purely entertainment focused outings of Spielberg's career, a step above intellectually than say the fun Ready Player One but really just an old school cat and mouse on the run thriller when it comes down to the bones of it all, Report also has its fair share to say about freedom of choice and an overpoliced society as we follow Cruise's special police chief John Anderton as his been pinned for a murder his not yet committed thanks to new technology utilizing the minds of three siblings who can predict murder's and suspects before they actually occur.It's a fantastic concept and thanks to Spielberg's innate ability to produce films with spills, thrills yet also filmmaking and storytelling smarts, Report is a thoroughly enjoyable sci-fi epic that gets great turns from its leading man and supports from Colin Farrell, Max von Sydow and Samantha Morton, whilst creating a memorable futuristic dystopia that is captured in a unique way by regular Spielberg collaborator and director of photography Janusz Kaminski.In different hands Report may've been a relatively po-faced experience (although one I would've loved to see modern maestro Denis Villeneuve tackle), one that turns its attention more to preaching and debates on morality of such projects and concepts and it may well have been a fine film produced in that way but there's few directors to have ever existed that know how to satisfy an audience quite like Spielberg, with his sensibilities ensuring Report is constantly on the money.From freeway escapes taking place vertically, a Hitchcockian throwback chase through a car factory or Cruise getting some fun looking eye surgery, Report is never too far away from its next fun scene or moment of white knuckle tension and when it comes to sci-fi's of this nature, Report is deservedly one of the most well-liked and talked about in the business.Final Say -It's not high-brow stuff despite its many contemplative ideas and what if scenarios but Minority Report is a rip-roaring sci-fi thriller that remains one of Spielberg's best efforts post 2000.4 umbrellas out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Spielberg's underappreciated sci-fi mystery,"Philip K. Dick's stories often lend themselves well to film adaptations and Minority Report is no exception. Minority Report is one of Steven Spielberg's most underrated film because he was able to make an compelling thriller, popcorn entertainment, and have a philosophical issues about free-will and pre-determination. The filmmakers must have had an eye on the success of The Matrix when making it. The screenplay was able to juggle the philosophical issues, moral issues, the mystery, and the character work. When I first watched the film I didn't like the ending because it seemed to sugary, but after finding out about another interpretation it makes Minority Report a lot darker.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Is it fair to be charged for a crime you haven't committed yet?,"Minority Report is one of the few movies that kept me glued to my seat and guessing throughout it's runtime. It's a sci-fi Film set in the year 2054, starring Tom Cruise and is directed by Legendary Film Director / Producer Steven Spielberg. It's filled with action, suspense and hints of peculiarity that make the film transcend the era it was made in, making it feel timeless and enjoyable even 20+ years after it was first made.The Plot revolves around John Anderton (Tom Cruise) who is the chief of the Department of Pre Crime, a revolutionary addition to the Police Force. In this world technology has advanced far beyond flying cars and smartphones, as crime prevention has been greatly improved and would be criminals are placed behind bars, or in this universe are placed in a cryogenic state before they even have the chance to think about committing a crime. This form of justice is carried out by the Department of Pre Crime and is only possible because of the birth of three gifted individuals (one individual more gifted than the other two), who have visions of the future. These three have been placed in a vegetative state so that the government can read their minds and aren't treated as people, instead they are viewed as tools for this world's Justice system. Due to incidents that would spoil the movie, John Anderton who is usually the enforcer of this form of justice is accused of a Crime that he hasn't yet committed, this ironic turn of events shakes his world views and he starts to question how many people he took in to custody have been falsely accused. His former workmates and friends have been tasked with bringing him in, the revelation of the would be crime is what sets the whole story on it's course, picking up the pace and the movie dives down an interesting path filled with lots of twists and amazing special effects taking into account it's age.I've never read the book so therefore can't compare it to the movie but the storytelling was top tier. Major storylines were well thought out and there are moments where you are made to doubt the main character. This makes the plot really interesting as normally you should be rooting for the main character but as the story progresses, new aspects make you question if he's truly innocent before finishing off with a big twist. Now personally I didn't enjoy the ending of the movie as I felt it was too picturesque and a little nonsensical to the theme of the whole movie. It felt like the director remembered that the movie was going to end soon and decided to end it on a relatively happy note. Although the movie was around 2 hours and 30 minutes long, there was never a dull moment as you had to pay attention to every detail to keep up with the story. This aspect of film making is what I see missing from less successful movies as every shot is deliberate and all details help add to the plot and ambiance.Now the plot aside, I really enjoyed this movie. The way it was color graded, how the story was paced and the overall theme of the movie was really fascinating. The methods used to take some of the shots and transitions were mesmerizing. Flashbacks were well utilized. This movie does well in it's storytelling as it jumps from the main timeline to flashbacks for context.The film was recommended by my Dad and I watched the movie with my family. Watching it with your family isn't necessary but you'll want to be able to talk to someone about the movie after because there is a lot to discuss. Watch the movie with an open mind and be prepared to be amazed by how the movie keeps up with recent films in terms of production and entertainment value. I would recommend gauging how mature you think you are or the person you'll be watching with is because although the movie doesn't have any explicit scenes there are a few that will make you want to look away as a young child. An example of this is when the main character has to replace his eye balls as that is how people are identified in their world. So to tie everything up I really had a blast watching Minority Report and I believe that the people responsible for making the Film were successful in telling a compelling and captivating story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Entertaining Movie with Holes,"28 June 2002. The fuel-celled, powered cars looked something like a scene from the animated Disney movie, ""Tron"" and the special effects of the cars almost seemed to be the same, about 15, 20 years old. This movie while fun and engrossing doesn't really rise to the qualitative level of the visionary ""Blade Runner."" The overemphasis of style over substance in the beginning felt more like a director who wanted to try to show off the futuristic gadgetry except with less success than in ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" There are irritating lapses in believeability, where Tom Cruise overlooks the simple fact that he can be located through electronic surveillance of his retinal patterns, as a top cop he can't even physically defend himself successfully from an amateur Justice Department sleuth, that stun guns aren't used when they would be most effective, and crime fighters can even set up a trap to ""surround"" someone even when they know where their suspect is going to be.Overlooking these obvious glitches, the movie moves apace with a decent plot and some interesting futuristic set designs and gadgets that were created based on real ideas about the future. The personal emotions of the characters poured through at appropriate times, though the use and manner of humor in the movie tended to diminish the seriousness and realism that a director such as Ridley Scott would have brought to the screen - here Spielberg was trying to be too cute. This movie won't win any awards except for technical and special effects and design but it will bring in the bucks for action. This movie probably raises more questions in this time of heightened terrorist fear and civil rights sensitivity than it answers.In short, ""A Minority Report"" is just about picking the right sandwich and milk bottle from a refrigerator when you're blind and groping through the darkened alleys of the imagination of Phillip K. Dick, the sci fi author who penned the short story upon which this movie was based.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
The Terminally Boring,"I recently sat down to watch this movie again more closely, and decided to re-write my review. In specific, to clarify on why I don't like it at all. It's because Steven Spielberg has the skill to make a movie that will really knock you on your ass. These days, an intelligent movie is almost certain to get an R rating, because the character of Tom Cruise is a Philip K. Dick character. This guy wrote stories where almost every time, the main character was tripping out in his own head as a different person, experiencing things and discovering things along the way, and so do we along with him. This trick is briefly explored, but in the end it doesn't matter anyway, because it was decided this film had to be a PG-13 hero saves the day family entertainment type of film, the demographic that Spielberg has catered to all for almost all of his career.The visual style they are trying to use here, which involves extensive use of a blue filter on the lens, really doesn't look pleasing to the eye. In fact, the film is rather ugly to look at, the design is unimaginative. A noir film is filmed at night! When you film at day, and put a blue lens on your camera to make it dark anyway, it doesn't make sense. Has anyone reading this article seen a movie called ""And God Spoke""? It's a fake documentary where two idiot z-level direct to video filmmakers decide to make a film about the bible because ""it's the biggest best seller of all time, the biggest target audience."" During the production, they decide to hire a polish cinematographer who is obsessed with Sven Nykvist. He thinks if he films exactly like Sven Nykvist, who is famous for his creative uses of dark lenses in brilliantly lit scenes, he will be like Sven Nykvist. He idolizes the man. When they film the garden of eden sequence, it's a cheap production, they barely have any lights, but the cameraman has put very dark lenses on the camera to be like Sven Nykvist. The end result is, they can't see anything, it's too murky and dark. He wasted several hundred thousand dollars in re-shoots in overruns. The point is, Minority Report is so boring that's how I was able to think of this connection. Doesn't Spielberg know that history grinds away at hacks?When the plot can be summed up as ""you used the memory of my dead son to set me up""... that is awful writing. I would expect that kind of writing in an Edward Bulwer-Lytton junk writing contest.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Dark, complex and interesting","In the year 2054 the murder rate in Washington is zero because of the Pre-Crime division.  Pre-Crime uses three pre-cognitives to see the near future and direct officers to arrest the murderers before they can commit the act.  However during a visit by an assessing authority the pre-cognitives see chief officer John Anderton kill a man.  John runs, escaping the pre-crime police and trying to find out how and why he was seen killing a man.This contains many levels of seeing, maybe linking up with how Speilberg sees his films  at first the visions are easily controlled but then they are fallible and more complex.  Anderton even changes his eyes at one point to show how his vision is changed.  Aside from these metaphors the film itself is a lot more complex than Speilberg would have done several years ago.  The film deals with a complex future where we are pre-judged by a big brother style police and the film does have an element of the moral questioning that this throws up.  However for the majority it is a complex mystery film and this carries it no problem right up till the end.The end (I'm not spoiling it) is where it trips up a little  the conclusion is a little too easy and the ends are too tidily tied up, showing that Speilberg perhaps isn't yet the mature director he almost is.  His vision however is very good, yes, we have all the CGI we need and only occasionally does it not look good.  However more than all the CGI, Speilberg mixes the present with his futuristic vision rather than having us all living in pods!Cruise has become more mature as well.  His Anderton starts out as an Ethan Hawk character  full of confidence, but later he is able to add more layers and more doubt.  He is also able to act well beside some other strong performances from good actors like Max Von Sydow and a strong Colin Farrell. The rest of the cast has some famous faces like Ayre Gross, Sam Morton, Tim Blake Nelson, Stormare etc but outside of them really it's Cruise all the way.Overall it may disappoint the Jurassic Park/Matrix audience expecting a fast, action packed thriller  the marketing makes it look like the Matrix when really it's much more like the noir of Bladerunner.  The moral complexities run nicely alongside the action but eventually it falls into Speilberg sentiment mode with a disappointing end.  Overall though this is very good but not quite Bladerunner.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Spielberg does Tech-Noir!,"The year is 2054 and the murder rate in Washington is zero, the reason? Three Pre-Cognitives (each named after a literary great) whose combined abilities witness murders before they actually occur. Apparently faultless, it's then something of a surprise to Pre-Crime chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) when the Pre-Cogs predict he is to murder a man named Leo Crow. Forced to go on the run, and haunted by a family tragedy, Anderton must evade the system he so perfectly executed himself. Can he find a flaw? Or is he actually about to commit a murder?Everybody Runs! That was the tag line that accompanied the explosive trailer for Steven Spielberg's, Tom Cruise starrer, Minority Report. This marketing tool indicated that the great bearded one had adapted from the Phillip K Dick short story and created an action monster? He hadn't, he had in fact created something far far better than popcorn fodder.Minority Report was the next project for Spielberg following the equally dark and intriguing AI: Artificial Intelligence, both films serving to note that Spielberg was capable of thought provoking science fiction outside of the standard crowd pleasers that many critics love to decry. In fact, it's arguable that Spielberg may have hit his creative peak with Minority Report, for the messages and crawling dystopian bleakness on show paint a picture not so much as a future far away in our lives, but of one we live in now. Big thematic points of reference dot themselves throughout the piece. Such as the changing of eye balls, or that in these post 9/11 years we yearn, and always will, to be safer.Here in this bleached shadowy world, a world of metallic tones and visual stings (ace cinematographer Janusz Kaminski on duty), we are safe under Pre-Crime. Yet still it's a world without soul, it has no heart, it's almost as if inhuman in itself, suggesting that the World's problems are not easily vanquished by technology - a total sacrifice of the World's inhabitant's souls. Spielberg of course is well served by the supreme professionals he has at his disposal, he has also managed to garner a great performance from Tom Cruise, something that critic and fan favourite directors have not managed to do previously. Believable grief, action work as strong as ever, it is however with his ability to imbue a tortured film noir protagonist where Cruise excels the most.Alongside Cruise and operating with great impact are Samantha Morton as Pre-Cog Agatha and Max Von Sydow, the latter adding that touch of experienced know how needed for his particularly important character. The odd casting choice appeared to be Colin Farrell as the meddling, almost vindictive Danny Witwer, but he plays well off of Cruise, this even if he veers dangerously close to comic book villainy at times (check out a holy smoke Batman scene). What action there is is first rate, from a jet back pack pursuit, to car jumping heroics, the sequences are crafted with Spielberg's deft eye for an action sequence. While the sick sticks (yes you read right) metal spiders and a brilliant Peter Stormare cameo should hopefully have you squirming and grinning in equal measure.Which brings us to the finale, an ending that may not be a complete surprise (yet it still doesn't cop-out in context to Anderton's tragedy), but things are rounded off in true classic noir tradition, where it closes down a thinking man's tech-noir. Superb. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Steven Spielberg's film represents the best that science fiction has to offer: reflections on our contemporary condition as a society based on speculation about the future,"The plot takes place in 2054, when murder was banned in the city of Washington, thanks to the Pre-Crime division, a police sector where the future is visualized through paranormal, the precogs, and the culprit is punished before committing the crime. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) leads the team of police officers working in the sector, and he fully believes in the effectiveness of Pre-Crime. When Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is sent to investigate the department, to assess whether he should be released across the United States, the precogs see that Anderton will kill a stranger in less than thirty-six hours. Now, the police officer needs to fight against the system he has always defended, in order to prove his innocence.Among all the recent films of Steven Spielberg's career, ""Minority Report"" is definitely one of the great gems. It is a feature capable of combining all the director's mastery of action with all the elements of Dick's work in a surprising result. Part of the success of the result found here is due to the way Scott Frank and newcomer Jon Cohen worked on adapting the original text. Leaving aside the political intrigue that motivates the persecution of the protagonist, the script was built to be a race against time, giving a dynamism that Spielberg manages to control like few others. In this way, everything that happens in the film becomes urgent, even when the protagonist needs a few moments to breathe, or when he himself cannot see where to run.Incidentally, not being able to see is the metaphor that the director uses to show how incoherent the simple idea of a Pre-Crime division is. After all, no crime is actually committed, so in the eyes of the law, everyone arrested is innocent. For the same reason, when caught up in a conspiracy, Anderton has to remove his own eyes so as not to be captured - while Spielberg uses this as an analogy to show that the character is freeing herself from her blind view of the system. That's where the controversy starts. Is it right to arrest a person who had the intention, but did not actually commit any crime? Anderton defends tooth and nail (and sophisticated equipment) that yes. If you see a marble approaching the edge of a table, why do you catch it before it hits the floor? The theory is the same, says Cruise with self-assurance similar to that of his character in Magnolia.Spielberg has created a science fiction that is not restricted to genre fanatics. The main reason for this is that he was advised by scientists, architects, writers and inventors, and he managed to create a plausible future. Therefore, there are no flying cars (at least not like the ones seen in Star Wars) and other gadgets à la Jetsons. His future has iris identifiers and super-fast cars, that is, it is a future with feet on the ground. This was the ideal excuse for the producers to be able to sell as much advertising space as possible and thus increase the film's budget (set at US$ 102 million, of which US$ 25 million came from merchandising from mega corporations such as GAP, USA Today, Nokia and Lexus). But Spielberg's future isn't just claustrophobic, it's also very clean. And, unlike what is seen in ""Blade Runner"" (another adaptation by Philip K. Dick, which also treats vision as a metaphor), here the noir effect is created through another photography technique. Janusz Kaminski (who has been collaborating with Spielberg since ""Schindler's List"") reduces the saturation to show the apathetic society that has been created, but at the same time, raises the contrast to create a neo-noir ambiance, without losing colors entirely. The result is always very strong white lights, a deliberately bland palette and sharp contrasts.The detective plot is complex, full of layers and leaves no room for the viewer to breathe or even blink, even considering the duration of the work. From the moment the action goes into ""turbo"" with the pre-cogs predicting that Anderton will commit, in 36 hours, the murder of Leo Crow, which he has never heard of, the script starts to resort, perhaps a little exaggeratedly, to expository texts to allow the events to be accompanied satisfactorily. The didacticism is uncomfortable at certain times, such as when Anderton confronts Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith), the creator of the technology that allows the prediction of the future in her greenhouse full of genetically altered plants and who introduces us to the concept of ""dissonant report"" or the ""Minority Report"" of the title; or when Witwer explains what is already obvious to the viewer to Burgess.But it's clear that Spielberg knows the problem and makes a lot of effort to balance these moments with breathtaking action, but that never confuses the viewer, nor draws too much attention to itself. For example, rather than dwelling on Anderton's escape in his self-driving car on roads that go horizontally and vertically, the director is economical and uses CGI visuals to maximum effect, dazzling and surprising in equal measure. The same goes for the intrusive shots that Spielberg uses with the help of CGI, with cameras inside walls, in cutouts of a building and under the door in the sequence of ""cyber spiders"" or for Anderton's initial fight against his peers with much use of efficient practical effects.But, perhaps more fascinating than all the rest is the moral discussion that ""Minority Report"" proposes: free will versus safety. Would it be conceivable to thwart the will of people - whatever their nature - in favor of a world without violent deaths? Wouldn't the mere concept of punishment for a crime one hasn't even committed yet shape behavior, reducing freedom of choice in the process? In the end, do the ends justify the means? It is absolutely fascinating to stop and think about it and Spielberg, using all the drama that is characteristic of him, puts the viewer in the middle of this discussion, whether he wants it or not, by making us sympathize with Anderton and his dark past with the loss of his son. It makes us ask ourselves: would we give up our freedom to avoid the death of a loved one? Notice how this is a current theme, present in our day-to-day life in one way or another.After all, the script also presents this same idea in another light, creating a future world in which the government can take preventive measures to protect society and in which the media have become so intrusive that it is not possible to even take a step without having your retinal scan and having your name mentioned by a ""digital person"" on a street billboard offering you something. Look around you at the banners on the page you are browsing and see if your behavior is not already known and manipulated by the media. The futurology work in ""Minority Report"" is scary.Another fundamental point of this project is the long-awaited union of two icons of Hollywood cinema: Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg. If in the years prior to this project neither of them had been getting much right, because they opted for more daring and alternative proposals, this time they manage, literally, ""to unite the useful with the pleasant"". I say this because it is identifiable in ""Minority Report"" the concern of both to evolve as creators of dreams, but based on solid alternatives of reality and enjoying the best that technology is capable of providing. It is possible to check here echoes of both the A. I. - Artificial Intelligence (2001), by Spielberg, as well as Vanilla Sky (2001), with Cruise. The choice of both, therefore, is logical and correct.Despite the use of expository dialogue that is even justified to allow the film to flow coherently, Spielberg falls into two other traps, however. The first of these is the introduction of Lara (Kathryn Morris) in the final third of the tape, giving her a relevant and essential role, almost a kind of extended deus ex machina. Even though her existence and even her presence is felt and discussed before, her entry into the plot sounds too easy, especially when she takes the action for herself, which forces the artificial change of narrative point of view. The second trap is typical of Spielberg and, therefore, cannot even be called a trap, being more like a style trap. The director can't resist a positive ending. Remember the last few seconds of War of the Worlds, also with Tom Cruise? Practically the same happens in ""Minority Report"". And, here, as there, the clash between the path the tape followed and what is seen in the few seconds before the credits roll creates a strong and unnecessary rupture, which could have been avoided with a more uncertain, less rounded and less rounded vision of the future. Comfortable. But we're talking about Spielberg, aren't we?Despite the problems, ""Minority Report"" is a great and captivating cinematic experience, one that, like the best works of the genre, generates heated discussions long after its end. This new work has definitely stood the test of time, being digested even better over the years. Steven Spielberg's film represents the best that science fiction has to offer: reflections on our contemporary condition as a society based on speculation about the future. K. Dick, the man who dared to dream of electric sheep, gave rise to the basis of ethical discussions that screenwriters Scott Frank and Jon Cohen deepened in adapting the text to the cinema. The work that Spielberg, Cruise and all the other professionals involved maximized through their unrivaled levels of competence. The end result was a film that, twenty years after its original release, remains very relevant and a great, pure and simple cinematic experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Great Thriller, Contains Plot Holes","This is another of Tom Cruise's great films as an action star, but I had to knock it down because of the plot holes. What Spielberg and the writers did well was create a gripping thriller with plenty of twists and turns. The acting was terrific, and the CGI holds up today. I felt most of the movie was a bit too bright so the cinematography could have used work, but they shot great angles, nonetheless. The plot hole of John's identification continuing to work throughout the movie was odd and didn't make sense. It was necessary to keep the movie going but what an odd inconsistency to have throughout the entire film. I think it's a solid film and would recommend it for thrill seekers. 3.5/5 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

A Concept Film That Also Wows With Action,"Imagine if you could be charged & arrested for a crime you were ABOUT to commit? That is the premise behind Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"".For a basic plot summary, the film (set in the future) focuses on John Anderton (Tom Cruise), chief of the highly successful ""Pre-Crime"" unit, which (with help from three special pre- cognizants) are able to predict a murder BEFORE it occurs, rendering the crime rate almost nil. However, Anderton suddenly finds himself the target of a pre-crime investigation, and embarks on a crusade to prove his innocence...which in itself is in doubt until the shocking conclusion.In terms of plot, the film excellently delivers a high-concept topic in a way that both creates high drama and gets you thinking about the possibility of such events actually occurring. At its heart, ""Minority Report"" is a concept film, but one in which the events are portrayed (thanks to Spielberg) in such a linear, easy-to-understand manner that it actually feels like an action- adventure epic.The acting, with Cruise leading the way, is also entertaining, as Cruise plays a very convoluted Anderton. On one hand, he believes in the PreCrime system with all his heart. On the other, he grapples with the fact that he himself could be a casualty of that very system.About the only thing I didn't like about this film were some of the extended action scenes. While flashy, in terms of real-ness they were much more suited for, say, a James Bond film. In other words, a bit too fakey for my tastes.Overall, this is a great concept film that will keep you thinking, draw you into the characters, and keep you on the edge of your seat. Creatively, I compare it to Blade Runner, although much better in terms of the action/adventure angle, whereas Blade Runner seems so bleak.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Spielberg's best of the 2000s,"In the future, murders are prevented before they are performed. When pre-cog officer John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is accused of committing a pre-crime, he must find out why he will kill a man he has never met.'Minority Report' is Spielberg's best of the 2000s.Great story and script. It fast-paced, intelligent, and real at the same time.Tom Cruise gives a great emotional performance and uses his smile perfectly. Samantha Morton gives a great performance as a woman who is frighteningly not used to the world around her. Max Von Sydow is good, but not memorable. Colin Farrell gives a great snobby performance and his chemistry with Cruise is top-notch.The star of the film is Steven Spielberg. This movie is an old-school noir story, set in the future. The production design is high-tech with chrome and clear windows everywhere. The special effects are amazing, as well as the cinematography and editing. Visually this is one of the best movies. I've ever seen.Never boring and always interesting. This is Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' and 'The Color Purple' for the new millennium.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Visually dazzling film with one or two good ideas!,"Tom Cruise plays the murder squad policeman of tomorrow (2054) - here murder is prevented before the act by means of a set of ""PreCogs."" Water-bound, drugged up humans (give Amnesty International a call) with the special gift of predicting the future. Therefore the central ""murder"" doesn't actually happen - some jackbooted SWAT team bursts in through the skylight just before the act.Bar the whiz-bang technology (which we will return to) we have a society a lot like today (only they don't swear as much!), where people eat, sleep and work without the need of tinfoil suits or magic pills. Cars do drive themselves though!We have Steven Spielberg in his, now common, ""reluctant"" director role. Let us not get in to ""Billboard"" politics, but I don't understand the man-inside beyond his need for constant pats on the back, recognition and applause. While noted as a nice and charitous guy - and he is - that doesn't mean he doesn't also have a fair sized ego.(He even helped form his own studio - Dreamworks - then he goes off to work for another! When you form/CO-form a business isn't it best to work for it rather than a competing rival? Or does show biz have another version of common-sense?)The problem with industrial technology (within the film itself) is that designers do not design superfluous parts for the purpose of them looking dramatic to the casual observer. Doesn't make any sense. But when you do have nonsense don't underline it by some kind of pseudo intellectual explanation as to why coloured balls have to roll down long plastic tubes before you can announce a would-be murderer - just let it pass!Minority Report is a clear example of reverse writing. Like coming up with a joke - you come up with a good punch line and work backwards to come up with a scenario that could lead you to that point. This comes up with a mixed bag of possible cliff-hanger clichés or twists to work towards - and the fact that Cruise's child has been killed (by persons unknown) sent my eyeballs a-rolling.Before we know it John Anderton (Tommy Cruise) is - for reasons a child could guess at - on the run from his former pals down at Nazi Jack Boot Central: and, as further expected, he leads them a merry dance up hill and down dale. This takes up a lot of the story and to be frank, goes on at least fifteen minutes too long. As we all know flight is only any good if you have somewhere to actually run to.While this is the Tom-and-tech show (the only love interest in the movie is his late son), it is good to see the Swedish veteran actor Max Von Sydow still in work after over a hundred films. Quite a few better than this and plenty made on the money this production spent on lunch.Steven S's has a poor record when casting Johnny Foreigner and I was sad to see his long-standing theme of foreigners (non Americans) not being trustworthy continues. Can't say anymore - but it leaves a lasting bad taste in mouth, just as much as the visual images leave a lasting impression on the eye.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Crime is not predictable at all!,"The human race has always been obsessed by the future, which is probably one distinctive trait that makes it human and takes it out of animality. Humanity has to plan its future in order to survive, hence it has to predict its future needs. But humanity remains an animal race in many ways, including of course its survival instinct. So crime is part of the picture, what we call crime in our human ethics. But this is nothing but the individual survival instinct that goes against the collective survival instinct. Then the collectivity, human society decides to consider the individual survival instinct as being a crime and as deserving punishment. It is, and has been, tempting to predict what and which individuals will become criminals in order to prevent that crime. It was for instance suggested under President Nixon to preventively take away into reform schools all the kids, aged six or seven, that had the « typical criminal » psychology before they realized their destiny which was considered as inescapable and necessarily criminal. This approach was essentially behavioral. Then another appeared, essentially genetic this time and some still believe that the DNA of any individual contains its destiny that is absolutely inescapable. So let us put away those who have the « crime » genes. Steven Spielberg deals with this dilemma but based this time on a modern embodiment of the seers of old. Three people have been transformed by some genetic manipulation into seers of the future and their predictions are considered as absolutely infallible since they always seem to agree. Then the criminals are arrested before they commit their crime and put away. The effect is the disappearance of crime from Washington D.C. in just a few years. But Steven Spielberg goes further and demonstrates that there are several flaws in this theory. First the three seers don't always agree and there might be a minority report from one of them that is over-ruled by the two others and not communicated to the precrime police. Then this precrime police is a private enterprise and it was necessary to prove its efficiency to get the business. Little by little it appears that the founder of this technology manipulated it in order to prove his theory by arresting someone who was supposed to kill a woman just before he did. That one was paid by the inventor who then afterward committed himself the very crime exactly the way it was supposed to happen which enabled this second crime to be understood by technicians as a simple echo of the first one that was prevented and to be disregarded. The death of the woman only became a missing person. That is the flaw of the film : why didn't anyone investigate this « disappearance » ? But then he also had to trick his own associate, the main detective of this precrime police. He does that by getting the latter's son killed in such a way that the crime will remain unsolved. But this enables the boss to nourish in his associate a desire to know who killed his son. This associate's coming around to that knowledge will make him become a criminal and thus he will be neutralized and put away but after the crime is committed for reasons that are not clear. But a few facts were brought together and sorted out by this cop's wife and then she manages to get her husband free, which sounds quite iffy, and this triggers a full process of truth discovery and public broadcasting. The end is yours to discover. But this approach, with marvelous special effects and beautiful action, seems to overkill the point it wants to make : The future is inescapable and predictable, and yet the future can be tampered with and manipulated. The first principle is excessive and even wrong. The second is probably true. But both together are just absurd because contradictory. The point is then disproved by this very contradiction. But it is a great film nevertheless that reveals this question of the future and its possible prediction is essential to man and humanity.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Stopping Crimes Before They Happen,"Based on a short story by science fiction author Philip K. Dick, in the future a pilot program based in Washington D. C. is meant to stop crimes before they happen. The system works by having three precogs living in water who are able to predict crimes about to take place, an example of a husband being arrested for the future murder of his wife and her lover. Crime itself has been reduced, and there are plans to bring this system to a national level.Trouble is, one policeman who is part of the program finds the precogs predicting his murder of a man he does not even know. Of course he smells a rat and flees, with the rest of the police after him. Questions are inevitably raised; are the precogs really so infallible? Is the policeman's future murder inevitable, or can it be prevented? And will the program be proven good or a failure?This is not a deep movie, just a sci-fi thriller with a novel concept.

Compelling concept but it could be better,It's a very engaging story about police predicting the future! I don't see Tom Cruise as a perfect candidate for the protagonist. If only Colin Farrell and Tom Cruise traded places! Then I could witness Colin Farrel's potential in the main character. Instead of hoping that he is a good actor in a sideshow. If that changed and Steven Spielberg updated the graphics and some outdated storylines. Then it could have been better if not a perfect story.

The sad part is that film is only allowed to go so far with truly showing us what we are as consumers and human beings.Minority Report is haunting as is Truth when it appears too bright to accept. The film touches on this ""truth"" as we watch the future seer suffer through a different perspective, a view that is right made wrong by the Majority.The question is: When do we listen to the Minority?It usually comes with a voice.

"A beautiful, intelligent science fiction film, and certainly one of Spielberg's best","Although Spielberg has made several genre films, none of them have approached the intelligence and sophistication of his two successive sci-fi masterworks, ""Artificial Intelligence: AI"" and ""Minority Report"". Although ""AI"" is certainly an impressive film, ""Minority Report"" was the film which simply wowed me in theaters and did so every time I saw it after that. This stunningly tense and thrilling look at the judicial system in the near future could have been a simple action thriller but ends up a spectacular, unique mesh of genres. If I had to I'd label it I'd say it was a futuristic sci-fi mystery noir with hints of the sort of social drama Norman Jewison and Sidney Lumet would pull off occasionally. Then there's the whole humor angle too. The bottom line is that ""Minority Report"" is wonderfully unique. There's films similar to it, but nothing will give you quite the same feeling you'll get from watching this.This decade has been simply tremendous for Spielberg. With the possible exception of ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (a fun summer film, perhaps, but one obviously made without any real artistic purpose), Spielberg has made nothing but extraordinary, wonderful films this decade, with ""Catch Me if You Can"" seeing the light-hearted Spielberg at his absolute best and ""Munich"", ""AI"", and ""Minority Report"" all being astonishingly strong and important films. What's most refreshing about his work this decade is that little of it seems lazy. There's real inspiration here, a real sense of enthusiasm and devotion.The screenplay is wonderful, combining intense drama, some action, a serious examination of some real social issues, and even a little bit of humor. This is the sort of science fiction we ought to see more of, the sort that leaves one thinking well after they have finished viewing the film. The characters are well-developed and interesting, the plot (all you should know before seeing the film is that it involves pre-crime, a crime-fighting system which allows the authorities to see murders before they occur and stop them) is well thought-out, involving, and unique, the dialogue is sharp, the world well-developed and just quirky enough to be both tremendously entertaining and believable.A film that juggles so many elements, such a complicated storyline and mythology, and so many characters as gracefully and skillfully as ""Minority Report"" does is rare, and it is proof of Spielberg's immense skill as director that he manages to do this, especially given how radically different not only the material but also the technical aspect of the film is to most of his earlier films. There's some stuff in this film that Spielberg probably hadn't even thought of doing before, and I don't doubt that this is partly a result of his partnership with cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. ""Minority Report"" looks like nothing Spielberg's done before (except for ""AI"", perhaps), and it's remarkable how well-realized this future world is and how stunning the visuals are. It is, quite simply, brilliant.A technical and visual masterpiece, ""Minority Report"" also boasts a brilliant screenplay, making it an outstanding, unforgettable science fiction masterpiece that will almost certainly continue to inspire and enchant audiences for many, many years to come. If not, it will still always be one of my personal favorite films.10/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Minority Report.,"Minority Report (2002) is a stunning, exhilarating film that was truly ahead of its time. The futuristic technology depicted in the movie, such as gesture-based interfaces and self-driving cars, has become a reality in the years since the film's release.The pre-crime unit, which uses psychic abilities to predict and prevent crimes before they happen, is also a concept that feels increasingly plausible as our society continues to grapple with issues of surveillance and civil liberties.Despite the film's bleak portrayal of a society overrun by technology and the loss of privacy, its portrayal of the future is still eloquent and thought-provoking. It serves as a cautionary tale of the potential consequences of relying too heavily on technology to solve our problems.Overall, Minority Report is a harsh but necessary reminder of the importance of balancing progress with humanity. It is a film that remains relevant and poignant, even 20 years after its release.Directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg. The film is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, and it explores the theme of free will versus determinism.Spielberg's direction is masterful as always, and he shapes the story in a way that is both visually stunning and emotionally engaging. The film has a distinctive visual style, with a bleached-out color palette that gives it a unique, otherworldly feel. This is particularly evident in the film's futuristic setting, which is a marvel of production design and special effects.Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell give outstanding performances in the lead roles. Cruise is at his best as John Anderton, the chief of the PreCrime unit, who must go on the run after being accused of a future murder. Farrell is equally impressive as Danny Witwer, the Justice Department agent tasked with bringing Anderton to justice.The cinematography in Minority Report is also noteworthy. The film's bleached-out look adds to the gritty, understated atmosphere of the story, and the cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, uses a variety of clever camera techniques to add to the tension and suspense.Overall, Minority Report is a majestically crafted film that showcases the talents of Spielberg, Cruise, and Farrell. It is a thought-provoking exploration of the nature of free will and determinism, and it remains a modern sci-fi classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Pre-Crime, Prejudice, and Precognition: Spielberg's Futuristic Thriller Unleashes Mind-Bending Suspense!","Set in Washington, D. C., in 2054, ""Minority Report"" follows John Anderton (Tom Cruise), a police captain in the PreCrime division, which utilizes the psychic visions of three ""precogs"" to arrest and convict murderers before they commit their crimes. When Anderton is accused of a future murder himself, he must delve into the mysteries surrounding the precogs' visions and clear his name.The film's visual effects and production design are truly remarkable, creating a futuristic world that feels both alien and eerily plausible. From the magnetic cars zooming along vertical highways to the personalized advertisements that relentlessly pursue Anderton, the film's atmosphere is richly detailed and immersive.Tom Cruise delivers a solid performance as the haunted and desperate Anderton, effectively carrying the film's emotional weight. The supporting cast, including Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, and Max von Sydow, also provide strong contributions, adding depth to the film's moral and ethical dilemmas.While ""Minority Report"" excels in its world-building and visual storytelling, the film's pacing and narrative structure can feel uneven at times. The first act is a gripping, relentless chase, but the second act slows down considerably, focusing on Anderton's investigation and the exploration of the precogs' visions. Although this shift allows for deeper examination of the film's themes, it may leave some viewers longing for the earlier action sequences.Despite these minor pacing issues, ""Minority Report"" remains a thought-provoking and entertaining film. The moral and philosophical questions it raises about free will, determinism, and the role of punishment in society linger long after the credits roll.In conclusion, ""Minority Report"" is a visually striking and cerebral sci-fi thriller that offers a compelling vision of a future rife with moral complexities. The film is an engaging and worthwhile watch for both sci-fi fans and those who appreciate a good philosophical debate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"""Careful, Chief. You dig up the past, all you get is dirty.""","'Minority Report' is gripping and intelligent for most of the film but the impact falls away towards the end.First of all, the premise is cool and so is the way the film handles everything. We all know Spielberg is a capable and quality filmmaker and the whole pre-crime concept is introduced and explained well. There are nice touches here and there such as 'conducting' the search for the murderer. Its true that some aspects of this film like plot devices and technical choices (all films agree that the future will have cold, blue light) are kind of standard and not that original. Not only that but red herrings like new alphabet letters and pills that make time pass faster were promised beforehand.... However, this doesn't really rankle that much. Spielberg doesn't go overboard on the futuristic gadget stuff but concentrates on the characters/story instead.What's irritating, though, is that some of the plot turns are inconsistent and fairly implausible. I mean, at the start we're told the pre-cogs can only see murder because murder is what most affects the metaphysical universe, however the filmmakers don't stick to this rule later on.However, As Anderson hurtles towards the future murder he is accused of, the film is mostly tense, thoughtful and gripping. Some of the best scenes don't have to do with chase scenes but character interaction such as Anderton's meeting in the greenhouse and a discussion about his son later on. Unfortunately, after the main event, the film becomes sort of unnecessary and overblown. The ending (concerning pre-crime) isn't very believable at all when you think about it. The early 21st century films - 'AI: Artificial Intelligence,' 'Catch Me if you Can,' and this one seem to be good/great Spielberg. Its nice to see him back at the top of his game, though, with the absolutely heart-stopping 'War of the Worlds,' and the extremely intelligent, respectful and courageous 'Munich.' Spielberg's usual pals in cinematography, score and editing do nice work here but nothing that will blow you away. Cruise does a fairly good job but sometimes seems stretched in some scenes - his 'War of the Worlds' performance is much better. The acting star of the film is Samantha Morton as pre-cog Agatha. She shudders, gasps and sees murder over and over again with wide eyes and raw believability. Colin Farrell also shows smarmy promise here.In conclusion, a great Spielberg film would probably be considered a triumph for most other people. I recommend you watch this film.PS: One last thing. If you were Anderton, wouldn't the best thing to do to clear your name be to hide out somewhere and lock the door? That probably wouldn't make for a very interesting film, though, would it?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
lacks atmosphere,"This is a film with a good story, which is no surprise being an adaptation of the writer Philip K. Dick's short story 'The Minority Report'. What the movie lacks is an atmosphere which is one of the most important elements of such films. All the futuristic implications of the film comes from gadgets and poorly designed cars. Urban areas doesn't look much different from present day cities and the film doesn't care much about the social developments of people in the 2050s. When this is the case, one expects more about the characters and their psychology but you don't get much out of them either. Behaviors of the precogs sometimes gets distractingly comical. On the good side of the movie it has some humorous moments well placed in good action. This is more of an action film than sci-fi and when you watch it as one, it is an enjoyable action-pursuit movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Water, water everywhere...","Pairing Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise must undoubtedly be a nightmare for many people, but for those in their fan clubs it had plenty of promise, and ""Minority Report"" is a definite return to form for the master after ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" - itself flawed but not as bad as many claim it is.Like ""Total Recall,"" this expands on (and from what I'm told almost totally changes) the Philip K. Dick story it's based on, and if the result is essentially ""The Fugitive"" with a bigger budget, harking back to that fine example of Action Movies With A Brain is no bad thing. You all know the plot (Precrime cop Cruise discovers he's wanted for a murder he's going to commit in just over 50 hours and goes on the run, etc.,), but Scott Frank and Jon Cohen's screenplay offers intriguing notions alongside all the thrills, and Spielberg delivers a welcome return to basics - let's not forget this is the man who did ""Duel"" and ""Jaws"" - while not betraying the ""Thank goodness he's grown up"" crowd. (Yes, we all know ""Schindler's List,"" ""Amistad,"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" were children's movies, right?) One moment we're experiencing a high-speed chase through an automobile factory, the next we're pondering the ramifications of a system that allows crime to become almost extinct. Somehow I can't imagine ""Scooby-Doo"" doing that.The movie's filled with special effects, of course, but Spielberg movies always have them serve the story instead of vice versa, and it continues here - throughout the result is that of a believable future world (love the ever-changing newspapers and magazines). And instead of complaining about the product placement in ""Minority Report"" (something which I've personally never really had a problem with), let's look at another aspect of the tale. Throughout the movie, water is a recurring motif; the Twentieth Century Fox and DreamWorks logos are presented through water, several crucial scenes take place around bodies of water (a coastline, a swimming pool), and Cruise's police officer evades his pursuers at one point with the help of an umbrella and a downpour. There may be other theories about this, but since it's associated with the good guys throughout the movie (and note the last shot of the movie), my own view is that you can see through water, and thus get a clear view of what's happening - thus, water = the truth.Whether you agree or not, you have to agree that blockbuster movies that give you a rollercoaster ride and food for thought are to be encouraged. Spielberg, his writers, his crew and cast keep the tension running high for nearly all of its length (the final confrontation between Cruise and the villain is just a bit off, and both it and the first scene are a little too TV-ish for comfort), but in the end ""Minority Report"" works for considerably more than a minority of viewers. The master still has it. The Dream still Works.PS: I didn't spot Cameron Diaz, but the lady Cruise and Samantha Morton encounter in the mall does look a lot like Lucy Liu...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Stup-EYE-d,"I'm going to say the latter. Spielberg's curious slab of millennial sci-fi both seems strangely up-to-date and a relic from a distant past. Riffing on a slight novella by Phillip K. Dick, Tom Cruise is thrust into the shadowy world of pre-crime, the central ""who watches the copmen"" plotline is fairly compelling but the frequent lurches into either Matrix-esque philosophical nothingspeak or genuinely silly comedy sequences muddle the vibe over the long running time. I actually can't make up my mind whether the occasional strange slapstick sequences actually improve or degrade this. In fact, I've pre-decided the answer at the start of this review.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Cruise in the world of 2054 makes a good action hero...,"MINORITY REPORT creates such a futuristic world of virtual reality that you can almost forgive some of the missing logic in the premise that has pre-cogs causing Cruise to hunt down the man he's supposed to kill (although he's never met him!). It's the kind of film you can enjoy even if you spot some of the flaws in the logic.However, despite some of the ingredients that don't quite make sense, it's a thinking man's thriller and Steven Spielberg has produced it on a grand scale befitting a superior thriller of its kind. He's created a futuristic world that is full of larger than life plasma screens and the sort of technology that borders on the believable, given some of the advances already made today.The premise of the story is even more disturbing since we live in the post-9/11 world where much debate has taken place over the government's right to interfere in citizen's private correspondence (via telephone, for example), while fear of rights being trampled have led to sharp policy differences between Democrats and Republicans. But this, of course, makes the story even more timely and intriguing.TOM CRUISE gets to play his action hero role in more than a one-dimensional way and is quite convincing as the man on a strange mission to find the man he is destined to kill--unless he can prevent what the pre-cogs have predicted. And COLIN FARRELL and MAX VON SYDOW lend conviction to key supporting roles.Furthermore, John Williams has written a busy score that magnifies the tension at every turn.Summing up: Well worth viewing for sci-fi fans who want more than just action-filled, brain numbing excitement.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"awful film, great disappointment","I walked out after the first hour of this film.  With the great reviews it had gotten (Ebert, et al), I was looking forward to it.  Instead, I got a vehicle for Tom Cruise, who's an okay actor, except I don't dissolve merely at his looks.  The movie quickly deteriorated into action-explosions-shooting-jetpacs-vomiting-punching-snot-strangling...you get the idea.  This was followed by more dizzying ""action.""  The basic premise of the film was fine, intriguing in fact.  But what I saw was an action film made for lonely 11 year-old boys or Tom Cruise fans.  As I left, I stopped at the popcorn counter, and the woman told me many people had also walked out.  It's amazing how this film can be called ""the best film of the year.""  By what measure?

Prepare to be dazzled by this futuristic advertis...oops!...movie,"Minority Report is a pretty decent flick, as just about any newspaper critic will tell you.  However, I haven't seen much mention of the use of product placements.  They seem to pop-up constantly, to the point of distraction, and left me with mixed feelings about the film. There are also significant plot ommisions and stuff that just plain makes no sense, but I guess that is to be expected.  The product placements are significant because of the sheer number of them and how out of place they are.  Hello, it's supposed to be the year 2054, right?  I guess that all the brands we buy stuff from today are still dominating the market 50 years from now...after all, our grandparents were driving Lexuses 50 years ago, right?  Oh, wait...  Of course, Spielberg and company couldn't just use made-up brands of the future to drive home any point they were trying to make about ad saturation.  Not when they could make millions by assuming that the people of the future still watch ""Cops"" on their holo-projectors and wear Remo shades.  In fact, some scenes seem to be included solely for the purpose of pushing a product (i.e. the scene at a well-known clothing store with fashions that just so happen to look very 2002).

"Impressive in its design, muddled in its ideas","Steven Spielberg has a habit of trying to put a conventional spin on stories with offbeat or challenging ideas. The problem with ""Minority Report"" is that he's so intent on downplaying the movie's subject--preventive detention--that he's afraid to address the underlying issue that the original Philip Dick story pondered. It's a film that for most of its two-and-a-half hours seems more interested in the sci-fi thriller elements of the story than in the difficult questions it poses. While the movie transcends its genre because it deals with such an interesting topic, it shortchanges that topic by skirting around these tough questions.Tom Cruise plays a cop in the mid-21st century who's part of a unit called ""pre-crime."" A trio of psychics can tell when someone somewhere is going to commit murder. One example: A man inadvertently walks in on his wife with another man. In the heat of the moment, he picks up a pair of scissors and is about to stab her, when the cops burst in and prevent him from doing what the psychics had predicted he would do. They slip a weird machine over the man's eyes and keep him locked up, immobile, and comatose.Right there you have a problem. Even in our justice system, a man who raises a weapon to someone has committed a crime, even if he's caught before he has had a chance to carry out the act. That has nothing to do with ""pre-crime."" Of course, the punishment this man receives seems quite harsh for attempted murder or assault. But it would seem quite harsh even if the man had carried out the act. The notion that preventing this man from killing his wife would require that he be detained indefinitely, particularly in such a grotesque fashion, is absurd. But there are examples of preventive detention that are not so easy to dismiss. By failing to address such examples, the movie weakens its own argument.As in other anti-utopian tales, the very person who carries out the corrupt form of justice becomes its next victim. The psychics envision that Cruise will soon commit a murder. Since Cruise believes in his job, shouldn't he accept their reading and allow himself to be arrested? But he finds himself in the same position as the people he has detained. They all swear to their innocence. Up to now he has trusted the psychics, knowing that the detainees would have committed the crimes if not for his intervention. But he knows he is no killer. The psychics must be wrong this time! Caring for his own self-preservation, he goes on the run.The rest of the film is an intense hunt-and-chase thriller as Cruise evades the police while trying to solve the whodunit. His adventures will take him in icky directions as he encounters spider-like robots and men without eyes. He also must meet with a strange old lady in a sequence that seems ripped off from ""The Matrix,"" which is ironic, since ""The Matrix"" was itself inspired by Philip Dick's fiction. ""Minority Report"" is longer and more complicated than necessary, but it is handled with the intricate craftsmanship that we have come to expect from Spielberg.The problem is that the movie is so focused on the complex plot that most of the time it forgets about its provocative themes. Certain plot points are muddier than they should be. Until I read the original story, I did not understand what the minority report was. (It was actually quite simple: one of the three psychics may have a different reading than the other two. But the movie explains this concept poorly.) And the final explanation for why the cop was thought to be a potential killer, which involves something of a time-travel paradox, was much simpler and to-the-point in the original story, leaving readers with something to grapple with. The movie tries so hard to argue against preventive detention that its case feels forced.Dick was never much interested in the design of his futuristic stories, and that's certainly true of the story on which this movie is based. In that story, the detainees were kept in ordinary fenced areas. There was nothing about them being suspended in a bizarre, computer-induced coma. In an effort to create a visual representation of the story, the film envisions a lot of new technology, including the ability to transfer the psychics' thought to a screen, a level of technological advancement that I doubt will exist by 2054. The movie does capture some of the paranoia that was typical in Philip Dick's fiction. To escape the police, Cruise has to take some gruesome measures because of the government's sophisticated means of identifying everyone, a possibility that doesn't seem far off in our own world.But all this technology distracts from the movie's political and philosophical message. Spielberg is a master of design, and his vision of the not-too-distant future is impressive but not exceptional. Most big-budget science fiction movies today do a good job at the level of world creation. I just can't help feeling a little frustrated every time a Philip Dick story gets turned into an action movie. Ironically, a film like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" which is not based on any of Dick's stories, does a better job of bringing out his ideas than any of the actual adaptations of his works have done. Because it focuses on the consequences of technology rather than the conception, it comes closer to the spirit of this great philosopher of science fiction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Really cool premise with overdone action scenes,"This movie's premise is amazing and it creates an interesting world. Imagining the philosophical conundrum behind pre-crime is half the fun of the movie, and that's what I found myself doing during the somewhat boring action scenes. Yeah, we expect that Tom Cruise runs around a lot and does action-y things, but the effects just don't quite seem right by 2022 standards. The first major action set piece is also a bit outdated in terms of direction. It cuts to random bystanders who have a few seconds of screen time before the action suddenly pours into their apartment or whatever. Pretty cliche by today's standards.

The climactic scene where the real bad-guy is revealed is pulled out of thin air through an opportune method that isn't even mentioned throughout the entire first 95% of the movie.  The plot holes are ridiculous and unforgivable, at times.  Then, the basic premise of the story, the idea of ""How far will society go to protect itself?""...  More crap about free-will and the idea of the power of one person over the majority and blah, blah, blah.  And, why did they have to date the movie?  Why ""2054""?  What's the point of that? It's going to suffer the same fate as every other science-fiction movie with a definite date attached to it.  We should be traveling to Jupiter by now according to Hollywood.  We're going to be replacing our eyes for the fun of it in 50 years?  Yeah, it shouldn't be taken so seriously, but it's no more than a weak storyline/vehicle for more super-slick special effects.

One of the best films that Spielberg has done,"When Spielberg had started to discourage us with his latest films, Minority report has come to tell those that thought that Spielberg wouldn´t be able to make and amazing film again, a film like ET or Jurassic Park, that he has still things to show us from his personal universe.The action is present from the beginning, after a brief ""mise en scene"" to teach the audience how the justice works in the 2054. A frightening method that allows the cops to know who is going to make a crime in the hours next. A malfunction (Or at least is that what we are inducted to think) gives place a prosecution that reminds ""North by Northwest"", the hunt of an innocent that is at the same time trying to get clues that can demonstrate his innocence. This is the part of the film that we enjoy the most, even when is a simple action film at this moment, the audience know the injustice and tries to identify themselves with our hero.But there is always a problem, first of all and the most important, we know the ending or at least we suppose how is it going to end, that´s really the problem of this film, with an exceptional start, has a common ending. The second is the amount of brands that we see during the film, at one moment we have the sensation that we are watching a commercial, this has to make us think how the cinema has lost its art component and now is a simple business, an industry. It´s really a shame that a good director that has something to tell accept to include publicity in his film, from that moment he is accepting that everything is permitted to get money to make the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Minority Retort,"I've never been a huge fan of Speilburg, I find his movies have great moments or sequences I enjoy but overall leave me feeling kind of cold. This feels like Speilburg was trying to make a movie just for me- he loaded it with actors I like (Max Von Sydow, Jessica Harper, Peter Stormare, Tim Blake Nelson, Samantha Morton), put in a little gore (the whole groovy ""eyeball"" sequence), even served up a scene where one person vomits on another (always a favorite). But no matter how Sir Stevie panders to me, I cannot like this movie.There is a festering pile of boogers in this movie, and it's named ""Colin Ferrell's Acting"". Hasn't anyone noticed how terrible this guy is? Why do they keep putting him in movies? He's awful! One needs only to look at the chase through the car factory: After performing a perilous climb onto a piece of machinery, Farrell pulls out a cross and kisses it. Later, when Tom Cruise is escaping, Farrell slams his fist into his palm ala a bully in a Nickelodian series. And it doesn't help matters that most of the dialog in this movie is god-awful.And why does this movie end and then go on for another twenty minutes? There's a point where the conspiracy is reveiled via a character giving a big long monologue (like Velma on the Scooby Doo show), then there's a nice, grim, downbeat ending that satisfied me. But no, it keeps going, and going, and has another character give a long monologue explaining stuff that's ALREADY BEEN EXPLAINED. Did the writers think the audience was so stupid they couldn't get it? Or couldn't handle a downbeat ending? There's a point where this movie becomes excrutiating.I did like how criminals are punished in the future by being dressed like Slim Goodbody, though.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
A frigid blockbuster from a reformed sentimentalist,"Steven Spielberg is a popular artist of genius, a wildly ambitious filmmaker with some amazing contributions to latter day celluloid folk mythology, but his results are more hit-or-miss than his millions of fans seem to recognize.  Out of 44 directorial credits, roughly 13 might be worth remembering, and of those only a handful could qualify as imperishable popular art classics. When he scores, he scores big.  Sometimes, though, the score is more box office than artistic.  In between the `Close Encounters' and the `ETs` and `Schindler's Lists,' there are some clinkers, and sometimes, as in `Saving Private Ryan,' an unforgettable patch is weighed down by an uninteresting body, and at other times Spielberg's eagerness to please, his childlike sensibility, and his sentimentality can sink him. Spielberg's movies are behemoths technically, emotionally, and in their box office expectations.  They arouse great expectations in the public, too, and they can be exhaustingly disappointing.  `A.I.' was that for most people (those who even went to see it).  It's too long -it had about three equally elaborate endings - but I was one of the few who loved it and found it magical and deeply touching and think in time it will be recognized as a classic, however flawed, and a worthy homage to Kubrick.  `Minority Report,' made after long delays while The Great One was editing `A.I,' doesn't have the magic or the emotional power of its immediate predecessor, nor does it have the bite Spielberg thinks it has.  If it was conceived as an antidote, it doesn't work that way, because there's nothing cynical, nothing ironic, about this movie.`Minority Report' is cold and uninvolving and borrows from so many sources it has no personality of its own. As a sci-fi action film noir story starring Tom Cruise, it's big box office and ought to do way better than `A.I.,' but it sadly does not stand out from the other summer blockbusters, some of which are definitely more fun.  The first problem with `Minority Report' from which all others flow is that this is another movie made from a story by Fifties sci-fi pulp great Philip K. Dick, a wrecked genius and a born cynic.  Spielberg is an optimist and a sentimentalist, if a reformed one, who is trying to make a `dirty' picture, something a lot rougher and nastier than `The Color Purple' and more sophisticated than `Jaws.' Unfortunately, though there is a special kind of craft visible here as always, the result is disappointingly ordinary and the plot is full of holes. Ridley Scott's `Blade Runner' may not do justice to Dick's ideas, but at least it captures a private eye tone and has great visual style, and its action is full of panache.  Visually, `Blade Runner' and `Brazil' are hard acts to follow, even for Spielberg.By making us care about a robot boy so advanced he could love and seek love, `A.I.' made moral issues of future technology gut wrenching: can you just throw a creation like this is the junk pile, or dump it by the road like a stray dog?  It was the old dilemma of Frankenstein - whether man can play God without disastrous results. In `Minority Report' Spielberg seems to have grown cold to the very same moral issue of technology's eroding our humanity that exerted such a strong force in `A.I.'  In effect he has said in public that the recent curtailment of civil liberties in the US doesn't bother him because he feels it's necessary after September 11.  I guess that kind of attitude explains why `Minority Report' overlooks the real relevance of `pre-cogs' and `pre-crime' to the very up-to-date John Ashcroft world of racial profiling and wholesale roundups of guiltless `suspects.'  Maybe it's moral insensitivity to Philip K. Dick's story, and to the pessimism in Dick's view of the future, that has made `Minority Report's' elaborated story end up being so poorly constructed. Spielberg and his writers lost track of where the premise was pointing.Typically Spielberg says he prepared for this movie by watching a lot of movies including film noir, Hitchcock, and John Huston, and he has incorporated elements of Ridley Scott, Gilliam, Kubrick, Huston, Hitchcock and bits of many other movies. Ultimately they are at best held together only by the force of Tom Cruise's personality and the propulsive energy of the action and the special effects - an energy that grows flaccid with the film's excessive length.  There are so many borrowings that `Minority Report' ends up seeming fussy and overcomplicated.  I left feeling tired and empty.  No real film noir would be half this long.  It's all so uneconomical, such a monumental waste of time and talent! Good film noir doesn't require a big budget.  Indeed, a big budget makes a film anything but noir.Sure, there are good moments-Samantha Morton's acting in the challenging and rather thankless role of the pre-cog Agatha, Lois Smith's Kubrickesque cameo in the animated hothouse, the retinal ID spiders who invade Anderton's post-eye-op hideaway, and the whole grotty eye op episode, which blends bits of `Brazil' with bits of `Blade Runner' but adds a delicious new level of disgustingness.  The Lexus factory episode is remarkable and sticks in the mind even as it seems reprehensible and preposterous, as do the personalized commercial ID's. Smaller roles like those played by Tim Blake Nelson and Jason Antoon are well cast.  Inside this clunky behemoth there's clearly a wonderful movie violently gesturing to be let out. I'm bothered, though, that the writers have said they didn't really `get' Philip K. Dick's story. If Dick's interesting enough as a sci-fi writer to base so many movies on, why take a story of his only to trash it - to weigh it down with pastiches and cameos from modern movie history?",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Base plot similarities.,"WARNING - SPOILERS! Some things you can't deny about this movie. Steven Spielberg is the best at telling a story visually. Tom Cruise gives 100%. And everyone else behind the camera does their best work.But one thing bothered me about the plot. The main character's mentor, or the person he takes orders from, or the person he most reveres, turns out to be the bad guy. Well, la-de-freakin-da! And the bad guy's goal is to completely destroy the life and reputation of his star pupil/protégé for the good of a flawed system, and hide this plan from his protégé for as long as possible.I've seen this come about as an actual trend in the last 10-15 years.

Half An Hour Too Long... But Good Stuff!,"MINORITY REPORT (3+ outta 5 stars) Interesting premise (inspired by a short story by Philip K Dick) about a future society whose law enforcement relies on a trio of powerful psychics who can predict crimes before they happen so that the perpetrators can be apprehended *before* the harm is done. Complications ensue when one of the top law officers (Tom Cruise) becomes implicated in a murder. He goes on the lam, waiting for a chance to prove that he has no intention of killing anyone and doesn't even *know* the man is supposed to kill. I would probably like this movie twice as much if it had the last half hour chopped off. The true climax of the movie comes when Cruise finally confronts the man he is supposed to kill. (An extremely powerful confrontation that actually had me in tears the first time I saw it.) After that we get a totally predictable finale with the good guys triumphing over the bad guys (and neatly side-stepping a lot of the murkier issues of morality and justice raised in the first 4/5 of the film). Based on this and ""A-I"" I am beginning to think that ALL Spielberg movies should just automatically have the last 30 minutes chopped off. Still, this is a fun movie... probably Spielberg's best action movie since the original ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".

Why is it not talked about more often?I sometimes feel like the big directors and artists after a while into their career develop some sort of a bias against them. As if it is inevitable that they would 'fall off' and everyone is just hunting for the movie that marks their downfall. This movie did escape that reputation, but I can imagine this sort of a collective mindset puts this movie behind some of his others making it just a little more underrated.But that is just an assumption, it is normal that not everyone will perceive a movie the same way and that people have good reasons to like or dislike any movie whatsoever.For me, this movie made me feel even better about Spielberg. It's a true testament to his versatility. It was a constantly engaging ride that took the plot in every direction that I didn't know I wanted it to.For such a complex plot it was also very well laid out and communicated. I don't think I had to scratch my head around this one as much as I did for some other notably twisty films. This one just sat right and I think it shows just how good of a director Steven Spielberg really is.I'm not inclined to go into a detailed analysis as most of the film's charm seems self contained, meaning the big 'message' doesn't seem too apparent or it hasn't been given that much importance, or I was blind to it because I was just too gripped by the storytelling, but the message is probably threaded somewhere in the film if you look carefully enough. Maybe it would've been somewhat more likeable if this dystopian setting was explored just a bit more, maybe the aspect of morality just a little bit more questioned even though it is a very obviously posed question by the end of the film and it is vital to some of the film's characters and their actions. Some extra scenes that would let us dive into the minds of the characters a little more thoroughly would've been welcome. But I really can't complain giving that I enjoyed every second of this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Well-made, if so dolled up that the original intent is lost","Americans can be put in prison for something they haven't done, on the accusation that they will do something – but enough about the administrations of Bush and Obama. Set in 2054, this has DC's police force(with a vote coming up to make it national) be a PreCrime division - people are arrested before committing murder. How? Via the visions of the future of the three PreCogs, Agatha(Morton, doing an incredible performance, a lot of it without words, using the expressiveness of her face, particularly her eyes), Arthur and Dashiell. They were the children of drug addicts, and thus gained this ability. Chief of the department, Anderton(Cruise, his intensity aiding tremendously, pulling us in), hunts down the perps-to-be, only one day, the prediction points to him - and says he will murder a man he's never even heard of. He goes on the run, determined to prove his innocence.What of the ethical questions involved in this Orwellian thought-crime justice system? Read the short story of Philip K. Dick for that(in general, pursue his body of work), because any such exploration is barely present here. If one cannot adapt this story and keep that intact, one should have the self-awareness to admit that someone else should helm it. Focus is shifted to where you can't recognize it(the entire issue of powerful post-war military has downright disappeared... I wonder why the US, with its bloated ""defense"" budget, would remove such a compelling, historical issue - and yes, I opened this whole thing with a crack about the current situation(not even getting into drones), and yes, it has gotten a lot worse since this came out... however, this did come out after 9/11, with the Patriot Act signed in, and yet, this did not comment much on the idea of a totalitarian government).The core of what's going on in this(I won't spoil it) didn't even need to be in this, and it's so unoriginal and out of place that it hurts - you'll note the writing contortions applied to even fit it in to the whole(yeah, don't expect overall in-universe consistency, even for all they don't explain - sometimes things that need to happen, just... do). Mystery? Convoluted. This is overlong, with a running time of 2 hours and 12 minutes sans credits(7 more with). While plenty happens, it feels like steps could have been skipped, and the excitement of the opening 20 minutes(a last-minute rescue attempt of potential victims) are inversely proportional to that of the last 20, the wrap-up.Before I am accused of hating on Spielberg(such as for how he includes far too much of his typical sappy sentimentality), I will go into all the positives. This is a good film. Hollywood? Certainly. But as I say of James Cameron and Peter Jackson, it's the right kind - they'll entertain the masses, not sending them out to buy some brand and then forget how crappy the flick was(I'm glaring at you, Bay), rather, they stay in the audience's mind, they resonate emotionally and they make you think(well, in this case, not about the most important thing). Steven asked Janusz Kaminski, his regular cinematographer, to make ""the ugliest and dirtiest movie"" either of them had ever made, and, he did exactly that.Some call this overly bleak, and I can understand why - who knew the dork who created E.T. even had a dark side? He also put serious effort into making the tech realistically futuristic, assembling a team of 16 future experts. It is quite credible, and the world feels organic. FX hold up these 11 years later, and CGI isn't overused - it always ""feels"" real, and is never there ""just because we can"". Eye candy? Sure, and like I said, it's not the stupid, pointless kind. The humor is great, keeping it from getting too dark, without being frequent enough to mess with the unflinching tension. Yes, at points this nears Hitchcockian levels.There is some bloody, disturbing content(most of it seen in quick flashes), a bit of moderate to strong language and a little sexuality in this. I recommend this to fans of the people behind it, and of sci-fi blockbusters. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

"Slightly flawed, but entertaining film","As previous commentators have argued, there are plenty of plot holes & inconsistencies throughout the film, but besides all that it was an interesting & enjoyable film to watch. The acting was very good for these sort of films, with Tom Cruise putting in a good performance as usual. The best though were the non American contigent of Colin Farrell, Max von Sydow, & the impressive Samantha Morton who is now finally proving herself on the international stage.

"Spielberg does dick (well, Dick)","Minority Report is a solid piece of cinema. A step up for mr. Spielberg after the failure that A.I. was. Cruise is one brave man, taking a job along side with Colin Farrell, who upstages him. Yes, the real energy in this yarn is Farrell, showing us that we ought to keep our eye on his future work, because the man handles his craft well and steals the screen. The plot seems to be nothing more than the usual run'n'hide for Cruise, but the good twists keep it lively. Only REALLY negative thing I have to say about this, are the kids that can see the crimes before they're committed. Of course they explain why this is possible, but it's quite far fetched. Spielberg admires and adores kids in his films WAY too much. Still, over all, this is a good film, which I would recommend.**** / *****",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

"One of the best films of 2002, with moral issues and a good story behind it.","What would happen if we could predict a crime with details and certainty before this same crime actually happened? This is the basic premise of this film, set in 2054, where a system was set up (Washington D.C. only) called ""Pre-Crime"" that allows the authorities to take precautionary action by arresting criminals in the act before committing the act. However, the entire system relies on three people with a knack for seeing crimes that have not yet happened, and which are held virtually captive and asleep, called ""Pre-Cogs."" However, doubts arise when Pre-Crime Division Chief John Anderton is spotted by the pre-cogs while committing a future assassination. Anderton will therefore try to understand how everything will happen and ensure that it does not happen.Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film is very well done. Set in the near future, there is much of the Orwellian universe here: people who are identified by the retina anywhere, as if a ""big brother"" watched over everything and everyone, a strong and controlling authority ... the movie, at this point, reminds a lot the works of this writer, famous for the pessimistic way in which he faced the future of humanity. The scene of the invasion of the condominium by the police spiders, in order to identify everything and everyone, is one of the moments that most reveals the controlling nature of the authorities, as if the ends justified all means, including the invasion of privacy and the home of each person. Of course, the weaknesses of the Pre-Crime system are exposed by the film and this raises complex moral and ethical questions. There is some poetic justice here, as it is someone in the system who tries to undermine the system to save itself. However, from a certain point in the movie, everything becomes increasingly clear and predictable, moving towards an ending that may, in fact, leave us wanting something more.Tom Cruise is an actor I don't particularly like, but I must admit that with this movie he got one of the best performances of his career so far. John Anderton is a good character, and Cruise was able to gradually destroy the character's confidence convincingly. The way he worked and brought to life the main character is one of the pillars that underpins the entire film, although he collaborates well with other good actors such as Max von Sydow and Colin Farrell. They never match Cruise, just giving you the support you need.On a technical level, and being a futuristic sci-fi movie, we should highlight the positive visual, special and CGI effects that Spielberg (who already has school at this point) has secured for the film. It was a job well done. Only those cars and airways didn't convince me, looking like something out of the Jetsons universe. Other than that, the focus is on realistic holograms, advanced computing, recreational 3D, robotics, etc. everything seems to be in line with the way humanity is developing.It is undoubtedly a good movie, one of the best in that distant year of 2002, and it still has room on the shelves and movie channels of our day.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

"A memorable action scene or two, but I found the story a bit lacking","This movie was okay, nothing really special. A Tom Cruise science fiction action/mystery/suspense that works on some levels, but not on levels concerning the story as I found it weak and full of holes. It is the future in this movie and there are some nice visuals and some stuff I can actually see happening. What I do not see happening is the whole seeing a murder before it happens and people who have not actually committed a crime being sent to some strange tanks for the rest of their lives. The opening kind of demonstration shows a murder that any lawyer could get a person a much lesser sentence for as it was a crime of passion and would likely draw a manslaughter charge at most. Well the lead guy on this squad of super cops who rely on psychics to find out who is going to commit murder before they occur is now on the run because the psychics have said is going to commit a murder. Well a nice initial chase scene occurs and there is a lot of cat and mouse that works nicely. Then there are scenes that make one think ""what the heck is going on?"" as the guy on the run gets his eyes replaced and plays pick the food. Yes, he has two choices of good sandwich bad sandwich and good milk bad milk. Strange plants that ensnare guests and a bunch of other just strange stuff more fitting for say an anime rather than a future that they are trying to present itself as realistic. It is nice to find out they culprit behind a bizarre murder case, but there are just too many strange moments for me to say this movie is all that good.

"Left me very satisfied thanks to the accurate storytelling, engaging special effects and unique setting and vision of the not-so-far future","Phillip K. Dick based movies are somewhat tricky. When in the right hands, they can turn into true gems (Blade Runner, Total Recall); although they also tend to become mediocre from time to time (Paycheck) or just plain messes (Next). This time around, though, P. Dick gets the royal treatment, with the help of one Steven Spielberg (director) and one Tom Cruise (star). This dynamic duo of extreme talent hands out one of the most accelerating and captivating sci-fi adventures to ever embrace the silver screen. The film, as a whole, left me very satisfied – thanks to the accurate storytelling, engaging special effects and unique setting and vision of the not-so-far future.The story follows John Anderton (Cruise), head of Precrime, a futuristic police force whose genetically enhanced employees have the unique ability to foresee the future, therefore helping the unit's policemen to prevent crimes before they occur. This technological advancement quickly gets out of hand when Anderton becomes the prime suspect of a future murder he is about to commit. Thing is, Anderton doesn't know the victim, and soon becomes a victim of the system he so dearly embraces. Questions of the morality of justice and law enforcement ensue, as Anderton embarks on a journey to both prove his innocence as well as find out who's really behind this crime.Once the action shifts gear, you'll have a blast. Look out for excellent performances by Collin Farrell (in one of his earlier roles) as the investigator trying to beat Anderton at his own game; and Samantha Morton as Agatha, one of three Precrime enhanced predictors, who has the ability to see the ""Minority Report"" and predict the flip-side result of the upcoming crime.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

I am so tired of Spielberg,"Knowing that this will make it to the ""0 out of 189 people found the following comment useful"" category I will say this: I thought of giving Spielberg one more chance after the abysmal ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" where he destroyed the undisputed talents of Haley J. Osment. Boy was it a mistake to give him that chance.It is not enough that the movie was a run-of-the-mill chase-the-good-guy movie which they've made since 1903. Nor was it that it had to last for two and a half hours with absolutely no reason. No, the worst thing was that it had the same crappy over-contrast no-subtleties look as the Saving Private Ryan or the otherwise potentially good Band of Brothers. Really, Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning, which was shot on PAL Digital Video cameras looked better than this zillion dollar turd.And somehow, this story was supposed to be originally written by Philip K. Dick. They've hidden the original very well, even better than with Total Recall.I made this promise in the late 1980's, but this time I'll keep it: I will never ever watch a Steven Spielberg movie again.

Not as good as you might have heard,"OK, it has some interesting ideas about a future society. The story is actually quite good, although there is something odd about the way it's very predictable, then there's a twist, after which you immediately know what the next surprise will be. Until the next twist that is.There are a few problems though. Both the action sequences and the (somewhat slapstick) comedy seem out of place in a movie like this. It's like a putting a Blues Brothers style car chase in Blade Runner. The ending too doesn't really fit with the rest of the film.And of course there's Tom Cruise, who, as usual, comes across as so unsympathetic it's hard to care what happens to him. And this has nothing to do with recent real life events, mind you. I didn't see Cradle Robbing Religious Lunatic Cruise on the screen, just Unpleasant Police Junkie Anderton.

"Great looking fun, but too predictable","Minority Report is great entertainment, as it should be, and a vast improvement on A.I. (although I still believe that would have been good had it ended 30 minutes earlier in the script). Spielberg's latest does not suffer from its length (a few minutes shy of 2 1/2 hours) and seems to fly by.Tom Cruise is surprisingly good and fans will be pleased do know he still gets to do his trademark 'running-in-the-rain' scene. Max von Sydow is solid as usual and Lois Smith provides some relaxing humour and mischief.Best of all is the always good, but not always in good films, Colin Farrell who is far and away the most impressive actor on display here. I can't imagine a world in which Farrell will not become a huge star and this is just the sort of brilliantly understated performance (far less showy than his splendid turn in Tigerland) that will boost his career into the stratosphere.Also good is Kathryn Morris. Morris is an impressive actress with a dynamite smile that clearly grabbed Spielberg's attention when she appeared as an FBI agent in DreamWorks 2000 release The Contender. Also leaping from The Contender to Report is Mike Binder in a small role which he makes the most of.The biggest negative I can see to this film is that fun as it is it relies too heavily on plot twists you'll see a mile off. One important one is practically highlighted by Spielberg, in a surprising piece of ham-fisted direction from the legendary director, a good hour before the big ""reveal"". This is a shame because what was an interesting idea for a film suffers from cliche and over simplicity. Perhaps after the criticism that came A.I.'s way about over-complication Spielberg has gone too much the other way.Hopefully Christmas' release of Catch Me If You Can, starring Tom Hanks, will find the balance. Trust in Spielberg, he will return to his great form as shown in Schindler's List, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Last Crusade, Jaws, Close Encounters etc., unfortunately Minority Report isn't it.

can spielberg make a bad film?,"being a huge spielberg fan, i knew this would be a great movie. And with tom cruise aboard, how could it fail?. In short it doesn't, it almost does, but there is no doubt that this is a modern classic. You all probably know the plot, but for those who haven't seen the film, don't go in thinking this is a huge action film like the trailer boasts. Don't get me wrong, there is action, but it doesn't over populate the film. It focuses on character and story. And all the better for it. As always, the brilliant John Williams is on music duty, and instead of driving the movie with his score, he makes it more suttle and quiet, providing a backdrop to a scene, that is quite frankly, gorgous. And Spielberg again, shows why he is the best director in the business. Some of the camera work and design of the shots are fantastic, and the acing which he gets out of the actors is superb. Tom Cruise is great as the flawed drug abusing John Anderton, but he has competition in the best actor stakes. As an opposing federal agent, Colin Farrell steals almost every scene with his cool, determind gum chewing character Danny Witwer. He plays the role with such confidence, it's hard not to dislike him. After the first two hours of mayhem and confusion, it slows down a gear, which for some people may drag the film down. I certainly felt a bit funny when it changed from ace futuristic thriller into an almost cliched who-dunnit crime drama, and maybe Spielberg played his all too familiar sentiment card too much, but it certainly weakens one of the best films in recent years. But despite the change of pace, on second viewing, the ending does work, but it still felt just a tad too long.

Violent and unorthodox,"I consider myself to be relatively tolerant of many things in movies. I can handle quite a bit, but there was something about this one that really did make me quite uncomfortable. I think it was my inner voice crying out that no matter what would happen in the future, it was unethical to punish someone for a crime they hadn't committed. And I stand by that still. While some believe that fate exist, there is nothing set in stone and you can change your fate. In fact, we do that with every choice we make in life. There is a lot that can trigger people here, a lot that triggered me even. The movie has a subplot where Anderton (Cruise) is desperately searching for whoever kidnapped his son and we are to believe that the son was murdered. I'm a bit embarrassed to say that now the scene that made me the most uncomfortable had to do with a simple surgery. I've watched House but there's one thing I can't handle when it comes to surgery and that's eyes. Weird but I was not quite prepared for a graphic eye removal surgery of the main character.With all that said, let me make it clear that this is an incredible thriller. It was made by the legendary Stephen Spielberg and is based on a story by Philip K. Dick who also brought us sci-fi classics like Blade Runner. The characters are each developed and interesting. The visuals are absolutely stunning, everything seems to just be perfect and I can't in my right mind not recommend this movie. There is a lot of content that might make viewers uncomfortable but if you go in knowing that I don't think it would affect as much. The movie reminded me a little bit of (one of my favorite movies of all time) 1998's ""Pleasantville"". This perfect world where no one gets hurt. But in creating that perfect world, you take away people's ability to live. Of course, this is much darker than Pleasantville but it ties a lot in with the same philosophies of it.

"Spectacular, dazzling futuristic sci-fi thriller, demonstrating Hollywood at its very best.","`Minority Report' is without doubt one of the greatest sci-fis in a long, long time. Popcorn entertainment for the eyes and mind. What it really is, is a demonstration of how outstanding technology is in the high-tech world of today. Of course one of the main problems that effects these blockbuster hits is that it may overload on special effects and be very poor in the script and dialogue. `Minority Report' avoids this problem with delightful relish. Of course the visuals are mesmerising as expected, but the plot holds your attention and the dialogue is never clunky, wooden or unconvincing.Another thing that the film has in spades is imagination. It tries to show a well-detailed portrait of a gloomy utopian future. You can see that a lot of work went into the script and the imagination is simply oozing out of its sides. But it has a minor deficiency of one thing- heart. While there is plenty of genuine grievances with Tom Cruise's character and his wife, the rest of the cast doesn't seem to have that many emotional reactions. However, there's still more heart present than in similarly themed big-budget outings. Besides, the body is big enough to carry the brains around.`Minority Report' is divided into three different parts, each a different branch of the sci-fi genre. It starts off as a futuristic noir with a cool plot, in which cops must race against time to prevent crimes. The second part is rather like `The Fugitive' with the classic man-on-the-run scenario. But there's the extra-added twist that keeps us on the edge of the seat- he kills someone in 48 hours who he's never heard of or does he? The least glamorous of the three parts, the conclusion is a gloomy but enjoyable `clue-in-the-clock' mystery/suspense thriller. Of course the story does seem complicated, but it makes sense if you give it your attention.In a film that headlines Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise, one would have the highest of expectations, and I certainly wasn't disappointed. They are two of Hollywood's biggest icons and it's about time they worked together.`Minority Report' is simultaneously a dark vision of the future and Hollywood at its most glamorous (excelling brilliantly both ways).

I only have eyes for you.,"Steven Spielberg presents a provocative Sci-Fi thriller about a futuristic ""pre-crime"" unit that has the ability to identify murderers before they kill. One member (Tom Cruise)of this astute unit finds that he himself will be a murderer in the very near future. This causes him to run and in turn try to prove himself innocent. The FX are great, but easily becomes boring. I really enjoyed the sequence where the ""spiders"" are let loose in the apartment complex. Different shades of color and camera tricks do not keep your mind off of thinking this flick is dragging on over two hours. Well rounded cast includes:Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, Kathryn Morris, Steve Harris and that man of stoic roles Max von Sydow. Pay attention to the importance of one's eyes. The use of drugs is as shameless as the plug for Lexus. This time Cruise is not required to use any acting skills for his role is more physical than usual. Entertaining; but pack a snack.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Cack,"What an over-rated movie this truly is. That was my first thought when the credits rolled, but for the life of me I couldn't work out why. The story was very original, it was directed by Steven Spielberg and it had a huge star taking the lead in Tom Cruise. Ah, I thought. Therein lies the rub.I think there is a lot to be said for casting unknowns in certain lead roles. Detective John Anderton is a shining example of such a role. You see, the problem in this instance is Tom Cruise. Undoubtedly a massive star and fantastic in Top Gun and A Few Good Men, Cruise nevertheless is essentially a one trick pony. And if you cast an actor with limited range in such an original movie (especially someone as big as Cruise), then, in this case, it turns into just another Tom Cruise action/drama picture. In every scene we see a bit of Maverick, a bit of Ethan Hunt and a smattering of every other character he's ever played.Now, consider Minority Report with a carefully chosen but unknown actor in the lead. Suddenly, the film is purely about the story; the unknown brings something to the lead part that no-one has ever seen before. A perfect example would be 28 Days Later - a tremendous film, but would it have been as good if someone like cruise had played the lead? I doubt it.Don't get me wrong, the big-budget, all-star action movie has it's place in the cinema. It offers the viewer a chance to escape for two hours without having to think too hard. The problem arises when the John Woos and Jerry Bruckheimers try to turn it into something it's not. They should just stick to blowing stuff up.So there.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Choice or Conspiracy?,"Steven Spielbergs's ""Minority Report"" is a visual and technical masterpiece, with great action, with an awesome movie star and actor in Tom Cruise at the top of his game, that somehow fails to deliver in the end. Give ""Minority Report"" it's due, it is a wild ride. However, it is long at 2 1/2 hours. The year is 2054, and Spielberg captures a viable world, specifically Wasington, D.C., where there have been no murders in 6 years due to the efforts of the Pre-Crime Unit headed by Cruise's John Anderton. The screenplay by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen based on the Philip K. Dick short story is fascinating and poses some worthwhile questions.In 2054, there are ""Precogs""-- tech for pre-cognizants-- who foresee premeditated or passionate murders up to 36 hours before they are to happen. So it is the Pre-Crime units job to prevent the murders from happening, by arresting the ""murderer"". One now asks: If that person does not murder the victim or isn't even aware that he or she intends to, then how can they be guilty, much less punished? We don't get to dwell in the inquiry. However, the question becomes very real for Anderton (Cruise)when he discovers that he is to murder a man he doesn't even know, Leo Crow, within 36 hours. There are 3 Precogs, the most talented of the three is Agatha (a very good Sammantha Morton). Apparently, in the cases where all three do not agree on a foretold murder, a Minority Report is filed. The Report is in Agatha, and Anderton must uncover the truth-- whatever that may be. The chase is on. Meanwhile, a government agent is sent to audit the process to see if the program can go nationwide. This is headed by Danny Witwar, a deceptively competent character, well played by Colin Farrell.There are some great effects: futuristic car chases, crashing jet packs, and robotic spiders. Though the biggest asset is Tom Cruise. Cruise is so intense, and it is amazing how his Anderton stays so intense. He looks great, and does all the action sequences expertly. With Cruise, one gets a sense of his drive, and also the burnout. He makes Anderton very human and empathetic. It is also refreshing to see Cruise not playing a character who is incomplete with his father, instead he plays an incomplete father. He does it well. Sammantha Morton as Agatha has some excellent scenes-- a solid performance. All this is what makes ""Minority Report"" disappointing in the end. The movie sets itself as a character play of fate, looking at the nature of true choice. However, what occurs instead of choice is conspiracy in a very long drawn conclusion. This does not give anything away. But the story and movie sells out the efforts of Cruise as Anderton, and perhaps the the value of the inquiry itself which made the movie so compelling from the start.Cruise and Spielberg have pooled their great talents together, and made a movie well worth seeing. Though ultimately there is no choice. And that is disappointing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

First instance of a movie being better than the book!,"I read a lot of sci-fi literature, and I consider myself a fan of Phillip K. Dick.  I admire his sophistication and political/social sensibilities. He was an ingenious satirist and prophetic writer.Although strong in concept, Minority Report is not the greatest execution of Dick's writing ability.  I'd go as far as saying that it is the poorest of his works that I've read thus far.The screenwriters for this movie did one incredible job in transforming this rushed piece of writing into a film that stands on its own.Tom Cruise gave a performance that for once did not rely so heavily on his dashing good looks; although it was Samantha Morton as Agatha who stole the show with a haunting and convincing portrayal as an anguished soul.The special effects were used sparingly, allowing the story-telling to do most of the work.My only wish is that Iris, the eccentric woman who designed the pre-cogs had more screentime.

Great Film Despite the Casting,"In a future where a special police unit is able to arrest murderers before they commit their crimes, an officer from that unit (Tom Cruise) is himself accused of a future murder.The biggest flaw in this film is the casting of Tom Cruise. Not that he is terrible, mind you, but it clearly shows the people behind the camera (Spielberg?) were more interested in casting someone who would bring the film lots of money rather than someone who would give the film depth.Luckily, the story comes with its own moral and ethical dilemmas. Is it okay to arrest someone for murder before that murder is actually committed? Attempted murder, sure... but murder itself? This is an old philosophic issue, made popular by the hypothetical idea of killing Hitler (or the equivalent) as a child.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Tom Cruise and Samantha Morton give Oscar worthy performances as Anderton and Agatha, respectively. Max Von Sydow and Colin Farell also give marvelous performances. What more can I say about this movie?

mediocre,"In 2054, an organization called PreCrime has eradicated crime through the employment of ""precogs"", a group of people who see crimes before they happen, allowing the police to arrest the perpetrators before the crimes happen. As a result, there has not been a murder in Washington, DC, six years. But what if one of the people working at PreCrime was charged with murder? That's the premise of ""Minority Report"". Tom Cruise plays PreCrime employee John Anderton, suddenly charged with committing a future crime. Steven Spielberg's direction is good as always, but the movie suffers a little. Don't get me wrong; it's a good concept for a movie, and the idea of an organization being able to go after anyone seemed like an important topic after September 11, 2001. But the movie seems full of itself. Still, this is one to check out, if only to see how Spielberg does it (although he and Cruise did a much better collaboration with ""War of the Worlds"").",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Spielberg has lost the magic.,"Let me start by saying that I think Philip K. Dick is one of the best science fiction writers ever. Conceptually he is matched only by such greats as Frank Herbert (Dune), Robert Heinlein (Stranger in a Strange Land), and Isaac Asimov (Foundation). Typically, his books have turned into some pretty good movies. Bladerunner (based on his  novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep) is one of the better Sci-Fi movies out there. Even the under-the-radar Screamers was a pretty good movie. That's why it's such a shame that Minority Report, which had a huge budget and big names, was so bad. I must admit that I liked the way the movie looked. The effects were certainly top notch and the 'washed out' look definitely made things more interesting. There were also a lot of great ideas concerning what advertising might become in the next few decades. But the movie just loses its focus within the first half hour. Let's not forget that this is based on a SHORT STORY, not a novel. At more than two and a half hours, the movie takes longer to watch than the story does to read. Why? Spielberg Padding. He just can't let it die. So, now you've got a really long movie that drags because it doesn't have enough story to support it. This would leave us with something mediocre that I would have enjoyed, just not enough. Unfortunately, ,it gets so much worse. At some point or another it was decided that this dark film noir-esque movie should have some slapstick humor thrown in. This is where things go from boring to painful. In one scene Tom Cruise has some eyeballs in a bag which he needs to sneak into somewhere. That part makes sense. It's just the shot of him scampering down the hallway chasing the eyes as they roll away from him that reminds me of the Keystone Kops which bothers me so much. How about during the intense jetpack fight when some burgers get singed from the action? These stupid scenes don't constitute a majority of the movie, just enough to make you really question what the hell they were thinking. And in the end, that's what I walked out of the movie asking myself. What the hell were they thinking?Good: Special effects, film's look, some of the acting (not much though) Bad: Everything else.If you thought Independence Day was a great movie, then go see this. If you though BladeRunner was a great movie, rent that instead.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
The Best Steven Spielberg movie ever made!,"2002 couldn't be a perfect year could it? ""Far From Heaven"" depicted the stereotypes between interracial relationships to homosexuality in the 1950's which still happens today, to ""Bowling for Columbine"" in which Michael Moore showed how Americans are fanatics towards having a gun; now in Steven Spielberg's latest film, he shows the more futuristic side towards people's mind: prediction.The main character in ""Minority Report"" is John Atherton (Tom Cruise), a futurist cop who heads Pre-Crime, an organization dealing with people's fate on whether or not they are going to commit a crime. He organizes the operation after losing his son from an abductor six years ago in which his wife divorced him and now all he has left is his job and PCP he gets from a blind drug dealer.The way the cops read the future is by having three individuals floating on top of a pool with water and milk combined; the main head reader is Agatha (Samantha Morton) in which she sees the crime being committed while the two males repeat the incident.Now the question is, what would happen if you were targeted for a crime you were not even involved in? That is what happens to Atherton's character as he believes that he was set up by Danny Witward (Colin Farrell), a investigator for Washington D.C., in which he believed that everything has its flaws, including the whole pre-crime system.Nobody believes Atherton is innocent as he is on the run from the cops and the people of the city. In order to clear his name, John must go after the source behind the incident and set everything straight.""Minority Report"" is a great movie, which is ten times better than A.I., and at the same time a very valuable lesson to anybody who wants to predict the future and realize that everything can't be true.

Minority Report,"I really did enjoy the movie. Tom Cruise is always a great lead and the way Spielberg blends multiple genres together for this one film is nothing but masterful.

"""Minority Report"" - 10/10","""Minority Report"", I think is about as realistic as a future science-fiction thriller could possibly get. It has a very realistic setting, characters and a police system that sometime, not too far down the road, is eerily possible. The whole ""pre-crime"" issue is what is at this film's heart.Suppose a person was to get arrested before they are able to commit a crime.Even today, this is possible, but only through the most careful of planning. But we cannot rely on careful planning forever, though. So in ""Minority Report"", we have the Pre-Cognitives (pre-cogs), three psychic human beings who are suspended in a flotation tank and are able to sense future crimes that are going to be committed. We learn that they are never wrong. (The actual details of a crime can be a little fuzzy, but it usually is nothing serious that will detract from making an arrest.) But they can sometimes disagree. So a ""minority report"" is filed whenever there is a disagreement amongst the pre-cogs. This sets up the film's plot which involves pre-crime cop Tom Cruise going on the run to prove his innocence when the pre-cogs name him as a future murderer.This is by far Steven Spielberg's most complex film to date. Though this is not Spielberg's first venture into science-fiction, it is his best. Tom Cruise makes a very believable protagonist here. The entire issue of ""Pre-Crime"" is treated as something of a flawed advance in law enforcement. It raises questions of how the police can be truly certain that a person is going to commit a crime or is it inevitable that the future can be altered. You see, it is all just too complex to really put into words here, you just have to watch the movie and form your own thoughts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

If You Dig Up the Past...,"This film marks a triumphant return of the Fritz Langian (Dir. of Metropolis)/ Kubrickian style of film making, one that questions government and personal freedom. What Spielberg did here was part of his ""Running Man Series"" (A.I, Catch Me if You Can, Minority Report), where he presented a multi-layered character, John Anderton, running from the law after being framed for a murder he did not commit. Yet. I stress ""Yet"" because of the Pre-Crime System that is the leading tool in crime in the year 2054, which leads the police to chase after John. The film follows the wrongfully accused John as he evades both the law and his past and tries to seek justice in the end. This film is truly a smart and cunning look at society today and where we are heading. For those of you who are fans of the original 100+ page short story by sci-fi guru Philip K. Dick, you will notice that the subject matter has taken a morose yet poignant turn, giving John more of a past and a purpose.

Great concept but dated,"Watching this almost 20 years after the release hurts it, a lot. And that could be tossed aside, as two decades is quite some time, but then there is Matrix. Sure, comparing pretty much any movie with Matrix is tough, but a Spielberg movie with Cruise as the protagonist should definitely have aged better.Nevertheless, it is still a good movie. Cruise's acting is great, as is Farrel's (even if he's underused). The main concept of the movie is explored quite well and there is quite a lot to think about as you watch the story unravel.The characters and complex and relatable and there is a real sense of finding out what's happening alongside Cruise. The payoffs are there, even if the ending is not quite to my taste.But, in the end, it is hard not to get pulled away from it. The CGI, the aesthetic and even some of the camera angles constantly remind you that this is a movie. A good movie, but one that was definitely better in 2002.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Cruise gives one of the best performances of his career as a chief of a ""pre-crime"" department that prevents future crimes foreseen through the eyes of half-human/half machine triplets known as pre-cogs.Colin Farrell, of whom I'm no fan, delivers in this film as a man working for the government, and so does Samantha Morton, who plays one of the pre-cogs.This was one of the most interesting movies I have seen, and one of the best films of 2002.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Surprisingly good,"I was going to avoid this movie.  The combination of Tom Cruise (a lousy actor) and Steven Spielberg (a lousy director) sounded hellish.

A Fantastic Film,"So with The Minority Report TV show hitting the UK, I thought before I watch it I would re-watch the original film that the show is a sequel too and here is my review for it. The premise of the film is set in the future where a special police force manage to arrest murderers before they commit the crime, but an officer must go on the run when he himself is accused of a future murder.Main Character
Tom Cruise plays John Anderton here and he is really good, he just has that leading man about him here, he leans heavily into his Mission Impossible routes and delivers a really physical performance. Also his character has plenty of depth to him, you care about Anderton and as we follow his journey you get more invested and want to see him succeed. Also in typical Cruise fashion, he runs a lot here and lets face it Tom Cruise has the best run in Hollywood so appreciate it in all its glory here.Supporting Characters
To be honest this is mainly the Cruise show, but there is a solid supporting cast with him. First Colin Farrell plays an agent who goes against Cruise and he is great here, he also gives a very physical performance and when these two go head to head it is a joy to watch. Max Von Sydow plays Cruises boss here and he is great as always too, the relationship between the two of them feels real and genuine and it adds to the movie greatly. A young Samantha Morton plays Agatha and she is great too with a really interesting performance that adds layers to the film, which is strange when you think just recently she was Alpha on The Walking Dead. Other great actors such as Tim Blake Nelson, Peter Stormare and Neal McDonough add plenty to their roles and add quality to the film.Story
The story of this film has a really unique idea that has unfortunately been copied plenty of times since. This film has plenty of philosophical and deep conversations to be had and it does it in a great way while keeping this film exciting and keeping you on edge. For the first almost 2 hours, the film's plot is tight, exciting and interesting. But then I felt like the last 20 minutes wasn't very strong, there is a big twist but if you have watched any film ever you can see it coming from a mile away. Also the ending didn't do much for me, I won't go into spoilers but for a film that is so interesting it felt like the ending was a bit generic and plain.Script
The script is great, there is some fantastic dramatic dialogue here and interesting dialogue that keeps you invested. The script is really well written, in terms of keeping the plot interesting and not overcomplicating a film that could have been very easily overcomplicated so it deserves credit for that. There is also some nice little bits of humour added here that rises it above just a dull action film.Style
The style of the film is great, even though the film came out 18 years ago it still holds up and looks great, the tech looks really flashy and the whole world looks really cool. The cars in particular look really unique and cool, this film has some really cool action scenes in it, even though one of them clearly inspired an action scene in Attack Of The Clones which brings it down a little bit. It is also funny seeing what stores they thought would be popular in the 2050's, let's just say they get it totally wrong. But this films style is great and adds plenty to the whole experience.Overall
Overall, this is a fantastic film, an action thriller that has plenty of depth to it that should be on everybody's list to watch.Rating - 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
OK for a rainy afternoon,"Definitely not one of the best sci-fi films. Apart from the basic premise it was extremely derivative - if it had included aliens you could have laid money on them being 'little green men'. It has all of the trademark Spielberg traits, including an enormous dose of sentimental schmaltz and appalling sound. Why is it that he thinks that we should have to struggle to make out what the characters are saying?That said it wasn't a 'bad' film; just clichéd with some glaring plot holes and a 'hidden' villain who was identifiable in the first ten minutes. Tom Cruise didn't do too badly with the part, but then he is at his best with vapid 'techie' action heroes. Think 'Mission Impossible' - it's the same character.Don't bother paying money to see this - it's only worth watching on the TV when it's free. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
noisy Kubrick,"I always appreciate Spielberg's efforts to make real films, those that go beyond the simple entertainment that permeates his career. He gave us and still gives, from time to time, joyful moments. He is anchored in stories, and he has a visual shape to his own world, and that's something not that common in the work of directors who so often aim at massive diffusion. But he also wants to make good work, and indeed he knows what molds the great films. He knows it as a spectator, and he understands it as a filmmaker. But in this field, he is an incomplete creator, because he is never able that film selling mundane golden rule of giving the public what the public wants.Here he tackles Kubrick. He had done it the year before with the disastrous Artificial Intelligence, which was a project Kubrick himself was apparently cherishing at the time of his death. Spielberg couldn't handle it, and made one of his worst films, which is not at least watchable. He tries to make it up here, and he partially does it. He chooses Cruise, who had been in Kubrick's final effort. Cruise is relatively weak, or at least not suited for adventurous flights, he is straightforward and what he does as an actor doesn't reflect any kind of understanding of the rules of the game he is supposed to be playing. Kubrick didn't took him, he took a couple who was it already for the publics eyes. Besides, Tom's character there is supposed to be clueless. Well, here as well, but he is allowed to take the lead of the narrative. That is one of the flaws in this film: to allow Cruise to be the action figure everyone expects him to be blurs the emphasis the images and how they build realities should have. Also, the useless branches in the narrative main course deviate from the interesting potential this film had. Why do we need the revival of the romance between Anderton and his former wife? Or underlining so much the sorrow for his past losses? Well, because that reduces the risk that the audience would be put away by the film, and the producers wouldn't want that, and Spielberg wouldn't say no. Moralizing about how apparently perfect and fair systems are usually corrupted and their highest hierarchies is a minor flaw.But there are very good things in this film, and Spielberg is as well to be granted its strong points. He picks a Phil Dick story, which means he will work with memories, possible worlds, provisional realities. Dick's stuff is highly cinematic in its roots, because it is usually visual (literally here) and explores narrative: stories about storytelling. Also, that is the stuff that permeates some of Kubrick's most deep works. So that is table were Spielberg lays his skills, and he knows that. And he builds the skeleton well enough. We have a cop whose work is to interpret images. Those images are provided by three beings with a divine aura (the ability to provide us with images is sacrate!). The cop concludes the reality of the film through the images within the film. Because the validity of those images is unquestioned in the world of the film, the power to bend those images is limitless. So the story is a quest for being able to distinguish between truth and lies, but, and that is the real trick, truth and lies told by the images. Some bits are precious, like how the images that foresee Anderton as a murderer match the real events, or the footage of the drowned lady. But we don't watch these images long enough, and the images themselves are not powerful enough most of the times, and the outcome of everything is done in the fields of common, now outdated action films, not in the films of the images, like it would (and was) perfectly done by Kubrick, Antonioni, Wenders or de Palma.If i hit hard on Spielberg is because i treasure his imagination and his ambitions. I wish he'll do really well some day.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Minority Report is one of the best films in Tom Cruise's biography,"In my opinion, Minority Report is one of the best films of the last decade. Steven Spielberg at that time briefly retired from family, light films and made some really gloomy and very intense films, to which Minority Report belongs.The film was shot by the director in a definitely cold style, but the interest in what is happening on the screen does not decrease one degree! A short story by Philip K. Dick found its worthy form in a full-length movie. The action begins to rapidly fly forward from the very first frame. And those episodes where there are no chases and shootings are full of tension and drama in the performance of brilliant actors.Without a doubt, Minority Report is one of the best films in Tom Cruise's biography. The actor managed to combine drama and action in his role, the character is fully revealed with its advantages and disadvantages, and he really wants to empathize.Other roles are also filled with excellent actors. Max von Sydow played the classic role of senior mentor and part-time evil genius, which he did flawlessly. Colin Farrell evoked ambivalent feelings - at first you feel hostility towards him (due to a conflict with the positive hero of Tom Cruise), and closer to the final you openly worry about him and sympathize. Samantha Morton also performed well as a seer. The actress gave herself completely to her character and realistically showed the seer's behavior in the terrible conditions of the crime prevention system.The dissenting opinion looks at one breath right up to the finale. A captivating plot, excellent acting and directing, brilliant special effects from the ILM studio will justify all your hopes for this fantastic thriller!In Minority Report, Tom Cruise's character says: Everybody run away! But where do we run from Spielberg and Cruise? See Special Opinion. You won't regret it at all!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Grade B murder mystery with sci-fi overtones.,"Another soulless, Godless offering from Spielberg. The P. K. Dick story that Spielburg briefly acknowledges that the movie is based upon is neither. Dream works continues to disappoint and rely too much on special effects instead of real human characterization and feeling. The only exception in the movie was the main character's near worship of his dead son; with spirituality all but dead in his movies, I guess Spielberg has to give his characters something greater than themselves to look up to. A better actor than Cruise was also needed for the main character and would have been a nice compliment to the great special effects and put less of a burden on them to carry the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Great and involving plot, superb craftsmanship at every level and great futuristic world. Music is also excellent here as it elevates many scenes to higher level. Acting was very good by everyone but the standout was Samantha Morton as Agatha. In short, this is a very rewatchable movie that hold up like a charm.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"imaginative, interesting, but cold, and emotionless","I guess, I've never been much a fan of sci-fi, futuristic, techno movies....... Although, this film is interesting at first, then, it starts to get confusing, and I got lost....... Especially, when I couldn't care less about most of the characters, when they seem just as robotic, as the movie iteself......! I dislike cold movies, where characters role display no emotions, or care for much about anything....... We are human beings, and we have emotions, and I would appreciate if they display those characters in movies........ It was especially funny, seeing police chasing Tom Cruise, while wearing some sort of flying engine, that allows them to fly......... They just looked silly....... Tom Cruise gives his usual creditable performance....... I would recommend this movie, if you like sci-fi, techno films, and robotic characters........",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Smart and Thought provoking,"Minority Report is one of those rare science fiction movies that comes every once in a while to induce some weird, yet really intriguing and thought provoking ideas in our minds. The very idea of a pre-crime police department is simply cool to think about but also spooky.In the great hands of one of the greatest film directors of all time, Spielberg, Minority report has breathtaking visuals, a compelling story and a pretty good performance by Tom Cruise. It' also a very gruesome, no holds barred kind of movie. One could say it even feels dirty at times, but it does exactly what it sets out to do.There are a few things that bother me about the movie. Keep in mind this movie was released in 2002, which was more or less a pretty experimental age for CGI effects. The effects in movies like X-Men and Attack of the Clones simply do not hold up anymore and look like PS2 games. Although not entirely the case with Minority Report, some scenes do look pretty dated and the effects just look silly at times. There are also some pretty over the top action sequences in the movie and some over the top dialogue as well. Spielberg actually did this very well in the Indiana Jones movies, but those movies were supposed to be kind of over the top big budget silly movies (although pretty smart at the same time). In this movie sometimes it feels like it doesn't belong.Despite its flaws, Minority Report is a great sci-fi thriller that has some great ideas.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Exited for but Disappointed,"First, I really like this movie. BUT!!!! I had been waiting for this movie and reading about it and following the production for several years. Now, this was before Tom Cruise when all alien worshiping on us, and he was making really good movies. When I read that he and Spielberg were teaming up for a movie based on a by Philip K. Dick, I was stoked! I had been talking to my friends about this and when it came out I got some of them to go with me to see it. As we walked out of the theater, one of them asked me if it was all I had hoped for and worth the wait . . . and at that moment I realized it had the Star Wars Episode I feel to it. I was expecting the greatest movie ever, and all I got was a movie that was ""good"". Not great or something a geek like me should be following and waiting for so long, just something ""good"". Maybe if I had not been so hyped for so long I would've liked it better. But, oh well, it's better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Everybody Runs,Wow This Was An Awesome Movie I Loved Every Last Minute If Lot of great action Tom Cruise Doing His Thing,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
My opinion right after watching it for the first time...,"Being someone who has always had a strong interest in the future... particularly where our society and civilization is headed, what advancements we will make from the sociological to the technological to the spiritual... I have always enjoyed believable futuristic settings and scenarios in not only science fiction, but in all speculative fiction. So when I first saw the trailers for Minority Report I was immediately interested by the story, but I was looking at Tom Cruise in a Steven Spielberg action film which seemed very well polished and Hollywood. Naturally, I had my doubts. I waited until it appeared at the dollar theater and then procrastinated once again. Just recently, however, my roommates rented the DVD and I got my chance to check it out. Overall, I cannot confidently state anything negative about it without becoming more analytical than I care to. The setting was mostly believable, allowing a stretch or two for the precognition that the story is structured around. The characters were given a few touches here and there of depth, notably the way Tom Cruise's character had dealt with his loss of a loved one and how the side-effects of that were still affecting his life. The story was moderately complex, which was more than I expected, and actually surprised me more than once. In closing, I would most likely watch this film again, but I doubt that I'll ever end up buying a copy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
A pointless assault on the senses.,"This film is nothing but a clothesline movie to hang special effects, action scenes and feeble attempts at humor. I won't talk about how ridicules and unbelievable the plot is, it would take too much time.  What really surprises me is that people like it.  Are we really so brain dead that we must be bombarded with visuals every few seconds to watch a film?  The interaction between people in this film could have been done with robots. Wait a minute. I think they were.Don't waste your time on this trash and just go rent blade runner again",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Intriguing and Original...""Minority Report"" soars","When most first hear the plot of ""Minority Report"", they roll your eyes and think ""Sure, whatever."" I was certainly one of the many who didn't find the concept intriguing, but, more or less, stupid. I am a huge Tom Cruise fan  but then again, who isn't?  as well as a huge Collin Farrel fan. To see both extreme talents in one movie seemed like heaven. Add Steven Spielberg, one of the great directors of our time, to the mix and you've got a real treat. But with such a silly plot, I doubted the movie could be anything over okay. Needless to say, I was wrong.In the year 2054, John Anderton (played by Tom Cruise) leads a group of cops under a program called ""Pre Crime"". Pre Crime is the futuristic way to track murderers. Inside a ""temple"" are three ""Pre Cogs"". Pre Cogs are basically humans who were born with the gift of seeing murders before they happen. Three of them, the main being Agatha (played by Samantha Morton), are kept inside the temple. Whenever a murder in the Washington D. C. area is about to happen, the Pre Cogs sense it and a short clip of that murder is projected onto a screen. Anderton and his team look the video over and find out where the murder will take place. To put all that in a nutshell: Pre Crime lets cops see murders before they happen, enabling the cops to stop them. That's just the basics right there; the actual system is both more impressive and complex.Pre Crime is a system used only in Washington D. C. The founder of the system is Lamar Burgess (played by Max von Sydow), who would just love to make Pre Crime go national. Collin Farrel's character is Danny Witwer. Danny is a detective sent by the government to look over Pre Crime; Danny claims that he can find a flaw in the Pre Crime system.So here's the real start of the story: The Pre Cogs sense a murder coming up. Big deal, right? It's just another D. C. murder for the records, right? Wrong. This time, the killer is none other then John Anderton himself. In about thirty-two hours John is supposed to kill Leo Crow, a man he's never met. Obviously this is a problem, and John is forced to run from his own ""employees"", now being lead by Danny Witwer.So, you ask, where does the title come in? I'll skip circles around a spoiler and tell you that a minority report is an alternate way of murder. If I told you anything more then that, I'd have to give away a major plot point. Once you discover the value and meaning of a minority report, the entire film takes a different turn for you.Tom Cruise is as great as ever as John Anderton. Though he at first seems like a run-of-the-mill cop, we discover he's much more then that. What would have been a lifeless cop is a great one with Cruise in the role. Also exceptional is Collin Farrel as Witwer. I still find it amazing that Farrel can make himself sound American, not his native Irish, in practically every film he does. That proves a good actor.Every movie has something that could be changed to make it better. Though ""Minority Report"" is an exceptional movie by most means, it fails in one. That would be the colors the film is shot in. I have never seen a movie that showed so much blue, black, and brown and such little of every other color. Everything in the film has a blue glow; a soft brown in it. The colors can get very distracting and sometimes they seem to take away from the over-all feel of the film. All the shots are nice and clean though, and Spielberg hasn't started using the now-popular ""shaky camera"" affects yet.The plot at first seems simple and predictable, but it takes many twists and turns along the way. A plot that seems silly becomes intriguing. The acting is good, the direction is good, and the ending is a sure-fire knockout that just might blow you out of your seat.MINORITY REPORT: RATED PG-13  VIOLENCE, SOME SEXUALITY, A FEW BAD WORDS 3 ½ OUT OF 4 STARS BOTTOM LINE: INTRIGUING",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

The system in question consists of three precogs who can see the future. The murderer therefore never commits the crime, but is still sentenced.Tom Cruise plays John Anderton who is responsible for stopping the murders based on the information provided by the precogs.

It just reiterates everything a viewer of any sophistication already figured out, and leaves nothing to debate or chew on afterward, not to mention being unforgivebly cliche and unoriginal.

another indication why Spielberg is one of the great movie artists,"`Minority Report' is the latest audacious triumph from America's premier filmmaker, Steven Spielberg.  Unlike most successful directors, who are content to rest on their laurels and keep producing works of similar theme and content, Spielberg is not afraid to test the limits of his medium by producing works that are both spellbinding and visionary.  He is even willing to risk alienating a mass audience unequipped or unwilling to come along with him on his journey of discovery (which partly explains the relative box office failure of his masterful `A.I.' in 2001).  It is ironic that Spielberg, who is often charged (falsely) will being largely responsible for the `dumbing down' of American movies over the past several decades, is now making more intelligent and adult-oriented films than virtually anyone working in Hollywood today.The theme of `Minority Report' is very similar to the one found in `A Clockwork Orange':  just how far are we willing to go in trading away a person's civil rights in order to achieve a society devoid of the threat of crime and violence.  In `Orange,' the society of the future attempted to head criminality off at the pass by `reprogramming' potential criminals before they had the chance to actually commit the crimes.  `Minority Report,' based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, creates a future society that has managed to find a way to do virtually the same thing, only, in this case, scientists have enlisted the aid of genetic mutants who have the ability to witness murders before they happen and can then pass that information on to the authorities.  Law enforcement now becomes a matter of apprehending and imprisoning criminals BEFORE they have even committed the crime.  The problem arises when John Anderton, one of the `Pre-Crime' agency's top cops, is himself shown to be a future murderer.  The plot of the film becomes, essentially, the classic chase story, in which an `innocent' man must elude his pursuers while at the same time unraveling the clues that will ultimately lead to his proving his innocence.  From this material, writers Scott Frank and John Cohen have fleshed out an intricate and fascinating plot that keeps us guessing all the way to the film's finale.In many ways, though, it is not in the narrative details that `Minority Report's true greatness lies (after all, this story is basically a redo of this year's earlier, abysmal `Imposter,' which, by the way, was also derived from a Dick story).  It is the vision that Spielberg brings to the material that sets it apart.  Rarely have we ever seen a future world brought so vividly and believably to life as it is here.  Set in 2054, the film is a total visual masterpiece.  Aided by astonishing production design, cinematography and special effects, Spielberg has created a universe unlike any we have seen before.  One of his most triumphant moves is to not try and imagine the future in totally unfamiliar terms.  Most of the clothes and furnishings seem strangely similar to what we have today.  The effect of this is to help us identify with the characters in a way that might not have been possible had everything been made to seem alien and unrecognizable. What the filmmakers do emphasize in their vision of the future world is the constant barrage of audio/visual stimuli that come in the form of things like personalized holograms and animated periodicals which pinpoint just how close our own world is moving towards this sort of all-encompassing sensory overload.In a day and age in which even the most elaborate special effects can elicit a yawn from the audience, Spielberg still shows that he has the ability to dazzle us.  There is a chase scene done on a vertical superhighway that far surpasses anything in this summer's `Spiderman' or `Attack of the Clones' for sheer breathtaking ingenuity and excitement.  In fact, on the visual/special effects level alone, `Minority Report' makes those other two films look like first-year film school pikers.  It's also impossible to convey just how extraordinarily brilliant cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's work is on this film.  With his muted color scheme and emphasis on glowing whites, Kaminski brings a true otherworldly quality to Spielberg's vision.Like all great Spielberg films (and there are so many we can't even count them anymore), `Minority Report' packs a wallop both in the overwhelming intensity of its action sequences and in the quiet moments of subtle reflection where the filmmaker affords us glimpses into the workings of the human heart.  The director is helped immeasurably in the first case by the brilliant editing of Michael Kahn, and in the second by the outstanding performance of Tom Cruise in the lead role.  Cruise has rarely brought such dramatic intensity or such emotional depth to any character the way he does to John Anderton.  The long delayed and long anticipated collaboration between one of the world's greatest directors and one of the world's most charismatic stars has resulted in a film worthy of both of their talents and reputations.In a time when filmmakers like George Lucas seem mired in the successes of their past, Spielberg continues to move ahead and to develop ever more as an artist.  Even if he were to stop making movies today, Spielberg's oeuvre would put him in the pantheon of the world's greatest film artists of all time.  But let us hope he will continue to make films for a very long time to come.  We eagerly await all those future masterpieces.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Interesting retelling of Shakespeare's Macbeth,The great film with some great ideas. It has all the elements of Macbeth.

The Patriot Act...evovled.,"One of the better science fiction films that has come out in the past few years, I was pleasantly surprised by Minority Report. The visuals are simply stunning and really get your imagination going. Not only are they nice to look at, they're fairly probable. I especially enjoyed the cars that drive themselves and take you up to your apartment or condo. The retina scanning cameras that are everywhere are also very realistic. The US government is already trying to implement biological modes of identification besides simply having you give your fingerprint at the DPS station to renew your driver's license. In all actuality, it's fairly feasible, even scary. Although the film takes place in the not so distant future, it's more like 1984.Tom Cruise is a hit or miss for me, sometimes he's enjoyable and sometimes I want to crush his head in a vise. It always seems to be a toss up, but he does a decent job here. Colin Farrell outshines him though as the investigator of Pre-Crime who's trying to dig up dirt on Cruise's character, although his role is minimal. You really do hate him at first because of his character, which is a good sign that he did a nice job...even if he reminds you of a gibbon monkey or a man in a Gillette Mach 3 commercial. Let's just pray suspenders aren't around in the future. Overall a very entertaining film from Spielberg with some excellent action sequences and a few decent twists. But since it is Spielberg, you always know how the film will end. Nice and pretty, everything's fine and you get breakfast in bed while winning the lottery. If he didn't always end films the same way, it might make his movies more enjoyable as you wouldn't be able to predict what type of ending they'd have.

The special effects were well done, but not awe inspiring.  The dialogue was nothing that moved me.  The acting was solid and Tom Cruise did well, but the plot was quite plain and predictable.  I really expected more from those involved with this film, but maybe this is the tripe that most mainstream moviegoers eat up.  Eck.  How it can rate in the top 100 movies on IMDB, I'll never know as I can think of at least 200 better movies.  But Spiderman did the same before it deservedly fell further back.

The Finest Film Spielberg Has Ever Made,"There is only one film for me, just one exclusively, that flawlessly captures every last ounce of director Steven Spielberg's finesse and meticulous expertise. That film is 'Minority Report' (2002).Imagine the year is 2054, in Washington, D.C. A time when the planet is smothered in Artificial Intelligence, dominated by invasive targeted advertising and intrusive security extents, a world existing in the midst of a technological domination. The District Of Columbia is 100% murder-free thanks entirely to the astoundingly reliable specialised police department ""Pre-Crime"", which identifies killers before they commit their murders. It is captained by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), a Father crushed by the disappearance of his son Sean, living a hollow existence lined only with the self- destruction of guilt. To compensate, he joined Pre-Crime. The system relies on the precognitions of the""Pre-Cogs"", Arthur and Dash – the twins – and Agatha (Samantha Morton), the natural leader, the most gifted. Three mutated humans with psychic abilities. And yes, I tell you now, those names are indeed references to the three great mystery writers: Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Dashiell Hammett. But when Anderton is framed for a future murder, he has just 36 hours to prove his innocence.The Pre-Cogs are surviving examples of children born from parents addicted to the fictional drug Neuroin (a heroin-like drug) under scientific experimentation. Most of these children wouldn't live past the age of 12, yet these three were seen as ""gifted"", graced with a certain talent. They would wake up at night screaming, shaking in the corner as they saw murder over and over, an image that continually haunted them. It wasn't long before someone realised that these dreams were murders that were actually happening and so they were exploited for use in Pre-Crime. Hyper-sensitive brain scanners read activity in the brain tissue of the Pre-Cogs and an intricate electronic system displays the images they see onto monitors.That is what Pre-Crime is dependent upon; three genetic mutants heavily drugged, generally unaware of their surroundings and conditions, predicting the future. From there, it's up to the officers to analyse the images they're given on the screens to find where this murder is taking place. And, seeing as it'll be going nation-wide soon, cocky Department Of Justice representative Agent Danny Witwer (played with excellent charisma by Colin Farrell) comes along to supervise and ultimately dictate everything. The system is perfect, it's never wrong. However, the Pre-Cogs have been known to disagree occasionally a record of their disagreement is known as 'minority report', of which the film gets its title from.So this is the future? The Earth has finally surrendered to these bombarding technological advances that occur so swiftly that us petty humans have to keep running just to stay in the exact same place. ""The Red Queen Hypothesis"" is most certainly a relevant factor in this world. The streets are littered with ruthlessly efficient Eye-Dentiscanners that identify the passing civilian and plagues them with targeted advertising from one of its countless gloriously attractive holographic advertisements, calling their name directly to seize attention. ""John Anderton! You could use a Guiness right about now!"" shouts one of the invisible voice with its corny fiddle soundtrack from the remarkable glass walls that dazzle and distract passers-by. This film is crammed with product-placement: visual telecommunication screens by Nokia, exotic holidays with holographic Hawaiian girls for American Express, GAP clothing, Bvlgari perfume, and even Lexus designed an entire car for this film! The greatest element of 'Minority Report' is its believability. All this incredible technology, from transport pods that drive themselves on vast freeway networks with vertical inclines to singing cereal packets, has been presented in a fashion so rich and affluent in detail that it seems so real.To ensure the utmost plausibility of a world where even the walls of alley-ways are technological, alive with grotesque public announcements, Spielberg consulted numerous scientists. The effect of all this is a result so immaculately polished that even now, nine years after release, it is still realistic.There is so much to admire, adore, appreciate, and question in this deliciously complex film. I reserve it specially as the only film I have ever seen in which Tom Cruise presents a clear ability to act. Most films starring Tom Cruise feature Tom Cruise in the cast playing Tom Cruise! Yet in this, with the professional guidance of Spielberg, Cruise plays his character with brilliant realism. He is almost constantly engaging. Other factors to be remembered of this film are its screenplay. The story behind this film is so beautifully active, but the explanation that is presented to the viewers is abstract. This is a rare example of a mystery film, entirely due to the deliverance of its magnificent plot-line; there is never an example when, like many other initially promising but subsequently destroyed films, the plot is given to us on a silver tray. It is flattering to the viewer's intelligence to be able understand this film. Its complexity and intrigue, which is unravelled gradually, makes the wonderful experience of explanation feel so much more rewarding.Another feature is the musical score, by John Williams. The addition of Williams' soundtrack lifts the film, providing one of the finest examples I can imagine of giving suspense to otherwise already extremely exciting scenes. For instance, when Anderton is escaping Danny Witwer and his men through an automobile manufacturing factory, the thumping trumpet blasts and violin shrieks are reminiscent to his Oscar-winning score of 'Star Wars Episode VI: A New Hope' (1977).'Minority Report' is my absolute favourite Steven Spielberg film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
I'm sure I'm in the Minority.,"This movie was okay. The tech stuff at the start of the movie was really interesting but it fell back into the same stuff we've seen before. After the gadgets the story was the same as before. One of the main problems was that the issue was only a personal one not one that had any greater social significance. A simple example is that Anderton did not, to any great degree that I could tell, question the fact that what had happened to him could be happening and could have happened to others. The process of law that he was so gung ho to be leader of turned around and bit him in the ass. He never questions(looks inside of himself)the ramifications of this problem. Anyone involved in such a sweeping law of justice would have to question what he has been doing. Examples of movies that reach outside of just the individual are Matrix, Fight Club, Blade Runner. These films find the connection from the personal to the community. They also show characters questioning the 'idea' of their problem. Example, in Blade Runner, Harrison Ford's character ends up questioning the definition of what it is to be human. Film's like Minority Report are great when your young(audience and filmmaker) but the really great movies capture all ages with a deeper meaning; ie Matrix, Blade Runner.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

"Spielberg and Dick Deliver Concept First, Tangible Story Second","Steven Spielberg tackles a customarily big-brained Philip K. Dick concept, discarding most of the novella's story beats while retaining its core premise and tricky moral dilemmas. Set half a century in the future, Spielberg's forecast depicts an America that's more advanced, more heavily reliant upon its technology, but still socially familiar. The key talking point is pre-crime, an ethically dubious predictive technique that's been employed by law enforcement to completely eliminate homicide in Washington DC, but the stage is sprinkled with all manner of cute, interesting and downright prescient bits of dreamy theoretical hardware. Nobody bats a thousand with this stuff, and while PD jetpacks and nausea-inducing cattle prods haven't yet entered the the market, the film's anticipation of self-driving electric cars seems on track and its widespread use of draggable touch screen interfaces predate iOS by a full three years.So, as a practical forecast / demo reel for smart, life-enhancing tech, Minority Report is a real wonderland. As a narrative, it's frequently hamstrung by jerky pacing, significant plot holes and long-winded exposition. When high profile pre-crime detective Tom Cruise is framed by his own system, he goes on the lam in search of answers. That quest carries him to the doorstep of the retired geneticist who developed the prognostic network, and there we're subjected to an obscenely fast-paced crash course on the concept's ins and outs. In that five minute sequence, I don't think she pauses for more than half a breath, brain dumping a hefty pile of dry elaboration as if she were reciting from a technical manual. Were that the only example, I might have raised an eyebrow, shrugged and moved on. Instead, it's the first of many such brake-screeching halts, convenient excuses to drone on about ideas that would have been better-served by practical examples. Man, does this film know how to belabor its points.When their course is cleared, Spielberg and Cruise can be trusted to deliver some stirring slices of action and suspense. A fiery fight scene in the guts of an automated assembly plant, for example. A modified elevator escape on the edge of a towering residential complex. Recovering from a painful eye transplant to avoid detection by the vast network of face scanners (another bit of prophecy that now seems uncomfortably precise), Cruise fights detection in a losing battle that keeps us teetering on the edge of our seats. It's all proficiently done, leveraging a wealth of dazzling sci-fi concepts into a string of thoughtful, exciting blockbuster scenes. Another of Minority Report's strengths is its distrust of reckless advancement; constant reminders that (to paraphrase another Spielberg hit) just because we can do something, doesn't mean we should. The storyline hinges on this point, both in the projected infallibility of the pre-crime apparatus and in the misuse of the three drugged, unwillingly captive ""precogs"" that power the whole system. These points are the film's lifeblood, but too often they're overshadowed by an excessively twisty narrative and a weird tendency to spell everything out.I loved this in theaters, wowed by all the big ideas and gray morality. Revisiting it now, two decades later, I was more impressed by its window dressings than by its cinematic execution. The story has a lot of oomph, but the script is wordy and overwrought, the special effects have seams showing and the third act drags on forever. Still good, but no longer great, this one's best remembered for its high-minded speculative work than its dramatic chops.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"""Boring Report"" is More like it.","Too long, too long, too long, too long...by about forty minutes.  This would have been a much more effective movie had Spielberg opted for ""addtion by subtraction"".  Because he opts for the extra length, this film collapses under it's own weight.  It begins well enough, ends typically, everything in between is muddled, predictable and boring.  Hence, most of it was expendable.  I don't understand why this film got such rave reviews, the actors gave journeyman performances and the special effects were good...but not great.  There was nothing here to set this film apart from any of the other mediocre, over long, self important sci-fi blockbusters that have been inflicted on us over the past few years.  Count yourself fortunate if you missed this in the theatre.  On DVD, at least, you can fast forward through the plodding, boring middle of the film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Trying to discover who's behind this betrayal he suddenly finds himself in a path which leads him to the missing dissapearance of his son which was taken from him six years earlier.

Observations on Comments,"Others have already provided articulate, nuanced comments for this film. Of course, the opinions run the gamut from Love or Hate, to Damning with Faint Praise.But in speed-scanning all posted comments, I feel I've noticed a trend; a dichotomy in the tone of reactions to the movie that may help those who have not seen it decide if it's worth their time and money.  (But after the the two numbered items below, I'm just rambling.)1.  Those who have stated or implied that they have READ any work by Philip K. Dick tend to have enjoyed the movie.  (This does not mean that they--or I--would have preferred Spielberg as director, or Cruise as lead protagonist.)2.  Commentators who don't mention that they've read any book by Dick tend to dislike the movie, or feel it's mediocre (beyond being reduced by Spielberg/Cruise.)I don't mean for this to be iron-clad, and the pleasure/disgust in viewing MR has been well-stated both ways.  It's also true that I've read a handful of Dick's novels, and find that his characters' themes of alienation, despair and worry about paying the rent play out well, as projected into futuristic settings (or revisions of history, as in The Man in the High Castle, and Radio-Free Albemuth.)Phil Dick used a life-long battle with obesity as an excuse to become an amphetamine addict (check the Author's Note at the end of his 1977 novel, A Scanner Darkly.)  His fans lost him in 1982--the speed-abuse had severely damaged his pancreas.  He was about 60.The year prior to his death, he gave an interview in which he stated that he believed his first novel was superb (Solar Lottery, 1955.  There are two other titles for it.  One was only used in a British edition of the work.) He flatly stated that his next 25 novels--and other short writings during the period--were ""junk....worthless.""  It's funny that the story from which Minority Report was derived was written during this time span.Presumably, the next ""quality"" novel Dick felt he had written was The Man in the High Castle, published in 1962.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Majority rules on `Minority Report',"So, the third of the four must-sees this summer movie season is out (Spider-Man, Attack of the Clones, this, Men In Black II) and I saw it last night.  With all the buzz about this flick being Steven Speilberg's best movie since Raiders of the Lost Ark, I felt as if I should've been standing in line on opening night.  I mean, that's pretty tall talk to be better than Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List.  Truth be told, I was almost willing to pay the $7.50 just to see the Daredevil and Red Dragon trailers. As for the main feature, the verdict is good.  Yes, I said `good.'  Well, I'll even go so far as to say `pretty darn good,' but certainly not `Speilberg's best since 'Raiders'.'  Just `pretty darn good.'The premise is by now well known: Washington, D.C. in the year 2054 has an experimental program in which murders are foreseen by mutated precognitives and potential perpetrators are arrested before their crime can be committed. The constitutional arguments are also pretty well known by now, but I don't have any intention of getting into a monologue about that, as the issue is covered in the movie and it's the movie I'm here to discuss.  Tom Cruise's policeman John Anderton is the chief of the `Precrime' department of the D.C. Police, and has a zeal for the program stemming from the disappearance of his 6-year old son in the days before the Precrime program.  When a representative of the Justice Dept. arrives to try to poke holes in the program's premise before the it's instituted nationally, Anderton is told by his boss, played by Max Von Sydow, to accommodate him.  The next thing we know, the `precogs' foresee Anderton committing a murder in less then three days' time, and the chase is on . . .Cruise once again displays his mastery of the `cold' acting method.  As he did to perfection in `Jerry Maguire' and `Born on the Fourth of July' (but for some strange reason abandoned in `Vanilla Sky'), he relates his character's anguish, anxiety, terror, etc., through subtle stares, sparse dialogue and body language.  No ranting and raving, no overly preachy stretches of dialogue; just a look in the right place here and a sentence under the breath there, and the audience gets the idea.  Staring at and speaking in unison with home-movie holograms and hobbling about his home strung out on inhaled illegal drugs, Anderton displays to us his personal misery, then returns to dedicated professionalism at the station-house the next day.  He does a fine job of carrying this movie.  Colin Farrell (who will play Bullseye in Daredevil next year) does a great job as the Justice Dept. errand-boy, playing him with just the right amount of swarminess (is that a word?) and intelligence.  Von Sydow's performance is terrific as well, and his role here continues the summer's theme of taking `senior' movie veterans and making wonderful use of them (Cliff Robertson in Spider-Man, Christopher Lee in Attack of the Clones).The visuals here are terrific.  The vision of Washington, D.C. 52 years from now is more believable than Blade Runner's prediction for Los Angeles of 2016.  The architecture and technology are not so omnipresent in the Capitol that we don't see life as we might would lead it.  With the exception of the superhighways, the technology depicted in the movie is a garnish to life at that time.  The bluish tint that Spielberg gives the film casts an almost sterile hue to the world we see there, such that blood, when spilled, is all the more garish to see.  I thought it was an interesting touch.  The sick-sticks and retina-scanning spider-robot bloodhounds used by law enforcement of the day were absolutely creepy.  The personalized advertisements and greetings depicted here instantly made me think of the crap accumulating in my e-mail box every day (lasmoak, give your lover a larger . . . or lasmoak, mortgage rates are now . . .), and this hitting-me-close-to-home gave a lot of other things in the movie credibility.  This movie shows us a world where fantasies can be lived out in a chamber is a lot closer than the holodecks of Star Trek.Okay, the story.  It's good.  Yes, I even said it was pretty good.  This film isn't a big-budget, slam-bang modern American Action Movie, and with good reason:  It isn't supposed to be.  It is big-budget, don't get me wrong, and it's all on the screen.  The visuals and the effects are terrific, and they enhance, not overpower, the plot.  This movie is a lot more cerebral than I expected, and that's always a welcome surprise in today's movies.  I confess that I wasn't prepared for the film-noir pace of the movie, as hearing all this comparison to `Raiders' had me set for a trill-a-minute-type spectacle.  Well, it ain't that, but it's good nonetheless.  Yes, the movie's 2 hours and 20 minutes, but I promise you that it doesn't feel like it.  Speilberg once again tells us a marvelous story, this one being expanded from a short story by Philip K. Dick, the author behind the works inspiring Blade Runner and Total Recall.  The clues unfold, the suspects sometimes surprise us and the confrontation at the end is not one easily predicted, despite it having been foreseen by the precogs (figure that one out for yourself).This is one to see, and while it ain't Raiders, it sure as heck beats Scooby-Doo.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Disappointing,"Well, this film is entertaining.  It is well thought out.  It is well written.  It is well directed.  And it is well acted.  However, it did not come up to my expectations.  Maybe this is because I had really high expectations.  At any event, I was a little disappointed with the final outcome.I think that one of the reasons is that there was so much time watching Detective Anderton going through the recorded images of the Pre-Cogs, waving his hands around with his fingers sticking out, or watching him jump from vehicle to vehicle on the magnetic car highway, or the wall projected images from the ""PC"" in Anderton's home.  This seemed to me to be more about Spielberg's image of the future than about a very good crime drama.  I think that's where the film lost me.  I also thought the CGI images weren't very good.  I would have expected better.Maybe a second viewing will change my mind, but this one is worth seeing at a matinee, not at a full price showing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Original and enjoyable science-fiction/thriller.,"""Minority Report"" is one visually splendid looking movie. It's a science-fiction movie made with lots of style and eye for detail for an imaginary futuristic society. Everything is nicely constructed which makes the movie somewhat believable to watch. Also non-fans of the science-fiction genre will probably enjoy seeing this movie.The movie perfectly mix entertaining lighthearted action and thought provoking issues.Steven Spielberg really is one great actor director. Tom Cruise is truly superb as the main character John Anderton. This movie also marked the breakthrough for now well known actor Colin Farrell who really is excellent in his role! It might very well be his very best role yet and when I saw this movie in the cinema back in 2002 I was really impressed by this 'new' unknown actor and expected great things from him in the future. It's a bit of a shame that he has never surpassed his ""Minority Report"" role yet and his choices of roles aren't always good but I still regarded him as a very good actor. Other fine roles are portrayed by movie veteran Max von Sydow, Steve Harris (probably best known for his role in ""The Practice""), Neal McDonough who worked with Spielberg before previously on the 10 part mini-series ""Band of Brothers"", Lois Smith, Tim Blake Nelson and Peter Stormare.Truly the best thing of the movie is the look of it. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski really surpasses himself at times and the use of light at times is simple stunning. There also is nothing wrong with the special effects and they look highly realistic and convincing, without ever overusing them. For some odd reason neither of those two elements were nominated for an Oscar. The only nomination it received was for 'Best Sound Editing'.To be honest, I have never been fond of the whole conspiracy theory element of the movie and I thought it was unfitting for the movie. It was a bit too heavy for such an entertaining movie as this one.All in all to be honest this wasn't exactly a movie I was blown away by but I most certainly was entertained by it.

"Those Who Do Not Find Spielberg's Dystopian Universe Hypnotic, Are Surely in the 'Minority'!","The year is 2054 and Washington DC is the host of a nervy experiment in crime prevention. Deep in the Pre-Crime agency lie the 'pre-cogs' - three psychics who dangle in liquid suspension, sharing their incriminating visions with the police. Devised by retired law enforcement officer Lamar Burgess (a brilliant Max von Sydow), the system uses the talents of these pre-cogs with exceptional psychic abilities who are kept in a constant state of dream sleep by a combination of mind-numbing drugs, partial immersion in a huge sensory-deprivation tank, and electronic 'halos' attached to their heads. Using the fragmented images seen by them, which are projected onto a screen, the agency is able to predict and prevent every murder that is about to happen in the city, deftly stepping in and arresting the suspect before the crime has even been committed, to let him rot in a suspended-animation prison. With no homicides in six years, it's a flawless system headed by a perfect guardian, Chief John Anderton (a riveting act by Tom Cruise). Motored by the death of his son, his Pavlovian impulse is to slam the lid on any homicide before it happens. A nifty prologue shows the system's ruthless efficiency, but the arrival of a rival detective Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell, all growl and snap) sets into motion an unbreakable chain of events that sees Anderton on the run from the very system he championed. Pre-cog Agatha (Samantha Morton, in an alternately touching and haunting performance) has marked him for murder and there's just 36 hours before his date with his secret victim. It's a set-up all right. But who's pulling the strings?From the description alone, Minority Report may appear to be wholly outrageous and borderline unbelievable. This being a work based on a story by Philip K Dick, wacko embellishments are a given, and with its singing cereal packets, vertical freeways, virtual shopkeepers and simulated reality parlors that make your wildest wish come true, Minority Report's world - a surreal cityscape of opulent chromes and 1940s grub - makes for an extraordinary spectacle, made all the creepier by a parched and seedy color palette. If the universe is fully immersive, so is the plot thanks to a screenplay which is hardboiled but never scrambled and the dialogue which is sour and smart-mouthed.But above all, Minority Report works because of its director Steven Spielberg, who deftly juggles an intricate plot. The storyline allows him ample room to accent and detail - and no one is better at building a fictional reality than Mr. Blockbuster. Although this film is nearly three hours long, it is constantly exhilarating, either from the standpoint of its futuristic vision or its tense plot line. Spielberg packs the frame with reminders of humanity trudging along despite the bleakness of its surroundings, delivering a product which is well-rendered, technically and emotionally, as the subtler moments resonate with real sentiment and insight.Minority Report is not just some fairy tale gussied up with hi-tech cars and cool costumes and called science-fiction.

Potentially Great Film Falls Flat,"By the end of ""Minority Report,"" I felt cheated that a wonderful premise, fraught with social and political ambiguity, and the makings of a potentially great film, so completely, tragically missed its mark. It is difficult for me to believe that this is the film Spielberg wanted to make. It is visually interesting, if self-consciously so, but there is little substance behind the high-tech crap. And moments of 'levity'--inserted, I suppose, to occasionally lighten up the tone of the film--is sophomorically, embarrassingly silly (small SPOILER: like Tom Cruise chasing after his runaway eyeballs). The only aspect that was, for me, mildly engaging was the plight of the ""precogs,"" especially Agatha, movingly portrayed by Samantha Morton. The only other performance of note is by the wonderful Tim Blake Nelson (of 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' fame), who certainly knows how to make the most of a small role. The rest, even the great Max von Sydow, cannot rise above the clumsy script and even clumsier direction (sorry, Steven). Dashing Tom Cruise slaps on a face of grim determination and tries to pass it off as acting. Colin Farrell, equally dashing and determined, pulls off a Javert-like performance that is solid, if not illuminating. (One more possible small SPOILER) The happily-ever-after ending was especially annoying to me, and persuaded me from a passive ""oh-well-you-can't-win-'em-all-Steven"" attitude to an active dislike for this unbelievably sloppy film. ** out of *****.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Food for Thought,"Intriguing and thought provoking since the plot itself revolves around mental abilities of some unique humans.Movies and Writers dealing with Time Travel, Psychic Pre-cognitive abilities and the like, face the tricky issue of convincing their audience/readers that the logic holds good in whatever is portrayed in the storyline.And Spielberg does a great job in keeping you riveted to your seat throughout the movie raising mind boggling thoughts of futuristic human societies with interconnected telepathic abilities, Internet style and what not.But come outside, after the movie and you begin thinking and asking questions and find the story has its flaws.  Only three PreCogs monitoring a city with millions of people ? And how is PreMeditation defined here ? A crime may be rehearsed a  thousand times mentally but never get to be committed at all. It would then be a crime to even 'think' violent crime and one couldn't make movies or write novels either about crime. And one thing is for sure. Prediction is an impossibility. There are too many parameters controlling human behaviour to be accurate about it. One more thing. That scary wet eyeball in the packet which Andertons wife used for retinal id. Cant the dumb machine make out the difference between a living pulsating eyeball and a dead one that would already have started collapsing and decaying with a change in form and content ? Watchable movie... Mmm Well, OK.. Enjoyable!",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
I wasn't expecting this.,"I wasn't expecting much of this movie, so when I sat down with my friends to see it, I was positively surprised to see that this movie had something more going than just a lot of futuristic action with no content.Of course, like all futuristic movies, it has glitches (lots and lots) and you shouldn't try to disassemble the movie, but it's hard not to. Remember the Back To The Future trilogy ? Remember Blade Runner ? Remember AI ? Remember Mission: Impossible ? This Spielberg. This is homage to Philip K Dick (who's novel the movie's based upon). This is homage to Stanley Kubrick (for whom Spielberg finished the directing of AI). This is Tom cruise. This is a movie filled with references, you won't catch them all the first time, but it sure does a lot for your viewing pleasure. This is science-fiction at it's best (at least this year).So, if you don't go too deep into the logic and consistency of the movie, you'll find that this is quite an enjoyable adventure into the Spielberg movie-magic.I give this movie a rating of ****/***** - Tom Cruise is excellent (as always, ok, I'm a fan, sorry) and the movie's a blast.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Flawed by principle but entertaining,"Films relying on concepts like time travel or ""privisioning"" of the feature mostly fail from the logical standpoint, simply by the paradoxs created. So is ""Minority Report"". Overseeing this, the story and the special effects are at least entertaining. The issues raised by the future presented (total supervision etc.) to the viewer also provide some grounds for intellectual engagement but being a mainstream release this parts remains kinda shallow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Minority Report gets a A+,"When people go to the movies, they go with a lot of emotion build up inside of them. Those emotions can be happy, sad, angry or even excitement. Steven Spielberg is particularly one of the best movie director out there in Hollywood today. He can make movies the way movies were meant to be made. He makes movies that are filled with wonder, magic, and even thrills. But, in this science-fiction thriller made by Spielberg, those emotions are obvious to the audience. In Minority Report, Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the chief of Washington D.C. PreCrime police force. As the movie opens, Anderton and his fellow colleagues witness an upcoming murder from a future killer, who's planning to commit a future crime. The way it works is that in 2054 A.D., PreCrime can stop a future criminal from having to commit a future crime. In other words, catch the criminal before he or she commits the crime. For the last six years, Washington D.C. has been murder-free because of PreCrime. Furthermore, the PreCogs that are used in this police unit can see visions of the future. There are three of them, each of which are stationed inside a pool of milk. These PreCogs have precognitive abilities to see their future murders. Everything seems to be okay for Anderton until one day he witnesses himself committing a future crime. Now, how did that happen? Anderton quickly tries to hide the footage and is forced to run from the law as he tries to dodge the police every which way he can. Colin Farrell plays Danny Witwer, an very risky Department of Justice agent in the PreCrime unit. Witwer and Anderton inexplicably creates a tension between themselves even at the beginning of Anderton's run from the law. Max Von Sydow plays the official of the PreCrime unit and is also Anderton's superior. He is also drawn into the investigation. Meanwhile, Witwer tries to replace Anderton's position by placing himself as the chief of the PreCrime police force. Most of the movie consists of Anderton trying to outrun the law by avoiding them at any costs. Some of the action sequences in Minority Report are very well-directed by Spielberg. One of my favorite out of all of them is when Anderton gets into a fight with Witwer inside a car factory. The storyline of Minority Report gets complicated, I think, because the movie wants us to solve this entire mystery behind all of the technology that this world has in store. But, there's more to that. The movie also deals with specific themes of mistaken identity and family relationships. We even see how Anderton deal with the pain and suffering throughout the movie with him feeding himself pills and medication. Even more specifically, we see a distinctive relationship between him and his son, who drowned in a swimming pool. The story of Minority Report was based off a short story by cult science-fiction author Phillip K. Dick. To me, Dick's other movie adaptations including Blade Runner and Total Recall were also very successful critically, but also holds a deeper meaning to the hardware. In both movies, you can see the everyday man being forced into a situation where technology affects their surroundings and themselves. The cinematography is absolutely well photographed with a bleached-colored tint. The look of the movie is fascinating to see and eye-popping to look at. Spielberg's vision of the future has never been more better than before. This is the second Steven Spielberg's movie to be set in the future during the early 2000's. His other sci-fi film, A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, was also a very good looking movie. Minority Report is certainly one of the best movies of 2002. The feel and look of the movie makes it seems that Spielberg was actually making a tech-noir film, which he did. The one other criticism that I have about Minority Report is that this movie focuses more on everyday themes that affect our society. That is significant to other science-fiction movies as well. But, the way Minority Report portrays those themes makes us wonder about the world we live in. This movie did come out in the early 2000's and according to my critical praise of this movie, I can only say this world is probably moving a lot more faster, even though technology is making several advantages and advances in our everyday lives. You can love it or you hate it, but you can't underestimate technology in the 21st century. The world is changing and we are too. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Thrill Ride with great performances...""Muuurrddder!""","Wow. What a rush. Two words to describe the film are ""thrill ride"", but not a thrill ride where all the loops and dips are seen, but one that keeps you guessing,and can sometimes completely startle you. I was amazed, not only at theamazing cinematography, the beautiful score by John Williams, and the pulsepounding story, but by Tom Cruise. I normally can't stand him, but this filmallowed me to look at him differently. He didn't seem to be Tom Cruise in this one. He really embodied John Anderton. Plus, performance-wise, thesupporting cast is better then excellent, with Samantha Morton as Agatha thePrecog being the stand out performance throughout. Just her saying ""Murder""will send chills down your spine, no doubt.One thing I will say is that this film is not for everyone. The intense nature of it may be hard for fans of Spielberg's more lighthearted fare to swallow. But, for those looking for a new Spielberg, the change is a welcome one. The cold dark future that is portrayed is one that is very, very possible, and sometimesfreightning to realize. Spielberg did a bang up job showing how technology'sadvances will only increase our lack of privacy. Amazing, and very truthfulrealization.Plot holes aside (they are few, and far between, and most people wouldn't catch them), this film's plot moves so fast, that sometimes its hard to catch up. Each moment of it will keep you guessing, which keeps the audience always on their toes. You will never know what it coming, and that adds the the intrigue of this very film-noir-esque film.One aspect of the film I found the most interesting had nothing to do with the actual film... It was the ad campaign that is seen on TV and in the Trailers. I applaud Spielberg for, how shall I say, diverting audiences attention. I won't say any more, but you may be pleasently surprised to find out that even before you even see the film, you really have no idea what its about. That's greatadvertising, in my opinion.My only problem with the film is that in the end, the plot is very familiar. You won't recognize it while watching it, but its there. I won't say what film this one almost parallels, but if you've seen this other film, you may recognize it after viewing Minority Report. But, there are enough differences  between the twofilms to not make it a real issue. It won't bother the average film viewer, but it kind of bothered me, but nothing to change my opinion of the film.To sum it all up, this is not a film to be missed. If you saw A.I. and hated it, this one should redeem Spielberg for you. If you loved A.I., you should love Minority Report even more. I hope this film stands out as a breath of fresh air in the usually dull summer fare, and that it will be the surprise hit of the summer. 9.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Some Philosophical Ponderings,"The Philosophical Problem: arrest and detention of ""criminals"" before they committed any crime - the future is certain, as the crime is divined by three ""gifted"" humans who lie submerged in a tank of neurotransmitters at the Precrime center. They feed visions of future murders to the police, who prevent the commission of the crime.In a word: We have the arrest and imprisonment of ""criminals"" absent the actus reas, although the guilty mind is certainly at work.Result: The crime rate plummets - pre-meditated murder is obviated. Only the odd ""crime"" of passion remain.Philosophical Assumption: we live in a deterministic world; time is a running reel, each effect determined by its antecedent cause.Caveat: when we are made aware that we will commit a crime of passion -the film gives the agents a choice to execute or avoid.Problem: its incoherent to have a vision of a future if that future is in any way alterable. Assuming determinism, there is one future, a still shot of the running reel.Problem: if the crime is prevented, the future ""crime"" reported by the precogs is impossible - the future is the prevention of the ""crime"" - and then it really becomes confusing.Solution: the precogs report likely futures, taking into account the antecedent circumstances, they report a highly probable occurrence, that for any number of reasons focus on violence and crime. They could just as well ""see"" the apple falling from the tree and landing in the bush.Problem: the intervention of the probable act renders that event highly unlikely - now we're in the land of contradiction, and absurdity. If the precogs predict highly likely occurrences, and the crime is going to be prevented, so it has a zero chance of occurrence.I would have to conclude from the above nonsense that knowledge of the future is impossible. And this irks me.Problem: is it moral to incarcerate people who have committed no real act of violence - only the formation of intent to commit the crime. There is a case for incarcerating those who haven't committed the crime. An analogy would be the husband who wishes to kill his wife, but hires an assassin to do the dirty work. The husband has clearly acted immorally, yet his shirt is clean of blood.The assassin is prevented to kill the wife, however. There is no murder, no actus reas. Everyone lives. One would have to have a very high standard of morality to condemn mere thoughts in the absence of harm.There's a lot of dirty work to be done to sort this out, and I am already in over my depth. Incidentally, Minority Report is a pretty entertaining flick.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

"Minority Report is a multi-genre film with lots of themes, Steven Spielberg made another hit - My Ultimate Review","Minority Report is directed by Steven Spielberg and loosely based on the 1956 short story The Minority Report by Philip K. Dick. Scott Frank and Jon Cohen wrote the screenplay and I strongly believe it represents the essence and heart of Philip's short story, The Minority Report fits well in a cinematic form and Steven Spielberg was the right person to direct, perfect direction and his vision for the story was probably close to Philip K Dick's vision. I find him talented but also a genius in storytelling and science fiction.The story is primarily set in Washington, D. C and Northern Virginia in the year 2054, where PreCrime, a specialized police department, apprehends criminals based on foreknowledge provided by psychics called precogs. The cast includes Tom Cruise as Chief of PreCrime John Anderton, Colin Farrell as Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer, Samantha Morton as the senior precog Agatha, and Max von Sydow as Anderton's superior Lamar Burgess. The supporting cast is like the main cast, filled with talented actors. Steven Spielberg has characterized the story as fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot. The film's central theme is the question of free will versus determinism.There's some truly terrific performances through the movie, I won't go into detail in any scenes as I want you to experience it yourself. But Tom Cruise, now days known for his crazy stunts and action movies. In this film he goes all in his dramatic performance, it's excellent. Colin Farrell and the rest of the main cast does a phenomenal job, but Tom probably gave the best performance.Janusz Kaminski serves as the cinematographer for the film and he have worked on numerous of Spielberg's films and even won an Oscar for Saving Private Ryan. His cinematography is notable in this film, it's remarkable. John Williams does the music and I don't really feel I have to explain how good it is or how talented the man is, he's a legend. Michael Kahn edited the movie. Cinematography, music and editing is some of the best parts of the movie, it leaves you satisfied and entertained, extraordinary work. The visual effects in Minority Report is impressive and incredible, how they used the visual effects in action sequences was so well done. Truly an achievement in visual effects.Minority Report's story is a great one but it starts off slow, but the long run time of 145 minutes is needed because of world building and character development. Steven Spielberg wanted to make something other than a sci-fi action film and he managed to do that, he created a film that goes deep into themes of. He characterized the story as ""fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot"". Other themes include the role of preventive government in protecting its citizenry, the role of media in a future state where technological advancements make its presence nearly boundless, the potential legality of an infallible prosecutor, and Spielberg's repeated theme of broken families. As you see, the multi-genre film has a grand scale and it led to my rating. I absolutely loved the film and will probably watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Overhyped.. Undermade.,"Worst Spielburg yet? I think so.  I've had never turned off/walked out of a Spielburg film until last night.  With me, Spielburg has always been a hit or miss director, but his misses have never been so wide as with Minority Report.  After a few hours (I watched another, much better film) I returned to where I'd left off in Minority Report and was pleased to see that the film did improve (however slightly) during the latter half.The first image the audience is handed in watching Minority Report is a robotic lathe that looks like it was drawn up with some 10 year old CAD software by a drafter bent on one night of heavy drinking.  This special effects showcase was off to a bad start to say the least.  In fact.. the only special effects worth giving merit were the ""spiders"".  The entire world's ability to go from muted color sharp photography in one frame to air-brushed soft focus (and poorly textured) CGI in the next was staggering. One minute I'm watching a grungy cop flick.. the next I'm watching Blues Clues as our hero pretends to jump from one moving vehicle to another without drawing undue attention to himself.  I kept waiting for him to miss his mark.. look at the camera.. and then, upon looking down, fall with the full Looney Toon orchestral accompanyment.  I couldn't suspend my disbelief for an instant.. special effects?  3/10One of the worst sins of this flick was the touchless interface used in the pre-homicide detective's work area.  Sure.. it looks cool... I thought we'd be in for a real treat when the lights dimmed, Cruise lowered his head, raised his arms, and we saw a spectrograph form across the middle of the screen.  I figured Spielburg would incorporate some music after creating such an image of a Hi-Tech conductor.  No.. no.. instead we see yard-long hand motions made to do the same functions (select, drag, zoom, focus) I can do with my mouse, one hand, and 12-18 square inches of area to move within. If you're going to create a futuristic computer interface, at least try to make it more practical than what we currently have.  A keypad, a mouse and two jog-wheels would have made the whole process 10x more productive.  The set being filled with lexan screens that were glued together with ugly, poorly formed seams was a letdown as well.  I figured the future would have something better to offer.The storyline was very contrived, yet used very basic character generalizations.  There was nothing difficult to figure out since every aspect of the plot was spoonfed to you, so the intellectual aspect was ruined.. if you try to actually sink your brain into the intricacies of the plot, you see it holds less water than a sieve.Anderton undergoes 12-16hours of pain to have his eyeballs swapped out, so that he won't be IDed by the sensors in every public domain.. only to whip out his old eyes (during one extremely pointless scene) so that he can scan himself into the Pre-Crime headquarters.  Good thing he got those new eyes... or ..or else  *shrug*  Anderton purposefully enters the room where he's been fated to murder someone (with the murder weapon armed) simply because he's a moron... There is no reason established for him to enter the room, other than to advance the already disgusting plot.Didn't know Colin Farrell was in this one until I saw him step into view.. If that was his first mainstream exposure to an American audience, I bet he's glad some people saw him in good flicks like Tigerland before passing judgement... what a poor role.Bottom Line:  Cold pointless summer flick that doesn't hold a candle to most others in the special effects, action or philosophical realms.

Not Just Entertaining,"A thriller based in a 2054 Washington. Starting from the fact that in my Opinion, this is the first movie of its kind, I must say that many motion pictures that came after did not follow this kind of futuristic ""film noir"" genre, I thought it would open a new chapter in film history.Anyway the Screenplay was probably the best effort put into this movie together with Spielberg's amazing directing, and I loved the visual effects that brought a ""cold"" feeling to the story, During the first 10 minutes of the film I realized that this was a movie that would be nail biting and keeping you on the edge of your seat, Plus the whole concept of Precrime (being able to see a murder before it happens just made it) 10 times better. After the opening scene it just kept flowing in the right direction and you started to forget you in a theater. As for the acting I never really liked Tom Cruise as an actor but I love the way he plays the protagonist John Anderton. This movie has the right amount of action leaving space to important dialogue without ruining the climax of the story.

"Dull, over-hyped, forgettable?","The first review I read here of this film mentions The Fugitive, Blade Runner and The Matrix.

Star Wars II, anyone?The Fugitive is more emotional, and as it's set in our world we can identify with it. Blade Runner is a damn sexy film, and I think the female character (what was her name) coming to terms with the fact she has been designed and built is much more engaging than than the run-and-hide as the star wonders whether or not he will murder, or is he being set up. The Matrix was much more in-tune with popular culture, fashion and pop-philosophy and predictions for the future, albeit blatantly copied from Terminator.It's not even particularly memorable.

Philip K. Dick with Agatha Christie! It can't get better than that.,"When commenting Minority Report, everybody talks about Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise, but some people forget the real brain behind the film: Philip K. Dick. His great imagination created this little masterpiece, just as he did with Blade Runner and Total Recall, all great science-fiction movies. Minority Report joins his ""brothers"" with honors. It is better than Total Recall, but not yet a classic like Blade Runner (only time will tell). Spielberg did a great job creating the greatest action scenes of the year, and a script that takes the Philip K. Dick's universe closer to Agatha Christie's, and other mystery authors. The crew behind the movie took a little (but brilliant) tale written by Dick and extended it to 2 hours of mysteries and surprises. Tom Cruise is the same as usual, but it's great to see both of the richest names in Hollywood (Spielberg and Cruise) making an intelligent film.I hope time brings justice to Minority Report, so people will recognize the masterpiece disguised as sci-fi blockbuster movie.(sorry for the English mistakes!)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Its a good sci-fi flick,"Since I love sci-fi, I knew from the start that I would like this one. And yes, it was sci-fi. The vision of the future is very interesting and the whole Pre-crime thing sounds ok, I guess... If humans are ever able to predict the future.As I watched the movie I noticed alot of references to other sci-fi flicks. Johnny Mnemonic, for example. The way the Pre-Crimes were using their hands to move and focus on information on their screens made me think of Keanu Reeves surfing the internet in the year 2021, waving his hand around. Then there was Timecop. Only in that movie, the police went back in time. And not really too stop murders from happening. Then I was reminded of Strange Days when Tom Cruise visited his hacker-friend in that Virtual Reality place. Very similiar to the devices used in Strange Days. I liked all of these movies (even if I can admit that Johnny Mnemonic is bad, and so is Timecop.), and I did like this movie.Its about a futuristic police agency called Pre-Crime, where they use strange human beings to predict the future. The Pre-Crimes can see when a murder is about to take place, then they go there and stop the murder from happening! That's something I'd like to see in the future. Anyway, the leader of this agency (John Anderton) is seen killing a person on their ""future-vision"" screen, and finds himself chased by his own partners and friends. He knows he is innocent... will be innocent... ach! You get the idea, and tries to prove it. To do so he must get a number of diffrent pieces of the puzzle together, and the one responsible for the mess ends up being who John least thought it would be.As I said, very interesting movie. But its a bit slow. Not something I would really want to watch again, in awhile. Nice future, nice story, nice characters, nice actors, nice directing. But its slow. And that's really the worst thing a movie can be. But in the end, its a good movie. Something you should keep your eyes open for. And if you like it, buy it.

Rubbish...,"I was hoping for a decent Tom Cruise film for a change since Spielberg was directing.  At the sneak preview I attended tonight, the crowd left with comments ranging from ""what was that all about"" to ""Spielberg has lost it."" After Mission Impossible I and II, then the snooze fest of ""Vanilla Sky"" I can't say I look forward to any film staring TC.  I surely expected more from Spielberg and left empty on all counts.

Superb look into the future..,"Superstar Tom Cruise gives his ""most potent action performance"" - David Ansen, Newsweek.  And quite frankly, I couldn't agree more. Cruise plays the Chief of the Precrime unit, and does that very well.""For six years, Washington D.C. has been muder-free thanks to astounding technology which identifies killers before they commit their crimes. But when the chief of the Precrime Unit (Cruise) is himself accused of a future murder, he has just 36 hours to discover who set him up - or he'll fall victim to the ""perfect"" system he helped create.""Great story, great action, great sci-fi thriller!

Very impressive. Spielberg and Cruise's first collaboration is an awesome sci-fi thrill ride!,"Minority Report is an interesting blend of sci-fi and thriller. With a combination like Stephen Spielberg and Tom Cruise, you know it's going to be awesome without even hearing what the movie is about. But of course, it is my job to tell you these kind of things, so here I go.Minority Report takes place in the near future of 2054. Now before you scoff at some of the seemingly too-advanced technology they seem to have, you should know that before production, Spielberg gathered some of the world's greatest scientists and had them brainstorm on what the world would be like in fifty years and he mostly used what they came up with. Of course he did add some stuff, but they're cool additions so I'll let it slide.The plot revolves around John Anderton (Tom Cruise). He is the chief of an experimental program called ""Pre-Crime"". Pre-Crime uses the Pre-Cogs' ability to see when and who is going to commit murder to stop them from ever happening. The Pre-Cogs are three people actually, who can precict the aforementioned murders. They keep them drugged and isolated so they can predict these murders better. This is really my only big problem with Minority Report, the Pre-Cogs. For some reason I just can't buy the fact that they gained this ""ability"" from a combination of different drugs and medicines. That really is the only part of the plot that is a little too far-fetched. Anyway, eventually the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton himself will kill a man named Leo Crow, whom John has never heard of before.This leads Anderton into a wild flight for his life as he tries to discover whether he had been set up, or the system is imperfect, contrary to what everyone believes. Or, worst of all, maybe he really is destined to kill Leo Crow. The chase leads him to many different places and people, which leads us to what I think is the best part of Minority Report, the diverse characters. The Supporting Cast that you rarely see at all are fantastic in themselves. From the peculiar Dr. Iris Heneman (Louis Smith), to the shady Dr. Solomon Eddie (Peter Stormare), to the eccentric Rufu T Riley (Jason Anton), all of these characters are fascinating in themselves and it's a shame we don't get to see more of them.With a great supporting cast, the main cast is even better. Colin Farrell plays Danny Witwer, an FBI agent who is trying to take control of PreCrime and leads the hunt for John. He does a very impressive job and I was amazed to later find out he was Irish! Everyone should definitely keep an eye on him. Max von Sydow plays Lamar Burgess, the Director and creator of PreCrime. He is something of a father figure to John and will do anything to keep PreCrime alive. Kathryn Morris also plays Lara, Anderton's ex-wife. They all perform spectacularly as they interact with each other and move the plot along at a good pace.Then there is John himself. Although appearing successful at first, you quickly realize he is a shell of a man. His life has fallen apart following the kidnapping of his son. His wife left him and he is reduced to getting high and watching home videos during the evenings.The film is filled with a very gritty feel to it and the coloring is filled with the cooler colors of the spectrum, especially blues and whites. It's also surprisingly packed with questions that most sci-fi movies don't bother with. It's filled with questions like ""Are the lives saved by PreCrime worth it if the system is imperfect and some innocent people are imprisoned for murders they actually wouldn't have committed?"" It's surprisingly deep for it's genre and leaves you thinking after the movie. As for the action sequences, they are all top-notch. Especially this one very impressive scene in which John is fleeing his former squad who are armed with all kinds of cool thins, most notably jet packs. I bet that was a pain to shoot.Minority report is a high quality sci-fi thriller. With it's impressive stunts, inventive but believable (except for the PreCogs) plot, the vast range of characters, and the intelligent presentation, I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
OKAAAAAY STEPHEN AND TOM!!! WE FORGIVE YOU FOR A.I. AND VANILLA SKY!!!,"You will find many people here going on and on about how this is one of the all-time great movies (it's high ranking on IMDB justifies that).  I don't quite share the same opinion but I do think that in a time when summer movies are getting dumber and dumber, Minority Report is a welcome and after Scooby Doo, MIIB, Mr. Deeds, and yet another uninspired Star Wars sequel a very refreshing movie.  It is the most suspenseful movie I have seen this year and only Road to Perdition is a better looking film.  However, as hard as I tried, I still couldn't help getting confused (just a little) by the plot.  But at least I thought about the plot afterwards which is more than I can say for most of these ""event"" movies.  Cruise and Speilberg are in top form and Colin Farrell, who seemingly came out of nowhere, is fast becoming a BIG star.  The best scene in any movie I've seen this year goes a little like this.  Cruise is hiding from those robotic spiders (spiders that ID you by crawling up on you and scanning your eyes)that are searching for him. He does this by holding his breath in a tub of ice (with them being able to detect body heat and all).  He holds his breath for what seems like an eternity before a small breath of air causes a bubble to slowly rise to the surface.  Just that small bubble is enough to draw the attention of these ""spiders"", that come charging into the bathroom and surrounds an unsuspecting Cruise in the tub.  See, I told you it was suspenseful! 8.5 out of 10",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
The future might make you queasy,"The ""look"" of this movie is excellent. It is too long for its content. I found myself looking at my watch, though self-indulgence was to be expected from this director. Once again (cf. A.I.) the handling of subjects related to children is both central and so disturbing that I would not recommend this movie to my wife and would not let my young son see it. I gave the movie an overall 7 because of the worksmanship. I give the movie a -1 for its real central theme of disturbed (I use this politely) childhood and its pea-brained handling of the free-will vs. predestination question that is supposedly at its core but which gets pushed aside when convenient. I was also not happy about the use of multiple scenes that were violent or stomach churning. Question: What is it with Tom C. and eyes: ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Abre los Ojos"" (Open the Eyes aka ""Vanilla Sky"") and this movie in which eyes play a central role?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
On the Lam Before There's a Lam to Be On,"In 2001, Steven Spielberg bowled me over with his sci-fi story ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence."" In 2002, he took another stab at a sci-fi story for adults, and while not as good as the previous film, it comes close.""Minority Report"" is a satisfyingly nasty little piece of work about a world in which law enforcement officials can see crimes before they happen and arrest perpetrators before they've done their foul deeds. Great system, unless you happen to be one of those officials who's pinned with a crime you haven't yet committed and don't realize you have any intention of committing. That's what happens to Tom Cruise, and the movie is about his efforts to evade capture while being chased by Colin Farrell.The special effects are nifty. A highlight of the film is one in which the police send an army of little mechanized spiders into an apartment complex to spy on all of the inhabitants, and we get a birds-eye view of all the things they see. The story raises all sorts of big brother-ish questions about privacy and individual rights, questions that felt especially relevant so soon after 9/11 and Bush's homeland security initiatives.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
If you Liked Blade Runner...,"I long ignored this movie because of the title. ""The Minority Report"" sounded as exciting as a documentary on the decline of General Motors from an accountant's point of view.This a brilliant movie. It is a tour de force of the imagination. It reminded me of Blade Runner -- a gritty, thoughtful, believable vision of the future, casually laid out in great detail in much the way a drama about the old west would be handled. It is not just a few gimmicks. It creates a complete world, complete with shopping malls, advertising, office buildings, gardens, airports, cars, elevators...The scene when Cruise gets new eyes is pure little-boy Spielberg, grossing out his younger sister with an unlimited budget. I bet you can't watch it without gasping and going ""Eeww"".Max von Sydow is a treat. Colin Farrell gives you the creeps, though you can't figure out why.It borrows from Fellini's Satyricon, with the pale, frail oracles who float in a pool of water.It is an amazing movie in that it has no filler.

Great work,"First of all, I'd want to say that I admire most of Spielberg's works, and I consider him one of the best directors there are. He did have some disappointing movies, but most of his ""works"" were great or even brilliant works, like this here or AI. Examples are many... You should first know a little bit about the story. A man is being chased by the system he trusted, a system based on predictions. These predictions of the so called ""Visioneers"" help preventing crimes. As the whole operation is about to go nation wide, problems appear. A small study on the characters would be implied in my opinion.There's Paul Anderton, represented on screen by the one and only Tom Cruise, who does show us good quality acting. His character is one which you do meet through quite a few films, the kind of guy who lost a son, and who tries through his job to help other people which might suffer similar losses, and who usually feels better because of it. It's a kind of thing such characters do to keep living, to give their life a real sense. Paul is a smart guy, self determined and with good intention. Initially he doesn't have any doubts on the system, but that is just because he is not well informed. He believes he is the head of the  operation, but it is not truly so.    Then, we get to see the humanity in every person, even in him as he finds out he is about to kill someone. He is determined that he was framed, and tries to find out who did it, and why. We then meet an event which is arguable. The fact that there does exist only one future, and that it can not be changed. That is what the Visioneers represent. And the system itself. A future that can not be set under any doubt. Is it really so? I do not believe it is, and it seems that neither does Spielberg. You will see that after viewing the movie.So there's Anderton. Another important character is Danny Witwer(Colin Farrell), who works for the government. I think he is as smart as Anderton, and he might certainly has more experience in murder cases. He is actually quite alike with him. He wishes justice too, but he has a flaw which is very, very disturbing for some: he is arrogant, and he probably doesn't even know this because he is eager to prove himself. He's a good guy.Lamar is the so called ""bad guy"" here, despite the fact that he is just an old, and self obsessed man...he is all that matters, and his system of course. Anyone who stands in the way goes...well, you know. He is old, and the system is all he lives for. The fact that it might be going nation wide is of critical importance, but what I did not clearly understand is if he wants it or if he doesn't want it to go nation wide. Anyway, as a paradox, he will be the one who will prove that the Visioneers can be wrong.The special effects of the movie are great, and I especially enjoyed the whole idea of the film. The spiders were great too, and I must say the same about the acting of all actors.This movie is new...and still it is old. Many of the ideas we see here have been used in other movies too, but Spielberg makes them look new, and I believe that the success of this movie is mostly because of Steven Spielberg.I would consider it for the Oscars too, even for the best picture category, though I doubt it will get there. The movie would have been even better, if the end hadn't been quite disappointing. That's how I consider it, because it would have been just right if things had stayed as they were. The role of the wife had been so meaningless, and now the fact that she frees him just doesn't seem right.The story also points out a pretty important thing. If you agree or not, that's your decision. The system might be perfect, but the mistakes are made by human hands.Before I end this, there would be one more thing I'd have in mind. Was the choice of the year 2054 totally coincidental? Or maybe, it wasn't...because 1000 years before the Catholic and Orthodox Churches had separated each other. Maybe it's the same thing in the movie. We can see a conflict between generations, and then the fact that the program might go nation wide...it might make them all safe. But it does not happen so, and again everybody is in danger. How it partially was after 1054, because people had been separated again by ""higher"" forces. It's just my opinion...might be a coincidence.As a mark...I'd say somewhere between 8,5 and 9 out of 10. I consider it a certain ""must-see"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Not the best Spielberg movie but still well worth watching,"This script doesn't seem as solid as what Spielberg is usually working with. The effort to force the plot into a classic chase movie apparently demanded to ignore some smaller inconsistencies, especially the moral standpoint of the story was never really clear to me. Andertons swift change in motivation seemed odd and Burgess leaves without any clear statement. Appears quite a deal more as lazy scriptwriting then thought provoking.Besides that Minority Report is still good cinema in terms of scope, detail and a decent portion of vision, presented with the outstanding quality Spielberg got us used to. Not to mention the smart action scenes and the general, pleasingly rapid pace of the movie. And though the storytelling might crumble a bit here and there at least there is a story well worth telling.Shouldn't be an excuse, but scriptwriting mistakes like these are merely the minimum in most of the improbably successful, billion dollar productions that Hollywood has given us along the last decade. Re- watching this after movies like X-Men: First Class, Spiderman 3 or Inception makes me generally long for flicks as badly written as this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Hang It Up Boys,"Tom Cruise plays, well, ""Tom Cruise"" is this sad pale sci-fi ""product"" from the Spielberg factory of over developed concepts. Not a scene went by where I didnt feel poked, prodded and manipulated. So many, many plot holes its amazing this flick could stand up under its own considerable weight.  While we do get a sniff of ""Blade Runner"" and ""Total Recall"" most of the stink here is pure self-importance on the part of its cinematic creators.  If Cruise is playing a character one degree different than the unpleasantly moody ""Ethan Hunt"" of ""M.I."" it certainly isnt obvious.  Spielberg's direction provides neither awe nor wonder and few if any surprises or mystery.  The SFX were unimpressive, especially the much touted fight / chase sequence - much looking like it was lifted from a Playstation 2 Racing Game cartridge.While this IS the type of movie you want to see on a big screen, it's doubtful you'll feel you got your $9 worth.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Spielberg directs this sci-fi action adventure that totally kicks butt.,"Starring: Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell Honestly, I don't think I can remember the last time I watched a Steven Spielberg movie that I didn't like. And I think that Minority Report is probably my favorite Spielberg. Really, I think that Signs and Minority Report were the two best movies to come out in the year of 2002. It's a great sci-fi action flick with really cool special effects and great acting.John Anderton (Cruise) is a pre-crime cop. What exactly is pre-crime? Well, in the future, they have developed a way to track murders and find murderers before they do the deed. Detective Anderton is one of the guys that brings in the murderers before anything happens.One of the most interesting points I think that this movie raises is the notion of predestination. How can we know something was going to happen if we stop it? Are we really in control of our lives, or is everything decided ahead of time? Interesting.But after Anderton starts investigating one of the first pre-crime cases about a woman named Anne Lively being drowned, things start happening. The next pre-crime case that pops up, the murderer happens to be John Anderton himself. In less than forty eight hours, he is supposed to kill a man that he has never met.As the story unfolds, twists and turns come out at every corner. As soon as you think you know something, you're wrong. It's something or someone else. It's a good edge-of-your-seat movie that makes you think if you want to figure out what's going on before it all gets revealed to you.The great thing about this movie is it has plenty of action for the ADHD crowd, but it also has a very complex and detailed plot for the rest of us who want to turn our brains on occasionally when we go to the movies.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
A very good police science fiction thriller.,"In a near future, in 2054, a very new police division, named Pre-Crime, is able to detect a criminal before he does his crime, and a special section is at that time sent in order to avoid the crime to be done. For that, le Pre-Crime division used the supernatural powers of a trilogy of clairvoyants named ""Precogs"" who are human being which brains were damaged in foetal stage by synthetic drugs absorbed by their parents. These Precogs are able to read in the future when it is of criminal nature. Detective John Anderton is a chief member of the division. One day, he learns that he is the next detected killer and he decides to discover the secret working of the division in order to prove his innocence.

Masterful Film.,"At the start of it all, I had put this film off due to a number of things. For starters, it seemed as though it was going to be another Mission Impossible type film, that and I highly disliked Tom Cruise. However, after some time when I was at my father's selecting a few movies of his to take home and watch, I decided since it had such good ratings, I might as well give it an opportunity to impress me, after all, a movie I had watched just a week before staring Cruise, another which I had also put off, was The Last Samurai, and it was absolutely fantastic. Anyhow, this film took a new level on both crime dramas and sci-fi. It was an original idea with a comfortable, familiar feel to it that kept you drawn.

Excellent futuristic film,"Tom Cruise is the star of ""Minority Report,"" a 2002 film from Steven Spielberg. Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, Steve Harris, Lois Smith, Neal McDonough and Jessica Capshaw also star. Cruise is John Anderton, a futuristic cop at a time when murders can be prevented by being predicted ahead of time by three precogs. When the precogs see him kill someone he doesn't know, he attempts to find out who has set him up and why and keep the murder from happening.""Minority Report"" has a clever script beautifully handled by Spielberg. (The title refers to a report generated when all three precogs don't have the same vision of events.) Some of the effects are awesome, and one can easily see them becoming realities in the future. Newspaper headlines change before your eyes, disks are in the form of holograms, the images that the precogs see are projected, and the police see the whole event by moving their hands around the screen. People travel using jet packs. Everyone is identified by retinal scans. In one scene, Anderton, on the run from his own unit, has his eyes removed and new ones inserted so he can go around without being recognized. He is also given something that can place under his chin and dramatically alter his face for a very short time. There are some very exciting and tense scenes, as well as some poignant ones - Anderton goes home at night and puts a hologram into the computer that brings back his dead son. His vulnerability in that area will bring him more grief.The cinematography is very unusual, giving the film its own special look. There are tributes throughout to film noir and Kubrick.This is a thrilling film with excellent performances, with Samantha Morton a standout as Agatha, the most sensitive precog, who is kidnapped by Anderton to help him uncover the truth. She is amazing. I am not always impressed by Tom Cruise. As an actor, he is somewhat external; however, it works very well in this type of slick film. Von Sydow is always good. And it was wonderful to see handsome Neal McDonough of Boomtown. Lois Smith has one big scene, and she comes off as both eccentric and mysterious.The future may be closer than we think.

Everybody runs...,"I used to think Tom Cruise couldn't act to save his life. Having seen ""Minority Report"", I now know better. He delivers a down-to-earth, realistic performance in a challenging role. Set in the future, in the year 2054, Cruise plays the chief of the Precrime Department. Basically, technology has evolved, and there is now a way to stop crimes from occurring. However, he falls victim to this ""perfect"" system when he himself is accused of committing a future crime This is one of the most involving thrillers I have ever seen. The mystery behind the plot is rather cloudy at first, but once it starts to be explained, it becomes obvious who the perpetrator is. Collin Farrell (who was in ""Phone Booth"") delivers a solid performance as well, as does the rest of the cast.Have I ever been disappointed by Spielberg? No, and for the record, I loved his unique portrayal of future times in Minority Report. Most films set in the future have a classic feel: the future looks nice and pretty on the outside, but underneath the surface, people are as disgruntled as ever. However, Spielberg doesn't go with any of that nonsense here. The colours are all dull, monochromatic, bleached out. The lighting is dark. It is a refreshingly bleak and hopeless outlook on the future.In addition, Spielberg has the audience jump at all the wrong moments. No, perhaps I worded that poorly. What I meant was: oftentimes, the audience thinks Cruise is in danger, when in reality, there's nothing to worry about. Meanwhile, when the audience should be on the edge of their seat, Spielberg does nothing of the sort.

Great concept delivered in a great script 8/10,"Minority Report is one of those movies you have to pay attention to very closely if you want to fully enjoy.It's not a Christopher Nolan type of script where you have to re-watch twice but if you miss on all the details, you'll have a hard time appreciating the film.For starters, the writers have drawn inspiration from a short story and developed a well told story accuring in the future. Taking this kind of story and developing it is no small task and the writers are doing it perfectly.Tom Cruise and Max Von sydow are wonderful actors who deliver their portrayals the best way possible.What made me enjoy this movie was how every turning point made me rethink my thoughts and theories as the story progressed. For example: the idea of a pre-crime system to stop crimes before they even happen is amazing, a system I would have supported myself if existed in real life. However as the story proceeded I found myself conflicted with the thought I had in the beginning.This is an example of how a story and script (when written correctly) can draw the audience to their own estimation.

The chase and escape scenes were contrived and totally unbelievable. 5. Plot holes? HUGE! If you stopped someone from committing a pre-crime, why punish them? They clearly didn't and aren't going to commit that crime. How can you legally imprison sentient human beings even if they are ""precogs?"" If they have images of the murderers and everyone in the world has their corneas on file, why not just match up the corneas in the precog images?The concept is intriguing.

Origin of the movie's premise,"Can you arrest someone for a crime he hasn't committed yet ? Absolutely. Else, people are going to die. I could end here. Great movie. Love it. What's the problem with my resounding 'yes' ? A handful of people worldwide can, in fact, act out of character. They may, in fact, not kill the victims, after all. Besides, the real premise here is not about seeing the future. It's about seeing what people ARE. As opposed to what they DO. Under that slightly different premise, the question becomes: Can you arrest people for what they ARE, instead of for what they DO ? The answer to that question is a 'yes' that is backed by a lot more intuition. Arrest all nazis. They are nazis. Doesn't matter how many crimes they already committed. They are nazis. The original question, in this fantastic movie, is slightly tilted towards SciFi, so it slightly changes. Love it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Spielberg's Still Got It!,"(The following may reveal elements of plot)Minority Report: 4/4Oh, I f I tried to stress enough all the wonder and fanciness of this film, this would go on for several megabytes.It's wonderful!The story revolves around detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise)who works for the department of Precrime; a division of the DC police department that uses three precognitive individuals to predetermine murders and stop them before they happen.The chief complication arises when it is predetermined that Anderton himself will commit a murder in about thirty-six hours, and the chase is on. Anderton goes to many lengths to clear his name.He learns of a variable called a ""minority report,"" a possible seperate future that might find him innocent, and so he races to find his.The world Spielberg creates here is one filled with wonder and ingenuity, like magnetic cars, three-dimensional televisions, and billboards that scan your retina to adress you personally.The story is just as wonderful, an electric blend of action and intrigue. This is as close as Spielberg's ever gotten to film-noir. The movie is a whodunnit, (or more rather, a ""whowilldoit"") with a new piece of the [VERY CLEVER] story revealing itself at every turn.Some of the scenes are filled with such whimsicality that only Spielberg could make them work. Like a chase through a car factory...Anderton falls onto the production line, and a car is built AROUND him. He then uses the car to drive off and escape his pursuers.Or when the police, suspecting Anderton to be in a particular building, they fill the building with little, mehcanical, three-legged ""Spyders"" that retinally scan everyone in the entire building, checking for a particular fugitive.There are also several elements where pradoxes of time and the universe come into play; afterall, almost the entire film is based on the premise that ""just because you stopped it from happening doesn't mean it wouldn't happen."" VERY entertaining, indeed!But I've said too much. The bottom line is that this movie is just so wonderfully well-done, so masterfully orchestrated, that I advise you at all cost, without restraint, to SEE THIS MOVIE!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Does not live up to its potential to be a great movie, but still very good.","'Minority Report' should have been one of the year's best movies. It is directed by Steven Spielberg who, despite his gooey moments, is a great director. It stars Tom Cruise, who, regardless of what you think of him as a person, is a charismatic and talented actor (if you doubt me, go and see 'Magnolia'). It is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, the warped and brilliant mind responsible for the ideas behind 'Total Recall' and 'Blade Runner'. And the photography and special effects are superb.It is the year 2054 and murder has been wiped out in Washington D.C., due to the Department of Pre-Crime, which uses the psychic powers of three pre-cognitives (Agatha, Dashiell and Arthur, presumably named after the famous mystery writers Agatha Christie, Dashiell Hammett and Arthur Conan Doyle, which is a nice touch) to prevent slayings before they happen. Cruise plays the leader of the Pre-Crime unit, a skilled cop who lost his son 6 years earlier and now uses drugs to try and dull the grief. One day he is monitoring the visions the pre-cogs have when he sees himself commit murder and is forced to go on the run from his own unit. As he tries to discover who set him up, he realises that what he needs is in the mind of Agatha, who may have had a conflicting vision of the murder.The first half of the movie is excellent, with several tense and exhilarating action scenes and a some creepy moments, particularly involving a genetically-engineered garden and eyeballs. What is most impressive though is the technology of Spielberg's future world. Like most good science fiction movies, the technology seems both amazing and believable. I particularly liked the transparent viewing screens which Cruise could manipulate with cybernetic gloves, the chamber of cryogenically frozen criminals and the spiderlike, retina-scanning robots. The cast is solid, with a quietly haunting performance by Samantha Morton as Agatha.However in the second half the movie goes a bit flat, becoming too like a routine murder-mystery. I was not moved by the way the relationship between Cruise and his son was shown and the villain did not impress me. Besides the obvious mind-bending paradoxes about changing the future, there are also number of questions that the movie asked but did not answer. Why are there no ethical storms about the way the pre-cogs are used? If the surgeon hated Cruise, why wasn't he less helpful? Shouldn't clothing fashions be different after 50 years? What exactly happened to Cruise's son? They are not large things, but together they add up. 'Minority Report' is very good, but it does not become the great movie it promises to be.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Just plain excellent,"I've seen this movie an innumerable times but have never been a real fan of it. The problem was that i have never seen it from start to finish in one sitting. I have always seen it on TV where I only catch parts of it and am not paying too much attention to it. However, this is one movie that--if you give it your initial attention--you will never lose interest. Superb visuals and a push and pull of the pace that never lets the movie fall into any long dull parts or unnecessary drawn out action sequences make this a thoroughly entertaining film. The plot twists fit well with the other parts of the movie creating a mildly intellectually stimulating movie. While the twists may seem to be predictable for some, the twists are for creating an engrossing plot rather than just for the shock factor. I thoroughly recommend this movie beginning to end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Half a movie,"Nice idea, and then, again, sloppy and unfinished. Steven Spielberg should (and probably is) the man with the resources, the means to make a consistent and iron-clad movie.

This flash-bang-whiz SF thriller is an exciting ride,"Like so many Hollywood movies, this movie pairs stunning visuals and awesome techniques with a mediocre, unconvincing story. In this case the insistent flash-bang-whiz helps to make up the deficit, as the viewer has no time to reflect on how bizarre and silly much of the story is. So watch and enjoy the spectacle, but don't worry too much about holes in the plot or cookie-cutter characters.A few barely functioning psychics float in a pool at police headquarters, and occasionally they get a vision of a murder about to take place, which results in a wooden ball rolling down a chute and into the hands of detective John Anderton, who quickly tries to locate and then shut down the crime before it can happen. John has issues of his own, such as drug use, the disappearance of his young son, and the subsequent collapse of his marriage. Then one day Anderton himself is fingered by the ""pre-cogs"" and he has to go on the lam and try to figure out who is out to get him and why. This leads to a few plot twists and an unconvincing wrap-up. But there are enough memorable moments - such as Anderton being followed by video ads in a shopping mall, a scientist and her amazing, moving plants, and mechanical spiders that invade an area on behalf of the police and identify people by shining a beam into their eyes - to make this an exciting ride.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Another mind-buster from the Sci Fi king,"This film, set in 2054, has at it's base nothing more than an ordinary crime situation sort of speak. A cop is supposed to be a murderer. But what really makes this film interesting is that he has not committed it yet. Because of three persons, called Precogs, the police is able to see into the future and prevent murders before they are even committed. The chief of the unit that prevents the murders, Anderton (Tom Cruise) finds himself in a predicament one day, as he sees himself kill another man in the future. Not believing he would be able to do such a thing, he thinks it is a conspiracy and flees from the law to solve his own case. From here on Philip K.Dick (the mentioned king of sci fi) takes us (together with Spielberg and the screenwriter) on an incredible journey which is never predictable (except for the very end of the crime). The series of events are sometimes so surprising, that it reminded me of another film based on Philip K.Dick material: Total Recall. But back to this film. Overall, I felt that the second half of the film was much better than the first, which really was not too special at all. It seems to me, that there are not too many films that can hold and grasp your total being and keep it excited for two and a half hours. Is this film good? Is it bad? It is neither, but it is definetely a step up for Spielberg after A.I. Not a must see, but if you're into science fiction and well crafted stories, give this one a try.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

And here is my Minority Report,"Minority Report had a lot to live up to for me, so perhaps I was building myself up for a bit of disappointment. I wanted it to forever banish A. I. from my mind. Now don't get me wrong - I really enjoyed the film and felt the the direction and main leads, Tom Cruise and Max Von Sydow, were excellent. The story was well constructed, although there were several plot holes that only really became apparent as we talked about it on the way home. For me the main problem was the last three quarters of an hour, where the pace was allowed to slip, and there was a little too much explaining being done. I'm sure Spielberg did this so as not to fall into the same trap as the original version of Blade Runner, also based on a Philip K Dick story, which proved to be baffling to a great deal of the audience. There was also some rather alarming similarities to the noir classic L. A. Confidential, which I won't give away here in case you haven't seen it.Having said all this, I would still recommend this film, as it is a cut above the usual multiplex fare, and shows that after almost thirty years in the business, Spielberg is still a director full of suprises.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Where are the minorities?,"when I watched the production documentary, especially when the computer animation department were doing their screen review, it seems that all the workers were Caucasians . Where are the ""intelligent"" ""smart"" Asian engineers, animators, etc? And if I remember it clearly, it seems that everyone who is in charge of those individual departments are Caucasians. Are Asian Americans not capable of managing any of those departments?That made me to think further, how come there was not any major Asian actors in this movie? In the year of 2050, Washington DC seems to have only two races, whites and blacks. I don't want to accuse anyone being racist, however, it just doesn't seem to be right. After all, Hollywood is located right in Los Angeles, where Asian population is very big. They actually had meetings with all kinds of scientists talking about what kind of things, weapons people will use in 2050, how can the director, casting director forget to mention about the race issue in 2050? Ever since Jesse jackson protested during one Oscar event, we now constantly see black actors being nominated and won Oscar awards. Just because Asians do not protest, that does not mean that Hollywood movies should ignore the Asian race, especially for a movie that is set in the future when Asian population will be even bigger.Why are those three precogs all Caucasian, and the female actor was not even a US citizen. Are they willingly agreed to be put in the water tank for the rest of their lives? And if this thing goes national, where are they going to get other precogs for all other cities? And when they die, where are they going to find the new precogs?Overall, this is a entertaining movie to watch, but it has its logical flaws.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
A Terrific Film! One of the Best!,"In the future, criminals are caught before the crimes they commit, which are told by the pre-cogs. One of the officers, John Anderton, in the special unit is accused of one such crime and sets out to prove his innocence.This is a film you would want to see in theaters. No, it's not a dumb action movie. No, it doesn't have mindless action scenes. And no, it's not a bad film. In fact, this is one of the best films ever!This film is not complicated because it doesn't give too much information than you already need.

Didn't impress me... much.,"I saw this movie with my friends this summer, and when we got out of theater, we all thought that it was a waste of money, the trailers promised so much more than the audience got.

The plot was both original and not so original, you have seen most of the things before, but the whole thing about getting arrested before you commit a crime was new to me.

Cinematically -- and Scientifically -- Disappointing,"Back in the 1950's, many science fiction writers were apparently fascinated with the idea that paranormal studies could someday lead to the discovery of provable, replicable, and even manageable extra sensory perception (ESP) in humans. Most of what these writers wrote was rubbish. Some of it was brilliant. The writing of Philip K. Dick generally belongs in the latter category.The new movie ''Minority Report'', based on a P. K. Dick short story of the same title, concerns the harnessing of human precognition as a tool to prevent murders. As a film, it's only fair - a disappointment, considering that Steven Spielberg directed. I went to the theater hoping that Mr. Spielberg would show due respect for the Science in SF. The basic story, naturally, has considerable interest, and when written it featured state of the art scientific extrapolation; the execution of the movie, sad to say, suffers considerably from obvious appeals to the lowest common denominator. ''Minority Report'' is Dick dumbed down.In terms of pure film criticism, it's easy to lament a complete lack of character development, a ridiculously stereotyped and predictable villain and gratuitously flashy action pieces, not to mention clunky fist fights and stupid cops that seem to come from a different movie altogether. But as a lifelong devotee of great science fiction, my major objection to ''Minority Report'' is its wildly uneven depiction of the future. Granted, many film-goers might not notice or care, but for me, the little details really stick out: things like cell phones and hypodermic needles that will clearly be out of date in five years, let alone fifty.Of course, given today's extremely rapid - and rapidly accelerating - pace of scientific discovery and technological development, it may not be possible to present a depiction of our world fifty years hence with any credibility. Indeed, it leads one to wonder: If the 1950's SF fascination with ESP seems quaint to us today, which science fiction fads of our time will be looked upon as anachronistic by our grandchildren?For my money, the closest any filmmaker has come to capturing the flavor - if not the exact look - of the potential human future was way back in 1968. Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', made with considerable input from Arthur C. Clarke, is still the best of them all. My advice to Mr. Spielberg, if he's listening, is to pay more attention to period detail and less to fight sequences; you may not please the trailer park crowd, but your film could have far greater impact and more lasting appeal.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Future imperfect,"With a typically imaginative future-set sci-fi story by Philip K Dick, an A-list cast with Tom Cruise in the lead and Steven Spielberg as director, this big-budget feature looks great on paper. The story's good too, in these days of zero-tolerance towards crime, the idea of stopping a murder before it's actually committed is ingenious and the demonstration of the Pre-Crime Unit in action, effectively the film's prologue, is great as Tom Cruise and his team race against the clock to stop a crime of passion double-murder.I also liked the fact that the operation was subject to moral and indeed legal scrutiny, in the form of government busybody Colin Farrell, but the main story, and the excuse for Cruise to do his running man schtick one more time is when the system inexplicably turns on him, triggering the obligatory extended chase and action sequences which for me take up too much of the story, spectacle over content. I didn't even think the SFX were that good, especially Cruise's John Anderton's gravity-defying first escape from his pursuers, plus the product-placement to which the viewer is subliminally subjected is outrageously excessive. In addition it was too easy to pick out the real bad guy and I even predicted, without ""pre-cog"", the give-away line before it was said, making the ending somewhat predictable.There's not much call for great acting here, Cruise doing action-hero better than bereaved parent, Max Van Sydow, looking and sounding like John Huston, but without the devil-meant while Farrell probably comes off best, but is dispensed with too soon and somewhat unnecessarily I thought.I think that under all the flash-bang-wallop that Spielberg employs here there was a leaner, darker, better film trying to get out. Perhaps if he'd pre-cogged the final cut himself, he might not have blocked his own buster.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Fresh Science Fiction Noir peppered with Character segments.,"From the opening Fox and Dreamworks logos, this film sets a style and tone that is clear - Science Fiction noir... a whodunnit framed in a future society issues and values.The film doesnt soapbox - it simply moves forward with the story from the opening scenes.  Its a smart film, knowing (or guiding) exactly what the audience wants to see.The story mixes some wonderful character scene pieces - Peter Stormare's dirty doctor; the Lois Smith's slightly mad Pre-cog inventor; David Stifel's very cool Lycon the Black Inhaler dealer; and more.  Such scenes give the audience a breather, fills in the blanks, moves the story, and provides an awesome texture and depth not found in many contemporary science fiction films.The screen play does have a few ""leaps of faith"".  I dont think they are holes, as this implies plot error.  Rather, these are plot issues that may not seem plausible or represent common sense.  Yet the core whodunnit mystery stays intact and is fair and interesting enough for the broad audience.Another gripe is the length of the film.  Without exposing plot, the story does tend to end anticlimatically, rather than a nice dramatic close. Spielberg does need to punctuate a bit more.Spielberg's magic comes in presentation.  He is just a master at finding the right camera angle, the right nuiance, the proper pacing.  The effects for most of the film are seamless with their film counterparts.  The two-shot with Samantha and Tom is a master stroke of a director absorbing the audience into a scene.Its a go-see for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Hi tech movie with some faults...,"Minority Report didn't fully satisfy me. It left me with a bit of a bitter tongue when it ended, although some aspects were not of my taste during projection as well. I'd say this movie is very ambitious but fails to take off as it should. The frame is more important than the painting in this case. Cruise once more (Impossible Mission I, II, Vanilla Sky...) acts in one hi-tech environment having the most advanced (sometime not so practical-to-use and a bit hard to believe) structures and computers available for doing his job. Some good visual inventions don't just make up for the sometime leaking characterizations. The dialogs themselves seem not to be wonderful either (the greenhouse, the mall) but fair enough generally. The action sequences are as spectacular as you would expect with special care for the fight in the cars factory (I think courtesy of Kawasaky) and the plot captures you from the beginning showing a great potential. Unfortunately not completely fulfilled. It's still a good movie which might have been even better with some adjustments. Despite some flaws, it's recommended.

One of the best sci-fi films of all time,"Minority Report, I would say, is one of the best science fiction films to be released over the past twenty-five years, and that is certainly no small feat given some of the competing films released over that time-span. Minority Report obviously had a lot of effort put into it by both the filmmakers and its actors and the result is a brilliant thriller. In the past decade I would call it Spielberg's best, ranking among his other great thrillers, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', and 'Jaws'.The movies is based on a short story by the late sci-fi master Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Total Recall, A Scanner Darkly) and it ranks up with Blade Runner as the greatest adaptations of his work. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the Chief of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia. What exactly is his job? To use the unusual psychic abilities of three beings – known as ""Pre-Cogs""- it is his job to analyze future crime scenes and prevent murder from happening. For ten years this system works without a flaw and they are close to taking the program national, only there's one problemJohn's name has been called for the future-murder of Leo Crow –a man he has never once before met. On the run Anderton must evade the highly controlled security of the future United States capital all while trying to prove his innocence, and in so doing unraveling the secrets of the system- secrets that would destroy everything the organization has worked so hard to achieve.What really makes this movie stand out is not the visual effects (though, they certainly are amazing), but it is the human aspect of this film that makes it a memorable experience for the audience. The film manages to cater to all human emotions contained within the plot, from the fear of loss, obsession, greed, fear, insecurity, and many more. All the characters are found to be believable, as none of them come across as being cardboard, as so many other action films do.Tom Cruise pulls a very believable performance and I consider this one of the best of his ""Average Joe"" performances. By this I mean like in 'War of the Worlds' he doesn't come across as being a superhero, as he was in the 'Mission Impossible' franchise. He is perfectly believable as a sad soul who only wishes to make up for his past mistakes and punish the criminals of the world. Haunted by tragedy of the past we can't help but sympathize for his loss, because we can believe him. This isn't a straight-forward ""tragic"" character, such as Kurt Russell's Colonel O'Neil in 'Stargate' (1994). John Anderton is suffering, but he hides it well, going on with his job. In fact his loss is his drive in his work, so naturally he can't believe it when the system turns against him. It's the compelling characters and performances from the actors that make the difference between a good movie and a great movie. Special effects have nothing to do with the quality of the human element of the story (sorry, Michael Bay).The special effects of this film are amazing, providing a believable, yet still fascinating view of the future. Unlike visions presented in Blade Runner, and to a certain degree Total Recall, this is a very clean, well kept design for the future. All the buildings shine and all vehicles appear to be in tip-top condition, but like those other Dick based films the underlying structure of society is as corrupt as ever. How the effect crew for this film was skipped over by the Academy I will never understand, because even two years after I first saw the film many of the visuals remain stuck in my mind.You should not miss Minority Report, because in my opinion it is one of the best films ever made, let alone one of the best science fiction films ever made. For a thrilling, emotional, and mentally stimulating movie experience I can't recommend Minority Report strongly enough to give the film credit, for it goes above and beyond what so many other films have done. So, if you want excitement and brain stimulating ideas forget the garbage of the current theater's films, such as ""Transformers,"" and do yourself a favor: forget that an action movie is not supposed to be dominated by pure special effects and action, go out, buy a copy of Minority Report, put it in your DVD player, sit down, and enjoy a non-stop thrill ride of a movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Gee Whiz,"I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan.  But I have seen pretty much everything he's done.  He can carry a movie (Eyes Wide Shut) or destroy it (Far and Away) when he is allowed to engage the audience.

Spielberg regains his vision,"Twenty minutes into Minority Report and I am thinking - is this Spielberg's mid-career masterpiece? On the ebbing strength of the last half hour, perhaps not, but it is still a masterful piece of film-making.I'd like to think of this as Spielberg's equivalent of 'Measure for Measure', an accomplished piece of storytelling from an excellent writer source, but emotionally detached while philosophically engaged.The basis of the plot is a law enforcement experiment called 'Pre Crime' that uses three humans with drug-induced 'second sight' which causes them to have visions of crime in advance of them happening. These visions are manipulated via the information technology of 50 years in the future to piece together the time and location of the intended crime, enabling teams to get there first and arrest the pre-cognised perpetrator.The premise is worked through in a dazzling 10 minute set-piece at the start of the movie which sets the tone for its stylistic verve. The ideation of the virtual moving 'scrapbooks' which are used to rearrange evidence is quite simply brilliant, but just one facet of the film's visual inventiveness. Spielberg uses FX frequently to play around with rough cut digital video imagery, which is far from his trademark sumptious and immaculate composition (still precedent in the foreground).There is a deeper philosophical layer behind the Spielbergian eye candy. Behind the success of pre-crime as a tool for civic harmony and the implications of interning individuals for actions they did not actually commit. In essence - the argument between predestination and Free Willl - which has been exercising humankind since Socrates and perhaps before.It is only the idea of the infallibility of the pre-crime process, and the unanimity of the three precogs, effectively a reworking of the three classical 'fates' that lend the programme its moral authority.This is where the parallels with Measure for Measure emerge. In Shakespeare's play, the events take place in a degraded civic society and the argument is that sometimes illiberal measures are needed to protect society at large from the forces that would destroy it through vice and crime. This is clearly the philosophical settlement made by the society of the time of Minority Report, which is able to countenance the oppression of the 'not yet guilty' to protect the 'not yet victimed'.The film has been criticised for not portraying a suitably dystopian view of the future, which is laid at the door of Spielberg for his inability to be truly bleak (those having missed Schindler's List). The inevitable comparison is with Bladerunner - truly the sine qua non of unfortunate futures. But I find Spielberg's ambivalent vision a lot more interesting and probably accurate.It is unlikely that the state will be all Fascistic, that all the trees will be uprooted, that it will rain all the time and everyone will be unhappy and unloved in the near or even far future. Despite our fears, that is not really how life turns out. It is much more likely there will be mix of rich, poor, luck and unfortunate that has typified human society since it has been recordable.Nevertheless, the ambience of a more illiberal society, by a degree, is created in the progress of the film. One of the most memorable set-pieces is the 'spider sequence', where a SWAT team is searching for the film's fugitive anti-hero, played by Tom Cruise. They unleash a swarm of mechanoid 'spiders' into an apartment block who intelligently seek out humans from their heat signatures with the aim of reading their iris for a positive identification.The sequence is brilliantly realised uses a roving plan-view of the apartment complex to show how the machines infiltrate each apartment to apprehend their 'prey', each of which are indulging in the mundane activities of life, from taking a dump to arguing in the kitchen.What is interesting is those vignette characters' reaction to the intrusion of these sinister devices. They appear neither surprised nor shocked by their arrival, but instead either wait patiently to be scanned or ignore them. This occurrence is normalised, yet it appears to the viewer to be an unsettling violation of our rights to privacy and anonymity. What levels of control and intrusion will become normalised in the preceding generation.The theme of vision and sight is repeatedly explored throughout the film. The iris is the instrument of identification - the eye functions to define our individuality and our citizenship, but it also functions as a shackle, an inescapable 'mark of Cain'. Interestingly, again from classical parallels, is the means Anderton uses to escape from that particular problem when on the run - it is an established them in classical literature for those outside society - the hermit or outcast - to be blinded.I will avoid discussion of the film's last segment, the emergence of the precog character, the final plot twist and the denouement. It appears that when Spielberg intends them to account for themselves directly to the audience something is lost. From the loss of Colin Farrell, the anti-hero's nemesis - onward, the film loses something and cruises towards it resolution. This just makes the latter stylistics seems slightly forced and ephemeral.But there is intellectual engagement enough across the entire two and half hours to merit the regard of being a truly great film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
a great movie with style and substance,"I like this turn toward more serious material that Spielberg has taken. Minority report is a great effort.  Entertaining, deep and stylish.

Spielberg's return to form,"I was lucky enough to see a preview screening yesterday in Leicester Square and being a fan of both Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg I was looking forward to it. The film is based on a short story by sci-fi genius Phillip K. Dick and had, what I felt was a great premise, the police can see into the future to prevent murder happening and the police chief is told he is going to murder a person he's never heard of in 36 hours he has to go on the run to prove his innocence etc... Right from the first scene I was hooked when we saw Cruise and his team in action to prevent a 'crime of passion' in a race against time. Straight away I was delighted as this was 'vintage' Spielberg, really wracking up the tension and pace to get the palms sweating so by the conclusion of this sequence I'd realise I'd been holding my breath. From that point on the film rarely lets up and rockets along at a breakneck pace showcasing some superb action scenes, including a fight in an alleyway with police with jet packs, a terrific fight scene in a car manufacturing plant and a wonderful escape on the freeway with all the 'Tron-esque' cars. Tom Cruise gives a very good performance of the man on the run, adding more depth of character and emotions than is usual in these sort of films. His supporting cast is also fantastic including Colin Farrell as the FBI agent chasing after him, Samantha Morton as one of the 'Pre-cogs' who predict the murders and Max Von Sydow as Cruise's boss, an actor who always lends weight to whatever he does (even 'Flash Gordon'). There is a great streak of black humour that runs through the film which is a welcome relief at times from what is essentially a serious movie and thankfully the humour doesn't undermine the serious aspects, unlike in a lot of Spielberg's other films (Jurassic Park for instance). I have been disappointed with Spielberg's output for a while, to be honest I've found all of his films since 'Schindler's List' to be dissapointments, all containing good elements but overall very mediocre stuff. This film to me was a return to form, this was the Spielberg who made Jaws, Duel and Schindler's List, not the Spielberg who made Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan and A.I. This may be at base level a 'sci-fi thriller' but it is expertly handled, with a decent script, logical plot development, some nice twists (though some I should have seen coming in hindsight) and wonderful visuals and I came out loving it. If this is the quality of film we can expect from a Cruise/Spielberg collaboration then I can't wait for their next film together. Hello Mr Spielberg, it's good to have you back.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Spoiled by the same problems as AI,"Minority Report is a reasonably good film; great and exciting in places, and lame as a one-legged mule in others. Why have the last two movies Steven Spielberg has directed (AI and this) got intrusive and sickeningly schmaltzy scenes that really hurt the strong stuff before? The end of AI is the worst in motion picture history that I know of, and while Minority Report doesn't fall anywhere near as far, the way it shoots itself in the foot with clumsy 'emotional' scenes and overstated dialogue is distressing. Like AI, the end is overlong and drains the excitement away. If this kind of stuff was lost in the editing room, Minority Report could have been a classic.

One Of The Most Intelligent Sci-Fi Thrillers Ever Made.,"Definitely amongst the most intelligent sci-fi thrillers to surface on the silver screen, Minority Report is an ingeniously envisioned, smartly crafted & cleverly narrated cinema from Steven Spielberg that presents the director in prime form, paints an endlessly fascinating portrait of the future & remains one of the most creative works of Spielberg's filmmaking career.Set in Washington D.C. in the year 2054 where crime has been entirely eradicated thanks to an advanced system that's able to pre-determine any criminal activity, allowing the cops to arrest the perpetrators before they commit their crimes, Minority Report follows the Special Police Force's chief who one day finds himself accused of a future murder & tries to prevent it from happening.Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film doesn't wallow in explaining how everything works in the future but simply gets on with its main plot within few minutes into the story. Spielberg's execution deserves kudos for he does a terrific job in narrating its complicated plot & keeps everyone firmly glued to their seats from start to finish while the screenplay is a masterwork of imagination in itself.Art Direction puts up some extensively detailed sets on the screen, the sci-fi elements that are infused into the story carry a thought-provoking, well-researched & plausible dimension, Cinematography encapsulates the film with a neo-noirish ambiance, thanks to its splendid use of desaturated colours, high contrasts n lighting. Editing relentlessly paces the whole narrative & John Williams' score is fitting.Coming to the performances, Minority Report features a pretty reliable cast in Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton & Max von Sydow and everyone is very convincing in their given roles. The action sequences are an absolute delight to look at, Visual Effects is state- of-the-art stuff as in every Spielberg film and even though it enhances the experience by a great deal, it never overshadows the story at hand.On an overall scale, Minority Report is a bravura piece of work from Steven Spielberg that digs way too deeper than most sci-fi flicks dare to, has been influential in the creation of a few technologies in existence today, and on a thematic level is as rich as Blade Runner. Its deeper layers may unearth on multiple viewings but even for those who aren't in mood for excavation, Minority Report simply happens to be an extremely gripping, wildly entertaining & thoroughly satisfying experience. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

"""If you loved ""Blade Runner""..........","Another Philip K. Dick story gets the full Monty for the big screen. The big question here: ""How far is a society prepared to go to ensure public safety""? Does any of this sound familiar to you, folks? I'm sitting here watching CNN reporting that the FBI is hunting for 5 suspected terrorists who entered the US illegally as I write this. ""Pre-crime""? Homeland security? Do the math. This movie came out right on time. The subject is definitely in play.The world of 2054 as portrayed here by our pal Steve Speilberg is not at all implausible.

The scene with Cruise's character in the mall is coming soon, and I don't mean to a theater near you, either.The film is story-driven and the acting is secondary to the special effects, which are spectacular, but Peter Stormare is a hoot is his cameo and Samantha Morton and Cruise do a creditable job considering the parameters. For you cinematography buffs out there, I believe that I counted 659 different shades of the color blue during the course of the movie. See if you can find them all.

"Finally, a satisfying Spielberg","At last, a movie that will satisfy and thrill, that will fill you up with special effects and still manage to tickle your brain cells as well.Minority Report is one of the best sci-fi films made in the last 20 years. Tom Cruise gives a multi-layered, humanistic performance as Pre-crime detective John Anderton, a man bruised to the bone by grief and driven by the necessity of his work. Anderton is compelled to be perfect at his job, ever since the death of his young son years earlier. He knows he's good, and so does everyone else, especially the young FBI agent who wants Anderton's job for himself and tries to discredit him.The action is intelligent, not noisy and flashy. The special effects, most notably the car-chase scene, are just dazzling, but not so much fantasy that they strike a false note.The plot is beautifully put together, weaving two stories into one, and chugging along seamlessly, without any noticeable holes or questions afterward. Rarely is a film so well constructed that it raises no questions, but this one is just such a film. All your questions are answered, and without any ""deus ex machina"" plot devices.The supporting cast is excellent. Max von Sydow, as Pre-crime Director Lamar Burgess, gives a classy, well-drawn performance, as does Samantha Morton, the sensitive, fragile pre-cog, who tries to help Anderton beat the frameup which threatens to put him away forever.The future in this film is a completely believable one, for a change; unlike the one in A.I., Spielberg's last attempt at a sci-fi film. There is enough of this world still left in the future world of Minority Report that we know where we are, and can relate to it. That makes this film all the more believable and realistic.I heartily applaud this effort. Well worth seeing more than once, and deserving of some greater recognition than it probably will get.

Almost great,"For most of its length Minority report ranks with Steven Spielberg's very best work.  It's imaginative, dark and occasionally thrilling, with one or two sequences worthy of Hitchcock were he to make a sci fi version of one of his wrong man scenarios.  Then you get to the last twenty minutes, which are dreadful.  Not only does Spielberg seem unable or unwilling to allow one of his movies to have a dark or disturbing ending but he can't even allow a potentially upsetting thread to remain hanging.  Instead the bad guy has to get caught, the good guy has to be vindicated, he has to repair his relationship with his estranged wife and she has to be expecting, the future crime program has to be terminated and the precogs have to be shown to be leaving satisfying lives.  Yuck.  The ending is ludicrous and betrays everything that the first two hours of the movie had accomplished.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Interesting movie, but stick to Dick (MAJOR Spoilers!)","Philip K. Dick has written loads of short stories that have evolved into screen-plays. Some have worked (Blade Runner, Total Recall) by basically developing a life of their own and becoming something independent of their source, while still staying true to the story their based on. However, this movie is not one of them.The problem is not the craftsmanship. The digital effects are incredible, probably best viewed on the big screen. The acting is good, maybe sometimes a bit over the top by Agatha, the pre-cog. And Tom Cruise is, of course, his own flashy self. And a few moments of slapstick-humor to spice things up a bit. And yet, this movie seem like a waste of time. Why? Let's take a look at the story:John Anderton works for ""Precrime"", an institution that predicts murders days before they are about to happen. They do this by using ""pre-cogs"", humans kept in a state of drug-induced helplessness, who get visions of the future and pass them on. Knowing what is going to happen, Precrime can act accordingly and stop any crime before it is committed. One day, Anderton sees his own name as a ""future murderer""; however, the victim is no one he's ever heard of. He now has to prove his innocence against a system that seems to know his future before he does.Great and imaginative story. And yet, the movie wasn't satisfying.It might be because Steven Spielberg and Philip K. Dick are completely incompatible in regards to their world-view, and come to opposite conclusions. And that poses a gigantic problem for the script:Dick sees the future as something that cannot be changed, not by our own individual choices at any rate. However, because of free will, there our several ""alternate"" futures, which is also the reason for there being THREE pre-cogs. They ""vote"" for a future that is the most likely to happen, but knowledge of that vote naturally changes the course of events. But the fact that you'd change your mind if you knew about your future can also be foreseen by the pre-cogs, so their vision changes accordingly. Therefore, the pre-cogs are always right, no matter what you do. This idea is reminiscent of the Oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece.Stiil with me? I knew you were.With Spielberg, it's an entirely different matter. He views free will as an entity in itself. For him, there are not millions of preplanned events, that we slide through by taking this path or that; there is only ONE way, one that we determine by the choices we make. Therefore the pre-cog system doesn't work, as by these choices we can negate any ""vision"" of the future that is brought up. This is a very individualistic ideal, and, in a sense, the ideal that Hollywood and, specifically, Stephen Spielberg have always represented.Now imagine a Greek tragedy, done in a ""Hollywood"" way. See the problem?My advice: Read the short story, hate it or enjoy it depending on your world-view, but skip this movie. It just doesn't know which direction to take...",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Majority Records  (My best writer + my best director) (dvd),"This terrific duo should associate more often. I will not enter the empty debate to decide if it's the best PKD adaptation (just because PKD must be read than watched) but there were a lot of good ideas and inspired filmmaking here. The first pre-crime reminds you that Spielberg is really good at thriller and it's a shame that he doesn't do more, above all that he started here (see ""Night Gallery""). At first, the blue filtering didn't convince me here it's fine because this future is really bleak. It reminds me of ""Robocop"": a future not too futurist but with us, common people having become hollow shells and identified data: thoughts, eyes, body warm, localization. What can the ""government"" ask more the moment we can't get any privacy thus identity. This all-seeing eye is well depicted here all the more than PKD is an intelligent rebel: the loss of our liberties would be pernicious, hidden behind the ""it's for your own good"". Tomorrow, it will be casual crimes, but today it's already terrorism, fundamentalism and states debts. But PKD is also a true writer because it's his delicious idea to have a pre-crime cop witnessing his own pre-crime! With Spielberg on command, you can find that the bragging Farrell is decent actor and fresh newcomers (like Morton) as well.

Modern Masterpiece!,"When you see a film based on any literature by Philip K. Dick you can rest assured it will be something worth watching. Steven Spielberg has crafted a very realistic vision of our future and the questions it may raise. He has not lost his tendency to put a positive spin on even the darkest of questions, but he manages to keep you on the edge of your seat up until the final breath.The futuristic thriller/mystery is based on the concept of precognitive visions of the future, specifically murder. Three Twins have acquired the gift of seeing a murder before it happens allowing a controversial program called Precrime to emerge. Precrime is about to go national and has been placed under review to find any possible flaws in the system. Tom Cruise plays Chief Detective John Anderton, who is caught up in a conspiracy to ensure that Precrime fails, however all is not what it seems. John sees a vision supplied by the twins of himself killing a man he does not know, it is now a race against time for John to find out what is really going on before Precrime catch up with him and put him away.The film is perfect in its conception, exploring futuristic law enforcement techniques, weapons, entertainment, modes of transportations and possible moral dilemmas. It puts a spin on the innocent until proven guilty principal and the criminal is arrested before they even commit the crime and even become a criminal. It asks the big question, ""Just because you believe something is going to happen and you stop it, would it of really happened?' Even better than that is the film actually answers the question and doesn't leave you hanging.It is also a perfect example of how well computer technology can enhance a production. The special effects are only evident because you know technology like that does not exist; however the image itself is flawless and very real. The ""Think Tank"" behind this production must of spent a great deal of time coming up with plausible technology and realistic effects to make the production seem that much more real. Ultimately it works and the film looks and feels like a possible future.Unfortunately the film has no great standout performances and Tom Cruise is his normal self (same as always), but everything is very sold and certainly makes the pass mark. There are also a number of questions about certain details in the film, like why are the prisoners held in the manner that they are? It seems in a film about moral questions, some of the details are important, but they receive nothing in the script. It does however not seem to matter in the end.This film is another Spielberg masterpiece and will not fail to entertain most tastes.

One of the most impeccable science fiction films,"It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words, then moving pictures are worth a million words, which is why it may generate at least a million words.Steven Spielberg conducts another cinematic masterpiece and the movie is one of the most beautifully crafted movies ever made. It is an engrossing story about a system called ""Precrime"" seeing into the future and predict crimes beforehand by three gifted humans (called ""Pre-Cogs"") with special powers.At the beginning,the film gives a snapshot of the background in the year 2054 A.D where technology is highly advanced and the state-of-the-art compared to that nowadays. For instance,hand-touch screens,automatic traffic moving system and sci-fi weapons will have commonly used in the foreseeable future.The content is unquestionably amazing.The background sets in the year 2054 A.D and the ""Precrime"" with highly advanced technology prevent crimes,usually murder cases, from happening. But,will the system realize when i become a hoary-headed old man? I reckon everything will happen.The story is undoubtedly impeccable,but a little bit complicated.It raises some questions about morality, justice, exploitation and society issues. For example, can the authority declare guilty of someone who 'may' murder via the ""Precrime"" that affect their whole life? is the ""Precrime"" flawless if some officers use the system to help their friends or relatives with their authority,just like Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise)?? How the government monitor the system which might be mis-used and cheated??The casts craft a visually stunning movie that give a amazing plot portraying the US authority tries to stop murder cases from happening.

Spielberg Picks Another Good Story,"We quite often give sole credit to the director of a good movie, and while this is deserved, we must also recognize the individual that envisioned and created the basis for the movie in the first place - the writer.  I have been impressed with quite a bit of Spielberg's work (save that of A.I.) but have not until Minority Report paid attention to where the ideas came from. The reason I did so with this movie was that the plot was so fantastic and bursting with creativity that I was almost compelled to investigate this source of its genius, Philip K. Dick.Spielberg made this literary gem into a feast for the eyes.  No stone seems to go unturned in creating a realistic world of the future.  From cars to advertising to appliances, Spielberg assembles it all.  And to garner some of the best that Hollywood has to offer, he enlists the services of Tom Cruise.  Cruise plays the protagonist, Detective John Anderton, in a futuristic tale of a world where a crime can been predicted.  A ""precrime"" bureau is assembled to stop that which hasn't happened yet - future murder. Anderton's embrace of precrime is due to the loss of his only child, who was abducted.  When Anderton stumbles upon a flaw in the precrime system, he is setup and hunted down by his own agency.  The story begs the question that if you knew the future, is it predestined that you would still make the same choices, despite your knowledge of what was about to happen?  Can you change the course of events to come?Detective Anderton discovers that not everything in life, now or in the future, is merely black and white and that no looking-glass ball is perfect. For a wild roller-coaster ride of a movie that has some of the most creative and plausible ideas of the future, I highly recommend you watch Minority Report.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Go Steven Go,"I always feel a bit anxious when I'm going to watch a movie adapted from a book. I mean, I really love Philip K.

Just might restore one's faith in the Hollywood machine...,"Sparked to go see this one out of sheer morbid curiosity after the ""A.I."" debacle (a year old movie I still have yet to decide whether I liked or not) and by some very positive reviews from critics, this is one of those rare Hollywood films (like last month's ""Insomnia)"" that I was literally shocked by how good it was and how much I liked it. Spielberg's first attempt at film noir is quite the doozy, and it's always a treat to see an actor like Tom Cruise actually try to act and inhabit a character instead of just projecting his ego on screen and playing what is essentially himself (much the same way Pacino delivered an Oscar-worthy performance in ""Insomnia""). What is so pleasing about this film is the way it follows all of the traditional film noir rules (betrayals, mysteries, and plot twists galore, memorable dialogue, philosophizing, great chase scenes, intricate detail into crime and detection) while at the same time giving us one of the most well thought out, beautifully designed, and utterly captivating views of the near future ever brought to screen that falls somewhere between over the top Verhoueven satire (""Total Recall""/""Starship Troopers"") and Kubrickian dystopia (""2001"", ""Clockwork Orange""). Unlike ""A.I."", this film also benefits from some much needed sense of humor to offset the often disturbing imagery, and also isn't afraid to utilize a nice tidy ending and many genre clichés (stunning action sequences, predictable but still powerful plot twists) to propel the story. I for one have become a huge fan of this latter day Spielberg, the more mature, darker, and clearly Kubrick inspired auteur. In the end, Minority Report may up come a few straws short of a pure classic, but when so much of what Hollywood puts out there for mass consumers is pure drivel, it is nice to see that some people in La-La land are still making one hell of an effort to truly entertain.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Interesting, but tries a little too hard","Steven Spielberg needs to stop trying so hard to make a masterpiece. Minority Report was a good movie, but it felt forced, obvious and even preachy some of the time. Social commentary should never be at the forefront of a film or itdetracts considerably from the story. A statement should be the subtext--the""read between the lines"" part of a movie. But Spielberg seems to think it's the other way around: the social statement is your film and your characters andstory are just coming along for the ride. It just doesn't work well when you do that, though.When you overlook all that, there is something worth seeing here. It's nice to look at, displays a dizzying array of gee-whiz futuristic gadgetry and, of course, you've got Tom Cruise. So, you know, it's not bad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Clearly he's uncontested in the realm of technical filmmaking, and I think he knows how to handle a story as well.  Tom Cruise and the supporting cast all did well.  The cinematography, editing, music, visual effects, and production design, all done by Spielberg's regular collaborators, were all top notch.  Sure, a couple of things bothered me a little.

No retort for Minority Report!,"Minority Report is evidence that Spielberg kouldn't quite kick the Kubrickian phase after making Artificial Intelligence. But this time, he's traded in the cute little robot for suspense, jet packs and braintwister plot twists. In the future, crime can be predicted, projected and detected thanks to a handful of strong silent types who have arguably the hardest job of anyone in the world. They have to sit in a bathtup all day. These pruney ""precogs"" are the reason why Tom Cruise can kick so much ass before that ass even has a chance to kill. It's true you might be scratching your head a little. You might be wondering if these precog pool people have a right to leave their bathtub. You might be wondering why are they in a bathtub. You might also wonder why there are still old fashioned garbage shoots in a future that's so high- tech, we can see the swirly thoughts of precogs on a video screen. But don't worry! The action and suspense in this film are as plentiful as product placements. Let's see... there's Pepsi, Aquafina, Reebok, Nokia, Gap. There may even be a subliminal ad for hemroid cream. Minority Report isn't just a moody, neo-noir thriller either. There's a bit of slapstick to be enjoyed too. Witness a blindfolded Tom eating a moldy sandwich after having an eyeball transplant. The yucks continue as a computer Reports Cruise's eyes as those of a Minority when they are identified as a Japanese man's. Cruise turns in an emotive performance here as we see him break down and crack up more than once or twice. When he's not jumping around or hitching a ride on a jetpacker, he's shedding a tear or two.

So, what happened?For the remainder of the film the pacing is terrible (bursts of action moving the story along followed by long periods of...well...sluggish navel gazing).  It's as if Spielberg has NO idea what kind of a film he is making.I understand the problem, as Philip K. Dick stories tend toward the futuristic high tech combined with film noire.  But Spielberg doesn't combine them...he just makes two different movies and shows us one during the first hour, with the second movie making up the remainder of the film.It's worth watching, and even paying for...but don't expect anything great.

Nice Effects but the basic plot premise is pure B.S. Cruise Should Know  Better,"Reality Check! I think that responsible and intelligent film reviewers should make a clear distinction between the genres of ""science fiction"" and ""science fantasy"". The first genre occasionally produces an intelligent script based on what could theoretically be possible if human knowledge and technology continue to expand at the present rate. The second genre is a time-wasting mess of ""fairy tales"" (the sort of moronic drivel LRH specialized in) that could only appeal to or entertain flakes. If only our country's pathetic education system could somehow instill in the majority of students the two most basic laws of physics (the first and second laws of thermodynamics)we'd all get along a lot better. The brilliant physicist, Stephen Hawking, vainly tried to explain, in detail*, that the second law of thermodynamics makes it absolutely impossible to foretell the future - not even with the haziest accuracy. Even Scientologists acknowledge that cognitive thought has mass and energy; - ergo, human cognition must be subject to the laws of entropy. You can no more recall the future than you could travel to work today on gasoline or diesel fuel that have not yet been refined and would have to be derived from fossil fuels that have not yet even been been extracted from the ground! Three years before production began, Steven Spielberg assembled a team of sixteen future experts in Santa Monica to brainstorm out the year 2054 for him.

Goooood Sci-Fi,"What could you expect from Steven Spielberg besides an intelligent well-done film? ""Minoriy Report"" is just that. Plus, it has the intensity of Tom Cruise's performance. If you ask me, it's a good mix.The story is not that convincing though. Crimes being stopped before they happen. Hmmm. I was not so fond to the idea of humans being able to predict when and how a murder was going to happen. When I heard of the movie I thought it was gonna be like an enormous organic computer to calculate probabilities, give results and never miss. Anyway, the point is: police has now a window for peeking into the future.Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the top cop of this department who has unlimited faith in this system; he dedicates his whole life to it since he lost his son and wife. But his faith is torn apart when the system turns against him. And the running starts...I think what I liked the most of ""Minority Report"" was Spielberg's vision of the future. It almost makes perfect sense (then again, except for the infamous pre-cogs): personalized advertising, eye scanners, 3D home videos, etc. Now THIS I call science fiction. I don't think I could have bared to see it under Paul Verhoeven's eye (originally, he was to direct the movie).The whole look of the movie is fantastic. Unlike his 'compadre' George Lucas, Spielberg does not show off with visual effects in every frame of the movie. They are there alright, but he manages to blend the SFX with the background so nicely, your eyes take them as a whole. There's also that blurry look we saw in ""A.I."" that makes it feel like you're dreaming of it.There's this one other thing: the ending. Is it just me or this ending is just as bad as ""A.I.""'s? I mean, in ""A.I."" they could just have put ""THE END"" when David finally reaches his Blue Fairy and close a very good movie. I feel the same happens here, but go see for yourself.

Well realised but flawed future thriller,"This is one of Spielberg's better films. It's a highly competent, Blade-Runneresque vision of the future that was highly influential in its depictions of gesture computing, personal transport, advertising, and people tracking. There are scenes here directly influenced by David Cronenberg and Ridley Scott. The atmosphere is tense and pace is handled very well throughout. The story is interesting in its treatment of precognition as a scientific crime-fighting tool. Spielberg does well to set up a convincing future world with a bizarre mystery at the center of the story.Where things unravel is towards the end of the film. What begins as a clever, twisty tale with a very interesting and unusual concept, ends with a bog-standard and very tried trope which does not do the rest of the film justice. The final twist and reveal are extremely weak, not even to the level of a weekly TV detective story. It's a disappointing flaw in an otherwise exciting and thought provoking SciFi thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Interesting and involving sci-fi thriller from Spielberg,"Set in the middle of the 21st century, ""Minority Report"" follows John Anderton (Tom Cruise), a skilled Pre-Crime cop who is very efficient in preventing murders from happened. He lives in Washington D.C., where there hasn't been a murder in six years thanks to the installment of Pre-Crime. This law enforcement group uses visions from three future-tellers (Precogs) to determine when and where a murder will happen. But when the Precogs predict that John Anderton is planning a murder, he is forced to flee and somehow prove his innocence.Obviously, one of the big issues here is if it is right to arrest someone from committing a crime you know will happen before the fact. Both sides of the issue are given fair treatment here; we see both the great efficiency of the Pre-Crime unit as well as the consequences it bodes for, as Steven Spielberg put it, ""the .002%"" Such a premise holds a goldmine of material, and Spielberg and his collaborators do a good job mining it for substance. The acting is very good as well. Tom Cruise is solid as the lead, but Samantha Morton steals the show as a Precog who starts developing a connection with Anderton. Max Von Sydow and Colin firth also make good impressions in their supporting roles.The city of Washington D.C. is richly realized, with its magnetic highways, personalized advertisements, and no-glasses-needed 3-D video files. The cinematography presents a world that is obviously very advanced, but emotionally detached. Overall, this is a very technically accomplished picture.As much as the creators go into the issues at hand, I ironically wished they had gone deeper. How, for example, was the U.S. Constitution changed to allow for Pre-Crime to exist? I also wished the grand motive for the existence of Pre-Crime by its creator had been better clarified; as it was, it seemed a little sketchy.Still, this remains a solid achievement. ""Minority Report"" is both thrilling and smart, and is worth your time especially if you are into good works of science fiction or Steven Spielberg's repertoire.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Cheetah,"Tom cruise is on the run in this film. This movie is alot at 2 hours and then some - reviewers try to hard to tackle it to one genre and say its thriller or science fiction or action but i would say its chopped bits and pieces of all 3 genres. The movies got good action, good scenes / story ( depth) , some complexity may need a second watch , interesting twists and turns. Couple dull moments in my opinion. If your like myself though your going to stick to it watch to the end.The two stars did a good job Cruise { kind of } and Farrell performances are decent liked the chase/fight scenes. Kudos to Farrell his character development skills. * highly recommend -The Beguiled - Also have to mention props to Samantha as Agatha her scenes were intriguing and thought she could have been used more she was belittled in the story. And that old guy Max kept me drawn in watching . Some of the other other characters seemed very minimized do to the story and action. Time as well perhaps. Few of them especially the "" Precogs"" could have had more prominent roles story scenes.Spielberg does decent job with the movie. I find something about the style in this movie different then his other movies i love. Could be the length of the movie or Tom Cruise way about him might have been a masterpiece with an actor with more flavor or selflessness maybe ? Also do NOT question things when watching its going to get you confused. Few times in first half hour i asked questions instead watching and listening.

It was especially good during the scenes where Cruise is looking at the murder on that screen in the beginning.However, the overall directing, I thought was bad.  Characters will often start off from the opposite side of the room walk to each other so they are 5 inches away from each other's face then start talking.  It got very awkward, and if someone got that close to my face I would back away.However, after seeing it I developed this really weird fixation on the bald girl, Agatha, despite the fact that she looks like a lizard and looks mentally retarded in certain scenes.

one of the most complex films that is still enjoyable as a blockbuster,"Steven Spielberg Directs another classical film after his A.I fails to deliver the high expectation set by his previous body of work. Minority Report is like a reminder film that he is still one of the best directors of all time.Spielberg sets Minority Report in the near future of 2054, in which the technology is advanced, but not far-fetched. Cars can drive themselves (which is pretty much what they can do today. Google car) and ride up elevators, computers come with holograms as a user interface, and stores recognize you from your eyeball scan. As all science fiction fans know, however, the genre is not about technology but about ideas. The big idea for Minority Report is based on a short story by the venerable Philip K. Dick. In this future, there is a ""pre-crime"" unit in the police force, which revolves around three psychics who are able to see violent crimes before they occur. These visions are projected in a flat screen panel and manipulated by detectives with the grace of a symphony conductor. Equipped with futuristic stun guns, jet packs, and search robots, these cops then arrest and intern the criminals before the crimes are committed.Spielberg, with Janusz Kaminski, his cinematographer for many films, have crafted a visually stunning movie. The special effects are seamlessly incorporated of the world they created.Tom Cruise does a fantastic job of playing the lead. He is becoming one of the best sci-fi stars around, nearly all of his futuristic films are not only box office successful but also are extremely enjoyable and fan loved.The film is just delight to watch, and has enormous play back value.

Brilliant!,"After ""AI"", I was quite reluctant to believe the hype surrounding the Cruise/Spielberg collaboration for ""Minority Report.""  ""AI"" was such a convoluted, though beautifully filmed, piece of film.  ""Minority Report"", on the other hand, is not only well-filmed, but it appears to showcase Spielberg in some of his best work to date!  Elegant, thrilling, poignant, and masterful, ""Minority Report"" delves deep into the moral quagmire that represents the government controlling ""psychics"" and ostensibly putting them to use for their own betterment.  We all know that whenever the government gets involved in any form, something horrid will happen.  Such is the case in ""M.R.""--a good man, Cruise, is taken down like an expendable pawn in a egoistic game of ""show me the money"" by his ultimate superiors.

A very underrated movie.,"First, I'm not a natural Steven Spielberg fan and I'm not a Tom Cruise fan. I usually strongly dislike most of their work.However, Minority Report forces both of them out of their respective safety zones. Cruise was pretty good in Vanilla Sky where he tolerated a total facial destruction as a key part of the plot. Once again, in MR, he's not a afraid to look bad -- emotionally or physically. It's hard to believe this one time smirking ""pretty boy"" can be so gritty and he does it convincingly.Spielberg laid an egg with AI, but here he does a good job of convincing you that you are in the year 2054, moreso than more future set movies.The movie has some interesting homage subtleties -- throwback to Kubrick movies and style, for example. And except for a couple of really dumb plot holes, it's pretty tight and unpredictable, even when it's being predictable (which itself should be predictable in a movie about predictions!).I'm usually the first to make the ""too long"" complaint, but the movie is trying to say a lot about its characters in the small scale, and also about the social reaction to crime on a larger scale.How far are we willing to go for security? I think that we're constantly trying to balance freedom and security. We often get it wrong -- the WW II imprisonment of Japanese-Americans, overzealous police, unconstitutional detainment of ""persons of interest"" regarding terrorism. From hindsight, we usually get it right. Spielberg offers a sense of foresight in this movie. Hopefully, we'll get it right.Enjoy the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Once in a while along comes a movie that justifies the very existence of the medium. Minority Report is one that does just that. I had no idea what this was about when I entered the cinema, killing an over-bearingly hot afternoon in, ironically, Washington. Then I sat spellbound for over 2 hours as Spielberg and his crew span a tale so pertinent to our time. A multi-layered movie that works on, well, every layer. Whether it's action, special effects, film noir, or just plain politics this is a film that is intelligent. It uses, rather than depends on, special effects and poses so many questions about freedom and security. How relevant at the moment, especially as it seems that US citizens can be put away for just thinking about ""terrorist acts"".Somewhat episodic in its early stages, though well spiced with humour, it matures into a free-flowing thriller laced with political messages that we ignore at our peril. A must-see for any movie-goer with an ounce of intelligence.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Complex film,"Great film about the future. Colin Ferrell was terrific.This film is truly excellent. Perfect casting and excellent effects. Acting is without compromise and the climax from the finale sequence is out of this world. This remains one of my favourite films and ranks along with blade runner and Lord of the rings trilogy. Respect to the producers directors (Stephen Spielberg) cast and crew. Truly an awesome job. Total respect to the author of the story line, without doubt he has captured the heart of many thousands of people and incited logarithmically more, with his insight and imagination. This film i recommend to all film buffs, and i am sure without any doubt will be an all time best. It will always keep me firmly poised watching with intent.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Best Movie of the 2002 Summer!,"Last summer, I went to see Steven Spielberg's previous movie A.I. Artificial Intellegence and I thought that it was an excellent motion picture. But also, last summer I heard that Steven Spielberg was planning to direct a movie called Minority Report about a group of futuristic police officers who catch serial killers before the crimes are even commited. I absolutley couldn't wait to see how this movie would turn out. So now, one year later, I went to the opening night of it and I must say that this was one hell of a movie. It was so cool the way that the future technology was developed, the way the special effects were created, and the best of all: Steven Spielberg did such a brilliant job directing the film. Movies like Minority Report only come once a year which is not enough considering that this is the kind of movie that people want to see. Things to enjoy throughout the movie are: the score by John Williams, the beautiful cinematography, the awsome screenplay, and the screen presence of a lot of the actors including Tom Cruise, Colin Farrel, Jessica Capshaw, Max Von Sydow. Minority Report will be one of the best experiences of your life.Steven Spielberg, I heard, is working on another movie called Catch Me If You Can starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio which is slated to hit theatres over Christmas of this year. Hopefully I will get to see that along with the sequal to Lord of the Rings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Strangeness,"This is another expected oddly-twisted take on a Phillip K. Dick story.  The combination of Cruise-Spielberg is wonderful and works in this movie.  The story was good and it kept you going throughout.Having seen Blade Runner and Total Recall, I knew that Dick's work would be fairly left of center.  I was NOT disappointed!  Although, one has to wonder about how much of working with Kubrick rubbed off on Spielberg.  There are definite tips of the hat toward Mr. K.  Which is actually fitting for this movie.Once again Max von Sydow shines in a strong showing.  He has yet to disappoint me in a movie.  He can make really dull dialog work to his advantage, not that that problem existed in this film, but in past films. He was a beacon!!  Great!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Spielberg is the consummate of foresight,"When you watch a movie like this, you wonder how in the world can the guys come up with the setup of a future that is so specious and yet so real. But Spielberg as we know, is a master of that art. The mannerism in which 2054 AD is depicted, the technology,the gizmos, the transport,the infrastructure and every single component of the plot, it seems like Spielberg himself is a precog who has the ability to foresee the future and tell us how it'll be. Cruise, like always is at the zenith with his action and involvement but for this movie, its the plot and the cogent story line which will capture your imagination. You'd actually feel as if you belong in a real world from the future because its appeal is so very massive. In a nutshell, the movie is about the Colombian department of pre-crime, a department that has been setup with the intention of stopping criminal incidents before they happen. How ? Well, its 3 precogs who are supposedly inculcated with the capability or rather with the gifts of coming up with previsions of crimes that are yet to occur. With state of the art transport, the cops can easily get t the crime scene and stop it from happening. But then comes the twist. A twist that's the real thing to watch out for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"I think this is a good film, and thats all i can say...","It is kind of hard for me to write about this movie cause i think it is an ok movie. So i can't bad mouth it for 10 lines and i can't brag about it for 10 lines. If you have read any of my other reviews you will probably notice that i love the actor Peter Stormare, and he is, like always, great in this movie. But the thing that struck me while watching this on dvd was: I had the subtitles on so i wouldn't miss any of the dialog, but when Dr. Solomon Eddie talks with his wife the subtitles said: *speaks Russian* It should be pretty obvious that it is Swedish and not Russian he is speaking... Some of my friends doesn't like Tom Cruise as an actor but i am always telling them that that is because they only watch his poor movies. He is pretty good in this movie, as Detective Jon Anderton.

A Masterpiece by Default?,"""Minority Report"" isn't a bad movie, but that doesn't make it a masterpiece, certainly not the instant-classic four-star science fiction film most reviewers are making it out to be.It seems that films which receive the highest praise these days do so by default.  If 95% of the movies out there are crap, does that make the other 5% worthy of high praise?  NO.  But I suppose if I was a professional film critic watching crappy movies all year long and then came across a passable science fiction film like ""Minority Report,"" I'd probably get all excited too and say, ""Hey, this one isn't too bad!  What the hell--it's a classic!"" That's the only explanation I have for the critical praise this film has received.  Just add it to the list of highly-praised films from the past five or six years that have been graded on a curve.""Minority Report"" isn't a bad science fiction film.  Although there are some huge flaws in its logic, the main concepts it introduces certainly give you something to think about, which is what good SF is supposed to do. However, Spielberg's attempt to compensate for the film's lack of emotional pull by tacking on a happily-ever-after ending might cancel out the introspective aspects of the story for some people; I don't mind happy endings, but this ending was a bit too much.The film gives you other things to chew on besides the SF concepts: action sequences, special effects, neat little gadgets, a few startling moments, a bit of humour, a bit of mystery, and Tom Cruise's chiselled and well-photographed face if you're into that.  It has a little bit of everything to satisfy most people.Overall, though, ""Minority Report"" is a science fiction film, the kind that gives you something cool to look at and a few things to think about while you're being distracted by the action.  But that's it.  It's a passable science fiction film, nothing too spectacular or too profound, nothing to get too excited about.If you haven't already seen it in the theatres, save yourself some money and wait for the video.And I repeat:  Just because it isn't a bad movie, doesn't make it a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
An underrated Sci-Fi movie,"In a dystopian future where authority has complete control and people are constantly under surveillance, a system called ""Precrime"" is established. With this system, murder crimes can be detected and prevented before they happen. The person who is going to commit the murder is arrested before the crime is committed. However, this raises the question: Would the arrested person have really committed the murder? What if the so-called ""murder"" decided not to go through with it at the last moment? What if all of this was just a thought? In that case, the arrested person would be punished for nothing. This leads to questioning the system.In my opinion, this film is an underrated sci-fi movie. Despite having such a great and unpredictable story, along with excellent visual effects, it remains relatively unknown.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
better than average tom cruise movie.,"Based on the philip k dick short story of the same name.Where the movie and original story intersect is the premise, pre-cogs have the gift to see crime before it happens allowing a team of police to prevent the crimes from happening the criminals are arrested before they commit victims aren't victims anymore. The existing chief(cruise) of the unit is under inspection by an outsider(farrel).The film does several things very well, the vision of the future it presents is excellent in the sense that it is believable that America could look like that in 50 years.The action scenes are good, punchy, not drawn out and full of themselves. The acting certainly didn't embarrass itself and the film moves along seamlessly from one phase to another.Where it does fall down is behind the action there is, well, nothing of note. The short story was more concerned with how far someone would go to protect what they believe is right idea what sacrifices would they make. This was what philip k dick was more interested in, everything else was salad dressing. For the film the salad was sacrificed, becoming standard action fair, guns, fights, chases, damsel in distress and make sure the bad guy gets it in the end.It just feels empty and disappointing, it could have been more than just an action movie by the numbers.Not to mention the complete lack of suspense, I didn't come across anything in the film which I thought that's a surprise, didn't see that coming.Ultimately the film is one of the better Tom Cruise action movies which Tom Cruise fans will enjoy, Philip K. Dick fans however may not.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Showing its age,"Saw this in the original theatrical run and was impressed at the time. It exceeded my hopes for an adaptation of one of Philip K. Dick's best stories. Flash forward 10 years and I wonder what I ever saw in it (the film, that is). Visually it holds up, though the CGI segments are looking shabby already. Action scenes are well paced, plot nuances are treated deftly. Some of the supporting roles are badly miscast--I laughed out loud at the abrupt appearance of Mike ""Mind of the Married Man"" Binder--but Peter Stormare and Jason Antoon were both great and Max von Sydow probably carries the film.Still the preponderance of bad easily obscures the good. The clever bits are more or less forgettable, while Spielberg's knack for clichés and remarkably immature sense of humor stink up the film (like when the robot spiders canvass the apartment building, or when Cruise chomps down on some spoiled food, etc. etc.) Then there are the pervasive cornball Spielbergisms--anybody who remembers Close Encounters, Hook, Jurassic Park, and the rest knows what I mean. The primordial will to schmaltz is always right below the surface, even during his most imaginative and skillful storytelling. I think the worst might be when the precog is narrating to Cruise and his sickly-looking waif/wife about their kid going off to college and falling in love, blah blah blah (this unbearable moment of fake drama is soon shattered in a preposterous shift).With the last 20 minutes the movie degenerates rapidly. In retrospect, an oddly mediocre effort!",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Gotta suspend disbelief!,"As any Sci-Fi fan will confirm, suspension of disbelief is the core of fiction.  It's why we see movies in the first place... escapism. When suspension of disbelief is disrupted, the entire pursuit is for naught!In ""Minority Report"", Spielberg has undertaken the task of creating a very complex and detailed future world.  A world rife with technical and extra-sensory wizardry.It is a shame, then, that after having painstakingly created this elaborate world, he throws away the audience's suspension of disbelief with a GRIEVOUS technical error!As anyone who has worked in a position requiring ""card-key"" access will tell you, upon leaving that position, the ""card-key"" is surrendered or rendered useless - eliminating the possibility of access by a former employee.One of the critical actions that our hero (a fugitive from justice, at this point) takes in this film is to infiltrate his former employer using his OLD EYE (essentially his OLD CARD-KEY)!!!From that point on in the film, all hope was lost. The security system at this cutting edge, high tech, high security facility simply permits the access of a disgruntled former employee who happens to be currently wanted for murder?!Despite the impressive special effects and capable acting, I can only recommend ""Minority Report"" for a good laugh.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Good for folks with ADD,"Cheesy at times, but that's about the worst thing I could possibly say about this film. It's chock-full-o'-imagination, featuring an uncountable amount of things in their futuristic state (such as cars, drugs, and of course, the law-enforcement). Deeply philosophical, and engrossing, the film tackles several issues of morality. In my opinion, the plot is absolutely intriguing, as the viewer is pulled through a series of events which leave one stunned and confused. Little by little the truth is revealed, in such a way that it is on the tip of our tongue until finally it is reaffirmed, or in most cases, we understand the truth only after Cruise thinks it up on his own. In any case, I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in crime-drama, philosophy, action, sci-fi or simply anyone who dislikes films that drag on, scene by scene with predictability. I could watch it over and over and never get sick of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

The concept is interesting, predicting crimes before they happen but I found it hard to stay fully invested.There are some cool futuristic elements, and Tom Cruise does a good job as usual, but the overall vibe of the film just isn't my style. The story felt a bit too convoluted at times, and while it has its moments, the sci-fi genre with its heavy philosophical undertones just isn't something I get into.If you're into high-concept sci-fi, this might work for you, but for me, it was just an okay watch that I don't feel the need to revisit.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Great,"This is an extraordinary film.  The acting, casting, screenplay, and overall film was top-notch.  Going into watch the movie I was not so confident of Tom Cruise's acting ability because of his work in Mission: Impossible 2. Cruise's performance was absolutely incredible.  He was a perfect choice for the role of John Anderton.One thing about this film you might want to know before you watch it s that this is not the kind of movie you see because you like to laugh or because you're looking for over the top action sequences.  Don't be fooled by the PG-13 rating either.  I belive this movie will be enjoyed most by intelligent adults.  You have to look at the meaning of the film and what it's asking.  Is everything predetermined from the start?  Does fate exist? Is everything predetermined until you see how it will happen and change it? Of course everyone will say no at first because nobody likes the idea that they aren't in control of their life.  It's one of those unanswerable questions.This film was inspired by a Philip K. Dick story.  So were two other movies that I know of. They are Blade Runner and Total Recall.  I would recommend both of these to anyone who liked the film Minority Report.  Both are similar in the way that they are both depictions of what the future could be like and they have deeper meanings to them.  I would also recommend seeing The Matrix if you enjoyed Minority Report.  Of course all of these films I've mentioned are not for everybody.The overall film is very enjoyable and worth watching.  You won't want to leave to go to the bathroom or to refill your drink you'll be so interested as the story unfolds with several twists and a very surprising resolution.Rating: A- or 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Slight disappointment,"I found Steven Spielbergs Minority report to be a slight disappointment with it's predictable scenes and clishes. The plot itself was far from predictable, but each individual scene went along a path everyone is familiar with. The ending was cheesy with John Andertons (Cruise) wife pregnant and re-united with him. Should the film have ended when they put the headband on John it would have been somewhat better.The future society remained in the background and not much interesting was shown, apart from a few nice visions of how technology will develop in the future.Acting was of a standard level - nothing specially good nor bad.7/10 in my oppinion - the absolute universal truth being 7/10 as well..",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Movie Magic Masterclass,"The movie is a masterclass of how stupid improbable ideas can be designed to look great and realistic (`pre-crime' psychic-palm reader bollix, retina-activated ads wasting ad budgets on a passing guy instead of the crowd around him, updatable newspapers that have to be held up with both hands like old newspapers taking up two seatwidths, doing tiring aerobics/music conducting just to open an Email, telling everyone in the room your password just to utilise voice-activation tech, `skyway-hiways' driving skyscraper residents mad, etc) - give me a break. sexy looking though.  Unlike most sci-fi movies, this one has been hyped for its tapping of the ideas of futurists and product designers, who unfortunately are usually more concerned with how fantastic their own visions in their own fields are than whether these are possible in the greater future reality. Hence, one has to take issue with this aspect for MR more than the out-and-out fantasies that are Star Wars, Superman or Pretty Woman.Unlike the beautiful snooze-fest A.I. (.also my exclamation after enduring to the end of that film), MR is a proper effects masterpiece with the classiness no George Lucas directed show can come close to.  Cruise is a De Niro of action stars, his very presence in a scene oozing charisma, be it as a part of an emsemble, an action sequence or a wordless close up.  SS is der ubermann of Movie Magic.

But yes this movie's biggest turn off for me was the pushing off the technology, too unbelievable.Along with the fact of the over doing of the future technology, this movie was fairly boring when it starts off, if money wasn't spent on this movie's rental it would have been turned off before it even ended. My friend in fact, fell asleep during the movie.Sure eventually the movie picked up, through a few good twists, but all together, but by then it was too late, I had already barely payed attention to the majority of the first half.

Science-fiction novels with thought-provoking implications, which made them interesting. In this film, this side is completely neglected, drowned in an orgy of special effects.Ridley Scott took one of Dick's novels and created a masterpiece: tense, visionary, fascinating, full of interesting, multi-faceted characters. Spielberg's is just a classic Hollywood movie: lots of effects, lots of adrenaline, lots of action, but characters are extremely dull, and almost every turn of the plot can be easily anticipated.Spielberg isn't very good at exploring characters and implications of a story, and Cruise is the right actor for a movie like this: a good professional, but also good for shallow characters only. Like other Spielberg's film, this one is also, sometimes, intolerably moralistic.Definitely no masterpiece; 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Gotta keep running,"One of the best films in the exciting category of ""future technology and radical ideas run amok,"" Director Steven Spielberg's (Saving Private Ryan) Minority Report dazzles through its high-octane action and visuals that are both gritty and fantastically futuristic, while at the same time the film thematically explores the dangerous world of pre-judgment and the quandary of pitting personal liberties and freedom of choice -- not to mention the moral, ethical, and judicial nightmare that is the notion that one may be found guilty of a crime that has yet to be committed -- against the guise of making the world a safer place. While other films similarly explore the dangers and downsides of the role of advanced technologies in futuristic settings, Minority Report proves the best of the bunch for its ability to counter the wonderfully-realized visuals of a bright and glossy utopian future world with an examination of the dark and disquieting elements that under the surface make it so, with superb special effects and exceptional actions scenes in tow to make it a complete Science Fiction picture.In the year 2054, Washington, D.C. has become one of the safest cities in the world. Premeditated murder has virtually disappeared, and crimes of passion are at an all-time low thanks to the Department of Precrime and the work of the Precogs, a trio of individuals with the capability to see future murders unfold and allow the would-be assailants to be arrested before they've had the opportunity to commit their heinous acts. The Department is headed by John Anderton (Tom Cruise), a divorced man who years earlier lost his son before the arrival of the Precogs. The program having proved a rousing success in the nation's capital, it's on the verge of going national, and Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), a representative from the Attorney General's office, has arrived for one final inspection of the process. When Anderton finds himself identified by the Precogs as a would-be assailant in a future murder, he must go on the run in an effort to clear his name of a crime he has yet to commit. In the process, he becomes privy to information that could jeopardize the future of the Precrime division while unearthing further disturbing information surrounding the project's origins.Though perhaps most readily identifiable by its stunning action scenes and nearly impeccable and highly-advanced special effects, Minority Report is, at its core, a cautionary tale that, like the best of Science Fiction, incorporates ideas that may be seen as relevant today but framed within the worlds of tomorrow. Based on a story by the famed Science Fiction writer Phillip K. Dick, Minority Report tackles some hard-hitting questions about not only one possible future of the American justice system, but also the impact of highly-advanced technologies on personal liberties. Is the future set? Is there no personal choice? Is one possible outcome of an as- of-yet physically unrealized future event enough to accuse, convict, and punish a man for a crime that ultimately went uncommitted? Spielberg, through the prism of Dick's story, manages to mesh a brilliant philosophical undertone with a big-budget special effects extravaganza, the film is a rare movie going experience that manages to be both very smart and a lot of fun at the same time.Indeed, Minority Report's invigoratingly deep and incredibly well-integrated thematic structure only helps in making the picture a complete experience that delivers everything the modern movie going audience could hope for in a film such as this. The tale of the hunter becoming the hunted and suddenly forced to more personally understand what it is he's done to others and experience firsthand how the system he heretofore so enthusiastically embraced can fail when forced to look at it while on the other side of the law lends yet another added layer of tension and purpose to the film, further accentuating the questions raised throughout the story. Featuring a quality cast, Minority Report still isn't a movie that's sold by its stars. Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, and Max von Sydow don't disappear into their roles, but they do embrace them wholeheartedly and all deliver convincing performances that, again, only accentuate both the heavier themes and exciting action pieces that define the movie. Cruise is Cruise, his character not all that different than other roles he's played (his John Anderton seems at least partially reminiscent of Ethan Hunt), but the actor manages to capture the feel of the movie superbly and convey enough raw emotion in conjunction with his abilities as an Action star to play the part very well in each of its several layers of complexity. Just as importantly, the picture's special effects are not only seamless, they're cool; and in conjunction with the wonderfully-choreographed action pieces and Composer John Williams' (Star Wars) heart-racing score, Minority Report proves a wonderful movie when examined from every angle.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

an okay film,"I like the idea and the story is alright. But it does contain the usual Spielberg cheese. I dont like bad attempts at humour in an otherwise seirous story/movie and you got heaps of it in this movie.On the other hand you have a lot of cool scenes in the flick like the one with Peter Stormare (he delivers as as usual) as a nasty underground doctor. For Cruise this is a standard movie (the acting for sure isnt like what we saw in Magnolia) and he slides through it with ease along with Max von Sydow.All in all .. the story, acting, effects are okay. The cheese levels are okay, as in acceptable for a Spielberg movie in my humble opinion.An okay film, go see it.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
What a waste of time........and money,"Save yourself some money and what is worst to waste, TIME!! A film with a poor and predictable plot, decently acted with many ridiculous and ludricrous scenes ( example, Anderton chasing his eye balls!) It's about time Spielberg realizes he's not Stanley Kubrick and he'll never be Kubrick before he decides to direct another unwatchable film like Minority Report and A.I! He's good for high budget films like Jurassic Park or any other movie that he can make fifty sequels and sell millions in action figures and dull toys from them.

Another hot shot regrettably,"A view to a future, which may come true or not. A contribution to, say P.K.Dick's legacy, but not for real perhaps. Some say Steven Spielberg is a never grown up kid for the Hollywood entertainment factory. This film may promote their point. If one tries to convert a story of human life, its restlessness, unknown future, void ending against the ultimate eternal questions, Spielberg has failed so far for sure. His 'Report' is easy in the reading and unavoidably summed up in the 'happy ending'. I find it the very opposite thing to Dick's prose. He underlined our seclusion in our ultimate experiences, our specific and unique comprehension of the external input, the meaning of 'external', the unease, when balancing the choice between the real and elusive, and the rejecting of unnatural. It's a 'game' between our beliefs in God and the agnostics. Spielberg's made it easy to please the executives and audience. I do like the movie but it's far away from the Dick's prose and his message for us.",,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Neo-Noir at its Best!,"I have found that sci-fi films don't work anymore. If we try to think of truely GOOD sci-fi films the list is pretty short... most of them contain the names James Cameron or Steven Spielberg. While this seems to be the case (especially in the last couple of years) Steven Spielberg has done the impossible and created an amazing piece of filmmaking by fusing an interesting future world with the best ideas of Film Noir.Without going into detail about the film it's all classic ""who-done-it"" and when, where and why. Tom Cruise clocks in an amazing performance (which means allot coming from me because I usually stray far & away from Tom Cruise films) which is depressed and twitchy. Spielbergs directing is at a new level and, while he hasn't mastered this level yet, he is obviously not far from it. The only real failing of the film is its ending which takes a bit too long to wind up everything into a nice and tight little ball. Even though the story does fit together well it still lacks a climax which can overcome the first heart pounding hour of the film. Still though, it's the best I've seen in a long time and can't wait to see what Spielberg will turn out next. I know a musical may be in his future and that makes me happy because I love to see directors pan themselves out and do different things.4 and a half our of 5 stars",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

"a disappointment - disjointed, incoherent and silly","I had high hopes for this movie, but left the theatre feeling pretty disappointed. A messy, disjointed script with undistinguished dialogue and a plethora of lazy high-gloss S.F. cliches made for a backside numbing couple of hours.I *should* love this movie - it was certainly trying to push my buttons as a lover of Blade Runner/Clockwork Orange Brazil/Mission Impossible etc etc, but it just wasn't happening. For me the ""futurism"" was too unimaginitive for one thing. Desktop computers in the year 2054?! Cars, roads, video projectors, advertising; it all seemed too drearily familiar.And the whole shebang about the pre-cogs floating in a vat of fluid comes straight out of the ""how to make a glossy SF film"" book. The one already well-read and better understood by the Matrix guys. Having a whole crime-fighting force based on the powers of essentially one woman (who is described as ""sub-human"" at one point, and then, half an hour later is walking, talking and making eyes at Tom) seems just too arbitrary and precarious a hook to hang a whole movie on. Suspended disbelief comes crashing down around our shoulders. This is not how the world works - not now, and not in 2054. It smacks of script writers' desperation, as do so many of the movie's twists and turns. It would have been smarter, perhaps, to have the precogs as a whole police department, smart-suited workers, not a trio of bleached newts.It was, sadly, a waste of a great high-concept pitch, mired in a muddy, silly script and some very uncertain direction. This is the Spielberg who made the dire Lost World, not the Spielberg of Close Encounters or Schindlers List. The theatre, I'm sad to say, rang out with derisory laughter at quite a few points.

Interesting take on the future,"While still feeling the heat from the so-so effort of A.I., Steven Spielberg redeemed himself wit ha more constructed effort and one that was more suitable for hard-core sci-fi fans. Once again, he tackled an interesting story, one that could change the complexion of society as a whole. Only this time, he did it right, making this more of a thriller as opposed to a movie about family values. While all the action sequences could be placed in one trailer, it was still a fairly interesting story with great little insights about the technology of this future world. The only downside, proved to be Tom Cruise. Once again, his average acting style came out in full force, running through a movie with little emotion and guidance. And to make things worse, this seemed like one big commercial for companies like Ben and Jerry's, Lexus, Guinness, Pepsi, etc. I kid you not. Well, with the nit-picking aside, this was an excellent film for sci-fi fans. 7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"So many plot holes, so little time.","MINORITY REPORT is an achievement of directorial brilliance.  Speilberg's vision gives this movie a special quality that makes it very enjoyable to watch.  Like many science fiction films, the environment is its own character (when done right the environment in films are supporting characters, when done wrong they are the main character).  The first two acts of the film move along marvelously, with suspense, intelligence, and energy. Unfortunately the third act is an incoherent mess, filled with cliches and illogical pretenses.  I wouldn't want to give away all the third act plot twists, but I'm not sure I could type them all in a way that would make sense...not that they made any sense in the movie.  The very nature of this movie invites paradox and contradictions, since it is about people who can see the future and all.  Unlike a film like MEMENTO, however, the inconsistencies in the plot cannot be rationalized.  The best description of this movie is MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (the movie) meets TIMECOP.

2054- You can get your eyeballs taken out for $1000,"No, I wouldn't consider myself a big fan of Tom Cruise.

"It looked cool, but fell short","I am a huge Spielberg fan, and I have liked most of his films, including this one. But, I just can't understand how someone can butcher a story like this film did. Everything that made Dick's story different and exciting were cut out, replaced by special effects. My first gripe is Tom Cruise as the lead. He does not look like a middle aged, overweight balding man to me. And I know that the whole side plot of his kid and the kidnapping were supposed to add to the ""complexity"" of the plot, but was it really necessary? For the film, yes; without the side plot a lot of the action wouldn't make sense. But in the story, Dick didn't have to rely on cliched drama to create suspense and excitement. He created a world where the hero is flawed and happy endings don't and really can't exist. Dick's fantasy world is not far from reality. Spielberg, on the other hand, creates a visually believable futuristic world, but the story is unrealistic which adds an artificiality to the film as a whole. I think the film is visually stimulating and quite entertaining (with the added bonus of the very attractive Colin Farrell), but I think that the story is bogus.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
sorry to report that it fell short,"Even the greatest of filmmakers fail to cover all the angles.  Minority Report was filled with imperfections in many areas that left a conscious audience with the feeling that some of the departments rushed through their work.  John Williams' score was one of the most disappointing features. It was if he composed the score without knowing what the movie was about. Spielberg, usually a great storyteller seemed concerned with the film aspect, but did not properly tell his story (which was in many ways no more than the work of another writer who lacked hope in humanity).  Tom Cruise's acting was fine, it fulfilled it's purpose, well casted, well acted.

Max von Sydow is excellent and the soft, bleak cinematography is noteworthy, but that's about it.  Spielberg is starting to bore me with these predictable endings and the apparent attempts among intellectuals to make the film somewhat more `meaningful' in the wake of America's Homeland Security fetish come up lame with me.Setting that aside, the material in the film - based, of course, on the Philip K. Dick short story - makes a direct philosophical statement: What happens in your life is all predetermined unless you somehow can foresee the future in which case - unlike others - you can make a choice. This premise has (had) a great deal of potential, but it never quite comes together. Those comparing this film with the likes of The Matrix or Blade Runner are naive.

7 out of 10,"As with several of Steven Spielberg's more recent films, I find myself frustrated by Minority Report. There are many brilliant ideas, images and sequences within the first two hours, but much of that is thrown away by having the climax dissolve into thriller ending Type B.Plot-wise Minority Report could be best described as a paranoid science fiction cross between The Fugitive and Mission Impossible. Set in the Washington of 2054, murders have been eradicated by the experimental Precrime division. Detective John Anderton (an excellent Tom Cruise) heads this taskforce, catching would-be murderers from evidence provided by the Precogs - they see the crimes before they happen. The system is perfect. But what happens when Anderton is charged with murdering someone he doesn't even know, in 36 hours time? As the poster tag-lines say: everybody runs. Hunted by the ambitious Ed Witwer (Colin Farrell), Anderton can only rely on his mentor (Max Von Sydow) for help, as he desperately tries to prove that the infallible Precrime system can be wrong.Until the present catches up with the future, the film is extremely engaging. Spielberg once again proves that he is the master of both set-up and set pieces. He creates a believably neurotic future where technology has advanced in a natural way. Anderton's plight is convincingly constructed, whilst his flight is almost unbearably tense. The ""jetpack"", ""eye"" and ""spider"" sequences are excellent examples of this and, in terms of suspense, are comparable with anything on offer at the moment.Unfortunately, after the pivotal scene where Anderton meets his predicted victim, the film falls apart. In place of startling originality we have a stultifyingly predictable ending that has been lifted directly from other films. The villain's unveiling is almost identical to that of LA Confidential's, and two climactic scenes are disturbingly similar to those of The Fugitive and Mission Impossible. Whilst it's sad that most of the few scenes that don't involve special effects are the film's weakest, this revelation might not be entirely surprising. Essentially Minority Report is the kind of chase movie that we've seen over and over again. Indeed, if it weren't for the climax, this wouldn't be a criticism - most stories are evolutions of all that's gone before. With the starkly blue look, draining colour from the screen, and an effective new spin on an old story, the disguise almost works.Do not doubt that Minority Report is very enjoyable. As a suspense thriller, it may well be the best of the year. But as dark science fiction, in the vein of Blade Runner, it misses the mark.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Decent but not Top Notch,"Pre-cogs?  Computer interactive light tipped gloves?  Two legged spiders? The writing is wanting in this film.  We are constantly asking why.....Why does Cruise's character live apart from his love......Why does the security for the pre-crime unit still allow Cruise admittance to high security areas? Why did they devote a great deal of time in the beginning to the sprinkler on the lawn, yet Cruise needs to delay for effect by asking about a door being ajar? The story needed the twist of the crime for the Von Sydow's character, but why was murder the only option? Why is the female pre-cog able to visualize and relate to Cruise  in real time all the potentials during a mall jaunt, but needs hi-tech brain wave contacts to get information she's been echoing all movie? Did anyone think that Cruise was going to shoot the guy? I am a sci-fi fan and am able to suspend disbelief for excellent movies like Blade Runner or Forbidden Planet, but I'm sorry, this misses the mark.

Pretty Fun And Interesting But Far From Perfect,"Minority Report is a film that will keep you interested and is enjoyable, but I can't help but notice some things that aren't quite right with it. It's plot is complicated enough for it to hold some plot holes which can be glaring at times. It's visual style sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. And honestly, it feels kinda dated watching it in 2014.The plot of this movie is intriguing, but I find that perhaps it was more sci-fi in 2002 then it is now. Certain aspects and technology we can kind of see today, so it does take away from the experience. It also seems pretty open to plot holes, as if certain aspects weren't quite thought through. Also, the tone is kind of all over the place. It is a serious film most of the time, but it has a LOT of comedic moments that honestly just feel out of place. Scenes such as the weird eye doctor mesh a little better, but the comedy in the jet pack cops chase just feels like some kind of Buster Keaton skit in the middle of a drama. It's really odd and just didn't work most of the time.The visual style of the film is kind of all over the place too. Sometimes it feels way too blue, as if it was color corrected wrong, where other times it's just the right amount of futuristic blue tinting. There's also a lot of bright lighting that causes a bloom effect and it just sometimes felt over done and as if the image was blown out.Honestly, I'm kinda conflicted with this film.

However, it suffers (like AI before it) from a forced injection of sentimentality and slush at the end, a very guessable plot (and this from someone who usually fails to guess; the old chap was just so obviously up to no good), and -- most importantly -- excessive media hype, which led the viewer to expect another BLADE RUNNER.After coming out of the cinema I gave it a 6/10 (good; above average) because of the latter; now some reflection and a viewing without preconceptions pushes me more towards 7/10 (very good; excellent, but not an all-time classic).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"An Uneven, Though Creative Film.","In MINORITY REPORT, the ""PreCrime"" division of crime prevention has come to pass. Through a group of ""floating"" clairvoyants, a murder can be seen before it happens. John Anderton (Tom Cruise), the top dog over at PreCrime, has found himself in the center of one of these ""visions"". He now has thirty-six hours not to commit the crime he is being hunted for; this he does, and at the same time, trying to figure out who framed him and solve another murder. All the while unsure whether this predetermined fate can be altered or not. Sound confusing? It's not really and the film-makers handle the material well.However, the one thing this movie is is uneven. Spielberg here tries to capture the same tone he did in the INDIANA JONES films, but does not quite manage it. What we end up with is over-the-top humorous moments: the chase in the factory (which is essentially a high-tech update of Charlie Chaplin going through the gears of that large machine); the whole sequence with the ""eye doctor"" (Peter Stormare) is all one-liners and physical comedy. Juxtaposed against these scenes are ones of uninspired drama: the rest of the movie. Spielberg fails to find that fine-line that he has walked in so many past projects (though I'm not sure what he was trying to do in his other recent sci-fi film, A.I.). This is not helped along by John William's score (film music fans will accuse me of blasphemy here), which is oppressive and terse.All that said, MINORITY REPORT is still a very entertaining, well made film.The story of MINORITY REPORT is based on a short work by Philp K. Dick. Dick has sown fertile ground in Hollywood (TOTAL RECALL, BLADE RUNNER), and some not so fertile (SCREAMERS, IMPOSTER). He is a writer of great wit, humor and vision. Dick has published dozens of books and volumes of short stories, which will make him attractive to sci-fi film-makers for years to come. I think Spielberg has come closer to capturing the tongue-in-cheek feel of Dick's work than any other film adaptation. It still remains to be seen if someone can make an epic and silly science fiction masterpiece in his name. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

An artistic vision of theoretical premise,"Hardly the seminal work of either Cruise's or Spielberg's careers, Minority Report underscores the areas it does well. In many ways Spielberg's career has latched onto the vision of the late Mr. Kubrick, and the directing in this film stands out not only because of its futuristic vision, but also its method of making what the audience knows will happen suspenseful. The underlying question behind the movie rests with whether or not humans have control over events the pre-cogs say will happen. This test of free will allows the audience to question the advantages and dangers of a more advanced, yet controlled society. Personally, I wish that the movie had done a better job of explaining the system. The movie gives a laughable explanation as to how the system works (heroin somehow leads to seeing into the future apparently.). While I expected something of an action flick, I found myself enveloped in an enigma of legal principles and theoretical situations not coming from the movie, but from my own pondering inspired by the movie. There are few plot holes in the movie, none of them serious enough to complain about (with the exception of the previously mentioned, fallible system. Cruise delivers one liners with his classic wit, and seemingly captures the essence of the feature, futuristic system in one line about a rolling ball. At the same time, I find Cruise's roles to be boringly similar: he is cocky, and then suffers (to some degree through something he helped to create). This seems to be a role molded to fit Cruise's patented acting style, and he comes off as perhaps a slightly better actor than he really is. There are no real other outstanding performances in the film with the possible exceptions of Kathryn Morris and Max von Sydow. The movie allows for some comic relief (even though I never thought I would laugh at a man chasing his eyeballs), and goes overboard with the ad placement. (In fact the movie actually contains ads in it!) Gratefully the movie gives us Spielberg's view on the role of the state in people's lives, but at the same time allows the audience to question this stance. Do the rights of a few override the rights of the masses? Even as such, the ending could have improved, perhaps with a bit (more?) of a voice-over. I would give it an 8/10 because of the artistic vision, and thought provoking film making behind it, but the movie is certainly not one the audience claps for at the end.

The cities of 2054 are a superb contrast of the plush hi-tech corporate areas and dismal decrepid slums.  This movie runs with pace and emotion and is hard to fault.Perhaps the finest moment is the chase of Jon and Agatha through the shopping mall where Agatha's gift is displayed with precision and humour.Altogether a great interpretation of the works of one of the finest sci-fi writers.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Should have been 30 mins shorter,"I read a lot about how this was Spielberg/Cruise growing up. Well, by my reckoning he's still got some way to go.Spielberg can't help loving the movie magic - with the somewhat childish vision of the future (jetpacks, cars driving up buildings). Although some of it is inspired (vomit sticks, personalised ads etc.)Cruise, for his part still can't help playing the archetypal action hero - all smiles, graceful moves and muscles. So he might look ugly and vulnerable for a while, but he'll be all smiles again...The most glaring problem is that if the film had ended at the ""first"" revelation, about 90 mins in, it would have been a perfect solid ending. Very Philip K. Dick, very dark, very cynical. Instead, they had to tack on more and more endings before they could get to the ""happy"" ending.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Spielberg and Tom Cruise best movie,"I'm not really a fan of Spielberg or Tom Cruise but is the first time that I'm totally sure that they deserved a 10 for the movie. This is not a typical Spielberg movie who in the past years decided to work with dinousaurs and the hollocast (I haven't seen yet AI). This movie from the same mind of totally recall and blade runner is the best picture I've seen in years. The plot is interesting, and the script is excellent, but the main attraction is the work of the director of Photography Janus Kaminsky, who recreate a very futuristic but realistic world, with lot of numbers and a grey and blue tone. The cast work well. This is a role from Tom Cruise who give his best performance. Cruise isn't a great actor, but in the few past year he grew a lot as an actor (compare his peromance in MI1 and MI2, and makes his performance credible and John Anderson the drogadictic police chief, who is involve in a future crime. However his co-star Colin Farrell, isn't good enough as the Javert of the 21 century Danny Witwear.  He start well but later he collaps. Much more better are Max von Sydow and Samantha Morton. Both gave the best performance of the movie. Von Sydow is one of the best actors of all the time, and he did not dissapointed here. He makes his ambiguos chararcter natural and credible, and finally Mrs Morton, is a beautiful lady that look horrible as the tiny co gorb Agatha (except the last scene), but gave a great performance, specially at the end where she steal the show as the mysterious woman that had the minority report. She will be the next Redgrave and Glenda Jackson (the three in one). The rest of the cast, from the police, to the doctors and scientific and unkown actress that portrays Cruise wife are excellent. Finally congratulation to Mr Spielberg that gave us an imaginative story with lot of suspense and confirm him as the best North American director alive. Steaven reafirms here as a storyteller.

"Good, but suffering from Spielberg-itis.","Minority Report is a film that takes an exceptional premise (in this case from an exceptional story by Philip K. Dick) and translates it exceptionally well to the screen. For the first 3 quarters of the movie. Unfortunately, the film falls victim to an overlong, somewhat mushy and cliched (what my brother would call a ""Murder She Wrote"") ending that almost, but not quite cheapens the overall product (unlike the unfortunate ""A.I"" which was ruined by it's Spielbergian ending). 7/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Almost perfect.,"To say that this movie is perfect wouldn't be a total lie, however, it does have its flaws. I mean every movie does, some of its the actors and some of it is the way the film is made. In this case it was neither, the flaw is simply the story, the whole basis for the film. To me, its the film that will suffer in the long run.The whole aspect, the futuristic authority, catching someone before they even commit a crime. Unbelievable. Spielberg does some amazing things, that I won't deny, some of the stuff that goes on in the movie is just simply amazing, but not perfect.Tom Cruise is a Detective for Pre-Crime (go figure..), he lost his son back in the past to a kidnapper...thus is why he goes to work there anyway. Von Exel is Burgess, like his mentor, his guiding light, the person who continues to tell him everything is okay, Also is the director of this Pre-Crime.So Cruise's character John Anderton is set up for murder so he believes...but then be begins to believe otherwise..Colin Farrel (aka Bullseye, Yeah!) is a investigator sent to the Pre-Crime Unit to seek out flaws and he finds one. Now I won't go on to ruin the movie, but it was a really good movie, I rated it a 9, and I consider it probably one of the best movies of the Summer.However I haven't seen XXX yet, and MIB is Coming in July...so who knows.

Highly recommended for Blade Runner and Murder-Mystery fans...,"I definitely recommend this Spielberg film, especially if you like Blade Runner, murder-mysteries, and other thinking movies.  ""Minority Report"" has so many quality ingredients, it should give most viewers good value for their dollar.NOTE: this film does not have a warm cathartic feeling at the end, nor does it have many laughs.  Instead, Minority Report has a disturbing and accumulating tension and ""A.I.-like"" flavor to it, and it doesn't even release you from that feeling at the climax. (READ: don't take a first date to this film).HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS MOVIE:  it is based on a Philip K. Dick story, just like Blade Runner, and it conveys a very similar-tasting gritty ambience; the technology in the movie is compelling; the surprisingly-few action scenes in the movie are well-choreographed; Tom Cruise does a very textured and noteworthy job as an embittered cop with emotional baggage; the cars in this movie are wonderful to watch; soundtrack is anxious and emotional; the narrative and quick dialogue are definitely appealing to thinking viewers.LOW POINTS OF THIS MOVIE: there was no humor to release the tension; the first 15 minutes are bound to confuse many people; there could have been a few more gunfights for us testosterone viewers; the medical scenes with eyeball replacement will nauseate some viewers; the end leaves you with mixed emotions and disturbed visions of the future.OVERALL:  I thoroughly enjoyed Minority Report.  If you like ""Blade Runner"" and other future-speculative fiction, or if you just like a good murder-mystery, then I recommend this as a full-price movie.Four and a half stars out of Five.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Don't expect BladeRunner,"I was a little disappointed at Minority Report. It had been described as the best SciFi movie since BladeRunner -- but it certainly isn't. In fact, it's actually no more than an above average movie. Bad points - it's unoriginal (you'll find yourself identifying bits from other movies), it's silly in parts (lots of plot holes), it's too long (2½ hours). Good points - it keeps your attention (most of the time), some futuristic ideas are interesting, and... well that's it actually. Tom Cruise is great when he plays ""himself"" (a woman-hating egomaniac in Magnolia; a rich brat is Vanilla Sky; Action Man in Mission Impossible) but he's hopeless ""out of character"".This movie - like AI - is way better than the standard movie fare (especially a summer release) but - like AI - it will be quickly forgotten. Spielberg continues to turn interesting ideas into ordinary movies. Now if Ridley Scott had directed this movie... 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

The story was complicated but not that hard to understand and the staff was absolutely amazing.From Tom Cruse to Colin Farrell they all done there job.

One of the best sci-fi films in years,"""Minority Report"" is a fascinating futuristic vision that depicts a society that actually seems like it could become the future. Rarely do you encounter such a feat in film.The movie is absolutely teeming with cool ideas and imagination. There is not special effect that is not in service of the story, and all are blended seamlessly by ILM. The movie has many brilliant moments: the retina-scanning spiders doing their thing, Cruise leaping across the vertical highway, and generally the set design throughout the entire movie.There are a few emotional aspects that left me cold, and some inconsistencies in the whodunit plot, but people shouldn't dwell on these elements. Contrary to a previous poster, who rather offensively stated that people with a brain should immediately hate the movie because of its (rather marginal) flaws, I'd say ""Minority Report"" is a very challenging and fascinating picture. I read a critic who stated that this film is ""not for stupid people"", and I'd be inclined to agree.In short, despite being overlong and the other aforementioned problems, ""Minority Report"" is the most dazzling, smart sci-fi flick in ages and Spielberg's best slice of pure entertainment since ""Jurassic Park"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Tomorrow Never Knows,"In the year 2054, Washington D.C. is murder free zone. This is because a futuristic ""Precrime"" program has obtained three precognitive humans (called ""pre-cogs"") who have a talent for predicting murder. The three individuals perpetually dream about future crimes, in a secured area nicknamed ""The Temple""; there, they float in a tank of water. The US government falsely claims the three live a luxurious lifestyle - working out in a weight room, for example - but, the pre-cogs are, essentially, imprisoned for the good of society. According to Precrime, the pre-cogs ""see the future"" and are ""never wrong"". The Washington program has prevented all murders for the past six years, and is about to be implemented nationally.As the film opens, top Precrime gun Tom Cruise (as John Anderton) goes through some visual evidence downloaded from the pre-cogs' minds, and arrests an individual for the ""future murder"" of his wife and lover. Mr. Cruise has a back-story. Years earlier, Cruise's young son was abducted, indirectly destroying his marriage. Cruise also takes illegal drugs, which does not effect his work or appearance adversely.Distinguished Director of Precrime Max von Sydow (as Lamar Burgess) is wary of arriving agent Colin Farrell (as Danny Witwer). He should be, Mr. Farrell is there to investigate the Precrime program. Farrell fears the system may be flawed. Due to a startling encounter with pre-cog Samantha Morton (as Agatha), Cruise also becomes suspicious. Then, the pre-cogs identify an unexpected murderer, right in the heart of Precrime!Orwellian ""thought police"" (aka thinkpol) are never a good utopian sign. There are plenty of plot holes and/or contrivances in ""Minority Report"". For example, how is it that these geniuses can't anticipate or detect an eye transplant? And, a certain pregnant woman made me laugh out LOUD.

30 minutes in excess,"The PKD short story and the film kept only the concept and name in common. There is few in the film from the ""book"", but this is not my regret. Steven Spielberg did it again.

It's neither bad nor good.,"Rating this a 7 feels too high, rating it a 6 too low.I saw this movie when it came out in theaters and I remember thinking to myself that it didn't feel like a Spielberg movie. Now I've just watched it again and I have the same feeling. Then I realized something, in 2001 Spielberg made A. I., in 2002 it was Minority Report and Catch me if you can. So when exactly did he do the preproduction for Minority Report? If you compare that for example with James Cameron who basically needs a decade per movie, then it becomes clear that Spielberg probably relies a bit too heavily on his production team. He's obviously a competent movie maker, I don't think anyone is going to deny that, but Minority Report feels as if he thought to himself ""Let's shoot this thing and get it over with.""

An important film,"Spielberg has been on a great film run -- creating two highly experimental yet so amazingly intelligent films in two years (""A.I"" and this such film).

"Seems like the perfect movie, excluding its complete adsurdity sometimes.","Spielberg is one of my favorite directors and there has never been a motion picture that he directed of which I can say something not quite good. Minority Report is no different. It's pretty different from the movies we see today and it's quite close in some ways to Spielberg last film A.I. - Artificial Intelligence. The only thing that keeps coming to me is the moment where John Anderton came back to the police station to get the girl-precog. He used his original eyes to get in. Okay, tell me, how is such negligence possible? The whole police are looking for him, nonetheless, they didn't even deny his very access to their station.

Black and Dark Future,"Technology does not necessarily means progress. Or progress may not be perceived as progress by everybody. This seems to be the message of some of the later films by Spielberg.

In other words, the SciFi Channel may be as instructive as the History Channel!Is 'Minority Report' a good movie? I think the answer is yes, but it is not a great one. I think Spielberg is probably the greatest director alive, but I did not like AI. 'Minority Report' is better, it deals with big universal subjects - the right to privacy, and the fact one is innocent before it's proved he is guilty. The fluency of action is back, but so is the mixed choice of actors. I personally do not like Tom Cruise, but Max von Sydow was fascinating! Some of the futuristic gags are nice, but we have seen too many 21st century dark cities already to be really impressed.I think that what happened with other films of Spielberg will happen with this one also.

A plot with Sci Fi!,"I go to a movie to be entertained and, most times, I admit it, to escape period. And I love good special-effects Sci Fi movies for that very reason. So I do not get all bent out of shape like some when when an episode of Star Wars or Men in Black doesn't produce a script that causes my mind to yearn for Hitchcock, Orsen Wells, etal. Minority Report, set in the mid-23rd century, moving along at a rapid pace had some very good Computer Generated Imagery yet different than a lot of CGI. The effects were were almost ""natural"" or should I say well integrated into the movie or better yet, incidental to the story-line. I can credit that on a plot that centered my attention on Tom Cruise's character and one mind-blowing assumption about crime prevention gone wrong to his detriment. I give some credit to Cruise not over acting yet maintaining the tension and helping me care for the character. The Oscar however goes to Mr.Spielberg's direction who had the action moving at such a nice clip that the CGI was just part of the story not something that caused me to stop and think, ""how did they do that?"" The bottom line for me was I got Sci Fi with a plot. I did not give it a 10 but I did give it a 9.

Best movie I've seen in awhile,"When I saw the trailer for ""Minority Report"" and later heard the plot, I instantly figured out how the movie was going to end. Or at least I thought I did. The movie actually went in directions I never could have imagined. There were times when I would predict something ten minutes before it happened, but when it did happen, there was a twist to it that made it much different than what I expected, and took the movie in a totally different direction. What I was most impressed with was Speildberg's vision of the future. It was a clever and seamless joining of modern life, with incredible futuristic visions of a world we can't imagine today. It was nice to see a vison of the future that didn't take place in the post-apocalyptic aftermath of a nuclear holocost, or in a world where machines or a totalitarian govornment has taken power. Tom Cruise was great as a pre-crime officer framed for murder, while Spieldberg's direction only makes the film greater. I loved the contrast between the futuristic surealism of the pre-crime headquarters, and the seemingly present day suburbian style setting we see in the film's opening seen. When you combine the twisting and turning plot with the action-packed chases and the incredible settings, you get a summer movie worth seeing.

Another BAD movie from Spielberg who loses no opportunity to trivialize a movie.,"Think Tron and Blade Runner meet Minority Report.  Steven Spielberg creates a Science Fiction film noir a la Blade Runner and Tron.  Unfortunately, as always, Steven Spielberg has to trivialize and Hollywoodize the movie, leaching and bleaching the life, substance, and darkness out of it.  This film is in the style of AI Artificial Intelligence, but better; unfortunately not good enough for me to recommend it.  As always in a Spielberg movie, when he has the chance to add lowbrow humor to a scene, he does.  After a while the cumulative effect of these cheap laughs and snickers (yes, the full movie house snickered to the visual gags), is to destroy the dramatic integrity of the movie.  He should review Blade Runner, Dark City, and PI to see how a futuristic film noir can be made.  As he has demonstrated in AI, and this movie, he does not know how to do it.So much is wrong with this movie: the cinematography is bleached out so it looks like a comic book printed on cheap paper, the music score is derivative (he even used Beethoven!) and detracts from the movie, the acting is one dimensional with comic book style characters, and worst of all he tacks on a glowing pretty Hollywood happy ending at the last couple minutes of the movie.  Sad, hard to believe he is considered one of the great film directors.  I have yet to see a good movie of his, though I must confess I usually miss his movies knowing they tend to be sappy and lacking in substance.

He then also entirely misses the issue of giving up freedom for safety, seeing only the precogs as being the losers rather than all of us.

But in Minority report it is the entire [large] cast, the spectacular production design and cinematography, and the great screenplay from a wonderful Philip K. Dick story that all come together in a perfect cinematic stew.Things to look out for include Max von Sydow's stellar performance (as usual), and all the small touches that show Spielberg at the top of his form. His vision of what a real future will look like 50 years out is probably as close (or closer) to reality than most anything else I've seen or read. If you like SF, or Spielberg or Cruise, you will likely love this movie.There are some passing sexual references, a fair bit of violence, and some *really* gross stuff involving eyeballs, so I would say that kids under 10 or 11 are probably a bit young for this (also the plot may go somewhat over their heads.) But if you like thoughtful action films, you'll definitely love this one. 9 or 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
I can't believe it!!!,"I still can't believe everyone keeps on insisting this is one of 2002's best movies! Give me a break! It is too damn long! I swear I was about to get up and leave the movie theater and it's a lot easier for me paying only $3.75! Really, I don't think the problem was predictability. It was the reiteration of the same damn thing over and over again. If you want to see it, go ahead, but you have been warned!!! I gave it 6/10 stars, and only because of the futuristic look it had which was pretty cool, but the plot sucked!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Cool Movie...,"I really enjoyed this flick. It is a really good story about a technology that isn't really all that farfetched considering the things we can do with cloning.

The Epitome of the Genre,"This movie is what all the other ""one man against the futuristic system that's working against him"" movies wish they had been.  I can think of a bunch: Demolition Man, Total Recall, Gattaca, Logan's Run, Time Cop, etc., etc.  I think this is as good as a movie of this type could possibly be, and I hesitate to even mention it in the same breath as the others, lest people that hated one or more of them give this one a miss.This is a character driven piece that has elements of Drama, Sci- Fi, Action, Whodunit and Locked Door Murder.  The vision of the future is first-rate, Art Direction beautiful, the Camera work is masterful.  Clearly Spielberg at his best. As other comments have said, there *are* plot holes (which I won't discuss)- I thought of 2 of them during the movie, half a dozen more later, but I think all of them can be chalked up to sloppy procedures by the pre-crime police, and I'd argue that any homicide department that hadn't dealt with a successful murderer in 6 years would get sloppy, so it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie.If there's any chance you might ever like a movie in this genre, go see Minority Report - I'd bet it's the one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
An impressive whodunit with a twist!,"I wasn't sure what to make of this film when it was first released, but finally, after the DVD came out, I sat down and watched it. I must say, I was spellbound.The plot revolves around the Washington, D.C. area ""Precrime Initiative."" Three ""precognitives,"" psychics of extraordinary ability, are connected to machines that monitor their neural patterns. This system gives the D.C. police the ability to see murders before they happen, and stop them.Tom Cruise gives an excellent performance. One believes him throughout the film, and he brings it a very human face. Through the course of the film, the viewer also meets some truly unique characters, from Iris Hineman, the co-creator of the Precrime system, who has a very unique exposition role, to Gideon, the slightly macabre sentry of Precrime's containment system.Of course, one could hardly have a movie without a plot, and Minority Report delivers a great one. The movie is a great twist on a murder mystery, and it keeps you breathless until the end. On repeat viewings, too, you'll probably catch even more of the plot, since this is a very pleasantly complex movie.Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the special effects and the action. They are some of the most convincing I've ever seen in a movie. In a sense, though, they're so great that you forget they're there! The camera doesn't pull huge establishing shots to make you say ""wow."" You just do, because it's so seamless, and nobody in the film seems overawed at the technology around them. The action is exciting and intense. There are well-choreographed fights and some other amazing action. The movie is breathtaking.Give Minority Report a spin. I think you'll be as impressed as I was.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
An edge-of-your seat Spielberg extravaganza- SEE IT!!!,"My only regret is that I did not get to see this film in theaters as I wanted to when it was released three years ago... I enjoy Tom Cruise and even more Spielberg films so this was, of course, a must-see for me. Taking place in 2054 Washington D.C., Tom Cruise is a police chief who heads a ""Precrime unit"", a brand-new police unit with futuristic technology that allows them to discover precisely when, where, and by who homicides are going to be committed.This technology is much appreciated as it began to decrease D.C.'s massive homicide rate and eventually left the city without a single murder in six years. Using mind-readers called ""pre-cogs"" (referring to the pre-cognitive), this police unit catches future murderers before they commit their act.... imprisoning them but leaving their victims unharmed. Considered ""flawless"" by the U.S. government, there is an occasional disagreement about a specific crime that is supposed to take place by one of the three mind-reader ""pre-cogs""... This disagreement by the mind-reader is referred to by the government as a ""minority report"" and is deleted, in order to keep up the idea that this new precrime system is flawless and works without doubt. However, this small flaw becomes a very big problem when Tom Cruise (himself the unit's chief) is accused of murder himself... when one of the pre-cogs has a flaw and it is not exactly 100% certain that Cruise does in fact become a murderer but the 2/3 suspicion of him by the pre-cogs is enough to have the entire D.C. police unit crawling through the city for him...This film soon becomes an exciting action-packed chase that involves Cruise constantly running from his fellow police officers as he tries to find out who framed him in a system that is supposed to be perfect for preventing murders. This film was great and I loved it and I think you will too. Please feel free to email me with any questions or comments...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Spielberg is a genius.  What else is new?,"Prepare yourself for something you've NEVER seen before!  Leave it up to Steven Spielberg along with his friend, Tom Cruise, to give you an incredible journey for approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes.

As with The Beatles'album, ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" back in the 60's, which was ground-breaking for the music industry, look at this film the same way.

Bergy's Back on form!!!,"Finally Spielberg returns to form with a thought provoking and gritty drama while doing what he does best, eye popping visual effects.Although it is sad to see CG effects overused once again when practical and miniature effects could be enhanced instead of replaced, the boffins at ILM manage to drop a lot of their ""gee whiz"" factor from the effects shots, allowing the audience to become immersed in an ""almost"" believable future world.Effects aside the story is compelling with some ingenious twists and turns and a more adult theme then Spielberg's recent efforts, this being down to Phillip K Dick's original short story. They also touch briefly on the fundemental paradox that is ""if you prevent the crime before it is committed, has a crime actually taken place?""Tom Cruise as Anderton is actually rather good, the posturing and floppy hair are gone and replaced by a nicely portrayed character that allows you to forgive the travesty of Ethan Hunt in M:I. However it is the supporting cast that really shines, Sydow is once more on form as the director of the precrime department who takes up the father figure role to Anderton, and Colin Farrell is outstanding as the department of justice overseer. Young brit Samantha Morton is not really used to her full potential as the precog Agatha, but no doubt having worked previously with the likes of Woody Allen this will merely be a role that will dump her squarely in the Hollywood limelight.The main drawback with the story is the schmaltzy Hollywood ending, if only the movie could have finished 7 mins sooner I would have had very little plot wise to grumble about, but this being a blockbuster summer movie straight from Hollywood's desk, I really should have been prepared.On the whole a slightly edgier summer blockbuster.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
A surprisingly excellent film!!,"When I first heard about this film, it did not particularly appeal to me; I am not a huge of either Tom Cruise or the Sci-Fi/Action genre. However, there was something which made me go and see it, and thank god I did!! This is going to remain in my top ten films ever list!! Okay, so there were a few minor glitches in which belief had to be momentarily dispelled i.e the whole Lara getting into the department using John's eyeball thing (but hey, maybe with all of the huge attention of having the Chief of the department imprisoned, the withdrawing of the access was maybe overlooked). It was extremely suspenseful, emotive, had an incredibly well written script, excellent performances and cinematography. I thought that the use of the futuristic technology was extremely well thought out. It was futuristic enough to show that it was 2054, (and I loved the cars and motorways!!) yet familiar enough to be recognisable as this planet and Washington DC in the near future, setting the familiar landmarks of DC against a futuristic backdrop. My only criticism was the touches of humour in it...I know that Spielberg likes to mix a variety of genres into his films, but I felt that this was unneccesary, and made a bit of a mockery of those aspects. It gave those parts of the film a lighthearted feel which undermined the actual plot. But overall, a really really good film and I cannot wait to own it on DVD!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"Outstanding Directorship, Style and Cinematography wrapped around a Clumsy Story","Determinism is the name of the game in 'Minority Report', the central premise intriguing but also exhibiting major flaws.

Samantha Morton is phenomenal and generates sympathy from the audience. Neal McDonough is having a fun time but doesn't have a lot to do. Colin Farrell is the weak point, with average quality acting and almost nothing to his character but plot devices.Almost everything visually is A Tier incredible. The world design is fully engaging, truly mesmerising and completely engrossing.

Eh...not all that good,"Tom Cruise will be known for his cocky, grinning characters in Mission: Impossible, A Few Good Men, and Top Gun--thus excluding him from the list of great character actors.  Steven Spielberg will be best known for his action/dramas such as Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, their venture together, ""MINORITY REPORT"", comes across as nothing particularly new or fresh.  It lacks both the drama of Spielberg's 80s movies and the tension of his war and horror films. Cruise is once again Ethan Hunt evading the bad guys in an story looking like a hodgepodge of Blade Runner, A Clockwork Orange, and the Matrix. The ability to sin is one of mankind's biggest question marks as to whether denying it will cause a lack of the feeling of being human. By removing it as shown in the movie, as we learned in ""Clockwork"", society loses much of its power.  But the plot of the movie becomes so complicated (and complex) that it becomes--more or less--Mission: Impossible with Indiana Jones set in 2054 with an annoying blueish hue to the film.  The story was too long and had enough material in it for two movies--but I guess Spielberg doesn't want to worry about the success of MINORITY REPORT II.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
A top notch 2002 standout,"War epics and comedy capers are nice, but this is what Mr. Spielberg does best. Minority Report is the kind of adrenaline rush non stop entertainment that recalls the days of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws. It's no wonder that most critics had this on their 10 best lists last year. Tom Cruise gives his best performance since Jerry Maguire and proves he still has some action left in him. He really holds the picture together among the frantic action sequences and surprising plot twists.

Very Underrated Science-Fiction Movie,"In this great film, the duo of Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg is incredible.

The movie is strong in many different aspects such as writing, acting, and director-work. I'm shocked the IMDb rating is a mere 7.6. It should be at least an 8 in comparison to many other science fiction movies. The plot was very dramatic and suspenseful. There were points later in the movie that I had no idea how the plot would be resolved.

In fact, we've all seen this plot before. Lots of times! I did enjoy Samantha Morton as Agatha. She's a wonderful actress.

Everybody Runs...Or walks...in this conceptually interesting thriller,"Minority Report is classic big-budgeted Steven Spielberg. In the hands of a more subtle but equally competent director, I think the film would have benefited from being a far superior movie. That's not to say Steven is not one of the best directors around, he is, but he is excellent at a certain type of filmmaking that I don't believe is particularly refined. In a science fiction thriller such as this, a sleek, lean, and mean direction is needed. The characters need to be more elaborated upon. Spielberg attempts to thrown in together special effects, plot twists, questions about morality, action, and Tom Cruise all in one basket. Not good. Steven Spielberg in my opinion is not a great mainstream action director, with a few exceptions (including the unforgettable Private Ryan). Every violent scene in Minority Report felt a bit too staged, the punches a bit too bland. John Anderton (Cruise)'s backstory, while conceptually devastating, enacted on the screen is a bit overly sentimental. It felt like a huge divergent too from the bigger meat of the yarn - the pre cogs and Anderton's alternate future. What is a nice twist is the ambiguity about the film's happy ending, and whether or not it is a dream. Some would interpret it to be so, others not. Inception seems to have heavily borrowed ideas from Minority Report, in addition to The Matrix (as the story was written long before The Matrix). It's definitely influential, and being Spielberg is definitely something to see, but Spielberg's bombastic approach to all of his films I think has undermined the film's full potential to be a haunting and subtle film that stays with you. Alas Minority Report, while full of cool ideas, images, and effects, is easily forgettable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

"Not just a movie, but a yardstick!","God bless Spielburg and crew for this movie. Having seen it during its summer premiere, I now am the proud owner of this soon to be classic piece of scifi cinema.There was so much in this movie that impressed me, the cinematography, the effects, the acting and the overall sense of the story. Not to be outdone, the spirit of PKD's classic story of sacrifice for the betterment of society gone wrong resonates with a vibrant life as prescient now as it was when he first wrote the short story.The entire technological structure of 2054 is well thought out, and though visually striking, is not as garish and showy as what we see in a typical Star Wars or Star Trek film. You can sense that technology as being a outgrowth of the future and not some obscene or frivolus paen to it with the only exception being the personalized and ubiquitous advertising, greeting each and every person that has been retina scanned. Though most of the technological progress of the movie push us easily through the story, this is more of a shove, but not one that would be lost on this viewer, no sir. Spielburg is proving he is as sage as his precog characters by predicting a future in which the last gasp of advertising is this ""blitz"" of information we all will be exposed to....by name no less. A concept that probably left huge drafts wafting over many a viewers heads, their indignant rebukes against the gross commercialism proof of the failure to understand. That is alright, I hear Men In Black 2 is out on DVD now as well.The characters were very perfunctory to merely glance at them, but as the story carries us along we see the dimensionality of Anderton, Burgess, Witwer and the Precogs become richer, more colorful and less static. Anderton, not only determined to ""save"" society by maintaining the Precrime system that will effectivley make murder extinct in all of North America should Witwer, find no proof of the system as being fallible. This sudden rivalry by PreCrime versus Dept. Of Justice sets the stage for the exposure of Precrime's top cop Anderton as being an effective and idealistic leader. A true believer in the system he works for but when at home alone, he is drug addicted, slovenly and in a constant state of mourning for his abducted and presumed dead child Sean, a loss so deep it not only drives his quest to end murder's grip on D.C. but splits him off from a wife he also still cares for. These are not hollow characters, floating in and out of the story like ghosts out of the ether, they interact in an intelligent discourse of, discovery, agony, hope and danger weaving an intricate story that is part crime-drama, part science fiction, another part detective story and a small part a fantasy. The melange becomes not just a clever scifi film but a hybrid yardstick that other scifi films will and should be forced to stand against if they truly believe they are ""serious scifi"". Gone are the pulp trappings of action/scifi and effects driven sentimentality. Spielburg has given us a movie that not only tells the story but sells the story in a fashion that you can almost feel its need to be told.Though there have been many adaptations of PKD stories throughout the years Minority Report is the only one in my opinion that gives us the story like Dick would have if he could have written a screenplay for it. At no time did I feel that they pimped or profaned the original concept or verse of the original story even right down to the ending which in relation to the short story would have been outlandish to force upon the audience but still a departure from the ""perceived"" PKD norm. The Minority Report, proof that scifi isn't all rayguns, spaceships, mythical creatures and vapid dialog.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Man on the Run.,"Steven Spielberg returns to his roots from his suspense of JAWS in his latest film, MINORITY REPORT.  Where his last film, A.I. was more of a film of wonder, MINORITY REPORTY is more of fear.  The best way to describe this film is: ""Spielberg does Hitchcock.""  It proves that when a old dog does tricks, he can do them well, and still impress people. MINORITY REPORT is based on the short story by the late Phillip K. Dick who wrote the novels for other sci-fi classics of BLADE RUNNER and TOTAL RECALL.  In Washington D.C. of the year 2054, the strongest police unit in the force is the ""precrime"" unit.  With the precrime unit, a officer can detect and find out when and where a murder is going to happen before the act is even committed.  Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) feels that the system is perfect and  precrime is what is keep society safe.  John is then confronted by Ed Witwer (Colin Farrell) from the Attorney General's office who believes a theory: ""if they see the person committing a act of murder in the future, how do they know that the murderer didn't change their mind at the last minute?""  John sees this theory as nonsense until he is the next target of arrest for a murder of a man that he doesn't even know.  John who hunted down killers is now the hunted, with his old partner, Officer Fletcher (Neal McDonough) leading the force after John.  John must beat the countdown clock to zero to find out is he going to commit a act of murder and who is the victim? MINORITY REPORT has Spielberg return to the suspense genre with a big bang.  This is one excellent and mind-blowing film that will please everyone in the audience.  Where A.I. was for the thinking man and JURASSIC PARK was for the eye candy, MINORITY REPORT will please the intellects with the suspense filled Hitchcock plot and anti-punishment theme similar to Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  The ones for eye candy will enjoy the action scenes and the spectacular realistic effects of the future. My favorite is the transportation system of the everyday person and their express ways.Another aspect of MINORITY REPORT that I enjoyed a lot was the use of blue and grey coloring.  From the very begining when the Fox and Dreamworks studio logo appear, it gives the viewer the clue on what type of movie this is going to be.  The coloring adds to the mood and tone of the story where this is a dark and mysterious future.  Credit should go to Spielberg and his regular cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who use the same coloring that was in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and much more different than the colorful A.I. and HOOK. I also did enjoy the editing by Michael Kahn and the scoring by the legendary John Williams, who are both Spielberg regulars.  Kahn does a great job by keeping the editing in a rapid pace, yet he gives the audience a chance to see what is going on.  There is never really a dull or worthless scene that is shown in MINORITY REPORT.  And John Williams does his Hitchcock style of music by doing a Bernard Herrman similar score from NORTH BY NORTHWEST.  Which would make sense since both movies are about that same theme, the man on the run. The only thing I would complain about MINORITY REPORT is the character development.  The actors all do a good job in their roles, but there isn't enough substance to understand on who the character's are.  The viewer does get to know who John Anderton is, but that is pretty much the only character on who the film focuses on.  There were some questions left open for me: Why did Witwer feel the system can have mistakes, yet he uses it to try to capture John?  Why is the relationship between Precrime Director Burgess (Max Von Sydow) and John Anderton so strong?       But that is small potatoes comparing with the rest of the film, and believe me the rest of the film succeeds!  I haven't had this much with a film in a while.  The suspense and action gives enough energy to make this two hour plus movie go by very quickly.  I have to give this movie credit, I did not look at my watch once to see what time it was.  I haven't done that with a movie in years. Where you have comic book action with SPIDER-MAN in one corner, the space opera of ATTACK OF THE CLONES in another corner, and the miltary gone wrong action of SUM OF ALL FEARS in the third corner.  I would reccommend that you go to the final corner and view the mystery/action/suspense of MINORITY REPORT.  And who knows, maybe after watching this movie, it might give you a different point of view on murder.  Spielberg returns to the excitement and fun similar to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and JURASSIC PARK with MINORITY REPORT.

A dazzling spectacle about a scary AND safe future,"Oh, my! What a technologically sound and crime free future! Everything in this film is so imaginative. The subject matter is fascinating, nifty, thoughtful and disturbing. Imagine a seemingly controllable but still humanly fallible future. Has anyone wondered 'what if' something bad befalls the precognitive trio that keeps the fabric of this new reality together? They have to die at some point, yes? Then what? Will there not be rioting in the street as people lament over a once secure country now forced to return to its unpredictable and dangerous past? Maybe the strange pool the trio perpetually floats in is the fountain of youth? The Precrime Division certainly doesn't allow them to go on a date. Maybe they can mate with each other and retain some cognitive power for their offspring? I don't know, and I don't think anyone in this film knows either. They are living peacefully on borrowed time at the expense of these all-knowing slaves.Oh, have you seen these neat tiny floppy discs? You can store home movies on them. These captured memories are fuzzy, despite the stellar technology everywhere else, further echoing human imperfection. The memory of loved ones is constantly fading. The sad people who watch these videos of the past are hurting. These trinkets of better times fail to purge agony, as do the countless breathtaking gizmos, ""neuroin"" drug business, and an imaginarium that can give you a tasty session of your deepest dreams, any of them... for a price, of course. By the way, there are also retinal scans everywhere, computer programs at the GAP that greet you at the door and remind you of your last purchase as if these computers know your fashion taste...because they do! There are eyes everywhere. There may be a small amount of privacy in futuristic apartments with lights and appliances that activate upon verbal command, until spider droids crawl into your bathroom while you're on the toilet or into your bed while you're making love to make sure you're not the future criminal that Precrime Division is looking for! Last, but not least-- JET PACKS! This film is geek heaven.The opening sequence is a thrilling spectacle with soldiers a second away from rappelling through your windows and arresting you for a crime you haven't committed yet! No trial, no jury, you get hauled off to a giant storage chamber where you watch cartoons in your head for the rest of your life! The action is awesome, but the intent is controversial, yet it works! Or...does it? Predetermination and choice are putting their boxing gloves on.As a fan of both, it was a pleasure to see Collin Farrell and Tom Cruise on screen together during a classic ""can't catch the wily protagonist"" fight scene. It winds up with Cruise escaping in one of those slick dreamy cars of the future. I'm not sure how he survived being inside during the car's assembly, though. Be careful of that car! It may override your control so it can start driving in reverse for you! Phooey on your intended destination! Naturally, perfection comes at a cost. I won't say what the cost is, but it's dirty, and the way it is executed avoids the cliché we've come to know so well.Minority Report is provocative, sly, dazzling and is served wonderfully by 2 hours and 26 minutes, allowed to breathe and let the viewer enjoy this spectacle. It's everything the Total Recall remake tried to be. The CGI work is impressive for 2002, and amidst all of this sheen, there is mostly a substantive story.I would give it a 9 out of 10.

Excellent movie,"This is easily the best Speilberg science fiction film since ET.  The texture of the movie is seamless and awe-inspiring, the suspense is ever-present and the thrills are genuine.

My report is bound to be in the minority,"I do not know how so many of the film critics got this one wrong!  I would also defer some of my review to another review that appears on this IMDB for this film, specifically the review by Shark-43, who got it right.  This movie is slick as snot with regard to production, effects, and cinematography (you know, the superficial stuff that is really only important if the movie is ultimately honest).  And, yes it does dabble in some of the darker arenas that plague men's souls.  But the slickness of Spielberg's mega-production ability and the star power of Cruise are not enough to win the day when, ultimately, this movie delivers one of the most Disneyland-like contrived, naive, phony, and pretentious endings I have ever encountered in a so-called movie of substance and intelligence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
"It was good, not great.","It was a good summer suspense film.  It left you with something.  However, it was at least 30 minutes too long.  The end was a little too drawn out, and there were almost too many special effects to take in the complex details of this film.  Good directing job by Steven Speilberg, and good performances from all the actors.  It's not every day that you see a movie with an interesting plot...however, it takes forever for you to find out what's *actually* going on.  But it's still a very compelling and original film. I would recommend it and give it a rating of 7 1/2out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Interesting film,"This movie has a smart plot and good performances. Tom Cruise is very good as the Chief John Anderton. The strength of the film is that it put in doubt that people's fate is already written and can't be changed.Even though I liked ""Minority Report"" I still think that it could have been much better in a more entertaining way, I am not saying that this is a boring movie, not at all, I mean that its biggest problem is that it last too much (145 minutes), because of that there are certain parts that are a little boring. I think that 2 hours would have been perfect. Other thing I didn't like was the lack of colors of the shots, they look too dark.The plot is about Chief John Anderton who catches future killers before they murder thanks to 3 people who see the murders in their dreams before they are done , but one day John Anderton see in their dreams that he is one of the killers who will commit a murder. Is it true or is it a set up?, that is what he has to find out with the police after him.I recommend to see it by its special effects and smart plot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Very Good - But Flawed,"First off, the reason why I've given this 7/10 is it's an enjoyable film, this is a Spielberg film, and as expected it has the action and suspense you come to expect, and although very good, it's far from his best work. I found some of the choreography in the fight scenes a bit poor. You shouldn't judge a films sfx by another periods standards, but as such it's aged fairly well, nearly 20 years old it still portrays an imaginable future setting. Cruise plays his part very well, always delivering in the films respective genres of action, thriller and sci-fi.So why not a higher score? Well there is a glaring plot hole, no spoilers, but if you watch the film consider John Anderson's (Cruise) position throughout, how does his circumstance change, and what leads him on the main trajectory of the films storyline ...then ask yourself how can that be possible? It's a counter-paradox, the events simply couldn't have come to pass, and as entertaining as the film is, this one rule upsets the apple cart for me.Would I recommend the film? Yes I would, of course I would, it's a great film, and plot hole aside it has a good storyline that makes you really think about the way such crime prevention would affect the world as we know it.Should the film be remade? Yes, I think it should, with a necessary plot change that makes the film make sense overall. With today's production values, and the almost inexhaustible roster of decent directors around today, I think it would do very very well. Look at the Total Recall remake for instance, it's a very decent film that not only takes nothing away from the original, but also gives the occasional nod to it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

Apparently a minority report,"The look, the feel, the tension and action in the early, exposition part of the movie are great, that is, while we are being given the incident which tells us how ""pre-crime"" works. It's down hill after that, way too long, with a somewhat predictable, almost cliché denouement (the bit of dialogue where the ""truth"" is revealed ... no I'm not going to spoil it.... is really a tired device ... a villain self-incriminating as if on the stand of a Perry Mason courtroom, for those who remember Perry Mason.... and it was already a cliché device by then... Spielberg should be embarrassed if not ashamed). It falls far short as thriller and certainly in no way can it pretend to be a thought provoking piece..... well, it pretends..... there just isn't any there there. Spielberg has had a long splendid career. At the beginning he was pooh-pooed by the critics. Since Schindler's list he's regarded as walking on water. I think he's a splendid director in a checkered sort of way. I don't think ""Minority Report"" will be remembered as one of his better movies. It certainly doesn't measure up to some of the more effective summer thriller/blockbusters like Bourne Identity or Spiderman. I truly was expecting a more intelligent treatment of an intriguing topic, a more exciting thriller, in short, a much better movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Cruise is terrific and the story is very clever,"Tom Cruise gives a sensational performance as a man fleeing from the precrime unit to prove his innocence in ""Minority Report"". He plays John Andertson, a precrime cop who works for the precrime station in Washington D.C. Over the years, humans were able to develop a system in which murder can be seen before it actually happens. Thanks to that system, Washington D.C. is the safest place to live since it has been murder free for quite some time. Tom Cruise is one of the officers for this system, and when he is accused of a murder he has not yet commited, he flees to prove his innocence. A very clever movie, with twists and turns along the way to keep you into it. This is Cruise's best performance ever in my opinion. The special effects are great and the stunts are amazing.

I'm in the reported minority; I think Cruise is great.,"I believe Tom Cruise is the most underrated National Treasure since the Jefferson Memorial.  I just read another imdb review claiming that Tom didn't have to do much acting in this movie as it was more action.  I'm not sure which cut this person saw, because in mine Tom was acting his butt off. You forget how good an actor has to be to not get swallowed up and lost in all that plot and all those special effects.  I was riveted by the performance, and by most of the movie.  I felt let down at the end, to the point where I didn't even bother trying to discuss the troublesome ending with anyone.  I just let it go, dropped onto the pile of all the other movies that died at the end.  Still, this movie kicked so much before then that I would see it again.  Not bad for a movie with no clear ending.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Spielberg does his job,"Despite it's length of two-and-a-half hours the movie is never boring but smashing good and it has all what you would expect from Hollywood. Cracking effects, solid cast and a neat story.   The film is based on a short-story by Philip K. Dick (just as Blade Runner), so we are talking sci-fi but not only that - it also is a breathtaking crime-thriller.John Anderton (Tom Cruise), a junkie cop working at Pre-crime preventing murders from happening, has mysteriously lost his son and divorced his wife (Kathryn Morris). His life is all about work, drugs and memories until the Pre-cogs (capable of predicting the future) anticipate a murder that will change his life.The director Steven Spielberg – the king of sci-fi – used a lot of futuristic gadgets and machines in a really brilliant way. It is realistic because these high-tech gadgets are about to become real before 2054.Janusz Kaminski, his cinematographer for many films, wanted to create a dirty, grainy and a bleak look and he succeeded.But this is not just a special effects and a sci-fi movie. The acting, the characters they are well drawn and all are supremely played by the cast. A striking Tom Cruise and a spectacular Samantha Morton. Agatha is the hardest character to portray in the movie and it is great to watch Samantha Morton acting her.I highly recommend you to watch the movie if you like Spielberg making sci-fi.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
One of the best films of 2002,"This film, without a doubt, is one of the best science fiction films I have seen.  Once again, Steven Spielberg proves he the the best director of films in the world.  This film has everything: action, crime, science fiction, and drama.  Spielberg ties all of those elements and turns it into a great movie.  Plus Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances I have ever seen. I also have to give credit for great acting to the supporting players, especially Colin Farrell.  Hopefully this will be the film that propels him in to superstardom.  Back to the film:  The one thing that makes this film so great are the elements of the environment and the story.  The story is quite original and is something that has never been done before (or if it has, not much of it has been done before).  The film does have its dull moments and rough edges but I usually forgot them throughout.  Also, the film has this texture that not only makes the setting realistic, but frightening.  This film makes the futuristic world creepy and eerie which was true masterpiece.  I am disappointed in the people who did not like this picture and has given it bad rap because it really is a great film.  This is by far one of the best films of 2002.  9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Cruise & Spielberg work magic in very 'matrixi' sci-fi thriller,"Very intelligent sci-fi thriller that follows in the vein of The Matrix and Blade Runner.

Also, rising star Colin Farrell, yet again, displays his talent as FBI agent Danny Witwer, who is brought in to oversee the Unit's work.All in all, Spielberg has crafted a very stylish and modern film that challenges you to reflect on the future.IMDb rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Actually not very many holes,"I don't have much to add to what others have already said as far as praise, but I would like to offer a rebuttal to the reviewers who say it is filled with plot-holes. This isn't a movie for the casual movie fan--one must pay pretty close attention to catch everything. I think they call this style an intellectual thriller? I've watched the movie several times and the more familiar I become with the film, I see fewer and fewer holes if any. I'd say it has more plot-twists than plot-holes. If you search for the holes, you will find them, yes, but I find it to be very believable for the most part. Most ""problems"" with the plot can be attributed to human error. ""They forgot to cut off Anderton's access??"" Yeah, I can believe that. I doubt they honestly expected him to be able to get that close to them anyway. Hey, and if he doesn't get access, well then we don't have much of a movie then, do we? Other ""holes"" I'd rather not delve into here, but with any of them, I'm able to see a counterargument, and thus acknowledge the plot as possible. As with any sci-fi movie, it's best to maintain an open-mind and not try to count things as impossible before really considering them. Top-notch movie with many surprises.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
More Science Fiction Adventure from Spielberg,"Minority Report Science Fiction Action/AdventureSpielberg. What do you think of when you hear that name? Whatever it is, you typically, eventually, think of Hollywood heavyweights. This is that guy that can direct anything he wants. He's on top of the world, and his pedestal is Hollywood. And yet, this is the first time I've ever reviewed one of his films. Guess I've been lingering around the crappy underground horror section too much at my local DVD hauntsLike most everything Spielberg has done since Schindler's List, this is another bleak, mildly depressing and somber film coupled with intense action and amazing visuals. The story revolves around Tom Cruise's character as ""the main guy"" in charge of a division of the Washington DC police department in charge of preventing future ""Pre-Crime"" crimesnamely murders. He got into it, of course, to prevent future horrors like kidnappingwhich is how he lost his son. Pretty quickly, a wild story is woven into the folds of this film as he is framed for the pre-murder of a man he's never met and uncovers disturbing secrets all around. All of this is flung around fantastic imagery and excellent special effects showing us the wild world of America, 2054.Here's the breakdown:The Good:--The real stars of this film are the vast quantities of amazing special effects and imagery. Okay, sure, the special effects are simply computer-graphics for the most part, and overall, they're really quite good. There are moments of somewhat lackluster CGmostly in the animated living plants we see during one scene in the movie, but aside from that, top notch.--Fantastic, intense action, fun to watchespecially with those great visuals.--One of the better ""visions of the future"" we have.--That, I think it's a Lexus, that with which Tom Cruise drives away from car's factory. That's a damn nice car. Lexus actually built it for the movieone wonders why they don't make 'em that cool now--The acting is really well done, and the story is quite nice. It takes full advantage of the futuristic Science Fiction setting.--Excellent Cinematography. Interesting use of blue hues and sheens throughout the entirety of the filmit adds a depressing, almost smothering feel to the film. Often, it's almost like a black and white movie, and very stark.--Good music.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--One wonders what happened to the day when Spielberg made movies that weren't so damn dark and bleak. This is still a fun film, but no where near as fun as, say, an Indiana Jones flick. And the future does not look like a happy place. Seems it's more popular to make visions of the future as depressing and uninviting as possible. Still, it carries along the atmosphere quite well.--Like I said, occasionally some of the CGmostly just on the ""living plants""seems kind of sloppy.The Bad:--Really, nothing I could say here that ruined the film.The Ugly:--Tom's dinner after his, uh, eye surgery.Memorable Scene: --The jet-pack enhanced chase scene.Acting: 9/10 Story: 9/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Character Development: 9/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 9/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 1/10 (extremely brief sexual references) Violence/Gore: 6/10 (some violence, mostly action suspense) Dialogue: 8/10 Music: 8/10 Direction: 9/10Cheesiness: 0/10 (relates to the dialog problem) Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 9/10Spielberg and Science Fiction fans will certainly enjoy this.

"Tense, fast moving thriller","I haven't seen much of Spielberg's movies. I have had many good things about his movies yet I haven't been in the mood to see them. At least until now. This movie is basically one of the best sci fi movies that have ever been released. That's weird considering I am not a sci fi fan at all. Of all the brainless action movies and pseudo sci fi movies that have come out recently, this is one movie that can actually stop and make you think. It has the usual sentimental moments of Spielberg that the ""critics"" hate. Instead here it is not an overdose with cute kids and harmless aliens. It is actually a tense atmospheric thriller which accurately portrays the emotions of a man who believes he is innocent and is on the run from the system he once championed. This movie is quite relevant especially in developing countries where the police have more power and people are even jailed without properly establishing their guilt. In this way it is not exactly a science fiction movie and it is more of a movie that can actually appeal to a lot of people who value justice and human rights.The storyline sounds quite ridiculous. But the execution - perfect. The story is about a policeman named John Anderton who is in charge of a system called Precrime. Precrime is a system where suspects are prevented from committing a crime. John Anderton fervently believes in the system and even justifies it to FBI agent Colin Farrell. He arrests these suspects based on the previsions(premonitions) from Pre Cogs which are three bodies lying in a pool of milk. The trouble here is that John Anderton himself is accused of the crime of murder by the system. He runs as a fugitive from the law and a nationwide hunt is in progress to catch him. The plot is quite confusing because of the advanced technology being described and in that sense it could be described as the most complex movie Spielberg has ever directed. The beauty is that everything comes together so perfectly in the end. The length of the film is not a hindrance at all.Tom Cruise is somewhat of an underrated actor. Although I don't think he deserves an Oscar, he has had some pretty intense performances. This one, particularly, carries the film and IMO might be one of Cruise's best performances. His confused emotions when his system betrays him are quite good and so is his acting with regard to the scenes with the memories of his son. Colin Farrell is OK but he doesn't have much to do, he should have been given a bigger role. Samantha Morton is also pretty good in her role. The special effects are quite advanced. Even though I don't really care about special effects, the special effects in this are quite impressive. What I loved most about the movie was the cinematography. The dark tinge reminded me mostly of directors like Fincher. The camera-work gives a dark and grainy feel to the whole movie and portrays the mindset of the main character. The complexity of the plot is not a hindrance as it doesn't have many loose ends. For this, praise must be given to the screenplay writers, Scott Frank and Jon Cohen who have written a fluid screenplay which moves smoothly. The background score should also have special mention. I feel this movie also has a feel of a horror film, in the sense that, it has some really tense sequences. The scene with John Anderton in the ice cold bathtub when the spiders check him out is of special mention.I can't really think of many negatives to this movie. Maybe the number of action scenes could have been reduced. But I still couldn't think of it as a flaw because I really enjoyed them.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"

"Great Film, Great Cinema","I've seen Minority Report twice now, in different company, and have thoroughly enjoyed it both times. Was moved and excited and engaged throughout. It's a film you need to take your brain along for, and much as I enjoy a mindless film occasionally, was getting tired of there not being much else around.This is the first film I've ever watched where I've noticed and loved a car! Aside from that the film presents a lot of things to think about. Not only is there the central question of 'how just is a system which punishes people who haven't committed a crime?' but also about privacy invasion - all persons are not only identified and registered globally by retinal scan, but are continually and publicly identified by scanners set all over the place. The future of truly targeted advertising is far more frightening in some ways than the idea of having your windows kicked in by rapidly descending men in black.A great film, a trifle sentimental in places but doesn't over do it, I think.

Worth the money,"That was a pretty good flick- a strong 7. Problems 1)it engages you intellectually throughout, but never manages to grab you viscerally.

The story was ingenious, but not unpredictable. Because the movie challenges you intellectually, you often find yourself ahead of the plot, and the only times you guess wrong is when it doesn't really matter much.Don't get me wrong- I paid $12.50 and I don't feel cheated one bit for having paid it; the weaknesses just stand out a bit, is all.

It's movies like this that put most other movies to shame.,"It seems that most very good movies that we see now are smaller films. The big-budget studio jobs insult our intelligence more and more but corporate ass holes keep on making them because people keep on watching. But when you think of the better movies of even just the last year, many of them (Gosford Park, Monster's Ball, Innocence, Amélie, In the Bedroom and Ghost World) are more obscure films that I can't see unless I sit on a bus for two hours. The Fast Runner hasn't even come to my local theatre, and I'm Canadian, and it seems to be one of the best Canadian projects ever. So it's refreshing when a major, major release finds a way of being complicated, involving and exciting all at the same time. Plus it shows that somebody is confident that the general public's brains are more than just mush.Minority Report is a tightly woven, emotional, thrilling story. It has action, but is more than just an action movie. Even though it takes place more than fifty years in the future, against a vivid, technically enhanced backdrop, its characters, their motives, and everything about it has a universal tone than rings true, more than many of the lame brained movies which take place at present. Plus, it's the most entertaining movie I've seen this year.Most people reading this will know that Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, a pre-crime cop who goes on the lamb with one of the murder predicting pre-cogs, Agatha (Samantha Morton), after he is identified as someone who will soon commit a murder. Anymore exposition would be unnecessary and possibly spoiling.The solid, capable cast also includes Max von Sydow and Colin Farrell, but the best performances of the movie belong to Cruise and Morton. Cruise is always real, with his added classic movie star appeal, in one of his best performances. He doesn't play up being the emotionally tortured work-alcoholic that he is, which, in a roundabout way, augments the pathos evoked for that aspect of his character. Morton takes a role that could have been totally cornball and overwrought and makes Agatha's sickliness credible; and her weird mutterings don't come off as some actor trying to be ""weird"".The only way a movie like this could get made is with a director behind it who has the studio's confidence behind him, 100%. Nobody has that more than Steven Spielberg who, with movies like E.T. and Jaws, has always found a way of perfectly blending special effects with the story instead of coming off as showy. His pacing feels natural, instead of formulaic; a trait which has proven him one of the most solid storytellers in the movies. He succeeds in Minority Report where he didn't in A.I. Adding humor where it fits in perfectly, choosing a moral dilemma we can identify with and knowing when it's time to end the thing, although I felt it waned slightly, very slightly, towards the end. Maybe I just need to see it again.If you generally like Steven Spielberg's work, wanted to like A.I., and like what movies are all about, you should definitely see Minority Report.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
P.K. Dick + high tech effects + Spielberg = WOW!,"Pretentiousness put aside, you got to hand it to them: this movie has a interesting idea for a plot, contains great effects, has some of the Spielberg warmth and humor, and it has a skilful cast that isn't necessarily composed by the Hollywood usuals.By the way, cheers to Samantha Morton for her performance as the precog Agatha. She's scary, cute, alien-like and sensual at the same time, without even having hair. How about that! :-)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
dazzling effects and better story than I expected,"Man, how I wish I'd seen this in the theatre instead of renting it last night. Like a newsroom working to a deadline, ""Minority Report"" moves at a fast pace. The special effects are really special. But one complaint: the advertising that's included is too loud and clear.But still, with good guys like Tom Cruise, with action like this, who needs James Bond 007? This film must have been a HUGE undertaking to make. Not that our director ever does anything small. Another fine job, Mr. Speilberg.Well worth renting, but it deserves a big-screen TV.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Futuristic Film Noir,"I loved A.I.', Spielberg's last foray into science fiction. It wasn't perfect  but for me, science fiction is about the philosophy of scientific progression; the wrongs, the rights, the gains, and the consequences of making the human being closer to our perception of efficiency. In Spielberg's tribute to the late Stanley Kubrick, he explores the morality and responsibilities in creating' life. Does intelligence dictate life form, and if so, who owns the right to take that away? Would killing an artificially created life form be considered murder? It is not the actual questions that attracted me so, but how these questions are played out in Spielberg's universe  how the movie works with these issues.This is also why I feel Spielberg's follow-up to A.I. is so wonderfully extravagant in its telling. The year is 2054. Murder has been all but eliminated thanks to a new technique called pre-crime'. This term refers to the ability to see murders before they happen  giving the police (pre-cops) time to find the place, and people involved in the murder, and hopefully prevent it. Even though this system has seen continued success, much of the population still doubted the idea of preventing something before it happens. The scenario is laid out wonderfully by a meeting between John Anderton (Tom Cruise), an accomplished pre-cop, and a representative/cop from the government, Danny Witwer (Collin Farrel).Witwer's main purpose is to find flaws in the system  somehow prove that although it is possible to predict the future, it is impossible to be certain that it will happen unless it happens. Anderton, who we find early on is one of the best pre-cops in the business, and believes that the system is sound, rolls a ball along a table in which Witwer catches. Anderton asks him why he caught the ball, in which Witwer replies, `Because it was going to fall'. The answer, in every sense of the word, was a prediction  an educated one at that, but still nothing more. From this, we can extrapolate the greater scope of this example: Is it possible to predict  for certain  that something will happen? Is it right to condemn someone for a crime that he/she has not yet committed? From this moment, Anderton and Witwer, because of their opposing beliefs, are immediately split into their own proverbial corners of the ring.Philosophy aside, this is above all an action movie; something Stephen Spielberg is no stranger to. His experience in working behind the camera shows in almost every aspect of motion picture from the shot to the timing. In the climax to an amazing scene were little spider-like robots are sent in to an apartment complex to find Anderton, one of the spiders creeps under the door to a bathroom where Anderton is hiding under water. We watch as the robot looks around the room and turns to leave after not noticing the submerged subject. We cut to a shot of a tiny air bubble that barely escapes Anderton's nose. The bubble bursts just as the last moving leg of the spider is about to leave under the closed door. Suddenly, the spider stops, and turns around for a closer look. The description of the scene is very mundane. However, with Spielberg's ability to masterfully time the action on screen, he is able to create a huge sense of tension.Spielberg's eye is as masterful as his timing. One of the most interesting shots in the movie comes near the later stages, where Anderton and Agatha are embracing. It is a two shot (very commonly used in modern Hollywood cinema), but used in a manner in which I've never seen before. The profile of the two characters looking away while talking to each other is wonderful, and lends itself perfectly to the subject matter of the scene; a stroke of genius during a scene that could have been just another scene.I also have to comment on the special effects of the movie. In many movies, some recent one which come to mind include `Attack of the Clones' and `Spiderman', the special effects, were used in a way such th at it seemed like the filmmakers were building the movie around the special effects. For me, this is a huge distraction  possibly intended to take our eyes off some horrible acting (I'm not naming any names here!). In `Minority Report', the effects are used to help and compliment the movie, never poking its way to the centre of attention, and letting the movie and its characters tell the story. Amongst the huge firecracker explosions and web swinging computer graphics of the modern day action movie, this was a refreshing change for me, and I hope the filmmakers take note and follow suit.Aside from these scenes, Spielberg's ability to play with the audience is consistent throughout the length of the film. It is so easy for him to startle, play with, and manipulate the viewer  and all the time being so very discrete. Much of the film is shot with a filter that makes whites seem oversaturated. This helps contrast dark shadows and retain a great film noir feel. It also lends itself to the idea of how hard it is to hide in a city illuminated by light and surrounded by tiny cameras.The casting is solid, and everyone played their roles convincingly. Samantha Morton was surprisingly convincing, and Collin Farrel was great at making us dislike him right from the start. People who are looking for something to calm their appetite for an action movie will surely be satisfied with Minority Report'. The fact that this action movie comes with a brain is a welcomed bonus.In a summer that has so far been filled with mediocre blockbuster fare, Spielberg unloads what is sure to be one of his most technically challenging and rewarding works.Larry www.crankyfilms.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
One of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen in a while,"Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise...need I say more?  You just can't go wrong! I have to say the story is absolutely brilliant!  I loved it from start to finish!  There are a few minor things that I was less than fond of, but they were so minor that I didn't let them really bother me.The special effects are just mind-blowing and Spielberg's idea of the future is PERFECT!  A lot of times directors go overboard with their idea of the future, I think Spielberg has the perfect amount of futuristic stuff meshed with present-day stuff.The acting is quite good too from all that appeared in the film.  Tom Cruise pulls off a solid performance as does Colin Farrell and Max von Sydow.  The rest of the cast is great too.If you are a science fiction fan, then I think it's in your best interest to see this film!  I am very happy to see that this film has already made it into the top 250 (and currently the top 150) films on IMDB!  If you're a Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg fan than you should definitely see this film!  I truly hope that you enjoy the film as much as I did.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Stunning Visuals and Incredible Story,"The visual image of the future that we get from Spielberg in Minority Report is awe inspiringly jaw dropping. Yeah. It's that good. But the best part about it is that the eye candy is only there to play along with the story, not to dominate it. Recently it seems as though special effects have been the basis for entire movies where as Spielberg understands that the movie should be the basis for the use of special effects. There are some great action sequences in the beginning of the movie including a jet pack sequence and a ""pulse gun"" scene; either of which would have been well worth the price of admission. Other details include robotic spiders that can confirm the identity of people in a building in a matter of minutes, cars that glide vertically and horizontally on magnetic strips, mammoth skyscrapers mixed with present day buildings in Washinton D.C., and so many others.Nothing can compare to the computer interface used by pre-crime to find out the details of the killer. The computer takes the visual images from the Pre-Cogs and plays them with a Precrime officer at the controls. The images can be manipulated by the officer with movements almost like a symphony conductor. It's like an enormous even cooler looking iPhone. Except this was about five years before our world was blessed (cursed?) with the device. Aside from that the overall look of the world is near flawless. The gray world makes the CGI animators job easier and allows the world to remain real and tangible for the audience.The story is about Precrime's star cop John Anderton - Tom Cruise in perhaps his finest performance ever. Anderton is a man with many flaws, especially since losing his son in a freak poolside disappearance years ago. He does drugs to make the present bearable all while tracking down (alleged) future murderers. It's all fine and dandy until Anderton is the next suspect the Precogs see killing a random man. He goes on the run to try to clear his name, all while DC's finest try to hunt him down in the futuristic world where it's nearly impossible to hide.Spending hours talking about just the images would be easy, but what really carries this movie is the engrossing story. There are numerous twists and turns, and there are small holes in logic at a few points, but those holes depend on personal opinions and philosophy. It has always been a dilemma to answer the question: ""If you stop something from happening that was supposed to happen, doesn't that mean that it really wasn't supposed to happen anyways?"" My biggest problem was this: John's supposed future murder was predicted early which meant it was premeditated, but it actually was not, it happened in the heat of the moment, so how could the Pre-Cogs have predicted it so early?We forget about everything that could be wrong because Tom Cruise is so exciting to watch on screen that nothing else matters sometimes. He is the best action star alive today, but he is also one of the few action stars with highly respectable dramatic talent as well. His turns in Rain Man, Born on the Fourth of July, Magnolia, and Jerry Maguire have all been top notch. He is the perfect choice for John Anderton and his collaboration with Spielberg allows him to get back into the high quality of work that we are used to seeing him in.The supporting cast is extraordinary with standout performances from Max von Sydow - the old and optimistic director of Precrime - Colin Farrell - complex and pessimistic investigator Danny Witwer - and Samantha Morton - Agatha, the most talented Pre-Cog. One of the most memorable lines in the movie comes when Agatha mutters, ""Is this now?"" It makes us realize that Agatha seeing the present is just as amazing for her as any one of us seeing the future.There are hundreds of other details, big and small, that make this movie an instant classic. This may sound tacky, but Minority Report shoots for nothing less than perfection, and it succeeds on almost every level.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
spielbergs best since schindlers list!,"Wow where to start.  Tom Cruise delivers a satisfying preformance as john anderton.  However i was dissapointed with colin farrels performance as danny whitmore.  Speilberg directed this sci fi film very well and proved his talent hasnt died down over the years.  the special fx where top notch. but i feel as though the major flaw in minority report was the script, the dialoque was less than note worthy and the character development was poor. All and all this was a great sci fi action film and proved that tom cruise is the most bankable actor out there right now(sorry harrison maybe that'll change after indy 4).8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
What a ride!,"Sometimes I think people forget how to just relax and enjoy a movie--they're so intent on what they want to say about it later in a forum such as this.The movie kept me enthralled for the 2 hours and 20 minutes I watched. Sure there were a few holes upon reflection--but who cares?  I had a great time and that is the magic of a good film.  If it entertains me and takes me to another place for a couple of hours, it's done its job!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Crime, Mystery"
Much better than AI,"Well, for all the hype, Minority Report was much, much better than AI--and is arguably the best sci-fi we've seen in years (sorry, X-men).  However, the film holds very few surprises for anyone familiar with the works of P.K. Dick (except, of course, for the execrable tacked-on Hollywood/Spielberg ending), and has several annoying ideological plot holes.  Beautiful to look at, the film uses Tom Cruise well, and is well worth seeing--but not with the heightened expectations of the hype-machine.
