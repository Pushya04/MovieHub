"not their best, but pleasurable nonetheless","This is by far not the most interesting production by the Cohens, but it is worth watching on a variety of levels. First, there is the pleasure of seeing a bunch of good actors working together with great chemistry, some of them (like Pitt and Clooney) certainly not in their ""traditional"" roles. Second, the story is actually wacky enough to hold up in terms of internal logic, as strange as it may seem. As usual with the brothers, do expect some unexpected turns, of the violent variety. And yet, somehow, the movie retains the character of a light comedy. Pay particular attention to the very last words spoken in the film, they may be the best summary of the whole thing I've heard so far.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Bright American Farce,"Nobody is quite there in this new bright farce by the Coen brothers. The plot is a smart excuse for a movie about nothing but appearing to be about a lot of things. Going backwards and forwards at the same time. Talk about ""The Russians?"" or planning to write a memoir. Brad Pitt is priceless and the innocence of his character is so believable that I wondered how many more surprises this actor has up his sleeve. He is a joy. George Clooney is also terrific and the Coens move through their crossed purposes with speed and elegance. I was totally immerse in their universe even if I didn't quite care what was going on. John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Richard Jenkins and the unnerving Tilda Swinton complete the package of this movie that feels as if it was made for the sheer pleasure of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not what I expected: dark, over-the-top, hilarious but surprisingly poignant","The Coen Brothers are an interesting pair, there's no doubt about that. Just as they did back in the 1980's with their debut and sophomore films, the Coens chose to follow up their most heavy-handed and serious film since Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men, with a nutty, over-the-top screwball black comedy. But unlike their second film, Raising Arizona, the Coens deliver Burn After Reading with a kind of newfound cynicism attached to it; it's funny, but it's also surprisingly dark and sad, and even poignant to some extent.Based on the Coen's first wholly original screenplay since 2001's The Man Who Wasn't There, Burn After Reading features a plethora of classic Coen staples: repetitive (and brilliant) dialogue employing a strange and almost poetic use of curse words, a multifaceted plot featuring slightly dim-witted characters in way over their heads, blacker-than-the-night comedy, over-the-top performances from a pool of actors featuring recurring collaborators and newcomers to the Coen clan alike, and to tie it all off, a lesson-learning conclusion in which nothing ends up being learned at all. It's wonderful how the Coens complicate the plot so much only to round it all off perfectly in the end. Like all of their films, Burn After Reading is a carefully calculated dance in which every pause, every stutter and every camera move is planned in advance.What I loved most about the movie is trying to get into the Coen's heads and see what they think is funny. What's for sure is that the brothers have the most unique sense of humour in Hollywood; superficially, it seems as if most of the film's comedy derives from over-the-top slapstick/screwball antics and bleak, black comedic situations and visual gags, but in reality Burn After Reading's comedy is a lot subtler than that. As I already mentioned, this is a film in which every twitch and stutter is calculated; fittingly, this is the real source of the film's hilarity, in the actors' facial expressions, subtleties, and delivery of the lines. It's great to think, for instance, that the Coens probably thought that applying a booming, ominous drum-dominated ""epic""-type musical score to the movie in the style of a Tony Scott action-thriller would be absolutely hilarious, and that's just one example of the many jokes in the movie that just soar right over your head. In addition, I think that the Coen Brothers are probably the most talented employers of curse words in Hollywood. Many directors are familiar with the colourful phrases, some more than others, but only the Coens know how to make various S- and F- words utterly sidesplitting.Blessed with one of the more impressive ensemble casts of any film this year, Burn After Reading inevitably features a plethora of good acting. Surprisingly good acting, actually, proving I suppose that the Coen's didn't really mean for this to be a total farce but do reach out for a little something more. Frances McDormand, George Clooney and John Malkovich all deliver fantastically colourful, over-the-top performances, but each of their characters also has an added level of sadness and poignancy to them that adds a little something more than physical comedy to the actors' performances: McDormand with her almost tragic loneliness and obsession with cosmetic surgery, along with her equally tragic ignorance of those around her that do appreciate her for what she is; Clooney with an equal amount of loneliness and desperation, and an undeniable air of incompetence abound him, suggesting that his mediocre job is probably the best he can get; and Malkovich, with his alcoholism and acute superiority complex. Tilda Swinton and the ever-great Richard Jenkins are a lot subtler than their higher-billed co-stars, and Brad Pitt delivers the only truly one-hundred percent cartoon performance in the film; thought despite its emptiness it's also the most enjoyable and completely hilarious.J.K. Simmons I reserve for last; he only appears in two scenes in the film, but they are undoubtedly and by far the funniest and most successful scenes of the film. Props to him for admirably succeeding in carrying the Coen's hilarity to another level of deadpan comedy.The Coen Brothers have an interesting sense of humour, and it is present up front and center in their latest film. Just the concept of following up a serious drama-thriller like No Country for Old Men with an over-the-top screwball black comedy probably seemed hilarious to them. Featuring great, uproarious performances from a stellar ensemble cast, the Coens really give it their all with their offbeat, so-subtle-half-the-jokes-soar-over-your-head comedy. And yet, the film occasionally does manage to reach out a little further from its apparent genre limitations and provides us with something more poignant and truthfully sad. It's even somewhat startling just how dark the movie gets and how cruel the Coens are to their characters. It wasn't quite what I expected, but then again, that's the Coen Brothers for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The Coens' funniest film since ""The Big Lebowski""","I'm not the only one to notice the pattern in the Coens' filmography: ""Blood Simple."" was followed by ""Raising Arizona"", ""Fargo"" by ""The Big Lebowski"", and ""No Country for Old Men"" by ""Burn After Reading"". The main concern one had about this film is whether it would be an ""Intolerable Cruelty"" or a ""Big Lebowski"" for the Coens. Let's put it this way: the reviews have been mixed, especially from major mainstream media critics. Guess what other Coen comedy received mixed reviews and was accused of being a somewhat tired mess? Yep, ""The Big Lebowski"".The Coens' sense of humor is very distinctive, and I'm not talking about stuff like ""Intolerable Cruelty"" (this one the mainstream media liked, go figure) and ""The Ladykillers"", which featured numerous commercial concessions. I'm talking about the vicious, cruel, misanthropic farce that gets self-important critics' knickers in a twist. Describing ""Burn After Reading"" as a screwball spy farce makes it sound much more ""Austin Powers"" than it is. There is a lot of silliness, but the sort of silliness one finds in a Howard Hawks comedy, not in most comedies that have been made recently. It's a screwball comedy but a pretty dark one.This is most certainly an acquired taste. It is not going to go down well with people who can't laugh at murder, things going terribly wrong for innocent people, or the Cones' trademark dialogue that pops up even in 'serious' movies like ""Fargo"" and ""No Country for Old Men"". However, ""Burn After Reading"" was seemingly tailor-made for my cruel sense of humor, as I found it to be easily the most inspired comedy script in a long time. It's a conspiracy espionage thriller with no stakes, nothing to fight over, a bunch of complete fools and idiots caught in the middle of it (""a league of morons"" if you listen to John Malkovich's character), and disastrous consequences for just about everyone. Take out the jokes and you could have a tragedy but as it stands this is the funniest movie the Coens have made since ""The Big Lebowski"", if not the best, and that includes ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"".One really shouldn't know anything about the plot or how it unfolds prior to seeing it, as this is a film which is far more intricately-plotted than most critics are giving it credit for. The basic concept is that Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt's characters come across a disc they think contains top secret intelligence. What follows is, as described above, a thriller with no stakes and a bunch of idiots. It's one of those movies where you really shouldn't be laughing (for ethical reasons) but are, and it will have you laughing through your disapproval for basically the entirety of the film after the opening fifteen minutes or so, which are rough in comparison to the rest of the film, and to be honest the only thing that keeps this film from being absolutely brilliant and the Coens' best movie since ""Lebowski"". Just don't go in expecting a movie that looks as beautiful as many of their movies do- Lubezki is no Deakins, at least not based on his work here, and the Coens are very clearly attempting to emulate in many ways the look of the sort of thriller they're basing this on. It's functional, well-shot, and well-directed, but the writing and acting are the main attractions here.Of course, ""Burn After Reading"" will be dismissed as having little worth and for being a disposable farce by many. Well, if only they knew how hard it is to do comedy well. I'd reckon this was harder to write than the (admittedly tremendous) ""No Country for Old Men"", which was adapted from a novel that might as well have been a screenplay if formatted correctly. The movie may not start brilliantly (not that it isn't good even early on), but once the Coens start firing on all cylinders they never stop, and the dream cast certainly doesn't either (Brad Pitt has a smaller role than most cast members here, but he is absolutely brilliant in the role), showing tremendous comic skill that few would have guessed most of them had. The final scene may very well be one of the best I have seen in a long, long time.""What a clusterf-ck!"", indeed.9/10",,Anonymous,Crime
Burn After Reading — What if you believed you were in a spy movie?,"Burn After Reading is a weird movie. It takes everything that makes a good spy flick and turn it on its head.

Story with twists within twists. Well paced scenario. Solid dialogs. Nice action.The actors.

One of the funniest movies ever made,"The Coen Brothers seem to have a catalog of movies that are both beloved and highly underrated. And no better example of the latter than Burn After Reading.Despite the solid 7.0 Rating and the 63 on Metascore, which are all positive, especially for a mainstream US movie. I think this movie is highly underrated by both film critics and audiences. This film works under a very particular type of weird, deadpan comedy that seems to be unloved by a majority of general audiences. But I personally consider this movie to be not only one of my all-time favorites but a tremendously hilarious film filled with wonderful writing and performances.While Brad Pitt is obviously the standout in this film, I think this film is helped a lot by the casting of the supporting actors. Richard Jenkins is my favorite of the supporting actors, and he again shows how underrated of an actor he is. He steals the show in a very nervous and insecure performance that works very well for the character.The writing is truly exceptional, and the way every single subplot works to connect with the main story is beautifully done and is brought together wonderfully for a hilarious, but poignant ending.If you like deadpan, awkward humor this will work very well for you. But even if you don't find the humor all that funny, this is still a very well-acted and written, and most importantly, entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very funny adult comedy,"The point here is that this movie is for adults, with adult themes and adult situations. As with all Coen brother movies, there are going to be people who love it and people that hate it. There doesn't seem to be much middle ground. I loved this movie. It was entertaining, dark and very funny. I really liked ""No Country for Old Men"" but I have to say, ""Burn After Reading"" was a more enjoyable film for me. Some of the reviews here have said that the film rambles around pointlessly, without any clear direction; well I have to disagree, if you are paying attention and you are an adult, you should have no problem understanding what is going on. The best part of the movie is watching this great cast perform brilliantly with the odd-ball material they are given. They are all straight men for the Coen brother's antics. There is violence, bad language, and everyone is sleeping with everyone else, especially George Clooney. But the movie is very funny and while the rest of Hollywood seems to have lost there way, the Coen brothers continue to put out intelligent, entertaining and thought provoking material.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Major Disappointment,"Wow, I can't believe this movie is still carrying 7.5 stars. First off I am a huge Coen Bros. fan, and I had the opportunity to watch Burn After Reading at my own home, at my own leisure. I really wanted to see this movie, and I was really disappointed. The actual ""movie"" itself was not bad, I think that my problems stem from the fact that I hated all of the characters. There was not one character that I liked or could in any way shape or form relate to at all. That for me is a first when watching a Coen Bros. film. Maybe if they had a little for development rather than just being thrown at us, I don't know. Like I said the film itself is well shot (they picked an awful lot of dreary overcast weather though), sounds good, and actually is paced well, and the way the characters are all intermingled with one another without knowing was pretty cool. Clooney's wifes character seemed kind of shoved out of the loop until we see her on her book tour in Seattle but whatever, that could have been another story in itself. Overall this movie was okay... Just not what I was expecting after NCFOM.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"More ""Big Lebowski"" Than ""Intolerable Cruelty"" -- thankfully","BURN AFTER READING is laugh-out-loud funny. It's more ""Big Lebowski"" than ""Intolerable Cruelty,"" though there are wisps of both, but ""Burn"" is not quite up to Lebowski's genius. Still, it is very, very funny and loads of fun.From the opening moments, the Coens' latest movie -- a spy-thriller spoof -- hurls the viewer on a hilarious romp through Absurd-land. What better place to set such a story than Washington, DC?The story involves a demoted government worker (John Malkovich) who finds himself the target of an extortion scheme by two gym workers, riotously played by Frances McDormand (a would-be gym bunny if only she could afford some plastic surgery) and Brad Pitt (a high-energy, arm-thrusting, hip-shaking fitness trainer-cum-""good Samaritan"" who lands himself way in over his head). The romp soon turns dark.As usual, the Coens' dialog is a real treat. When a co-worker points to Malkovich's alcohol problems as a reason for his demotion, Malkovich retorts, ""You're a Mormon. Next to you we all have a drinking problem."" And as usual in Coen-land, there's a clash between high and low brow. Malkovich's pronunciations of ""mem-wahhh"" for ""memoir"" is a hoot, and his correction of Pitt's mistaken ""report"" for ""rapport"" propels a conflict between classes and types -- symbols of a society in trouble, whose priorities are askew.As in the Coen brothers' 1987 box-office hit RAISING ARIZONA, obsessions fuel the plot, though this time it's body (not baby) obsession. McDormand is hellbent on getting expensive elective surgery to ""reinvent"" herself. Pitt is a workout addict, who can barely stop moving long enough to think straight. And George Clooney, who can only stop talking when it's time to go running or jump into bed with someone, plays a G-man fixated on sex. Notions of ""intelligence"" and all that the word connotes (along with its antonyms) mix into the film's dark comedic brew of unintended consequences.Where does it go? I don't want to give away any of the twists to answer that question in depth. But I would disagree with the critics who claim it doesn't go anywhere. The movie and its over-the-top, needless violence show how secretive missions even by bumbling know-nothings (whose only knowledge of undercover ops seems to come from spy flicks) can have disastrous outcomes. Secrets in Washington? Sure sounds like a topic we should all be better versed in.Erica Rowell Author: The Brothers Grim: The Films of Ethan and Joel Coen http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Grim-Films-Ethan-Joel/dp/0810858509",,Anonymous,Crime
Okay After Viewing,"Burn has a lot going for it. As with most Coen Brothers' movies, this spy spoof has a brilliantly quirky story that is full of interestingly flawed characters. The plot moves along with enough action never to be boring.The performances and direction make the movie well worth your time. Unfortunately, there's a missed opportunity here. Nothing ever really takes off like you would expect or want.This movie is not near as bad, nor near as good as some reviewers contend. Maybe it's because people have certain expectations of any Coen Brothers movie. As for me, some of their movies I love, and others I hate. Then there are a few, like Burn, that are just okay.

I also liked the character played by John Malkovich, he is very funny when he says ""fuck"" when he is angry.

"An Intelligent. Quirky, Surreal Delight","This film will not be to everyones taste, and I wholly understand the polarised responses.A star studded cast enjoy a knowing, wordy script, where dialogue counts, a Coen brothers trademark.However not very much happens, and the narrative is disjointed, so the pace of the story is very staccato.But once again the result is something very wide of the Hollywood mainstream and is all the more satisfying for it.A 95 minute running time,, and several separate but interwoven plots, mean that screen time for individual actors is limited. Consequently each shines in their given roles, relishing the word play and eking the maximum out of each situation.No scene is dwelled upon, and the occasional bloody outburst of violence, or titillating appearance of a Sybian machine , is shown then moved on from before you have time to work out exactly what is going on.The script is littered with double entendres, ""running gags (pun intended)and lines aimed straight at the audience from the screen.

Not as good as expected.,"The film has a good line up cast, but the script is not really that strong enough to utilize all the talent in the cast.

I sat through the movie expecting the Coen Brothers to create magic as the plot proceeds (like they usually do) but that moment never seemed to come at all. The Coen brothers definitely were not successful at showing what they saw in the plot. I really don't understand the very high rating. Or it could be just me.

Another Hit from the genius of the Coens.,"There's a point in this movie that George Clooney's character, Harry Pfarrer shows Frances McDormand's character Linda Litzke something that we've seen him working on for about half the movie. It was so surprising when I first saw it, that at first, I didn't even know what it was.Once again, the Coens have created wonderful characters, including Clooney, who is a womanizer and paranoid that people are following him, and McDormand, who just wants plastic surgery in order to look better. Also, there's John Malkovich as Osbourne Cox, who ""doesn't have a drinking problem,"" and maybe the best in the movie, Brad Pitt as Chad, a clueless gym employee who is pushed along by McDormand.The only character that isn't up to par with the rest is Tilda Swinton's character of Katie Cox, Osbourne's wife. She doesn't get as many laughs as the rest, and it seems like the Coens just needed her as a plot device rather than an actual character. However, she may not be funny, but she does play the character well.The writing is brilliant and the Coens weave the story in such a way that it reminds me of their previous movie, The Big Lebowski. In the end, as J.K. Simmons character sums it up himself, nothing really happens, but while watching it all unfold, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Plot-less Movie Can Only Go So Far,"Burn After Reading in a strange way reminded me of 8 1/2 in that both movies are about nothing. But these kind of movies can only go so far and Burn After Reading pushed it to the limit. I would explain the plot to you but as I explained there is none.The writing and directing was excellent by the Coen brothers. They took the storyline about as far as they could some how making their message believable showing that things never really go according to plan and they showed this in all aspects of life. The Coen brothers are show how they are quite a quirky duo when they make movies such as The Big Lebowski, Brother Where Art Thou and of course this. With their talent though they take movies like this further than almost anyone I can think of could.The acting in here was very entertaining to watch. John Malkovich is always entertaining to watch, his anger and rage is just a pleasure to watch as ironic as that may sound. Brad Pitt's total embodiment of stupidity in here is probably his best role I have seen to date but then again that maybe shouldn't be too surprising. Francis McDormand was very funny with her need for artificial improvements all over her body. George Clooney, who seemed to be sleeping with everyone was very charming and probably the most interesting to watch behind John Malkovich. Tilda Swinton has began to impress me a lot and has only done so more with the her cold blooded performance. Lastly Richard Jenkins and JK Simmons were actually the most entertaining to watch despite having a superstar cast in front of them.Despite this movie being so technically sound I still did not think it was an amazing or profound movie. It was a movie with an average story that was totally uplifted by its cast and directors.My rating: 7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tonight We Laugh,"Norman Cousins would have loved the Coen Brothers' ""Burn After Reading."" The late great Saturday Review editor had treated his illness with Marx Brothers movies, having ""made the joyous discovery that 10 minutes of genuine belly laughter had an anesthetic effect and would give me at least two hours of pain-free sleep.""I have never felt healthier than after 96 minutes of explosive and grateful laughter at the ""Burn"" screening, also marveling at the array of British-stage caliber acting from ""Fargo""-invoking Frances McDormand, witchy-icy Tilda Swinton, a more-manic-than-ever John Malkovich, and a dozen major players, such as J.K. Simmons as the deadpan CIA boss and Richard Jenkins as the former Greek Orthodox priest, now running an upscale gym.Others may lead the cast list with George Clooney and Brad Pitt, but to me, their performances were just a bit on the self-conscious side, trying too hard. At any rate, it's a great cast, and while the plot might have turned into a dud in somebody else's treatment, the Coen Brothers' writing is hilarious, their zingers deadly.A critic, probably with bad digestion, has decried this ""very black comedy set in a blanched, austere-looking Washington, D.C.  an uninspiring and uncomfortable place in which everyone betrays everyone else, and the emotional tone veers from icy politeness to spitting rage and back again."" If I had a chance to think, instead of enjoying ""Burn,"" I would have contemplated Molière and Evelyn Waugh, their comedies of manners, psychological insight, and unbridled great humor.Yes, there are betrayals (none better than the totally unexpected one at the end of the film), and there is rage, but all contained within a glorious bubble of writing-directing-acting excellence. ""Burn"" grips and holds, surprises and entertains, it is a virtuoso piece.Don't be misled by the a ""action-trailer"" on TV, saturating the airwaves; it says nothing of the film. Malkovich punching Pitt over a compromising CD of spook stuff is not at the heart of this - the McDormand character's pursuit of cosmetic surgery is, what with her self-examination, a lengthy session with the surgeon (Jeffrey DeMunn, in a brilliant turn), her desperate quest for a way to pay for it. Funny and going deep at the same time, ""Burn"" presents a series of character studies (hence the thought of Molière), in the context of mannered yet true social interactions (Waugh).Skip descriptions of the plot, reject self-righteous denunciations of smart skepticism and charming evil, go and wallow in life-affirming laughter.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Coen Brothers don't make bad movies - they don't know how :),"After their Oscar winning turn last year, The Coen Brothers are back with the new film, this time comedy/crime/spy story which is very funny, very dark, quite angry, at times surreal, always ironic and to put it simply a must see for any Coens' fan which means a fan of great movie making. Comparing to the last year's Oscar Winner, No Country for Old Men, their new film may seem much lighter and provides many laughs. But keep in mind, it is comedy: Coens' style and it means that not always the most likable characters get what they look for. As much as the film is funny, it actually paints very disturbing picture about stupidly, idiocy, incompetence, inability to see one step ahead of your actions that keep filling every aspect of our existence with dangerous speed. I loved it - from the very first scene to the end. I laughed a lot, enjoyed the dialogs and the acting. How could I not with the dream cast that include John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton, George Clooney, Francis McDormand, and very funny and deliciously clueless, Brad Pitt, and many familiar faces in the small cameos. George Clooney who has made three films with The Coens got the funniest scenes, and gave IMO one of his best performances. John Malkovich has got to come out of his semi-retirement and act more. His every appearance in the film as forced to quit his job, very angry CIA Analyst who then decided to write a memoir, was a blast. Tilda Swinton as an arrogant icy cold professional woman, and Frances MacDormand as Linda who would stop at nothing in order to ""re-invent herself"", both added to the film's multiple delights.This time, Coens' usual collaborator, Roger Deakins was not director of photography, instead, Emmanuel Lubezki, four times Oscar Nominee (for Children of Men, The New World, Sleepy Hollow, and A Little Princess) took care of camera-work. The film has very beautiful look to it, and I was happy to recognize some of my favorite places in Washington, DC and George Town.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Burn Before Viewing?,"You have to hand it to the Coen Brothers, the maverick satirists of American idiocy (and its resulting comedy-of-errors quirkiness): only they would dare to follow up their most critically-acclaimed, Oscar-winning films with offbeat comedies that are no less consequential when it comes to the bloody consequences of man's avarice. ""Fargo"" was followed by the cult classic ""The Big Lebowski,"" and now the Best Picture-winning ""No Country for Old Men"" has ""Burn After Reading,"" a jolting, surprising comedy that shows the film-making duo's mastery of cinematic form as a source of humor...and frustration. The plot (a gleeful jumble that recalls the tone and vulgarity of ""Lebowski"") concerns a discharged CIA agent's (John Malkovich) memoirs falling into the hands of two self-absorbed gym employees (Frances McDormand and an inspired Brad Pitt); meanwhile, a close-knit circle of Washington insiders (George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, et al) swap wives and find themselves entwined in what seems like a vast conspiracy (even the Russians are brought in to juxtapose Cold War paranoia against our post-9/11 era of fear) that is really just a string of misunderstandings inspired by the simplest of minds. While this is the Coens' umpteenth variation on the premise (after ""Blood Simple,"" ""Fargo,"" ""Lebowski,"" and ""No Country""), ""Burn"" shows them toying more with the mechanics of storytelling than before: there is a deliberate (yet also slow) buildup that holds back humor in favor of establishing character; and it is based on this knowledge that the film's last half often erupts in hilarity. And while the broad, artificial-feeling characters run the risk of throwing ""Burn"" into self-parody, the brilliant cast elevates what could have been throwaway caricatures. While a marginal effort in the Coens' unique filmography, ""Burn"" remains a distinct delicacy in a cinematically mundane year.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
An ax-ceptable film from the Coen Brothers.,"In the Coen tradition, we get our share of blood and guts in the story of Semper Fidelis.A level three analyst in the CIA, Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) is banished to a lesser position, presumably due to excessive imbibing. As with the movie ""Hopscotch"" with Walter Matthau, Osbourne decides to write his memoirs. Now, what do you suppose would happen if the memoir mysteriously gets in the possession of some aging female that is determined to get comedic surgery and is desperate for money and love. This leads to a chain reaction of fidelity and infidelity.When the day is done does the CIA know what they started and learn from whatever it is they did?The film has a good collection of popular actors.

Worth Checking Out but Not Among Coen Brothers Best,"The plot of this film was difficult at times to fully understand how things developed the way they did. As the trailer for the movie indicated, a CD containing classified information fell into the hands of Chad (Brad Pitt), a good natured if somewhat bone-headed fitness instructor, who comes up with the idea of selling it back to its rightful owner, a recently fired CIA Agent named Osborne Cox (John Malkevich). Linda (Frances McDormand) works with Chad at the fitness club. She has an internet dating service hookup with Harry (George Clooney) who is also having an affair with Katie (Tilda Swinton), who happens to be married to Osborne Cox. There were numerous other backstories & sexual intrigue, yet one thing that seemed to resonate throughout the film was that everyone is unfaithful & screwing someone else. And it all seemed so pathetically joyless. The sex displayed in the movie seemed like a publicity campaign for celibacy or at the very least a knock on internet dating services.The bad sex notwithstanding, what was less than clear was how the CD found its way to the gym where Chad happened to find it on the floor. We're left to assume it got there by way of Linda, but the film doesn't show when or how she got it. I suppose it doesn't matter all that much, yet I found that small detail just a little frustrating.All of the performances were excellent. I particularly liked George Clooney's role. He played the philandering Treasury agent Harry, with a goofy demeanor, not unlike his character in ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" or as the lawyer in ""Intolerable Cruelty"". There were many hilarious scenes, particularly funny was when Chad & Linda tried to sell the CD to the Russians (they called on the Russian Consulate after Osborne declined to pay their ransom demand). JK Simmons played a high level CIA chief with his usual comically bombastic demeanor displayed so well as JJ Jamison in the Spiderman movies.As far as Coen brothers films go, I would rate this in the middle of the pack. But as Woody Allen once commented about Sex and Pizza, ""Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good"".",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Odd Funny, Not Laugh Out Loud Funny","""Burn After Reading"" is a black comedy.

Superbly ludicrous!,"Nobody does farce like the Coen Brothers. Any fans of their work will be huge fans of Burn After Reading. The script is everything you could want from a Coen Brothers film, with this sitting alongside the likes of Fargo and The Big Lebowski in terms of tone and style. I won't describe the plot as its so fun and bizarre that its best to go in cold and just experience it. Suffice to say though that it is hugely entertaining, with great twists and turns and a fabulous set of eclectic characters. The Coen's really excel when it comes to crafting fantastical characters and plots, and this is no exception. The film flows so well, has so many quirks and strokes of genius, it really is fantastic.As with any Coen film the cast were selected with precision, with each performance bringing so much life and vibrancy to the already well penned characters. This is only the third film I've seen Frances McDormand in (Fargo and Three Billboards the other two), and she was as amazing in this as she was in those, balancing drama and dark comedy so perfectly. Brad Pitt was hilarious as the dopey gym employee, with Clooney also putting in a great performance. John Malkovich and Tilda Swinton were likewise tremendous, bringing drama and humour to their respective roles. It really was a tremendous cast, with not a foot put wrong in terms of the performance.The direction from the Coen's was as per usual, marvellous. They knit their intricate plots and oddball characters together in such accomplished fashion. Their films always feel so well rounded, with so much love, attention to detail and care poured into every scene. Burn After Reading is no exception to this, and is a very fine addition to their filmography.This film is an absolute blast, and such an easy watch at only 90 minutes long. Do yourself a favour and watch it asap!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Disappointingly pedantic and boring,"Well over a month after seeing it, I am still disappointed by Burn After Reading. The massive amount of talent involved, the fresh from winning Oscars Coen Brothers, and the premise of a classic screwball comedy, should have meant instant gold. But instead, it rather came and went with nearly a whimper.The film jumps around quite excessively, but basically gets kickstarted after Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) quits his senior analyst job within the CIA. He gets drunk, annoys his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton), and ends up writing his memoirs. One way or another, a CD with a lot of this material is found in a local gym. Thinking it could be used as leverage towards an expensive plastic surgery bid, trainer Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) (with the help of co-worker Chad (Brad Pitt)) attempt to blackmail him into paying money to get it back. When that does not work, they go to the Russians.Throw a subplot involving the gym's manager Ted (Richard Jenkins) pining for Litzske, Cox's wife's affair with another CIA agent Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), a whole lot of paranoia and intrigue, and J.K. Simmons, and you basically have what the Coens figured would be an appropriate follow-up to the mesmerizing No Country for Old Men.The problems only begin to start with the story. The film runs for 95 minutes, but it feels about a half hour longer. About five minutes into the film, I was totally bored. Sure, it had plenty of laughs here and there (and many of the Coens' signature hilariously pitch black moments), but the whole thing just lacks the zest to make it run properly from beginning to end. Hell, even comparing it to The Big Lebowski, a comedy classic ten years after its initial release, is a bit of an insult. While that movie packs laughs with a ridiculously silly story that works, this movie tries to want to give a touch of laughs and a ridiculously silly story that may have worked as an concept on paper, but not on film.Moments that should be funny are plagued by boredom, and when the emphasis on paranoia begins to sink in, the film only hurts itself more. I am a big fan of the Coens, but watching this almost made me think they may have truly lost their touch. With the exception of No Country, the brothers have yet to make anything remotely better than decent since O Brother, Where Art Thou? almost ten years ago. They clearly still have some creativity left in them, but they are barely polishing any of their movies before churning them out. This film feels like it could have been able to measure up to the greatness of their classics like Lebowski and Fargo, but the magic seems to be missing. It is almost as if they are trying to recreate something they used to have, but no longer can even muster to make work. Yes, the movie is funnier than a lot of the usual film offerings, but at the expense of putting the audience through agonizing torture waiting for the next funny moment. I would like to think that No Country was not merely a fluke, but with something as rushed and pedantic as this, I cannot fathom thinking of it as anything else.The acting is almost just as disappointing.I have heard the raves, but as far as I was concerned, McDormand and Swinton were fairly bland in their roles. McDormand gets a lot more to do than Swinton, but both look and sound like they are merely taking up space, and getting ready between takes to grab their money. I usually like McDormand, but her character just seemed so plain and lazy that I could never take her seriously for an instant. This may have been the intent, but when we have to watch the pathos and desperation build for her, I think we can assume she needed to put a little more effort in. Swinton serves as a mere catalyst to the reasoning for the whole film in general, but she is so underused and underwritten it hurts (especially after coming off an Oscar win for Michael Clayton). Even worse, she puts less effort into her performance than McDormand does.Clooney, while clearly putting more effort into his character, is just too silly for this film. His zany, oversexed nature is a little jarring when it first springs up, but it gets to be a little bit of a handful by the end of the film. He is clearly just trying to ham it up as someone who may or may not be a close representation of the real-life Clooney, but the results of this bizarre attempt are hit and miss. Malkovich on the other hand, gives a valiant effort with his character. Although his character is nowhere near as important in the second half as he is in the first, he shines rather brightly within the cast as someone who takes the role seriously, but clearly has the ability to play funny too. I think if the focus reverted and stayed on Malkovich the whole time, he could have made up for more than enough faults the film has.As it stands however, Pitt is the one who steals the movie. Playing totally out of character, his silly performance is the only real reason anyone should sit through the movie (and the criminally underused Simmons). His weird portrayal fits in very well, and is nowhere near as jarring as Clooney's. Pitt is clearly having fun, and is giving it his all to convince everyone that he is playing the anti-Brad Pitt. It is just too bad that he is negated to being a mere supporting character to the rest of the cast. If they all worked with one screw loose and put in some effort like he does, the movie could have actually been worthwhile.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brad Pitt should do more comedy like his role in Burn After Reading,Mrs. Shullivan and I saw this movie when it was first released ten years ago. In fact we sat through the film twice because we were 10 minutes late and missed the beginning and boy were we glad we stayed and watched it a second time. This comedy/crime/suspense film is such a classic with the comedy style presented by both Brad Pitt and his buddy George Clooney. This is another Cohen brother film release so one does know what to expect (somewhat) with the Cohen brothers.The Cohen brothers usually move a picture along at a rapid pace with a gifted and creative storyline as well as with great music score and this film fits their method of operating to a tee. Brad Pitt plays a not too bright health club instructor named Chad Feldheimer who along with his somewhat brighter peer fitness instructor Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) recover a disc that holds some pretty important information that certain bad guys want back.So Chad and Linda figure they can maybe receive a kind of reward for the return of the disc to the (not so) rightful owner. When Chad and Linda get in touch with the foul mouthed alcoholic and retired CIA agent Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) I thought we were watching another sequel to the 1994 Dumb and Dumber films. Add to the mix Osborne Cox's wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) wanting a divorce from her husband so that she can move on to her current lover Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) and you have in this comedic mixing bowl enough nuts and bolts to blow the roof off of any comparable perfect comedy/crime caper.We have watched this film several times now and we will be watching it a few more times whenever we want a good laugh. I give the film a perfect 10 for 10 rating.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Definite Letdown,"It's really a shame. This movie had so much going for it, such as a great cast and talented direction. However, it just didn't do anything. It almost did on several occasions, but it ended up coming up short each and every time. I didn't think it was that funny, either, and the film really struggled with figuring out if it wanted to be a comedy or spy thriller, and it didn't do a good job in either category. The only saving grace was John Malkovich, who has proved that he is definitely one of our best actors out there. Unfortunately, his efforts went for naught. The Coen brothers need to stop believing their own press and start making the kinds of great movies they made in the past. Come on, guys!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

ebullient,"Greetings again from the darkness. As usual, high expectations often lead to disappointment when it comes to movies. Being a huge Coen Brothers fan, I can happily re-watch just about any of their films at just about any moment (exceptions would by The LadyKillers and Intolerable Cruelty). Despite a tremendous cast, ""Burn After Reading"" just seems to go nowhere, I didn't have much fun getting there! The two best characters in this one are Brad Pitt as a perky, dim-witted personal trainer (replete with Vanilla Ice/Eraserhead hair) and John Malkovich as former CIA agent Osbourne Cox. In A-typical Coen Brothers fashion, most of the other characters pretty much fall flat ... in an over-the-top kind of way.The amazing cast is completed by Tilda Swinton playing Malkovich's bitchy wife who is sleeping with/dominating George Clooney's character, who is a paranoid sleazeball and seems to have no real purpose other than to also be sleeping with Frances McDormand, who is partnering with goof-ball Brad Pitt to blackmail Malkovich out of $50,000. Richard Jenkins is the fitness center manager who has a quiet crush on McDormand and is fed up with Pitt.There are some funny moments and certainly a couple of pure Coen Brothers scenes, but the story and the characters just don't seem complete, which is the biggest surprise and disappointment. I can only assume that Ethan and Joel felt the same way, and that the J.K. Simmons character speaks for them when he speaks lines such as ""Well we really don't have much, do we?"".",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Read Em' and Weep.,"Though most Coen Bros. films skirt a fine line between reality and fantasy, this is the only film in their ranks that is so inexplicable and stupid, it must be a true American crime story. Burn After Reading details what happens when you give absolute idiots classified information. The Coens needed the perfect oddball cast, and they got one. John Malkovich is easily the standout favorite of mine. A disgruntled ex-CIA agent with the dirty mouth of a truck driver and a lethal temper. He's phenomenal. Frances McDormand shines here as a middle-of-the-road dolt who only cares about plastic surgery. George Clooney is just George Clooney, but I got a kick out of his patented sex- machine and his priceless reaction to finding a stranger in his home. Brad Pitt, as the over-the-top gymnast, is the only one that sort of left me cold. Nearly anyone other than Brad Pitt could've played that character. A seasoned comedian, no doubt, would've knocked it out of the park. Is this a highlight of the Coens? Not exactly, but it's entertaining as hell.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The great espionage parody,"Coen Brothers' Burn After Reading (2008) is a roller coaster of a ride. Even with its bizarre story, hyper-real characters, incongruous setting the movie incredibly manages to keep one engaged from starting to finish. Burn After Reading serves to be a great parody on the espionage films of the bygone era. The seemingly strange casting of Malkovich, Clooney, McDormand, Swinton and Pitt turns out to be the movie's greatest asset: it's their impeccably flawed performances that gives the movie its real impetus.Burn After Reading serves to be a quintessential Coen Brothers film with its subtle, immaculate use of Dark Humor. The movie's strange outlook may make it appear like an exercise in style to those not accustomed to such unconventional style of filmmaking. But the receptive audience is expected to appreciate it more.So, if you are bored by the monotony of life or the mundaneness of cinema and want to try out something new then Burn After Reading is exactly what you are looking for!!!http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Perfect antidote for voter fatigue and disillusion:,"This is one of the few political satire/comedies I feel are worthy of recommendation. The characters are shallow, believable, and an amusing depiction of what probably does go on in D.C. in subtler forms. Maybe not so subtle, considering this is an election year.It starts out with Clooney as a Department of Treasury lackey, his marriage is failing and he utilizes online dating for a distraction. Frances McDormand is excellent as usual, as Linda Litsky, a shallow health club employee who wants plastic surgery to better her dating prospects. She and Chad (Brad Pitt) come across a CD which seems to have national security information, so she and Chad decide to try and sell this to the Russian Embassy.John Malkovich is the CIA operative who loses his job, loses his wife (Tilda Swinton) and subsequently has a breakdown. His scene when trying to get into his Georgetown brownstone after his ex-wife locks him out is classic.Coen Brothers farce here covers it all. J.K. Simmons has a cameo as the head of the CIA, and his deadpan portrayal of indifference and cynicism is dead on.Worth watching a few times, highly recommended.

Burn After Reading A Funny  Comedy,"Burn After Reading is a funny comedy from the Coen brothers whose other directorial credits include No Country For Old Men, The Big Lewoski, and Fargo to name a few. I won't reveal any spoilers because it's better to see it without knowing too much about the movie. Burn After Reading may not be the funniest movie I've ever seen but it's definitely worth watching because of the terrific performances by the whole cast. George Clooney is funny as Harry a philandering State Department marshal whose cheating on his wife. Frances McDormand is equally impressive as Linda Litzke an employee at Harbodies a workout gym whose wants cosmetic surgery. John Malkovich is good as always as Osbourne Cox a CIA Agent who quits his job after being demoted. Tilda Swinton is effective as Osbourne's cold wife Katie a doctor who's having an affair with Harry. Richard Jenkins is good as Ted Treffon the manger of Hardbodies who has feelings for Linda and Brad Pitt is hilarious as Chad Feldheimer a total goof ball whose also an employee at the gym Hardbodies. Pitt may not get a whole lot of screen time but he does a great job at playing a complete idiot. J.K. Simmons also shows up in a brief cameo role and does a solid job with the small part he does have in the movie. Well done. The Coens continue to show with the movie their talent and skill as filmmakers.

Adults only?... I think NOT!!,"I have read several reviews, and I was amazed at one in particular. That one review focused on how only adults would be able to grasp the significance and beauty of the film as a film. I completely and utterly disagree. I am, what some would call, a child. I am sixteen years old. Not old enough to even see the movie alone, though I did. I loved the movie, the humor, as is the case with all Coen brother movies, was indeed dark. The story had a wonderful arch. It was simply well made and well acted. Though i would have to say, from the perspective of an actor, John Malchovich's character seemed to have nowhere to go. It reached the zenith in the first scene. Yes he was a misanthropic, smart-ass, jerk, for lack of a better word, but his anger peaked then had nowhere to go but down.

Not top drawer but always watchable,"A meditation on the psychology of entitlement, this movie posits a world in which every living creature is a plaything, a patsy, a cog in a machine or a moron. It is twinned with a meditation on the psychology of pattern recognition; in this movie not a single person is capable of seeing what's in front of him or her because they are spring loaded to see something completely different; every character defines his or her own self interest so narrowly, and with such ludicrous emphasis on the wrong things, that a horrible outcome is pretty much guaranteed.Every single character is rendered ugly by a character flaw. Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) is a horndog SOB with no more ability to tell the truth than fly to the moon; Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) is obsessed with appearance to the point of being unable to make anything resembling a moral judgement; Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) is so gullible and malleable that he reminds me of that line out of the 1968 film No Way to Treat a Lady ""A thought of yours would die of loneliness!"" And it continues like that. John Malkovich's character (was there ever an actor who chewed scene with such slow-mo relish and verve?) is just an upper class man's son who evaporates as a viable mate when he loses his job, thereby causing his wife (Tilda Swinton, who must have been told ""Please channel every gonad sapping fishwife with clipped English diction EVAR, thankyou"") to run off to a divorce lawyer.About halfway through the movie, my brother turned to me and said, ""So, run into any likable characters yet?"" And the answer was a resounding no, but that didn't make me want to stop watching. I wanted to see it through, because I wanted to see if anything like justice would occur, and it didn't.I enjoyed the movie because it's brilliantly written and very well made. But those characters, hoo-boy. I am glad my life has more meaning, more friendship, and something resembling ethics and rationality, because these fictional folks abandon all such considerations in the first frame, and suffer the consequences all the way through, while the Coens hold up the magnifying glass.

Well made but it felt incredibly detached.,"This was an odd film--and I don't mean this in a favorable way. That's because unlike most Coen Brothers movies I have seen, I felt almost nothing favorable towards any of the characters and it all just seemed very detached and, at times, uninteresting. While I can respect the intricacy of the plot and the good acting, I just felt like I could not have cared less about the movie and could have just as easily turned it off and not finish it. In fact, had it not been a Coen Brothers film, I probably would have done just that. Fortunately, the movie did get a little better towards the end, but not enough to make the time I invested in it worth the payoff.The biggest problem is that the film didn't seem to know whether it was meant to be a comedy or a drama. And, if it was meant to be a comedy, the very graphic killings later in the film weren't the funny FARGO type but just violent. This much violence and cursing kill the comedy, though I still am not sure that it was meant to be a comedy...even on a dark level.The other problem is that no one in the film is particularly nice or even that interesting. In fact, it's almost as if the film is trying to say that everyone is bad and it's all very meaningless. Perhaps, but I just found this made the film a hard one to relate to or care about, even if the acting was generally good.""Blah""--a word I never would have thought I'd apply to a Coen Brothers film.

"For lovers of classic cinema and mature, edgy character comedy.","Being the second Coen brothers' movie of this year alone, thirst for more output from them isn't necessarily at a high, yet that won't stop most audiences from getting excited. Thankfully, such excitement won't be without its foundations, as Burn After Reading, although not quite as remarkable as this year's previous effort, is just as effective at managing to deliver what it sets out to do. In stark contrast to the brothers' No Country for Old Men, this outing sees them adopting their much more familiar satirically witty tone throughout, delivering what is perhaps their most comical and sharpest movie to date. Headlined by an all-star cast, and with a multi-layered story that revolves around national security and the personalities of all involved (plus a few Gym employees), there's a rich body of ingredients to take in here, especially on a one-view basis, but while such a movie is best suited to repeat watching, it's not hard to see the raw entertainment value present first time. Hilarious, engaging and always refreshing to watch, Burn After Reading is a cinematic treat of sorts; nice and easy, focused and all about telling a good story with even better characters.As has been the case with the Coens for so many years now, the tone established throughout this feature walks the fine line of satirical comedy mixed with compelling character drama and even a few instances of thriller-orientated action. Through this tricky razor edge narrative, the brothers create a movie that amuses at its peaks but doesn't necessarily flow as fluidly as their more renowned works. Nevertheless, despite some pacing problems, from start to finish, all involved manage to nail the mesh between shtick and drama effectively enough to give you quite a few belly-laughs whilst avoiding degrading the whole experience into a ridiculous, flat-out comedy driven feature. Sure enough, the humour is dark at times, and the satire is thin, but delivered by the cast involved who in turn are portraying their own mix of off-the-wall characters, Burn after Reading does well to get you on its side right from the beginning when Malkovich walks in and begins dropping the f-bomb left, right and centre. Off-put with plenty of drama and thriller tinges, the mix is potent, and the directors do well to keep things in balance so as to keep the majority of the film consistent in tone and focus.Perhaps the single greatest element of the film and indeed, the directors themselves is their ability to bring out the best of their cast, and in turn without resorting to personas that such actors have done in the past. In fact with the odd exception of Malkovich, pretty much all of the lead stars here have roles that go against their grain so to say. George Clooney is probably the biggest example of this here, playing sleazy Harry Pfarrer with utter conviction; there are no sly smiles here that bring on the charm, these smiles have quite a bit of coldness behind them. Brad Pitt too extends himself beyond his regular cool-cat persona and portrays always-eager fitness freak dunderhead Chad Feldheimer in what is possibly the most entertaining performance throughout the feature. Frances McDormand, although regressing back somewhat to her character in Fargo, gets to have fun with eccentric, obsessive and neurotic Linda Litzke, and Malkovich a recently quit C.I.A. agent going through divorce, often finding himself sleeping at midday and drinking at night before losing his head.Sure enough all these names are enough to make any cinephile get excited, yet the result is even more arresting than imagined. Put together, the actors work tremendously and play off each other exactly as is needed to keep on the edge of that razor of thrilling drama and comedy; there are moments of sheer hilarious caricature, but these are also off-put with grounded drama that only supports these instances of comedy insomuch that we see characters getting into these situations; we laugh when they laugh and we laugh when they react a certain way, because in a sense, we know them. As such, this is Burn after Reading's real centrepiece highlight; the characters are entertaining and at the same time compelling thanks to tight, focused direction from the Coens and spot-on performances and chemistry from the highly capable cast.Sure enough, there are elements that conflict in the Coen's script that even they can't seem to work around when it gets to piecing all of their convoluted parts together. As such, pacing and momentum can dip during specific segments, particularly during the opening act. In this respect Burn after Reading distances itself from the picture-perfect flow of similarly toned Fargo, but not by much. It's a low-key effort, and a more than capable one at that, even if fans of this year's No Country for Old Men and the classic Fargo may leave the cinema a little under-whelmed. When it comes to delivering a highly enjoyable two hour ride full of laughs, thrilling plotting and refreshing characters portrayed by top-rate performers however, Burn after Reading certainly does its job. Put simply, this is good cinematic fun with plenty of intelligence behind it all to keep things interesting; for lovers of classic cinema and mature, edgy character comedy but you probably already guessed that just from reading the name Coen.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,Crime
Burnt After Having Read,"The now infamous Coen brothers make a lot of movies and they know that people out there see a whole lot of movies too. A population distracted by constant film watching is a population led to see the world in a truly dramatic fashion. Finding a computer disc in the ladies locker room of a fitness club would ordinarily be just another occasion to throw something left behind in a lost and found box, likely never to be reclaimed. If you've seen one too many movies though, and you don't have a whole lot going on in your own little life, you might see finding this disc as an opportunity to blackmail the owner of said disc for contents you believe to be top secret C.I.A. intelligence. There's just one thing the movies don't tell you about capers such as these though, and that is that none of it is real. In BURN AFTER READING, the Coens decide it's time for a little fun and serve up a hearty dose of signature comedy that both highlights the influence of film and perpetuates it further at the same time.BURN AFTER READING begins with a thunderous, percussion heavy score and an all too familiar opening shot of the planet we call home. Slowly but persistently, the worldview becomes more focused and as we descend, we zero in on the city of Washington. The titles appear on the screen, digitally processed as though you were reading them off a computer. Have the Coens made a super spy movie, I wondered, and with that, they had me exactly where they wanted me. Though you wouldn't know it from the way they speak in public, the Coens are big jokers; they like to play with their audiences. They get you thinking one way and then take you in a whole other direction. It's almost like they're laughing at you sometimes but really, they just want you to have as much fun as they seem to be having. And fun is to be had in BURN AFTER READING. After perfecting the art of suspenseful drama with last year's NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, the brothers have returned to more familiar waters for zaniness that is entirely offbeat while still sharp and biting.The premise itself is certainly amusing, if not a little scattered, but it is the top-notch ensemble that solidifies this work as quintessentially Coen-esquire. Regulars like George Clooney and Frances McDormand return as two particularly kooky people who find each other online while pretending to be different versions of themselves. Tilda Swinton and John Malkovich are a married couple on the way to divorce. Both are, to a fault, cold and crazed respectively, as well as formidable performers. Richard Jenkins turns in another self- effacing, understated performance (after this year's THE VISITOR) that should nab him more work with high profile directors. And while all of these performances are top notch and so delightfully exaggerated, it is Brad Pitt that shines brightest for the simple reason that he is entirely ridiculous. Pitt plays Chad Feldheimer, a fitness trainer who has perhaps been running on endorphins for one too many laps, and the only character in this film who isn't pretending to be anything he isn't. This could have a lot to do with his character not being smart enough to pull off disguise but Pitt himself is more than capable. We never quite forget that we're watching Pitt but that's what makes his unbridled exuberance as he bounces around to the music in his headphones so darn funny.Despite the title, nothing actually gets burnt after being read at any point in the film. The act itself though is so dramatic that to name your movie this essentially announces the intended tone. BURN AFTER READING definitely makes good on its promise and has a blast doing it. The Coen Brothers are sitting pretty atop their throne as two of Hollywood's most celebrated filmmakers and their latest plays out almost effortlessly. Even switching over to a new cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki (rather than long time collaborator, Richard Deakins), happens without a beat missed. It's as though they could do all of this in their sleep. Now, that would be one hell of a dream that would make one heck of a good movie. We just have to make sure we can spot the difference between that and the real thing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Average,"Not a top tier Coens' film by any means. A few laughs here and there with John Malkovich being the most enjoyable aspect of the whole thing.The brothers likely needed to do this after making that dark masterpiece No County....only a year before this and it does feel like a throwaway film like The Ladykillers before it, it doesnt ever come together in a satisfying way.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""So, what have we learned?""  well, the Coens know convoluted/cracked comedy for one","And casting, let's not forget that. The Coen brothers, usually writing with specific actors in mind, have placed some of Hollywood's biggest and some of the plain best actors around in parts in Burn After Reading that test them to how far they can take the material before it spontaneously combusts. Maybe it does. While their film does start a little slow, if not too much so, their plot soon requires all of the actors- some Coen regulars big and small, some new- to act stupid, angry, confused, wacko, desperate, going nuts, and generally in characteristic form of a Coen comedy, which is far and beyond a distinct step above a lot of other zany/dark comedies. Thankfully, they all meet the challenge.Burn After Reading is about as convoluted as Alfred Hitchcock lost in a jungle-jim screaming for Mommy while the spiked edges of the metal scrape his noggin. And like Hitchcock, they use star George Clooney for great use as their own quasi-Cary Grant (a friend mentioned that Grant never died, he just became Clooney) as a treasury agent who is having not only an affair with a (now) ex-analyst John Malkovich's wife Tilda Swinton, but with internet-date seeker Frances McDormand. And yet, this is just a small part of the screwy-relationships angle of the picture that unfolds, which includes divorce and not-secret longing and even a home-built chair with a springy dildo.The Coens main concern here, as with Big Lebowski, is just tossing in a plot thread that is about as true a MacGuffin as possible: Malkovich's ex-analyst character starts up his memoirs, and they somehow get on a disc and wind up in the gym locker room at the Hardbodies fitness center, and McDormand and Brad Pitt's dim-witted ""good Samaritan"" character devise a scheme to muck with Malkovich's documents. From here it becomes a ""cluter-fuck"" as one character says (or maybe more than one), and there's a string of paranoia running throughout for Clooney, McDormand, and even Malkovich. And without spoiling anything, mayhem and violence ensue.That last line could also apply to the Coens previous No Country for Old Men, only this time (and not-too-oddly enough this was written off-and-on while that written), in Burn After Reading we soak up all of this with a kind of permission-slip to laugh our heads off. Sometimes it's very dark and nihilistic, and just darn right unexpected- one death especially had me and everyone I was seeing the movie with slack-jawed for a few seconds before suddenly going hysteric for five minutes- but it never really strays from being true to the wacky formula the Coens are used to. This doesn't mean every second will be totally crazy like Raising Arizona, but as it builds it becomes clear it's one of the best of the brothers' comedies, loaded with inspired and cleverly insipid dialog (once again Clooney's character, as in O'Brother, has one certain obsession-tic), and some fine outrageousness. Did I also mention its the funniest work Pitt's done in who knows how long, or that you'll have to stay through the end credits just to be able to laugh at the song?",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Confusing but great comedy,"What do you do when you come across a weird movie with great credentials; a film which you can't quite wrench your way out of? And a movie from the Coens no less... I'm talking about Burn After Reading, and it's probably the best film I've never understood. After making one of the best chase movies ever - and one of the BEST ever movies in any genre - in cinema history, No Country For Old Men, the Coens turned back to comedy; they seem to do this often. And what they also did was typical; they approached some of the best actors in the world and threw them into this great spooks movie. It's as if some demented chef was running a fast food franchise joint, and is convinced it's the best restaurant in the known world. Malkovich, Dormand, Pitt, Clooney, Swinton, J K Simmons and Richard Jenkins deliver a pitch perfect screwball script, and that potent skill base delivers the viewer a richly satisfying comedy.

review,"The 2008 film Burn After Reading is written, produced, edited, and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, is made up of an all-star ensemble cast. It takes place in Langley, Virginia in the early 21st century and although there is no real starring role in the film the entire cast does a great job performing.The Coen brothers are known for their comedies, and this film has some gritty scenes that will definitely get your attention.The plot involves two unconnected threads that become intertwined throughout the film. The theme is Man vs. Himself, and the main characters show what each of their weaknesses is throughout the film. It begins with John Malcovich, as Osbourne ""Ozzy"" Cox, ""quitting"" his job as a CIA analyst because his superiors know he is drinking too much. This leads him to write a tell all memoir about his life and career. Once his wife Katie, TIlda Swinton, finds out about him leaving his job she takes her chance to get a divorce and continue her affair with Harry Pfarer, played by George Clooney. Her attorney advises her to get her husband's financial information and other files, which she puts onto a CD.While leaving Hardbodies Gym, the disc is left on the floor by a law firm employee. Chad Feldheimer, played by Brad Pitt, is a personal trainer, obsessed with body image. He finds the disc and shows it to his co-worker Linda Litzke. Frances McDormand as Linda Litzke, then mistakenly thinks that the bank records and cryptic first draft of Ozzy's memoir on the disc is classified government information. Tracking it back to Osbourne, Linda and Chad decide to give the disc back, but for a price. Linda is desperate for plastic surgery and thinks that this could be the answer. Although Ozzy does not accept their offer, so they then turn the disc over to the Russian Embassy, promising there is more information to follow in return for monetary compensation. The problem is they do not have any more information, so Chad plans to break into Osbourne's house and retrieve more information.Harry Pfarrer, a sex crazed US Marshall, is entangled in many extra-marital affairs with women he's met online, Linda Litzke being one of them. This is how the two story lines connect. While taking his daily run, Harry has also noticed that someone in a dark car seems to be following him everywhere. Meanwhile, Ozzy returns home to find the locks are changed and his bank accounts are whipped out, his wife has making her divorce plans known. He is left to sleep on his boat. Chad is on his mission and once he sees the house is empty he breaks in to the Cox's house. Unfortunately Harry returns to the house to find Chad in the closet, and shoots, kills, and disposes of him, thinking he is the spy that has been following him. He later finds out that his wife has hired a private detective to follow him, because she too is ready for a divorce. He is not the only one having an affair. Harry and Linda met online and meet, later in a discussion she mentions her friend, Chad in missing. After more discussion Harry realizes it is the man he shot, and accuses Linda of being a spy as well.Richard Jenkins, as Ted, knows of Linda's need for more information being sympathetic he decides to break in the Cox's house as well, and look for more information. Ozzy, mad and drunk breaks into his house and finds Ted there. Ozzy shoots him and Ted stumbles out of the house, Ozzy then beats him with a hatchet in the middle on the day, right in front of his house.At CIA headquarters, Ozzy's former manager and his Director, J.K. Simmons, try to understand what happened. Chad and Ted are dead; Ozzy is in a vegetative state and dying after being shot by an agent while attacking Ted. Harry was arrested trying to board a flight to Venezuela, but the CIA Director suggests letting him go. Linda agrees to cooperate in return for the CIA financing her plastic surgery.The central theme of the film is Man vs. Himself. Nothing leads to a man's demise like man himself, and each on the main characters are plagued by one problem or another. Harry struggles with lust, and the need for sexual relationships. He also thinks he is being followed and has major paranoia. Ozzy struggles with his addiction to alcohol, which leads to him losing everything that is important to him. He too deals with paranoia, and that someone is watching. Linda has major body image issues and constantly feels the need to improve herself. She is willing to do almost anything to get the plastic surgeries that she feels she needs. Chad is obsessed with his body image as well, he devotes most of his time to perfecting his body. Ted is a good man, although he is to kind, and sympathetic. This will end up getting him killed. The camera angles in Burn After Reading opens with a theological shot; a Google-Earth's eye view of North America that rapidly zooms in on Langley, Va. The film begins and ends with the Google Maps view of the Earth. There are an abundance of low angles and you are often looking up at the characters. The dark scenes display good shadow detail and an inky black level. This is very important because of the technique Burn After Reading was shot. Things in the foreground tend to look extremely detailed, while the back becomes soft. Osbourne's boat and when Harry is jogging, in the first dusk scene, shows great evidence of the quality transfer.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very Disappointed,"Just voicing my opinion on movies in general, and why I hate this one. Firstly...I see about 50+ films at the theater every year. I love movies. I give many movies too much credit. Some movies are good and some are bad. Unlike the other coen movies that I hate ""Lady Killers"" and of course ""The Hudsucker Proxy""...This film had a great ""pissed off Malcovich"" but other than that I cannot say this film was good at all...in any aspect of film.For Me...these are the elements of a great overall movie. A) Acting - Pitt, Clooney...you guys suck...just come out already. B) Directing - I hate this movie...read C already. C) A good ending - This films ending made the movie a pointless film that should never have been made...making me very angry that I spent actual dollars to see this film.Many people disagree with me, and its my opinion...thanks, but I hate the film ""A Beautiful Mind"" so please just make me feel happy and think back to at least one thing you hated about ""a beautiful mind"" and post a reply.",,Anonymous,Crime

"Burn after Reading is the Coen brothers at their craziest, which means black comedy at its finest and an original story","The Coen brothers does it again, a great and original black comedy-crime film. Burn after Reading is brilliantly written, extremely funny and masterfully directed. The film is written, produced, edited and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. The story follows a recently jobless CIA analyst, Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) whose misplaced memoirs are found by a pair of dimwitted gym employees (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt). When they mistake the memoirs for classified government documents, they undergo a series of misadventures in an attempt to profit from their find. The film also stars George Clooney as a womanizing U. S. Marshal, Tilda Swinton as Katie Cox, the wife of Osbourne Cox, Richard Jenkins as the gym manager, and J. K. Simmons as a CIA supervisor.It was the first movie of the Coen's not to have Roger Deakins as the cinematographer and it kind of shows, but the award nominated Emmanuel Lubezki was the right choice for this film and the cinematography is incredible. I also want to praise the acting in the film, especially Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand, though it isn't the actors best they completely nailed the comedy aspect of the performance, how they executed the witty and smart written dialogue was seriously top notch. George Clooney is another actor who gave a terrific performance, it might not seem that great at first but the character is just so different from what he usually plays. John Malkovich was probably the funniest after Brad Pitt's performance.This isn't Joel and Ethan Coen's best film, but it's a worthy addition to their filmography as it shows how great storytellers and filmmakers they are. The simple plot shouldn't really work but the tone and feeling that their films have but they completely nailed it. Though it is far from perfect, it's still a very entertaining movie with memorable comedic performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Brad Pitt Steals This One Note Film,"BURN AFTER READING (B-) isn't really a spy story nor is it ultimately any kind of commentary on spying or the American history of spying. It's a comedy about broken, self-centered, and moronic people doing selfish and ignorant things that is tangentially related to spy stuff - mostly it's the CIA just kind of watching the idiocy play out. There's some funny moments and performances here, especially by Brad Pitt who steals every scene he's in. In the end however, it's not very compelling, enjoyable, or insightful watching dumb selfish people for an hour and half without either being more of a comedy or more providing a commentary.

A dismissed intelligence officer with alcohol problems, an incomprehensible wish for a cosmetic surgery, the exaggerated imagination of a simpleton and a lost USB-stick with secret service fragments are easily enough to start a chain-reaction into complete chaos which does not even make sense to CIA.In all this chaos to me it is Frances McDormand that stands out with her performance but also Brad Pitt, George Clooney and John Malkovics are quite convincing in their roles as crazy guys, no matter how different their madness may be.I would not have minded having some minutes more of that Coen Washington DC world because with a runtime of 90 minutes the film is a bit short.

The Genius of the Coen Bros. -- at a lesser effort.,"Burn After Reading, simply said, is a story of what happens when paranoia is combined with depression, stress, and/or loneliness.It tells of what happens when something as simple as finding a memoir of a CIA agent can be deadly when handled extremely by the CIA.It tells a story of two very idiotic gym employees who found the memoir and want to use it to their own personal advantages (Linda, who wants her cosmetic surgery paid and Chad, who just want some rewards for finding the CIA's sh*t -- Chad: ""Osbourne Cox? I thought you might be worried... about the security... of your sh*t."") Now, this movie is made out of random, meaningless plot and intersected with some more random, meaningless sub-plots.But, somehow, the meaningless-ness of this movie is what made it genius, I'd say! It explores how normal people would react when this kind of things happened to them (I won't tell you what, you have to see it for yourself). And it is filled with dark humour.But what stands out the most is the acting. It is a cast of big names acting stupid. Which is...good, actually...in a way. It's very confusing, to say the least. You just have to watch it.And the star of this movie is not Clooney, but surprisingly, Pitt. He just shines throughout each scene he's in.

"""The Idiocy of This World""","With their droll, cynical humour, the Coen Brothers have made this triumphant satire on what in the script they call 'the idiocy of this world', which they clearly view as a Ship of Fools. John Malkovich in the latter part of the film screams at someone: 'You are one of the league of morons against whom I have been struggling all my life!' Every character in the film is a member of this League of Morons, and the film itself is an attack on the League of Morons who clearly run the world, especially its governmental so-called 'intelligence' services, which according to the Coen Brothers' view of things should be renamed the Idiocy Services. The only characters in the film who are not total morons from the beginning are John Malkovich and his wife Tilda Swinton. But Malkovich is progressively reduced through unbearable frustration to a state of total idiocy himself, and as Joel Cohen drily remarks in a bonus feature to the DVD: 'Malkovich has embraced his inner knucklehead'. ('Knucklehead', for those unfamiliar with American slang, means 'idiot' or 'fool'.) That leaves the cold and calculating Tilda Swinton as the only person in the film who is theoretically a non-moron, but she has herself been reduced to a parody of an intelligent person who, in order to cope with the welter of idiocy surrounding her, has entirely lost her humanity and become an engine of devouring and despairing egotism. Which leaves no one and nothing to admire, a view of the world apparently held by the Coen Brothers and graphically portrayed in their revolting and disgusting recent film 'No Country for Old Men' (for which see my unfavourable review). This new film, because it is a black comedy, is wholly admirable despite its unremitting cynicism, and it provides many hysterically funny situations and lines of dialogue. As usual with Coen Brothers films, it is brilliantly made, since they are a pair of dark geniuses who flicker eerily like a couple of coal fires glowing side by side in the half-light, chuckling impishly, perhaps devilishly, to themselves. All the actors are spectacularly brilliant. Brad Pitt as a stupid 'jock' with a head of solid bone is simply amazing. Frances McDormand really outdoes herself this time, portraying the insane logic of a total fool hurtling towards  in this case not doom but, ironically, what she wants. It is the others in her path who come to sticky ends. John Malkovich not only embraces his inner knucklehead but does a lot of brilliant acting as well, and leaves us feeling as frustrated as his character is, and ready to stalk along in our underpants too, holding a hatchet with intent to kill. Tilda Swinton is the Ice Queen of All Time, and we really don't want to meet her. George Clooney is a befuddled moron with a coarse beard which surely would have scraped Tilda's face off (?). They are all having a great time, and you can sense the teamwork at every turn and in every scene. Everybody is betraying everybody else, with glee and no conscience or even awareness of what conscience might be. As for the story, well, where does one begin? It almost defies explanation, because it is such a parade of idiocy from beginning to end, but we are rapt with attention and glued to the screen because it is all so amazing, and can people get any stupider than that? The answer is unhesitatingly 'Yes', they can get stupider than that, and even stupider, and the downwards spiral of total idiocy is so devastating that one wants to look away but cannot. What a compelling vision, this time of a side of hell which is hysterically funny, although it portends the doom of us all which a world run by fools will inevitably bring. Can't the Coen brothers do a remake of 'Polyanna' or 'Sound of Music' or something, to dispel their unremitting gloom?",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

They Had It Coming!,"One thing you can bank on with the Coens is that the undeserving still can be bumped off. These are not morality plays. Sometimes the good guys end up slumped in some corner with bullets in their respective heads. Sometimes a person who is inconsequential and likable also ends up in the same place. The thing with these guys is that there is always a strain of unique humor running through the movie. In this case everyone is either moronic, amoral, or stupid. A lot of mistakes are made through misinformation and too quick action. This is the way it is. John Malcovich gets the ball rolling by losing his job (or quitting it). Because he has been a high roller at the State Department, his innocent and inferior memoirs are picked up by a health club trainer (Pitt) who can't think five steps ahead. And then there is the Francis McDormand character who is trying to reinvent herself but needs a bundle of money to get liposuction. The funniest, to me, are the people at the top at the State Department who are watching this maniacal feast and simply let things happen because they don't have a clue what to do. There are three incredibly funny scenes where the lead man has the events explained to him. At one point he tells them not to notify the FBI and instead burn the body.

the shape of things to come,"I must say I admired Coens' cinematic productions up to and including ""Fargo,"" but later found myself bored or unengaged by what they put through to the viewers. Their earlier style was either complete farce or a dark, brooding satire (so to speak) and it was just what the casual moviegoer needed after all those typical romance-and-cigarettes movies of the late 80s/early 90s. I, for one, did. Sadly, this dark element has mysteriously disappeared, to be replaced by an unwelcome doubtlessness. Where earlier movies posed and then withdrew unnerving, deep questions about humanity, mixing human horror (usually death and/or violence) with human idiocy (""I will destroy you!"" and such), the late 90s Coen movie (outside the great ""Big Lebowski"") seemed to veer all the more toward an unreflexive, transparent imagery in which the comic virtually displaced all the tragic. And this was sad. Lackily, there was still enough meat in it all to suggest more good things to come, and I guess we can safely assume ""Burn After Reading"" prophesies a revival of the good old Coens. I certainly wish it does. The movie itself is a little uneven, but even if its form and content are sometimes undecided, it leaves a mark on the viewer. The clash between the (implicitly) unlimited power of today's secret services and the unreality of modern life's casual events produces a very striking image. And the same goes to the cast of characters, which is as disparate as you could ever imagine. Take the comedians: Pitt, McDormand; the tragic actors: Malkovich, Swinton, Clooney (for the most part); and link them through a host of undecided, unrelated, displaced people - like Malkovich's (former) superior in the CIA, or McDormand's employer. The outcome is an explosive mixture, and it is something to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A bad Coen Brothers movie is still better than most other movies.,"If this film weren't identified with the Coens, it might have rated a bit higher, both in my opinion and in the opinions of other reviewers. But the Coens have a lot of talent, making some extraordinary films, and we have come to expect more from them this.BAR is all clever and no polish. The casting is OK, but nothing to brag on. (Most actors would sign-up for a Coens film without giving it much thought or even reading the script.) The acting is about average for the star-power involved, with Pitt (surprisingly) being the stand-out. The cinematography is just ho-hum. Long-time Coens collaborator Deakins is sorely missed. Several of the scenes have a sense of desperation about them that seems out of place. (For example, the scene with ""the chair"" is just not very funny and really doesn't contribute anything to the story or character development. And it seems totally inconsistent with Clooney's character.)The clever plotting and story-line are what save this from being rated much lower. Everything ties together pretty neatly and leaves you feeling smug and self-satisfied. (I think the scenes at the CIA office are priceless.)Recommended for people who enjoy black comedy and clever crime capers, but be warned: BAR seems more like it was written by the Coens and handed over to someone else to direct and edit.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very weak for the Coens,"I was kind of hoping for another brilliant one-two punch after No Country for Old Men, like Fargo and The Big Lebowski, but Burn After Reading has the feel of being written and made quickly and without much refining. Structurally, it's most like Lebowski, in that it's about a bunch of people mixed up in stuff that is beyond them, mostly nobodies finding themselves in a convoluted spy plot. The joke is that no one really knows that it's all much ado about nothing. The story has Frances MacDormand and Brad Pitt finding a CD with what they think is sensitive information on it. They think they can blackmail John Malkovich, to whom they believe the CD belongs. Meanwhile, George Clooney is screwing around with both Malkovich's wife, Tilda Swinton, and MacDormand, while being married to another woman entirely. Unlike Lebowski, Burn After Reading never bothered to involve me, or be very funny, for that matter. Brad Pitt is the only one who really gets laughs. His meeting with Malkovich, most of which you'll have seen in the commercials, was pretty great. Besides the goofy plot, there's nothing here even resembling the Coen Brothers; no stylish cinematography, little repeatable dialogue. Even Carter Burwell's score feels like it was written in an afternoon, and it sounds a lot like an earlier Coens score, I think Barton Fink. It's most likely their least memorable movie, with the possible exception of The Ladykillers.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

All the actors were perfectly cast in their role. Tilda Swinton, John Malkovich, and Coens' regulars Frances McDormand (and surprise, J.K. Simmons) deliver great performances. Standouts, however, are George Clooney (in a huge turnaround from his usual cool persona) and especially Brad Pitt. Pitt gave me the most laughs from anyone else in the film.In short, this is one of the funniest and freshest comedies of 2008, and also the funniest Coens film since ""The Big Lebowski"". Highly recommended for the serious moviegoer in need of a laugh.Overall: 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Burn After Reading: Coen's Bring Imperfect Wackiness,"As September crosses into the present, film critics and aficionados everywhere begin grinning and twitching in excitement. Oscar movies are officially on their way to the nearest silver screen. With the ribbon of quality content being cut, the first expected contender came from the brotherly duo not unfamiliar with the Oscar machine, the Coen Brothers, Joel and Ethan. Fresh off the heels of their Best Directing, Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay Oscars last year for No Country for Old Men, the cinematic brothers brought us a new chapter in their visual memoirs, Burn After Reading, a throwback to the darkly humorous days of Fargo, which also won them a Best Original Screenplay statue. Into the mix of directorial style and writing finesse we gained the acting skills of Brad Pitt, George Clooney, John Malkovich and Tilda Swinton. Frances McDormand is also along for the ride, but she's a Coen staple (and also married to half the duo, Joel Coen). This movie had Oscar potential written all over it, so the only question going in was would it live up to the expectations? Swingthe ball connectsit's going deepalmost thereawww. Ground rule double.This is not an Academy award winning film and certainly not one of their best, but still a nice way to slide into the season of quality content over box office boffo. Burn After Reading is a quirky, silly tale following a disc of information thought to contain CIA secrets from a disgraced and angry analyst (Malkovich), which is found in a local gym and tightly grasped by the hands of a woman (McDormand) desperate for money to cover her plastic surgeries. Mostly what the Coen brothers are known for is the depth and creativity of their characters and this film does well to cover the bases on that point. Frances McDormand plays Linda, a terribly pathetic woman so deathly afraid of aging and the current state of her body that she has blinders on to the rest of the world and the happiness it can offer. She brings the solid level of commitment and shine we've come to know her for. Brad Pitt joins in with what has to be his silliest and least intelligent character to date, Chad, a constantly hyper-active, exercise fanatic who works with Linda at a gym called Hardbodies. I have to imagine this was a fun role for him to play since he hardly gets to let loose like this anymore, not since 12 Monkeys. He provided a lot of the early humor in the film, but also drops one of the biggest plot twists halfway through. Clooney brings to life Harry, a ex-personal bodyguard with a penchant for compulsive lying and an addiction to sex. George only gets to be this wacky under the tutelage of the Coen brothers, so even while it's not his best work by any means, it's a fun reminder that he can indeed get goofy with the rest of the gang. Tilda plays the ice queen wife of Malkovich, while also having an affair with Clooney. Watching her in this role, along with some others, I wonder when her picture will be included in the dictionary next to ""emasculating"". Not to be left out of any discussion about over-the-top characters, Malkovich plays his part to the hilt, but I honestly feel his best moments are in the opening scene. There's not much of an arc for him, so only seeing him come to life early on really provides any surprise and unseen moments.Burn plays inside the footprints of Fargo, but never quite catches up to it. The Coens obviously know their craft and continue to put material out there with their own voice and character stamp, but this film felt a little like a step back for them. Maybe it was just a way to resettle into the dark comedy they are known for after their detour into heavy drama with No Country. Also running parallel to this is the question of the marketing campaign. Again the trailer was cut in a fashion to show one type of movie, but once you were in the theater it became something different, not wildly so, but still there is a distinct shift in tone from wacky comedy to dark comedy, and sometimes those audiences don't mix well. It's like seeing a trailer for Police Academy and getting Rushmore. Two great tastes that taste awful together.Recommendation: If you're a devout fan, you've already seen it anyway. If you're on the fence, wait until video. If you're completely on the other side of the fence, you still read this far anyway? I'll take that as a compliment. Thanks. :)",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Probably the funniest comedy of '08!,"Burn After Reading is the Coen Brothers returning to what they do best, comedy. After the superb No Country for Old Men, the two brothers decided that for their next project they'd do a wacky and fun screwball comedy, and it paid off very well. The film is very funny and entertaining; like previous Coen Brother's comedies it is filled with dark humor and quirky, yet likable characters. If you asked what the film was about, I'd have to say nothing really; it's really just a movie about a bunch of idiots who are somehow connected in a plot that turns out to mean absolutely nothing, but that's what makes it all the more hilarious.The Coen Brothers did a superb job directing, and their screenplay was as tight as always. Of course it is the acting from this stellar A-List cast that makes the film such a joy to watch, in particular the performances by Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand steal the show in practically each scene that they're in.Overall if you're a fan of previous Coen Brother's comedies you'll love this film, and even if you have never seen a Coen Brother's comedy, but like dark humor, you'll love this film. It is easily the best comedy of the year.A perfect 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another Win for the Coens,"An alcoholic, terminated CIA agent (John Malkovich) decides to write his memoirs. His wife, who is cheating on him with another federal agent (George Clooney), accidentally steals the memoir when she is retrieving the couple's financial records. This disc, due to the negligence of a law clerk, then falls into the hands of two fitness trainers (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt), one of whom is also sleeping with the adulterous federal agent. From there, mayhem and blackmail ensue.Can the Coen Brothers make a bad film? I mean, I suppose the answer is yes. But I have yet to see one. Without skipping a beat, they go from a serious Oscar-winning drama (""No Country For Old Men"") to a silly, effective comedy. And they excel in both genres equally well. I think some people may have been let down by ""Burn"" because they expected another Oscar film, but these people missed the point.The plot is so intertwined (not unlike past Coen films, like ""The Big Lebowski"") that trying to figure out what's going on and who is working for who is half the fun. And every character has their idiosyncrasies, making them each unique and funny in their own way. Being able to write such a script and plot is a gift, and the fact they've done this successfully multiple times really makes me feel that the Coens are going to go down as some of the greatest creators of their generation.Fans of ""The Big Lebowski"" will like this one. The style is similar, and the cast is amazing: Pitt, Clooney and Malkovich? You really have to be a cynical person to not be interested in this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Coens Rushed This Film,"After a disc containing the memoirs of a recently fired CIA analyst ends up in the hands of two dim wits who work at a gym, they go around trying to sell it thinking it contains important classified CIA stuff.The Coen brothers are taking a different shift from last years highly praised ""No Country For Old Men"" and going back into their comedy genre in which they seem to excel at. Here is a film that is full of characters that do stupid things, at yet we still seem to like them. Even when they are hacking away at other people. While ""Burn After Reading"" is a decent film, the entire project feels rushed and the ending too forced. It's as if they had no other way of ending the film, so they tack on the wrap up job.The film opens with the firing of John Malkovich, because he seems to be an alcoholic. We are introduced to his wife, Tilda Swinton, who is having an affair with George Clooney. Clooney is also married, but is not satisfied with just those two women, so he begins dating Francis Macdormand. She has been trying to find love online with no luck. Her co-worker, Brad Pitt, finds the disc with the CIA stuff and they both begin to blackmail Malkovich. Somehow these stories intertwine with each other in a dark and humorous manner.Everyone involved seems to be having fun. Brad Pitt and George Clooney are specially funny in their roles. One as a young, gum-chewing, doofus. The other as a paranoid treasurer who decides to build a very unique chair. Both Clooney and Pit are playing against type. Which is nice to see from such big A list actors, in a comedy anyway.McDormand is another one to watch. She seems to slide into this role perfectly, nailing every bit of dialogue that comes out of her mouth. It seems natural, even though most of the dialogue is not. Malkovich is the alcoholic CIA analyst who is mentally breaking down. Losing his job, cheating wife and other things. This character is dragged through the mud until he decides to explode. Malkovich plays it with a sense of integrity. An upper class way of presenting himself, much like how he portrayed himself in ""Being John Malkovich."" Tilda Swinton seems to have the cold hearted bitch role down pat.For those expecting a laugh out loud comedy, you'll be really disappointed. ""Burn After Reading"" is a slow moving film. It wasn't until half way through did it really start to kick up and peak my interest. There are a couple bits that are really funny, and others then just seem out of place. Don't expect it all to but fluffy funny stuff, this is a dark film. It is a Coen film after all.J.K. Simmons has a small role as a CIA supervisor who has no idea as to what is going on with these character. The audience feels the same way. While it's not entirely hard to follow, some people may have some problems with it. I guess that could have been there intention, especially with how they ended the film.While ""Burn After Reading"" is good, it's not Coen good and that may disappoint some fans. But the film is basically about stupid people doing stupid things, done in an intelligent way. The film has a few surprises, I was caught off guard at least twice. I just hope they put more time and effort into their next project.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Burn After Reading: Blurred after Seeing,"Another Coen Brothers comedy of who is screwing who? Maybe, but more to the point this is an example of a 90 minute string film, with a missing 30 minuets. Is this flick funny, yes, not as funny all the time, but very funny, at times. It is really a stoner film, disguised as a short FARGO. Too much information is given out without enough, ending plot. The film opens and closes with an aerial view of The Pentagon. Possibly to give an air of finality or complete misunderstanding. The story line is about how so many people, can enjoy being screwed, either from the vantage point of prey or predator. As with all Coen Brother films, this one is full of A-Star Power. Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) a philandering husband, Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) an exercise employee who is one of Clooney's bed mates. Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) a recently unemployed CIA agent who is married to Doctor Katie Cox (Tilda Swanton) who is also screwing Mr. Clooney. Then there is Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) who gets a real screwing by Mr. Clooney, completely by accident. There are many point of view shots in this film, that causes the audience to question, why? Is the audience supposed to view each point of view shot as a separate but very important point in the film, each time this scenario shows itself on screen? One must decide this question for oneself, or maybe just e-mail the Coen Brothers. Seeing the film as a screener, allowed this reviewer not to get screwed, by evening movie prices. My vision and my viewing pleasure of this film were both blurred, after seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Profanities, dark humor and surprises, yes, but where are the big laughs?","Well, I watched the film today, and I guess I will be one of the rare ones on this board that didn't like the movie.It's a disappointment.Maybe it's because I went to the movie looking for laughs. I didn't get them, so did the rest of the audience in the theater. Brad's character is there to provide some slapstick humor but hey, Brad isn't Jim Carrey and can never be him. He looks awkward in the film sometimes. There are pretty much profanities in the film, the F-word, sexual humor and bad morals etc, but since everyone and everything are so ridiculous and ironic in the film and that profanities are pretty much acceptable in this type of films, so no problems here. It's just that I felt the F-word seems to repeat too frequently that it seemed a little forced and deliberate. The killings are shockers, they are pretty good, it's just that no one laughed. Maybe the audience in the theater where i am in just ""didn't get it"" or maybe it's just that they did not think brutal killings are funny. Period.The best thing in the film has got to be the couple of scenes of the clueless CIA superior and his subordinate. They are absolutely hilarious. The Russians second them. The score is so ironic when applied to the film. It is pretty helpful to stimulate laughter, it's good. And the trailer has got to be the next best thing. It certainly looks great, it gives away most of the funniest parts in the film and idiotic Brad definitely comes as a surprise and is so much funnier in the trailer than in the film.On the whole it's still a pretty enjoyable film, though nobody quite get the laughs but at least it sustained my interest because I for one, will want to know what the hell is going on in the film. It's an okay dark comedy, but if you are going for big laughs AND you are the type of person who don't find brutal killings funny no matter how they are carried out, be prepared to be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Read After Burning,"The Coen brothers are back with another hilarious and original movie, 'Burn After Reading'. This movie has a similar sense of humour to 'Fargo' and 'The Big Lebowski' rather than 'Intolerable Cruelty'. Like their other movies, the characters are quirky, they find themselves in 'ordinary' circumstances with unusual consequences as paths cross and one of them has their way. With a cast like John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton, George Clooney, J.K. Simmons, Brad Pitt, Richard Jenkins and Frances McDormand, 'Burn After Reading' certainly does not fall short in the acting department but it is Frances McDormand who steals the show as fitness instructor who is obsessed with cosmetic surgery (in order to 'reinvent' herself). The opening sequence hints a spy thriller but once we land into the world of the absurd characters. Pretty much all the lead characters are obsessed with their image. The dialogues are laugh-out-loud funny. The humour is very dry (it might not appeal to all). The plot follows a steady pace and closes with a solid end. Many seem to object with the ending but I couldn't think of anything better. Secret actions have disastrous consequences.",,Anonymous,Crime

Burn After Reading is another unique Coen Brothers movie that provides some amusements,"After two weeks of suffering the effects of Hurricane Gustav, I called my friend and we agreed to see another movie at the theatre he works at. We agreed on this one since I was interested in seeing another Coen Brothers film and my friend was interested in seeing Brad Pitt. Pitt was perhaps the most enjoyably funny character here especially when he does one of his dance moves (my friend always says ""Go Brad! whenever that happens). And we also laughed out loud at the contraption that George Clooney made that he showed to Frances McDormand. The best parts for me, however, was the dialogue between the C.I.A. agents David Rasche and J.K. Simmons concerning the whole plot of this movie especially when Simmons says to tell him when all this makes sense! That seems to be the whole point that nothing makes complete sense. (In fact, knowing Joel and Ethan's sense of humor, I didn't really expect that!) And how hilarious was it seeing Pitt and McDormand's ""blackmail"" call to John Malkovich has to be one of the most absurd moments ever on film! The scenes with Tilda Swinton aren't as memorable as those of the other actors but she has some moments. In all, if you're a Coen Brothers fan, you should definitely seek out Burn After Reading.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Malkovich, McDormand, and Pitt are magnificent","It's a CIA comedy set in the 2000s in Washington, D. C., based on a confusion of characters searching for love, except for one dim-witted guy. Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) is a low-level CIA analyst who quits his job rather than accept demotion. His former boss is Palmer Smith (David Rasche), who reports to the Director (J. K. Simmons). Osbourne is married to Dr. Katie Cox (Tilda Swinton), a cold, controlling woman whose eyes are looking elsewhere. Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) is a U. S. Marshall, but mostly a desk jockey. He's married to children's book writer Sandy PFarrer (Elizabeth Marvel).The three other main characters work for a Hardbodies fitness club. Ted (Richard Jenkins) is the manager, and Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) and Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) are two of his staff.The plot follows the discovery of lost digital records on a CD in the fitness club and Linda and Chad's efforts to make money out of what they assume are highly secret CIA files. The marital hijinks and unexpected relationships lead to chaos and misunderstanding that only the CIA can ignore.""Burn After Reading"" is hilarious. The quirky characters that the Coen brothers always create are abundant here, especially Malkovich, McDormand, and Pitt. The humor is earthy and profane. There are two deaths, but they're not dwelt upon. The story pace is excellent in this 96-minute film. If you like the Coen brothers, this is a must.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Oh my f'ck!"", WTF happened?","After commercial and critical smash No Country For Old Men took the country by storm last year, the Coen Brothers had thrust themselves into the land of very high expectations for their follow up, which, admittedly, couldn't be more different. Their latest film featuring a stellar cast is unfortunately not as stellar as the performers. I found it to be frustrating and predictable, although well written and well acted. Maybe I just didn't like it and I'm missing all the 'charm' that is giving it the Oscar Buzz...wait, that's just Brad Pitt.Pitt is the shining star here, there's no doubt about it. If it weren't for the fact that he has the smallest role in the film in terms of importance and screen time, he'd be a shoe-in for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Now that doesn't seem as likely, although he more than deserves it. Pitt is off the wall hilarious, inventive, wild, thoughtful, and flat out irresistible. This marks a change from his darker performances, like Fight Club or Seven, and his charming performances, like in the Ocean's trilogy and Mr. & Mrs. Smith.The rest of our cast is exciting as well. George Clooney plays a sort of hybrid of his ladies' man & idiotic characters, though I think the character was more paranoid than stupid. He did a great job as well. John Malkovich and Frances McDormand are great as well, with the latter being lovably hyper and stupid, and the former putting on a great show as far as the humor of insanity goes. Malkovich's understanding of the script and tone of the film is wonderful.And that's about where my applause for the film stops. There are no technical problems with the film, as it is a well made film, although I felt the film dragged a bit in the beginning, taking far too long to get going. In fact, the plot of the film isn't established until about 35 minutes in, if that. It also felt far too long in terms of runtime, when in reality it was quite short. I also have problems with the predictability of the film, which is unusual considering the film is the brainchild of the Coen Brothers. I successfully predicted plot twists, character deaths, and the overall ending of the film before it happened, and felt a bit of a slap to the face by the ending.In short, Burn After Reading represents a sprinter running at the top of his game, only to trip and tumble, stopping just short of the finish line. While the acting and idea are nice, in the end, it just didn't do the job as far as keeping me interested and invested in terms of emotion or attention.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Coen bros provide an antidote to spydom,"Yes, this movie is a lesser Coen Bros movie, the story hardly makes sense, the characters are mostly idiots and the human race is in general treated with contempt, but that didn't stop me enjoying it. The Coens simply don't employ bad actors, though Brad Pitt went beyond his range a bit as one of two airhead gym employees (the other is played by Frances McDormand) who try to blackmail a former CIA operative. That operative is played, all stops out, by John Malkovich, and his icy wife by Tilda Swinton. Her lover is played by George Clooney, being a real sleaze for once. There is also a wonderful cameo by JK Simmons as a CIA bigwig which probably does that organisation more damage than the Bay of Pigs invasion. As this character says, the story doesn't make sense, but if you stick around (the film is only 90 minutes long) you will be treated to some pretty subversive comedy and a feast of good acting. I happen to see this film the day after ""A quantum of solace: the Coen Brothers are a good antidote to the idiocies of the spy genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

No classic but highly enjoyable nevertheless,"The relative failure of ""Burn After Reading"" after the phenomenal and Oscar-winning success of ""No Country for Old Men"" says more, I think, of audience and critical expectations than it does of the Coens. It will certainly disappoint anyone expecting them to top ""No Country ..."", nor does it measure up to anything like their best work. It may move in much the same ball-park as ""The Big Lebowski"", but without that movie's wit or ingenuity and while the language may lack the consistency of their finer turns of phrase, (a proliferation of profanities is the order of the day here), it's still sharp enough and funny enough to draw you in and keep you entertained. Whether that's down to the Coens or the top-notch cast they've assembled is a moot point. Nevertheless, it remains a highly enjoyable piece of nonsense, splendidly played by splendid players relishing their every corny line.The plot is one you could write on a pin-head and is daft enough to give the impression it's being made up as you go along. John Malkovitch is a CIA operative who is being put our to pasture. Tilda Swinton is the wife who is divorcing him in favour of George Clooney. Malkovitch is writing his memoirs; Swinton is building up a portfolio of their assets. There is a disc which gets left in a gym and which is found by a very dumb Brad Pitt who automatically assumes it contains state secrets and tries to blackmail Malkovitch. It doesn't! Frances McDormand is involved too, with Pitt in the blackmail scheme, (she's the 'brains' - I don't think so), and romantically with Clooney. A couple of people get killed, shockingly, as violence is something these people seem incapable of, (everyone's too dumb to be violent).It fairly zips along and like I say, it's splendidly played. By now Clooney has become a first-rate farceur. McDormand has always been a gifted comedienne. Malkovitch goes magnificently over-the-top and Tilda Swinton has a field day playing it mostly straight but with her tongue lodged firmly in her cheek. The real revelation, however, is Brad Pitt as the clumsy blackmailer. In the past Pitt's comic prowess has been somewhat lacking. A continually improving dramatic actor, Pitt has always seemed uncomfortable tackling comedy but here he's on a roll. It takes a keen intelligence to pull off someone as delightfully stupid as Pitt's character, Chad and it's obvious he's having as much fun playing him as we are having watching him.The film, itself, is no classic, (it's not even classic Coen Brothers), but it's very likable and I have a feeling that it might even improve with age. Aficionados of the Brothers Coen will definitely want to add it to their collection.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A good movie but not a great one.,"A good movie. A clever movie. A great movie? No way. Not even close. The movie has a muddled story and is not particularly humorous. BUT there is one aspect of this movie that saves it from DVD oblivion - the stellar performance of John Malkovich. Mr. Malkovich makes this movie work. He is actually FUNNY. This cannot be said for the other performers. Was Frances McDormand funny? NO. Brad Pitt? NO. By the way, he was not the Brad Pitt of Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Troy, two movies in which he excelled. Brad Pitt playing a buffoon is an example of flagrant miscasting. Nevertheless the actors give strong performances and the story does offer an interesting take on the nature of bureaucracy and human irrationality. There are movies in which casting top stars as goofy, cartoon-like characters work, but this is not one of those movies. Casting Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, Dan Ackroyd, Bill Murray, Jack Black, Eddie Murphy, Ben Stiller, or Steve Carell as buffoons can generate laughs with the right material but comedic acting can fall flat with the wrong cast and in this movie, with the exception of Mr. Malkovich, it falls flat.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"It's a hilarious movie about stupid people, and we'll leave it at that","The Coen Brothers are at it again! After taking home the Best Picture award at the Oscars for last year's No Country For Old Men, everybody was holding their breath to see what the Coens would do next. Well it's here, it's got an ensemble A-list cast, a loopy plot full of blackmail and espionage, and an offbeat brand of humor. Sounds like the Coens to me.Burn after Reading is about an ex-CIA agent named Osborne Cox (John Malkovich), who after quitting his job decides to write a revealing memoir about his past in the CIA. However his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton), who is cheating on him with the paranoid Federal Marshal Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), finds his memoir, burns it onto a CD, and ends up losing it by leaving it at a public gym. It is here where two quirky gym employees, Linda Litzke (Frances Mcdormand) and Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt), find the CD, and also Osborne's phone number and address. The pair decide to blackmail Osborne into giving them 50,000 dollars if he ever wants the CD back, otherwise they threaten to give it to the Russian Embassy. As all 5 of these morons get further and further into their little web of blackmail, greed, and deceit. Nobody seems to notice the severe consequences waiting for them just around the corner.Burn after Reading is really not a film that relies too heavily on its plot, since it just gets more and more idiotic as it goes along. This film relies more on its stupid characters and all the immoral, self centered hi-jinks they get into. Which they could have avoided had they just acted a little smarter. I am not saying Burn after Reading was a stupid film, I'm saying it was a very good movie about stupid people, stupid morals, stupid decisions, and frankly just downright stupidity. These characters are all perfectly cast and every single character has their moment (or moments). John Malkovich is excellent as a very angry guy, who begins to just hate everybody and everything. George Clooney is funny as a paranoid, sex addicted weirdo who cheats on his wife every chance he gets. Frances Mcdormand also gives a standout performance as a woman who needs lots of money, because she feels she needs plastic surgery and rhinoplasty to make herself look beautiful. However the real scene-stealer here is Brad Pitt as a flamboyant gym trainer who is obsessed with his ego. In one scene his character tries to smart talk Osborne over the phone by pretending to sound like a secret agent, but really just ends up repeating Osborne's name over and over again. It's scenes like this that really give this movie its comedic flavor.I have never seen a movie that goes this far with such idiot characters. However that is really what makes Burn after Reading a memorable film. Nobody acts with intelligence, everybody is self centered, absolutely nothing is at stake, and almost everybody gets hurt in some way by the end over nothing. There are a few scenes involving two CIA agents trying to figure out what exactly these people were actually trying to do, and they simply just have no idea, and neither do we. I can barely explain anything about this movie without using the word stupid in every sentence, which I'm sure you've noticed. So we'll just leave it at this: It's a hilarious movie about stupid people, and that's just about it. I give it a 3.5 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Crazy story,"Chasing big money by trying to sell no info can be really frustrating and also very funny. Yes I did laugh. But to me what a waste of good talent, I'm sure b grade actors would have managed just as well to get a good result. I certainly did not share the buzz some found in it. And I was a little surprised to see such heavy and intended language. Oh Adult it is! So I imagine that is how we hope our kids will become adult in their time ( i guess that they would need to reach this age first)! Yes I was aware it was a spoof, but going down the gutter with it because it's fashionable , it's nothing smart for me. We all deplore the bad language yet most of us. I'm not prudish and do curse more than my share. But it does not please me to get it in film. Perhaps I need to do an adult course to realise what it is exactly.",,Anonymous,Crime
Funny and neat work from the Coens. A nice concept of mixing the plot and intersecting it with complex characters.,"Certainly this Coen brothers comedy ""Burn After Reading"" will not be no Oscar winner like their previous effort ""No Country for Old Men"", but still the direction and over the top funny story makes this offbeat film one to watch. Many may see this as a spoof crime caper type and in many ways it is as it involves a plot of hidden info and the CIA. Plus for commercial success the all-star cast makes it watchable as each portray interesting characters with different attitudes who's lives intersect with a CD-ROM. John Malkovich is Osborne Cox a recently canned CIA agent who's down on his luck as his relationship with his pediatrician wife the classy and elegant Katie(Oscar winner Tilda Swinton)is about to go up into flames. As on the side Katie is seducing womanizer and federal government employee Harry Dfarrer(George Clooney).So the film has already introduced some complex characters now enter the big plot and theme of the movie two dim-witted fitness gym employees(Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand) come across one of Mr. Cox's old CD-ROM disc of classified information from his CIA days. Then one by one this film presents a fun to watch hoot of mishap and adventures as you see how each conflicted character is drawn together over a simple little disc of information as in the end each life has been shaped differently. Pretty good work from the Coens as the theme and concept was neat and funny even though it may not be a critical success the star power of Pitt, Clooney, McDormand, Malkovich, and Swinton will make it a commercial success. So to sum it up it's a pretty good feel good film to watch that you will have fun with.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Another smart and well done film by the Coen Brothers... OK, let's face it, these guys are geniuses","I mean, we see a film that has the Coen Brother's name on it, it's usually going to equal gold, these guys have brought us some pretty amazing movies, like Fargo, The Big Lebowski and of course the latest classic that won best picture No Country for Old Men. They now bring us Burn After Reading, basically a movie about how the most average people can be really stupid. Let me put to you this way, imagine the dumb jock who thinks that he's smart and can pull something as far as trying to blackmail the CIA into giving him money, oh yeah, I know, right? But the reason why the Coen Brothers make such memorable films, their odd ball characters, I mean they know how to tell a story, but their characters are what make the film so memorable... just look at Fargo: Marge Gunderson... The Big Lebowski: The Dude... and No Country for Old Men: Anton Chigurh, who takes this movie? Tough call to say right now, but I have to say the underdog in this movie is played by John Malkovich.The movie starts with CIA agent Osborne Cox who just got canned from his job and he goes home, not exactly heaven, his wife is horrible and cold, she's cheating on him. she's cheating with a man, Harry Pfarrer, who is married and is just cheating with everyone possible, including a woman, Linda Litzke, who along with her gym trainer co-worker, Chad Feldheimer is framing Cox for a CD of his memoirs that has information that the CIA wouldn't like the public to get their hands on. Linda wants money for her cosmetic surgery and gets Chad, who's screws aren't exactly tightened, and they play a game they shouldn't play with the CIA, blackmail.Burn After Reading is a very smart and intelligent comedy, I was very impressed with how well told it was and the acting is just as usual nothing short of greatness. We have an A-list cast that truly delivers, both Brad and George bring some humor to this technically dark tale, but like I said, the performance I found most impressive was John Malkvich, I haven't seen him in anything in a bit, so it was nice to see him perform and do a fantastic job as well. His scene with Brad Pitt in the car where Brad is trying to play bad cop with him is so memorable and delivers a great laugh. Burn After Reading is definitely a must see in the theater, like I said before, I mean, it's the Coen Brotehrs, need I say more? Well, I'm sure we've forgotten their little mistake by now, like The Lady Killers, so go ahead and enjoy their new treasure Burn After Reading.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Coens and Game Cast Have a Blast in Screwball Paranoia Comedy,"Winning Oscars hasn't kept Joel and Ethan Coen from their tradition of switching back and forth between comedies and dramas. The brothers have followed up the brilliant Western noir NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN with the funnier, less bloody but no less wickedly anarchic BURN AFTER READING (BAR), reuniting actors who've worked together in and out of previous Coen Brothers movies. Set in Washington, DC and environs (portrayed by New York and New Jersey), BAR is a screwball paranoia comedy about people who work in intelligence, pitted against people who lack intelligence. :-) When Osborne Cox (John Malkovich, proving he fits right in with the Coens' loopy repertory company) loses his CIA job, he decides to write his memoirs. A disk is found at the Hardbodies Gym with what ditsy trainer Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) suspects is ""sensitive s**t"" belonging to Cox, building a chain of nutzoid misunderstandings, violence, and other paranoia-fueled shenanigans. Those drawn into the insanity include Chad's co-worker Linda Litzke (the ever-wonderful Frances McDormand, her blue-green eyes communicating as much as her dithery yet determined voice. She has the same hairdo as Javier Bardem in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, but it looks better on McDormand :-)), hoping to finance her extreme plastic surgery makeover by getting money from Cox; reward or blackmail, it's all the same to Linda and Chad. (Without giving away too much, love-starved Linda ends up an unwitting femme fatale, in every sense of the term.) Then there's womanizing Treasury agent Harry Pfarrar (George Clooney, doing a frantic comic version of his Oscar-winning SYRIANA role), a man who needs to run after sex (literally and figuratively) to stay in a good mood and is never without an oddball choice of words: ""I have lactose reflux...Does that contain shell food?""; Tilda Swinton as Katie, Cox's tightly-wound pediatrician wife; Richard Jenkins as Ted Treffon, Hardbodies' manager, who's secretly in love with the clueless, self-absorbed Linda; and J.K. Simmons and David Rasche as CIA men who have to sort out the increasingly crazy mess. The whole cast is terrific, but if anybody steals the show, it's Brad Pitt with his two-tone hair and smilingly bumbling attempts at extortion. Like our household faves Max Von Sydow and Anjelica Huston, Pitt knows when to have fun with a role, and his delight in playing Chad is infectious. Even BAR's little details are a hoot, like Cox hiding out on his houseboat and keeping in shape by exercising to FitTV's GILAD'S BODIES IN MOTION (I've used the show to further my own fitness efforts :-)); Harry singing ""My Eyes Adored You"" and ""Born Free"" in the shower (alas, we only see this from the viewpoint of Chad, who's hiding in the closet :-)); and Linda using the (fictional) romantic comedy COMING UP DAISY, starring Dermot Mulroney and Claire Danes, as a litmus test for the dates she meets online. (There's even footage of Mulroney urging the unseen Daisy to get down from a tree. Maybe Mulroney did it as a favor to his buddy Pitt.) Between his affairs and 5-mile runs, Harry finds time to be a hobbyist; without spoiling anything, I can only say the contraption he builds gets my vote for Best Performance by an Inanimate Object! :-)",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mileage,"It's interesting that the Coens chose this film after the barnburner that was Old Country. To catch the trickle down crowd with a piece that makes fun of the very part of the crowd that trickles down - that's real courage.Burn After Reading condescends, but meta-textually. And Brad Pitt is a big give-away that this is exactly what the Coens are doing. He's amusing enough to keep the non-Coen audience entertained, but hollow enough to obviate the underlying theme. You just got mocked, average America. But the Coen take on average America cuts a wide-swath - it even includes us, the Princeton (equivalent) educated who think that we're artists because we like a good film but what do we ever really do - write a few pages of memoir as cliché (see our user comments) and wander around with a drink in our hands (how many movies have you watched this week?).Nice. Don't get me wrong - I think that it's great. The Coens have successfully skewered, and they've gotten away with it.

Fun Movie,"Saw this with my 50-year-old mom and it had us both laughing. Took a while to get started but once the plot got going, the movie's tongue-in-cheek humor had the theater splitting a gut. Brad Pitt was the most memorable character in the movie, stole every scene he was in - I just wish there were more of them! George Clooney could have done more with his character. He seemed to play a rather flat cheating husband, without really giving us his motivation. Malkovich was his typical brilliant self, and I found myself feeling sorry for him, until the end of the film of course. The Coen Brothers' ability to move between a dark movie like ""No Country..."" to a smart, funny movie like this says a lot about their skill as filmmakers, and is the reason why people will go see their movies no matter the genre.

Burn After Reading,"Ever since 1984, the Coen brothers have made a career out of portraying naive characters caught in a tangled web of deceit, adultery, jealousy, ignorance, corruption, and stupidity, finding themselves in way over their heads, and typically resulting in their grisly deaths. Burn After Reading is no exception. The tone of this film is dramatically different than last year's spectacular No Country for Old Men, and many people expecting more of the same will inevitably be disappointed by this film. Before viewing this film, you should abandon all preconceived notions you may have based on the extremely misleading trailer, and simply walk into the theater prepared for a little bit of escapism. This film is not designed to be a serious masterpiece; that's not what it's after. Burn After Reading takes quite a while to rev up, and, quite frankly, the beginning feels very un-Coen-esquire and disappointing. Once Frances McDormand appears on the screen, the film begins to show it's potential. As it progresses, it becomes exponentially more original and involving, and four of the characters here do manage to shine, albeit some taking longer than others to do so.The crux of the story centers around some gym workers who discover the personal writings and personal information of a CIA analyst recently forced into early retirement. The gym workers naturally assume they've stumbled upon classified material, and attempt to blackmail the analyst, setting off a wacky chain of events in which the ignorant blackmailers find themselves in way over their heads, dragging others into the situation, with inevitably disastrous consequences for all involved. The aforementioned four characters are played by Frances McDormand as a self-conscious gym trainer, Brad Pitt as her flamboyant and surprisingly un-annoying coworker, Richard Jenkins as the shy gym manager, and George Clooney in a strangely amusing role where no occupation seems to be required. Many of the other actors involved fall flat most of the time, including the usually good Tilda Swinton, whose two-dimensional character I could not appreciate very much. John Malkovich has an interesting role as the CIA analyst, but I feel they could have done so much more with this character; his last appearance in this film shows off this character's potential very well, it's just too bad that's his only great moment.Burn After Reading portrays every last one of its characters as leading secret lives, driven by lustful and greedy intentions, manipulating those around them, and generally making life difficult for everyone involved in this tangled web. The film interestingly clues its audience in to the major points of the plot, such that we know what the main characters do not for the majority of the time, but interestingly throws in some side plots in which we, as audience members, are totally clueless. While these side gags are often rich in suspense, their payoffs are a mixed bag, serving primarily as distractions, though at times hilarious ones.As mentioned before, this film is largely designed to be ""fun,"" and makes NO promise that it will be this year's Oscar winner for Best Picture. Could it be? To me it's highly unlikely, unless the Academy is so enamored of the Coen brothers that they fail to recognize that this film is nowhere near as involving as No Country for Old Men, and that the plot, dialogue, characters, and setting is nowhere near as inspired as that in Fargo. But you have to hand it to the Coen brothers for having the courage to have a little fun once in a while. The last line in the film sums up the ambiguity of this film perfectly. I can give this film a recommended viewing, but just note that my recommendation is not as enthusiastic as it could be. If you read this review and think it sounds like a film you would be interested in, by all means go and watch it in theaters.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A funny entry from the Cohens,"Following on the coat tails of their recent Oscar winner, No Country for Old Men, the creative film-making partnership of the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, return to somewhat more familiar territory with their most recent film, Burn After Reading, a comedy in their dark, twisted style. Burn After Reading is not one of the Coen's outstanding efforts, but it is more than amusing enough to warrant a recommendation.Burn After Reading starts it's focus on Oswald Cox (John Malkovich), a CIA analyst who has been reassigned from his position, for, among other things a ""drinking problem"". Infuriated with this decision, Oswald resigns from the CIA, annoying his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton), and providing the catalyst for her to finally seek out a divorce so she can be with her lover, Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney). Oswald decides to begin writing some memoirs in his now ample spare time, a disc copy of which is inadvertently left in the ladies locker room at a local gym, where it is discovered by Linda Lytzke (Frances McDormand) and her co- worker Chad (Brad Pitt). They decide to use the disc to blackmail Oswald for a significant sum of money so that Linda can pay for cosmetic surgery she so desperately wants.Burn After Reading can more or less be defined as a comedy, although in some ways it is not presented as one. Carter Burwell's score gives the film a generally serious tone, and the Cohen's are not afraid of taking chances that almost no other comedy would even think of doing. That being said, Burn After Reading is a pretty funny film, although it takes a little while for it to get going. There are some chuckles early in the running time, but this is one of those films that you have to build a bit before the laughs really start coming, and by the end, you are hooked.Much of the film's humor is provided by Brad Pitt in a somewhat out of type performance as dim-bulb personal trainer Chad. His endless preening, and over-the-top exuberance make for many a laugh in the film. George Clooney is also quite funny as sleazy ladies man Harry, who is a mixture or narcissism and infantilism, and Frances McDormand provides a number of amusing scenes a enhancement obsessed Linda.Burn After Reading is definitely a film that fits in the Cohen's oeuvre, similar in tone to their Intolerable Cruelty and Raising Arizona, although not quite as funny as either of those films. Even so, Burn After Reading still provides a considerable number of laughs and is a notch above many other comedies, making Burn After Reading worth a trip to the multiplex.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Slightly funnier than I thought,"Now that I've watched at least ten Coen films, and seen them at least twice each, I feel inclined to draw conclusions about the oeuvre. A friend of mine in the film business told me that it's the director who makes the film. The actor may sell the film, since people often just want to see him/her. But the ultimate merit of a film depends on the writer. This is where the Coens may be lacking. Their scripts are said to be extremely well-prepared before shooting. But that doesn't necessarily mean they contain any substance. Coen films can give an impression of having been thrown together in the form of several episodic cameos, compelling or amusing, but somehow lacking unity. This is the case with BUR, I feel, and may account for those reviewers who express their dissatisfaction with it.I would say the Coens' most solid and impressive production is No Country for Old Men, and that may be because it is based directly on someone else's book. It seems to mean something. The Coen remakes are not good, and one wonders why they were made.. The trouble with something like Burn After Reading, is that it seems ultimately pointless, although it is funny in parts. There is a tendency in many of these films for people to croak. Death is a joke. Perhaps most comedy lacks substance. Burn after Reading is a makeshift title.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Stars Made it an OK Movie,"""Burn After Reading"" certainly had the star power and presumably the budget to make a good film. There was Clooney, Pitt, Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, and even J. K. Simmons. That's some nice star power. The stars came in handy because they made it passable. If I were to say it was good, then it would be on the lower end of good, like a C good.The plot was simple, yet it intertwined so many different characters, and then when you step back to see the big picture it was like a ""Seinfeld"" episode---it was truly about nothing. There was a lot of infidelity and very shallow motives, but given the characters and the importance of their job functions you'd think that the movie was somehow about something bigger.

Underrated Coen Gold,"What is great about this film is that it doesn't play in one tone.It can be funny when there is humour and when there is murder it's shocking.

Seeing people get angry swear at each other and cause a cluster f@ck happening is something the coens invite us to laugh at, yet there are still lessons to learn again something the Coens have always done well Burn after Reading doesn't have warmth so some will find it hard to swallow and dismiss it, others will embrace this fresh piece of work and look at the world a little differently with the individualistic society and become that little bit wiser The Coens do this and they make me laugh my ass off at the same time every time I return to this film",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

All of them playing the roles of naives, fools, and lightly retarded guys. While we already know this role of McDormand in other Coen movies, there are not many comparable roles of these 3.

A Tragic Comedy About Middle-Age Dumb People,"10 April 2009. This movie is a quirky black comedy about the craziness of relationships, self-obsessions, and mistaken-who-done-its starring George Clooney, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Brad Pitt, and Tilda Swinton. The delicate balance of drama and black comedy precariously teeters and barely survives a credible ending. The characters are fascinating, particularly Brad Pitt's pretty out there in his wankiness. George Clooney also offers a rather compelling and out of character performance. Overall, the movie seems to over-reach its target and the script isn't quite as tight nor as satisfying as the characters themselves.

So after reading a few negative reviews I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I was very pleasantly surprised and surprising is exactly what it is. I think the fact that it plays like a suspense thriller or a drama is part of the fun. When we're laughing out loud the audience really understands that they are witnessing a unique comedy. I mean people clapped in our theater and that has been rare to nonexistent this year, even for the Dark Knight they didn't clap. My husband laughed so hard he couldn't catch his breath.

A healthy laugh in a vertical slice of ordinary meaningless insanity,"If you expect a well polished movie, a frank comedy, with a clear story and emotionally correct characters (by respect for the ticket you invested in, as some said) you'll be disappointed. It's a comedy because it's funny and caricatured. But it's also disturbing cold. That's why some people rated the work badly according to the non-sense story. Because the whole beauty of the coen movie lies in this aspect of fake, boring and out of Africa characters. The poster looks like spy, cold war movies. Indeed, this movie is about a war. It's the story of an accident, time, and horror, death. And death is so F king mean. It's about aging instead of living, living instead of being, being instead of enjoying. It's about conscience and sense. It's about life and communication. It's about making simple or complicated. It's about caching and missing. It's about luck and fate.

This is, after all, a Coen Brothers film. From The Big Lebowski to Fargo and No Country for Old Men to The Hudsucker Proxy, you either get it or you don't.This is a very intellectually challenged movie that has made fools of everyone in a subtle comedy that parodies the paranoia of those who believe in conspiracies and give high regards to governments who may not actually be as perspicacious as we like them to be.With a long list of reputable cast from Brad Pitt to George Clooney, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton and J.K. Simmons they each steal the show with their quirky characters and bizarre eccentricities. This is enough to enjoy for an implied humor that says so much about ourselves when we go overboard with our imaginative theories and this is how we may seem like if we were watched.It starts off with a simple discovery of a disk that holds secrets that could ruin the US government if it falls onto the wrong hands. Everyone associated with it seems to endanger themselves one way or the other that gets intertwined with a domestic complication rather than a political predicament.

Quirky characters and A-list actors,"Murder, blackmail, espionage – and this is a comedy? But Burn After Reading, the Coen brothers' latest film, is hilarious. Joel and Ethan Coen, who directed the movie and wrote the screenplay, have created an ensemble of wacky, egocentric characters whose worlds collide with disastrous results after a computer disk falls into the wrong hands.Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) and Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) are clueless, greedy gym employees who find the disk containing personal and ­financial files of Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich), a CIA analyst who quits his job after ­being demoted. Linda and Chad are sure the data is top-secret government information, and since Linda needs money for cosmetic surgery, they ­decide to blackmail Osbourne.Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) gets tangled up in the mess too. He's involved with Osbourne's wife (Tilda Swinton) and Linda – and he's married.Burn After Reading may initially appear to be a lighthearted comedy, but, as Chad puts it, ""appearances can be ... deceptive."" The Coen brothers wrote the screenplay while they were writing No Country for Old Men. In both movies, the deaths of innocent people are not taken very seriously, and there are no consequences for the killers; so the ending of Burn After Reading is unsettling for me.Why is this movie doing so well at the box office? The answer is simple: big names. I admit that my main reason for seeing it was that it was done by the Coen brothers. As for the actors, I don't think the characters would have been as amusing if they hadn't been played by A-list celebrities; at least Chad (the funniest, in my opinion) wouldn't have been as funny. He is the epitome of idiocy and artlessness, and yet, audiences love him, because he's Brad Pitt.Overall, it was the quirky personalities of the characters and the talent of the actors who portrayed them that gave this movie its distinctive quality.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
f*cking BRILLIANT!,"Joel and Ethan Coen are two of the finest filmmakers around, and it seems like every time they make a movie it ends up being a masterpiece, and ""Burn After Reading"" is no exception. Despite not normally being considered one of their greatest films and simply being severely underrated in general, I believe that this is better and funnier than more popular Coen's films such as, say, ""The Big Lebowski"" (a film that I also LOVE). It's actually saddening how little this film is praised, because it deserves much more acclaim and attention, for it is one of the most original, inventive, hilarious, creative, and shocking movies I have ever seen.Practically every aspect of this bizarre black comedy is pitch perfect. The cinematography and overall placing/movement of the camera both work together to make the film quite visually stimulating, while the characters and relentlessly inventive plot work together to make the film a great entertainer for the mind and emotion. And don't even get me started on the performances! How perfect can a movie get? These are some of the finest performances I have ever seen in a comedy, every single performer does an amazing job and perfectly encapsulate their character's personality. I ESPECIALLY have to give credit to Brad Pitt, who plays a lovably idiotic gym instructor that accidentally kickstarts a farcical string of crime, chaos, and even murder. His performance had me losing it while laughing, this is, without a doubt, the best Brad Pitt performance, and I'm willing to say that it is not only one of the best comedic performances, but maybe even one of the best performances PERIOD.But, the rest of the cast does excellently as well! John Malkovich is simultaneously threatening and sympathetic, while Frances McDormand portrays a desperate sex addict in a way that is both funny and pathetic, while George Clooney plays a charismatic but slightly mentally ill man dealing with a difficult romantic situation. And there is also brilliant performances from Tilda Swinton, Richard Jenkins, and J.K Simmons (who only appears extremely briefly, but still manages to impress highly).This is among the most enthusiastic reviews for a film that I have ever written, and that is because of how amazing this film is! This should be required viewing for all human beings that breathe (and animals should watch it too).",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"As Malkovich says: ""what the ....!""","I like Cohens, or I may say their earlier films. Unfortunately, after The Big Lebowski I couldn't get the same taste and joy from them. For me the best features of their films are/were characters, dialog and normality in absurdity. But in this film I had the feeling that absurd characters were created in sake of inventing absurd characters (I had the same feeling while watching No Country for Old Men). Also the structure is loose and the interconnections are way too forced. At certain times the film gets, I feel sorry to say but, boring and needs a better plot structure to keep it together and for me it lacks of it most of the time. The best thing in the film was John Malkovich; he was outstanding! Surely every film has its buyers but I have to admit this film disappointed me considering the cast and of course the creators.

Bleak and lively,"The demotion of a CIA analyst sets off a chain of events that ruins everybody ... except one.Sophisticated satire that runs through a cast of inadequate characters, each burning with the need to get their own way. The opening scene has a nice combination of script and performance, where the analyst can't bring himself to say what department one of his firing squad comes from for fear of confirming what's about to happen. The entire thing is filled with these subtleties, which efficiently establish the shortcomings of each character.The plot clicks together because these lives are already messed up, and the trigger event simply releases their pent up dissatisfactions and delusions. Each is unique and interesting, but the most intriguing is the ""never had to fire my gun"" air marshal: an odd mixture of sincerity, manipulation and paranoia - a narcissist whose reaction delivers a shocking turbo boost to events, and the role is performed with versatility. Maybe just one plot flaw, in that we don't find out in the end what happens to the analyst's wife.The intelligence honchos (including the Russian) are like observers of animals they can't be bothered to understand, and their final assessment of the situation is a dreadful reflection on ... I'm not sure what - the futility of life in America? Or is it just Washington? With the Coen brothers, I feel their comedy pulls back from making a broad statement, whereas their dramas are heavy with meaning - I kinda wish there was a medium, happy or unhappy.Editing keeps mushing us along, and I didn't check the time till about 50 mins - an extra 10 to flesh out the climax would have been fine by me.

They've earned it. But it's not like this movie is really that good or anything. It's screwy and fun, sometimes works, sometimes doesn't quite.

It's like he started from scratch and built this guy from experiences he once had in high school.""Burn After Reading"" passes the time, but don't build this up too much, because it's mostly just a whole lot of goofing around that just holds itself together because of the talents of the Coens.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Brad Pitt is a lovable goof and Francis McDormand gives one of my favourite performances as a vain, plastic surgery obsessed gym employee. I found Malkovich at his most Malkovichey - overacted shouting with contorted facial expressions. That doesn't prevent him being a likable character, and he gets us in his corner early on. I found George Clooney to be overdoing it a lot and Tilda Swinton was a bit bland and stuffy. I would've loved more of Richard Jenkins (who excels in a small role), Elizabeth Marvel and J.K.

"Despite good performances and witty dialogue, not one of the Coen Brothers best","The Coen Brothers are very uneven filmmakers in terms of the good quality of their films. Some are excellent such as Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, and O Brother Where Art Thou?And then some are needlessly complicated and slow such as No Country For Old Men and this film, while not without its merits, unfortunately is not one of their stronger efforts.Sure, some of their signature black comedy used so well in Fargo and The Big Lebowski is intact here and like those films the acting is excellent. Every cast member gives a great performance.Unfortunately the screenplay here is needlessly complicated and convoluted, and the pacing is very slow.I admired some things in this film but I think I think this could have worked a lot better as an action thriller as opposed to a dark comedy.If you are a fan of the Coens other works you will probably find something to admire here.If you are looking for a comedy to turn off your brain this isnt the one.Thinking comedies are not a bad thing, but when they get needlessly complicated as this one does eventually they just run out of steam and wear out their welcome.By the hour mark I realized this was not going to be one of the Coens finest hour and a half's worth of entertainment.The plot has a lot of potential but I think the tone is too uneven. Either this plot works as a straight flat out black comedy or it works as a thriller. Combining those two elements for this one particular film leaves much more to be desired.Not a bad film, but a very average one at best. My advice is to skip this and if you want to watch mainstream Coen go for Fargo, Big Lebowski, or O Brother Where Art Thou? If you want more underrated, brilliant Coen go for Barton Fink or Miller's Crossing. All of those films are far superior to this mediocre effort.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Almost as good as Fargo...but not quite.,"The bizarre character stew in this latest Coen Brothers' film puts me in mind with their earlier film, Fargo. ""Fargo"" put a certain charming folksy twist to the murder mystery genre. ""Burn"" takes an almost vaudevillian approach to the political thriller (and, for that matter, online dating). There were similar dynamics between characters, although not on a par with the Macy/ Buscemi/ Stormare weirdness factor. Clooney gets to stretch his ability by playing someone with little to no redeeming value, and it's only seeing how hopelessly, laughably pathetic the character is that we don't come away from watching ""Burn"" thoroughly detesting him. He's a high-rolling loser who gets his in the end. Same goes for McDormand, who you can't help but feel is a victim of reading one too many beauty/ fitness magazines and finds her body lacking in its entirety. Malkovich manages to maintain some dignity as a low-level intelligence lackey who is convinced he can publish his memoirs and blow the lid off the intel community. Pitt is endearing as McDormand's high-energy nincompoop cohort (personally, I think Brad should stick with the smaller partshe does lunatic so well). Tilda Swinton could've shown up in her Narnia costume for all the ice she exudes in this film. Richard Jenkins once again puts in a solid performance as an ex-Greek Orthodox priest, perhaps the only noble character in the bunch. Written concurrently with ""No Country For Old Men,"" one can understand why this film may have lacked in energy.

And then, the film ended.The most interesting character (for me) was J. K.

A smart comedy with stupid characters in strange situations,"The Coens have made a few comedies in their careers but I haven't seen any of them. After seeing Burn After Reading, I definitely want to explore more of their comedies.Burn After Reading shows two gym employees who find a disc containing confidential information from a CIA agent and try to use it in order to turn a profit.I'm not really how to explain the story of this film because of how strange it is and that's what I love about it. The Coen Brothers have a knack for creating quirky characters and putting them into weird situations which is essentially what Burn After Reading is. I can understand why this film is one of their more lower rated films but I think it's very clever.To me, the film is like a spy film without any of the smartness involved. It's more of a parody of the genre and the Coens do a great job of using the genre tropes of spy films and flipping them on their head which makes it harder to predict what was going to happen next. I had no idea how this film was going to end since the Coen Brothers add so many twists and turns that lead to hilarious and shocking situations that I wouldn't see coming. The ending is unpredictable and sums up the entire film perfectly. Their style of comedy is unlike any comedy I've seen. There is a level of cleverness and wit to them. The dialogue they write tends to be funny but it's how that dialogue is delivered and the expressions and mannerisms that come with it from the actors that make it absolutely hilarious.The acting from everyone is stellar. George Clooney does an amazing job and the subtleties you can spot in the way he portrays Harry is incredible. Seeing John Malkovich angry throughout most of the film accompanied with the Coens' solid dialogue was very entertaining to watch. Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton were also fantastic and had a few moments where they really shined. However, the best part of the film was Brad Pitt. I'm more used to seeing him play serious characters but he is honestly the funniest part of the film. The way he speaks and handles situations is comedy gold. It's easily one of my performances from him.All in all, I think Burn After Reading is one of the Coens' more underrated films. They've succeeded once again and made a comedy filled with stupid characters in familiar yet unfamiliar situations that you would normally find in spy films.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great but not for everyone!,"I went and saw Burn After Reading, with my girlfriend and her parents. I suggested this movie to them because I like the partnership between Clooney and Pitt. After watching the Oceans 11, 12, and 13 series I knew these two had the necessary, dry comedic timing that is essential for a piece like this. It takes a story which, to most of us, and to Frances McDormand in this film, is an important issue and twists it a little. It is a good example of how something that might seem more important to us, can be blown out of proportion and turned into something that it's not. That's what happens in this film, and I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it but, it's definitely a classic blend of comedy and tragedy. Having an ensemble cast, and using the soap opera/pulp fiction style story telling, so two seemingly unconnected plots, have an effect on one another makes this film a plus, for anyone pursuing a career in cinema.Two thumbs up, four stars, and a must see. Bravo!",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Don't Burn This One,"Burn After Reading is funny. After a brooding bout with some dense material in No Country for Old Men, the Coen's choose to engage in some rambunctious mimicry of the political spy thriller. Featuring a blessing of a cast, Burn After Reading tells the story of an idiotic ensemble, too lost in themselves to find anything worthwhile. The scariest part is -- the story is about us. And it's convincing.Word has it that Joel and Ethan were particularly inspired by Advise and Consent and Seven Days in May. (The poster design is clearly modeled after the Saul Bass work on The Man With the Golden Arm. The same man did the title design for Advise and Consent.) The brothers' rich history of deft genre study is not absent here. In deconstructing the political thriller, we are shown a universe not far from our own -- one where everyone is too involved with their own desires to be bothered by anything happening around them. The score is full of dramatic percussion. Indeed, the story beats a hollow body. There's nothing to respond to these characters. Burn After Reading has the intelligence to exclude Washington bureaucracy out of this debate. The government employees are the most intelligent and reliable populace in the film. Still, they are clueless about the incomprehensible ambitions of their constituency. Burn After Reading manages to elaborate on a valuable insight regarding human folly without becoming bogged down by didactic crap.In addition to the peripheral characters whom the Coen's occasionally allow to steal a scene, Burn is populated by a cast that is marvelous in name and in performance. It's full of exciting discoveries. Pitt, Malkovich, Swinton, and Jenkins deliver sensational work. The tradition of strategic director/actor pairing is as old as our technology. Burn is a testament to the virtues of adventurous casting. Pitt's stupidity isn't unlike his Tyler Durden, but it is more honest and, frankly, more revealing. Malkovich's vulgarity takes full advantage of his terrifying snarl. McDormand and Clooney are equally energizing and give their finest work with the brothers. McDormand's hesitancy and self-consciousness are a maturation of her sticky grin in Fargo. Clooney plays a character not far from Everett, but does so with more paranoia and swagger. A- list casts are cause for suspicion these days, but this is a marvelous example of how good an audacious Hollywood can be.The Coen brothers have always relied heavily on quirky resonance to their detriment. Their comedy is strongest when played with extended takes and mannered photography. We see much of that in Burn After Reading. They allow us to witness a more natural interaction with some marvelous actors and their expressive faces. However, these filmmakers seem to lean on wide shots as a punctuation, not a narrative fact. Their compositions have such a rich sense of space, but the shots stay in the can. It's a shame, really. The humor is built on interaction and interplay, not crafty visual manipulation. I only pick nits, though. They can stack up as many close-ups as they want as long as they retain the appreciation for long takes. It's a lost art in dire need of preservation. Drama is born of the long take.The brothers function on the assumption that Comedy + Tragedy = Reinvention. It's a hopeless aspiration, but is it possible that they do it better than anyone else? Their best work does float in the land between straight-faced seriousness and banana-peel slapstick. This seems to be a corollary of insistent genre study. In an effort to subvert and deconstruct classic models, the Coen's manage to create scenarios with a greater complexity and density than is present in most popular contemporary filmmaking. Burn After Reading doesn't even seem like a spy film. It has such a deep respect for the dignity of classic convention that the subversion reads like an entirely new creation. Perhaps the slight lack of center in the film is a result of their appreciation for these conventions. Regardless, the Coen brothers are one of the most respectable filmmaking parties at work for precisely this reason.Burn After Reading functions on steadfast but unforgiving fatalism. This is a common trope in Coen films, but only here is it made entirely explicit. To these filmmakers, human choice is independent of a crushing omnipotence. A CIA agent remarks, ""Well, we don't really know what anyone is after"" when presented with a summary of the film's puzzling event sequence. If there is a thesis to Burn After Reading, it's that we're all helpless creatures, floundering and philandering, smothered by our own desire. Like most of the Coen ouevre, the film ultimately becomes a thick tragedy. These characters, idiotic as they may seem, stand in for all of us.Set against the backdrop of shrugging U.S. bureaucracy, we are all deemed incapable of governing ourselves.79.3",,Anonymous,Crime
Quirky acting performances but not living up to its potential,"Burn After Reading is a quirky spy parody directed by renowned Coen Brothers and starring a set of outstanding actresses and actors like Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, John Malkovich, George Clooney and Brad Pitt. The confusing story revolves around a retired CIA analyst who is going through a divorce. A disc with information about his finances and memoirs ends up in the hands of two idiotic gym employees who try to blackmail him. Soon, CIA agents, Russian double-agents and private detectives are watching and being watched around the analyst's house when things go berserk.The premise of the movie is quite intriguing. The story is original and filled with surprising twists and turns while also criticizing and making fun of American bureaucracy, cinema and society. However, this rather short movie takes too much time to introduce a bloated set of characters. The characters are often quite flat, predictable and stereotypical. Later on, the story develops draggingly and only the final thirty minutes quicken up the pace. The conclusion to the movie feels somewhat aborted and is mostly told and not shown which is a sign for limited filmmaking in my book. The worst thing however is that this parody just isn't funny. I'm not the most serious guy and sure like to laugh from time to time but everything this movie evoked was a tired smile in two or three scenes. There is some creative situation comedy for sure but not one single truly hilarious scene. Since there are few action scenes and only a few small doses of suspense, this movie is only kept alive by its quirky characters and story.On the positive side, Burn After Reading has a mostly original script and offers memorable scenes with plenty of strange situation comedy you will remember long after having watched this film. The actresses and actors are also delivering the goods and very convincing as they manage to make the most of their one-dimensional characters. John Malkovich is brilliant as disillusioned analyst, Tilda Swinton convinces as his cold-hearted wife, George Clooney mesmerizes as lying womanizer, Frances McDormand excels in her role as hectic gym employee who makes all the wrong decision and Brad Pitt is quite amusing as dim-witted sportsman who is constantly and stupidly singing and smiling.In the end, you can give this film a try if you know and like the aforementioned actresses and actors as well as other movies by the Coen Brothers who certainly have their very own style. If one leaves out the brilliant actresses and actors as well as the situation comedy, one gets a movie with a confusing story line that just isn't funny though. I would recommend this flick if there really isn't anything else on television on a rainy night but it's overall slightly overrated.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Droll but a bit pointless,"Personally, I'm not such a huge fan of films by the Coen brothers; but it's hard to deny that each time they make a film, it's a different one. 'Burn After Reading' is a riotous spy-thriller, a viciously black farce that in which one can see traces of the brothers' previous films (deadpan scenes echoing 'Fargo', but also some of the zaniness of 'Raising Arizona', for example) but which is far from just a remake of any of them. As always, there are moments at which you can't help but chuckle; and it's fun to see Brad Pitt and George Clooney in such unheroic roles, although John Malkovich and Tilda Swinton do most of the scene-stealing. But the script suffers from a surplus of unoriginal swearing and a standard flaw of many of the Coen's movies: there's no reason to care for any of the characters. It's inventive and in places amusing; but it's still a film lacking in heart.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

It's a little bit funny,"I think I've watched the Cohen Brothers' 'Burn After Reading' about four times now and, although I find it a weirdly enjoyable film, I still can't get my head round the beginning. I guess you'd call it a black comedy/drama, filled with mix-ups and adulterous relationships, yet the catalyst for how it all begins seems to be one of those 'blink-and-you-miss-it' kind of moments. A CIA analyst (John Malkovich) gets fired and ends up being blackmailed by a pair of gym employees (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt), one of which is sleeping with a married man, George Clooney (who is also sleeping with John Malkovich's wife, Tilda Swinton). Confused? You may well be.It's a pretty confusing plot, not because anything's that difficult to understand - it just has a real air of confusion about it all. And, I think that's deliberate. For we, the audience, are treated like the CIA agents in the film, left to look in on this series of odd developments and wonder what the hell is going on here.Of course the film's storytelling style may not be to everyone's liking, however you have to admit that it has a stellar cast. With those names in the lead you'll be hard pushed to not enjoy their performances. Although, I have to say that (no-so-famous) Richard Jenkins stole every scene he was in and brought a real air of tragic pathos to the cast. In fact, he may well be the film's 'heart,' as, despite the other lead actors being big names, you may find it difficult to empathise with anyone besides Jenkins.Although everything ties up with these characters lives, like I said, it does it in a deliberately vague way which leaves you with question marks over your head (making you see the events through the bewildered eyes of those men supposed to know everything that's going on ever). Oh, and don't read too many spoilers - as there are definitely some moments that you won't see coming!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Great party!  You're not invited.,"This film was enjoyable in a detached kind of way. You are not ever involved with any of the characters. It's sort of like watching a Cohen Brothers home movie or the student film of some very talented, but very in-jokey film students. It doesn't matter if you think it's funny--it cracks up the directors, and that's all that matters. It's too bad. At times, the film is brilliant; sort of like ""It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" if that film had been written by the ""Airplane"" guys and co-directed by Ingmar Bergman and David Lynch. But that only comes in sublime flashes. For most of the rest of the time, you feel like you are watching over paid if not over qualified Hollywood Movie Stars (and yes, Frances McDormand, you are one. You too Tilda)hamming it up (way too much mugging here)at some sort of comedy camp retreat for actors. You sort of wish they had found some new struggling fresh faces for these roles, since the actors here seem to be slumming, or lazy, or falling back on old tricks. Remember how refreshing Frances was in ""Blood Simple""? That's what they needed here. The other thing they needed was a cohesive script. Too much happens ""off screen"" so to speak; when it would've been way more interesting than what we actually see. The CIA agents talking about the case is lame and falls flat, and frankly, is lazy. The other mistake was the shock moments the directors shoe-horned in for no reason other than to shock. Gore did not belong in this film. This really should've been rewritten and polished and given a strong plot on which to rest all the complications. This was a lost chance. This film really could have been a true classic. As it is, it's a notable, but forgettable minor comedy thriller. Wait for DVD.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Chilling suspense!,"You can't miss if you choose this moviel, it's a black comedy suspense movie, which is highly entertaining throughout a whole plot.

Passing time.,"Sadly that appears to be what nearly everyone was doing here from the Coens on down the line of A-list actors. Though the film has plenty of funny, surprising, and if nothing else engaging moments, it pales drastically in comparison to other works by most of these folks. It especially pales in comparison to the Coens' recent No Country for Old Men which is near the top of my all time list.The story deals with a recently fired CIA agent (Malkovich) losing a CD full of possibly crucial secrets he is planning on using to write a memoir with. Right off the bat that would seem like a highly illegal way of spilling compromising material, but somehow the man seems compelled to try and tell his story to anyone who might listen. Unfortunately he loses the disk at a health club and it falls into the hands of two employees (McDormand and Pitt) who plan on selling the info to the Russians after a failed, but hilarious attempt to sell it back to the agent. Most of the characters are connected by either the disk, or other characters in the cast they are screwing. Everyone here seems to be sleeping around with each other, but isn't that what life these days is all about? Really, this is not a remarkable project. All it does is give some of these A-listers a chance to work together and throw in some quirks here and there. Really nobody but Malkovich stands out in this ensemble. Pitt proves once again that there is no role he cannot screw up. The role of ""Chad"" is written just fine, but Pitt over-does it and tries to act excessively zany. I guess when you reach a certain level of stardom even the best directors either trust you to death or just don't have the guts to tell you how bad you're doing. Not sure which here. Tilda Swinton plays herself as usual, George Clooney is pretty good, and Frances McDormand again seems to blend right into her role. And the desperately random world of on line dating proves to be an easy target. Been there and done that! Luckily the film isn't that long, and if you have an hour and a half to watch these big stars mugging, go for it. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"An odd venturing into territory of both the political and pastiche sort, as the Coen's just about tread water with a purposely dopey spy thriller-come-romance feature.","It seems somewhat strange that George Clooney and Tilda Swinton would be in Michael Clayton, one of 2007's better films: a thriller about corruption; guilt; paranoia; espionage and so forth about a year or two prior to the pair of them then staring together in this; a pastiche of most of those things from the usually frustratingly wavy pens of the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan. The Coen's do indeed deliver a strange spoof-come-pastiche, delivered by way of their off beat and scatty humour ranging from dark and dreary in brutally efficient deaths inflicted on some by others to the construction one character lends towards a contraption designed to give its user the full benefit of a sex toy with minimal effort. Burn After Reading calls to mind a number of films of old, mostly of the spy or espionage ilk; broadly speaking, the film is a little like that 1998 John Frankenheimer film entitled Ronin only with Stellan Skarsgård's character completely removed and somebody like Jim Carrey's character from Dumb and Dumber inserted in place of him; an idiot that just happens to hold all the aces, much to the frustration of some of the other more brutal, more professional individuals entwined. Even Clooney's character himself has a name that echoes Michael Caine's Harry Palmer, but really only if you say it relatively quickly and repetitively.The film over-complicates a relatively routine premise, but deliberately so. Brad Pitt's Chad Feldheimer and Frances McDormand's Linda Litzke work at a local gym in the Washington DC area. He's eccentric in his body movements and gestures, the sort that strolls on ahead with an idea because it initially seems like an hilarious thing to do without much thinking about what the consequences might be; she's a lonely woman desperately seeking companionship via an online dating website, with a number of expansive operations on her body and facial area the overall goal so as to completely reinvigorate herself. Their roles as gym supervisors signals a sense that they're based within a zone in which people are present so as to tone up or to change appearance, dramatically or otherwise. Linda and Chad will undergo a similar 'toning up' process as they ill-advisedly leave their common existence behind and enter the world of espionage as gym owner Ted (Jenkins) persistently tells Linda she looks fine in a physically sense, and that the changes she has planned are unnecessary. Whilst on the surface a mere comment about her plastic surgery, it works on another level as a warning of greater items of change; particularly, her dipping into this new world she is ill fitted to exist in.This is all before we get to Clooney's Harry Pfarrer, a U.S. Marshall having an affair with Katie Cox (Swinton), the wife of C.I.A. higher-up Osborne Cox (Malkovich) whose compact disc those pesky gym employees have happened to stumble into contact with. It's an act on behalf of the U.S. government that sparks all this off, their demoting of Osborne signalling his resignation out of anger and the consequent embarking on the writing of his memoirs, a document you can understand will reveal the last 'x' number of years of C.I.A. work. By the end, The Coen's have got a little more political than perhaps they ever have been when they provide us with a scene that sees oblivious, dumbo government officials, sitting around discussing the eventual aftermath of the unholy mess they themselves have created. The film has begun with the removing of a higher-up from a position of power; innocents have since been caught up in the aftermath; many people have perished in the mean time and then the American government have, in a rather brutal fashion and through J.K. Simmons' character, brushed it aside in a foul swoop when taking responsibility and finding out why certain things went so wrong would be recommended. Read into whatever political under currents you like.Following Osborne's leaving of the service, he finds himself on a yacht out in the water with his father, informing him of the situation and talking of past decades when his father was in the force in a romanticised tone. He points at the ending of The Cold War as a moment that his line of work turned into something else as the boat seemingly drifts aimlessly out in the waters of nowhere, apparently going nowhere in the process, capturing what Osborne is feeling as he gazes off screen into the unknown. The best parts involve Osborne with the gym employees, Malkovich just about pulling off the scenes that require him to shout and badger people who are into something that's way over their heads, with Chad and Linda themselves trying to figure out the next plan of action; items that involve burglary and extortion in what is a passingly entertaining passage of play. The rest of it is a hit and miss meshing of romance and floundering on Clooney's and Swinton's behalf, barely any of it all that interesting but it somewhat eerily passes the time in an odd, numbing manner.Despite its light hearted tendencies within the genre, it's perhaps more involving than Ridley Scott's relatively pedestrian Body of Lies or either of Greengrass' two hollow; wishy-washy; turgid Bourne sequels which run on a premise but are practically devoid of character and narrative, the second sequel of which uses a bog-standard framework of self-discovery so as to provide a sense things are progressing. Clooney's consistent state of paranoia born out of the fact he believes he's being followed and the strong phobias plus reactions he has to the idea of surveillance actually addresses the issues at hand in a far more involving manner than either of the three aforementioned films. It's tough to get too excited about Burn After Reading, the directors' skill in film-making compensating for the brash, aggressive energy the piece carries but it's not enough to render it anything too great.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best Black Comedies I've ever seen!,"Absolutely hilarious from beginning to end. Coen Brothers prove themselves as one of the best directers out there.

Not especially memorable,"I enjoyed this movie as I watched it the first time, not having any idea what it was even about. I was just in the mood for the Cohen's brand of humor.

Number Two, when the movie ended and I had seen where everyone ended up, I realized that mostly it was just curiosity that compelled me to stick with it. The characters were well established, the story moved along at a nice pace, and the details of the plot kept me interested. The resolution, however, did not bring me much satsifaction. So this is a story that kind of lets you down in the end--you almost feel like asking ""What was the point?"" or ""Why did I sit through this?"" And I know what most people would say--that the movie is making a comment about this or that, and that feeling of dissatisfaction is part of the pont, but it's still not how I wanted to feel from watching a Cohen Brothers comedy.

"""You are part of a league of morons""","In my review of 'North by Northwest (1959),' I proposed that Hitchcock had depicted his F.B.I. agents as omniscient deities presiding over the affairs of Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant), interceding sporadically in a Deus Ex Machina-like fashion. 'Burn After Reading (2008)' – the Coen brothers' follow-up to 'No Country for Old Men (2007)' – uses the government authorities in a similar manner. Unlike Hitchcock's Gods, however, the Coens' authorities are hardly omniscient. Owing to round- the-clock surveillance of suspicious individuals, the government is continually aware of the characters' movements; less complete, however, is their understanding of the characters' motivations, and, frankly, they don't want to know. ""Report back to me when it makes sense,"" orders a high-ranking C.I.A. official (J.K. Simmons), who's so befuddled at the behaviour of this handful of American citizens that he'd rather cover up their crimes than get to the bottom of them.'Burn After Reading' is a send-up of the thriller, rather than a straight example of the genre. Gym employees Chad (Brad Pitt) and Linda (Frances McDormand) are complete idiots who happen to stumble upon the memoirs of an insignificant government employee, Osbourne (John Malkovich), and attempt to blackmail him for them. Meanwhile, philandering charmer Harry (George Clooney) sneaks around with Osbourne's wife (Tilda Swinton), and eventually gets himself into all sorts of paranoid strife. The Coens are no stranger to film noir, having incorporated the style into a good half of their films, and here the inevitable failure of greed is played for laughs more than anything else.

An amusing criminal comedy...,"The film has turned out good in my opinion. Most likely I have not understood all American jokes as I am Russian, however as well as on the contrary, but also the film had that many good jokes. George Clooney and Brad Pitt have once again proved that they fine actors. Even it is difficult to me to allocate, who from them has appeared better, but I think that it Clooney! Other actors also did not drop out of the general ensemble, was especially remembered John Malkovich. The plot will turn out original, even did not think that poor thing Pitt will kill, and further someone will cut an axe with special cruelty. A result heroine Frances McDormand so wished to perform these numerous operations and it will make them, only how many the person have given for it a life, and to someone Venesuellu to Hugo Chavez was necessary to leave.

Appearances Can Be Deceptive,"Burn After Reading is about tow gym employees Linda (played by Frances McDormand) and Chad (played by Brad Pitt). They unwittingly come into possession of a CIA agent named Osborne's (played by John Malkovich) memoirs. Believing this to be top-secret government information they try to sell it. Harry, Osborne's wife's lover is brought into this mix of characters. George Clooney plays Harry.The major theme of the film is idiocy. The Coen Brothers themselves stated this as a theme of the film in an interview. This is very evident in the character's idiotic behavior throughout the film. Chad's character was especially dumb. The character's unintelligent behavior is the main catalyst for the film's development. Idiocy as a theme is evident as Chad and Linda attempt to sell the disc of memoirs to the Russian Embassy. The Coen Brothers have used this theme before. The Big Lebowski also used idiocy as its central theme. The character Walter (played by John Goodman) was an idiot, a lovable, gun- crazy idiot. He would relate any situation back to the war, which would add nothing to the conversation. The Coen Brothers have a true affinity for characterization as is evident in both The Big Lebowski and Burn After Reading. The film constantly focuses on a single character's dumb-founded face. This enforces the theme. The angle of the camera is direct. The scene that best encompasses this is the scene where Chad meets up with Osborne to sell him the memoirs. The camera focuses on Chad's face and allows Brad Pitt's acting to shine. He can really show the expressions of Chad's dumb face. The second is the use of motif. The film keeps the viewer on the outside looking in. We are not part of the action, only viewing it. I believe this adds to the film's over-all feeling. The Coen Brothers are great at creating very original characters. The motif is of single character monologues and two characters intense dialog. Such as Osborne being on the phone with the bank. We are able to develop a better interpretation of his character. He is angry and assumes the banker is an idiot.This is seen again when Osborne encounters Chad in his car. We are able to see Chad's idiocy shine as he twice repeats, ""appearances can be deceptive"". This phrase I believe encapsulates the whole them of the film. Chad is an idiot but is trying to sound smart. Appearances can be deceiving, but in the case of this film, no character is capable of appearing smart.ReferencesBoggs, J. & Petrie, J. (2008).

Fun film for the Coen Brothers,"The Coen Brothers are some of the finest filmmakers around, and have shown to be able to make excellent serious films like Miller's Crossing, Fargo and No Country for Old Men to screwball comedies like the great the Big Lebowski. Burn After Reading falls into the comedy genre.The plot is confusing, especially for people who are not use to Coen Brothers films, but I'll give it a shot. Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) quits from the CIA after being demoted and seeks revenge by writing his memoirs. His English wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) has a real dislike for Ozzie and is having an affair with a US Marshall, Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), who is married to a children's author. Katie wants to divorce Ossie and tries to get a much financial information as possible and copies it and the memoirs onto a CD. However, her lawyers loose the CD in a gym and its found by gym workers Chad (Brad Pitt) and Linda (Frances McDormand). They believe they found top-secret information on the disk. Linda is on the wrong sign of forty, looking for love on the internet and wants some cosmetic surgery. Both Chad and Linda decide to blackmail Ozzie for the sum of $50,000. At the same time, the audience finds out that Harry is a sex addict and goes on the same dating website as Linda to look for partners. He ends up dating Linda and form a relationship when Harry's wife is out of town. When Ozzie refuses to pay Chad and Linda both decide to take the information to Russian embassy and offer to sell it to them. However this leads to them thinking they need to get more information for the Russians and alerts the big-wigs of the CIA. As the web of sex and lies continue during the film it starts to have consequences for the characters.Burn After Reading has a major trait of Coen Brothers of major characters who have separate aims and goals who end up interacting with each other. This happens in Fargo, No Country for Old Men and the Big Lebowski. As I said, it can be hard to follow if you don't know the work of the directors that well. Some people have described Burn After Reading as a parody of spy films. I didn't see it in the same way and I thought it was more a mick-take of the CIA and Washington D.C. because of their attitude and the bureaucracy. This was symbolised with J.K. Simmons playing the head of the CIA. It does make the CIA look pretty hopeless, which I guess quite a lot of people think is true. Americans may not know this, but in Britain they has been a issue about the intelligence services and government departments loosing sensitive information, and at the same time want to expand the amount of information they can hold on us. It adds a little topic humour to it. They are good acting performances in the film. Brad Pitt steals the show in this film, having most of the laughs and plays a total moron really well. John Malkovich is also going playing an easily angered, anti-social man who's life is falling a part. George Clooney is really good as a sleazy scumbag who is easy to dislike in the film. Frances McDormand is usual chirpy self, but is a little more downhearted compared to her role in Fargo. Tilda Swinton also offer a fine performance as a acid-tongued bitch who only thinks about herself and you wonder why she married Ozzie. The film is violence at times and its the only think that the Coen brothers know how to do: they are not filmmakers who are going to make a childens film in the near future.The film is a funny, but I was a little disappointed because I excepted more. I was hoping for more laughs in the film. The best performances for comedy were from Pitt and Malkovich. As some critics have said, it looks like the Coen Brothers and the actors had a lot of fun making this film. As well, except for Chad and to a lesser exent Linda, they are no likable characters in Burn After Reading. It is a solid film but it could have been better. To sum up, its too serious to be an out and out comedy, but its too silly to be a serious film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Inside Jokes Don't Make Outsiders Laugh,"I watched Burn After Reading with some trepidation. Reviews had been largely positive and it was portrayed as a madcap kind of comedy, but other than Raising Arizona I have never laughed much at Coen Brother movies and usually end up with a mildly bitter aftertaste. And so it went. In the end I think it disappointed both myself and my husband for a couple of reasons.One reason was that, with the exception of the poor schmuck who gets axed and shot to death, there were no likable characters. Isn't it kind of MOVIE 101 that you need to care about some of the characters? I mean, other than the one person with the least screen time? That doesn't mean the characters can't be flawed, but shouldn't they have some redeeming qualities too? Basically I don't understand why we're supposed to enjoy watching people who the Directors and Actors describe as ""stupid"" doing a bunch of stupid things for unsavory reasons. I also don't understand this notion that somehow stupid automatically = funny. (Christopher Guest movies, also so promising, mostly suffer from this same problem.)The impression I got, especially from watching the extras, is that the actors enjoy these movies because people like Brad Pitt and George Clooney get to play against type, which must be fun for them. And all of the actors seem to enjoy working the Coens, etc. The Coens clearly have a vision of what they want and they have all the requisite skills to make great films, except, I don't know, heart. They write characters that they don't like. (I didn't see No whatever for Old Men which may have been a great movie.) They portray a world where the nice guy gets killed and the idiot shallow woman gets her cosmetic surgery. I guess we're supposed to see that as Irony, and/or Reality or something. Instead it just seems arrogant to me - sort of like good-looking people mocking that frumpy singing sensation from England for being frumpy - it diminishes the person doing the mocking.We didn't turn the movie off - we waited to see how it ended. We agreed that the performances were good and, yes, Brad Pitt was surprising and fun (although the ultimate dumb blonde male performance not yet surpassed was Bill Pullman in Ruthless People). The fact that the movie held our attention just intensified the disappointment.",,Anonymous,Crime
Style of Coens at its best,"The Coen brothers are one of the best comedy writers in the cinema today, this film has all the components of its history; characters that are complete idiots and losers whose lives are altered as a result of a crime, Burn After Reading seems to be a silly film at first sight but it is not, in fact it has a very intelligent and well thought out story that works like a satire of American adult society, the film presents complex and deep characters very well written with the characteristic seal of the Coen.The hilarious performance of Brad Pitt and his character is one of the best things about the movie, by the time Pitt made this movie he was over 40 years old, however here he looks like a twenty-year-old gym instructor in very good shape, the character of JK Simmons, although it almost does not appear, is one of those powerful characters that the Coen put in their movies for a short time but their weight in the plot is surprising, every word they say leaves their mark.The violence in this film is not stylized or aesthetic, there is a half-way murder that is depicted as dry as it should be and something very common in the Coen films, the film's comedy is limited to physical comedy and witty dialogues, this is probably the weakest work of the Coen brothers so far, but even a lazy Coen movie ends up being interesting and not disappointing at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Dark and funny,"A perfectly balanced blending of dark and funny, it's not just another Coen Brothers movie - it's their NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Like the Hitchcock classic, it boasts a brilliantly confected screenplay built around a plot mechanism - a McGuffin, as Hitch called such things - less substantial than air, involving government spies, secrets, duplicity and connivance. The Coens, as inventive as ever, add plastic surgery and keep-fit to the mix.Superbly performed by a top-notch cast (has Brad Pitt ever given a more delightful performance? I really don't think so) and particularly noteworthy for its witty editing (courtesy of the Brothers themselves, under the name of Roderick Jaynes), it is crammed full, like all vintage Coen-work, of characters whose own worst enemies are themselves.Some clearly find this sort of thing heartless, some find it far-fetched.

"Complicated, but pretty good","A couple of health gym trainers (Pitt, McDormand) obtain a CD that has CIA information on it and they try to sell it.The above is the simplest explanation and major plot of the story, but this story really gets complicated and you just have to keep up as things move pretty fast too. However, the producers realized that we may get a little lost and have a CIA agent (Rasche) report to his boss (Simmons) everything that we have seen so far. They did this for us twice. Wasn't that nice of them? Lost no more.For George Clooney to play a womanizer with that really bad looking beard didn't make sense. Here the beard was a distraction, not a turn on as I guess the director expected it to be. Reminded me of Blutto in a Popeye cartoon.I kept waiting for Frances McDormand to say, ""Ya, you betcha."" at times (go see Fargo).There are some clever lines and antics but I wouldn't go so far to say they were laugh out loud lines and antics.

Burn After Reading just seems...pointless?,"It's been awhile since I've watched a film where I immediately think to myself ""...ok, so what did I actually take away from that experience?"". Apart from intelligence agencies knowing everything about everyone, potential divorcees gaining stalkers and the idiocy of suburban humans, I really didn't see much point to this. Having said that, its competently made and a pleasant watch. Explaining the plot is like battling Bobby Fischer at chess, you just don't do it. If you like the Coens, ensemble casts and dark humour then go for it and I'm sure you'll have a good time. But basically a bunch of people seemingly (or coincidentally...) are linked with a secret document being misplaced. Where might you ask? Just at the local fitness suite, no biggie. So the staff members hold the proposed recipient at ransom who's wife is cheating on a guy who's wife wants to divorce him but he is seeing other people in which one of them is a staff member at the gym and blah blah blah. It's all mental crazy stupid fun, but to a point where none of this is believable. Is that part of the humour? I guess so. Heck, all I wanted to see was John Malkovich shout profanity at everyone, in which he did so I was pleased. Brad Pitt was surprisingly funny. Frances McDormand had some of the best lines in what was a consistently witty script. George Clooney throws a dildo at the wall in a rage. Tilda Swinton was...present. Richard Jenkins was underused. Finally, JK Simmons leaves us with a summary of what we learnt: ""nothing. Or atleast never to do it again"". Whilst all the above performances were good with a darkly humorous script and solid direction from the Coens...it just felt messy. The first half which introduces all of our characters spontaneously really wasn't engaging at all. Consistently switching between everyone without establishing a plot. It's only when the characters start connecting that we ourselves connect with the story. However, with all the lunacy and outlandish events the film just abruptly ends.

"The Cohen's miss all their usual marks to produce an ""OK"" film but no more than that","Although I've seen True Grit recently, I am a few films behind with the Cohen's and watching Burn after Reading was part of me catching up. The film has a deliberately complex plot as innocent blackmail by two gym employees sees them accidentally mixed up with two couples each going through divorce and the CIA. Everyone's motives and intentions are misconstrued and soon confusion leads to messy and bloody misunderstandings. Although I had heard mixed reviews about the film, it did seem like rather an open goal for them since this was the sort of thing they had done before to great effect in Blood Simple and Fargo: small people in over their heads as a simple crime spins out of control.For some reason though, they get it wrong here and mostly their usual darkly comic is missing. The oddball characters are all here but the plot is far too messy and has far too many characters in the mix. This doesn't matter too much as the film passed the halfway point because by then it had a bit of momentum and all was clear, but as it laid out the plot everything seemed to be going nowhere and each character seemed to add little. Once the plot is clear the other problems start coming out. The first is that it is not as well written as previous films. The characters all have potential to be comic oddballs but they don't really come off and nobody here is a classic Cohen creation. The comedy doesn't really work as it should either and it didn't have that darkly comic feel that Fargo and other films did. It wasn't that I expected to laugh, but I just didn't have the otherworldly feel that they often give me.I know that part of the point of the film was that the plot was a complex mess but for me it was also a problem because this messy aspect tended to detract more than it added. The additions were the couple of great scenes with the two intelligence heads trying to get a handle on what was happening – these were funny and both characters were what I would expect. In the rest the mess is not funny or smart or engaging enough to stand up and, while amusing and able to hold my attention, still feels like it is the Cohen's underperforming. The many star names actually don't help as much as one would have liked. Clooney is amusing and works well enough but, while I liked Pitt's attempts at his character, I never once thought he was able to shake off the idea that he was Brad Pitt ""doing"" quirky. McDormand is good though, this is the sort of stuff that she does and she does it well. Malkovich, Swinton and Jenkins all add to the feeling that there are too many people in the film who are their faces first and their characters second. Simmons and Rasche are great though – if the film had more scenes like theirs it would have been better for it.Overall Burn after Reading is a sub-par performance from the Cohen's. It has aspirations to be the darkly comic crime film that they have done before and, on paper, all the absurdity and characters are there, but they just don't work as they should on the screen. The mess is part of it, but it also detracts, while the characters are not that good nor the film smart enough, engaging enough or funny enough. The Cohen's on an off-day is still worth seeing, but they have done better and will do again.",,Anonymous,Crime

Great cast holding up a good movie.,"If you like the Coen brother's previous movies, then you're probably going to like this one. It's labeled as a comedy, and humor wise can be compared to Fargo. At times it's cheeky and over the top, but it can also be very serious. The laughs were not frequent from me, but for some reason, the same heart pounding I got from No Country for Old Men, I got at times in this. Really, this was not one of the Coen's best works, though it was still good and entertaining.Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) has just been fired from the CIA, and he doesn't want to tell his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) the truth. She's got some secrets of her own, and she's been cheating on Osborne for psychotic charmer Harry (George Clooney), and Katie is secretly in the process of getting a divorce from her husband. Meanwhile, Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) is in the process of getting plastic surgery, and she's trying to find a love online, and she meets Harry. Chad (Brad Pitt) works at Hardbodies Gym with Linda, and he finds Osborne's files which were mistakenly left in the women's room. Linda and Chad try to give the files back to Osborne, and expect a small reward in return, he takes it offensively. Chaos ensues as many interconnected stories are told.The actors were really great here. George Clooney and Frances McDormand are over the top, but funny. Tilda Swinton is perfectly cast as the rude woman she plays. John Malkovich is good at being angry, so he too was perfectly cast. Brad Pitt is a great addition to the cast a the flamboyant and clueless gym worker, and probably was my favorite character, as he was most likable. The other characters were inconsistent as to whether they were likable or not, though whether or not they were, the actors always portrayed them brilliantly.The stories are okay. At times the movie drags, but usually it's well paced. The script is random and typical Coen strange. It's too serious to be a comedy, and too goofy comedic to be serious, so what we have is a movie stuck in genre limbo, never really reaching any genre successfully. It wants to be a comedy more than anything, but never fully reaches it's goal.Overall, this is a good, not great, outing for the Coens, with a lighter tone than some of their pictures, but pales as a follow up to No Country for Old Men.My rating: *** out of ****. 95 mins. R for language, violence and sexual content.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another great Coen.,"Those guys are just artists. This grim, dark humored satire is a portrait of various stupid and sometimes vain characters and their tragic failures in the eyes of a Coen-esqe spy thriller. The plot itself once again is not important at all, it's the characters and their actions, that make this such a marvel to behold.There is the low-level CIA agent played by John Malkovich, whose intellect doesn't want him to accept he might have lost his job to the bottle. We see the brilliant Frances McDormand as a gym teacher, who won't stop at major surgery, treason and extortion to ignore she's past her prime. George Clooney portrays a playboy informer for the intelligence offices, who loses track of his sleep-arounds. Brad Pitt as a spunky gym dummy easily overwhelmed, but eager to try anyways. And Tilda Swinton does her amazing ice queen performance once again.All of them already A-listers and here they happily satire their public persona to portray a bunch of idiots in over their head. Watching these characters drive themselves into chaos is cynical, but so funny at the same time. You're not supposed to cheer anybody on, you're here to watch disaster unfold. And oh my god, do the Coens know how to put that on the big screen!In the end you'll feel as smart as the CIA. And no, that's not a good thing in this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not Funny,"At a tipping point in the Cohen Brothers' ""Burn After Reading"", CIA Superior played by the wonderful J.K. Simmons (""Juno"") and his CIA Officer played by hysterical straight man David Rasche have a profound exchange. Simmons says, ""So what did we learn from all this?"" Bewildered Rasche replies, ""Um I don't know."" To which Simmons concludes, ""I don't f---ing know either."" That pretty much summed it up for me, after watching an hour and an half of ""Burn After Reading"". And with the movie's conclusion I soon left the theater.The most surprising thing about Ethan Cohen and Joel Cohen's ""Burn After Reading"" is that it is not funnypainfully not. You have Oscar Winners George Clooney, Francis McDormand, and Tilda Swinton, and Oscar Nominees Brad Pitt and John Malkovich either playing complete idiots or raving psychos. Granted for some the Cohen Brothers are doing art here. However, the over acting particularly on the part of George Clooney as moronic Treasury Agent Harry Pfarrer, and complete moron personal fitness trainer Chad Feldheimer played by Brad Pitt is utterly embarrassing. The cast could have all taken the advice of Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus from ""Tropic Thunder"", who in a cleaned up and politically correct vernacular advised actors to never play mentally disabled full out. Lazarus said it more plainly than I.One has to wonder during the making of the movie, that some assistant didn't say, ""Hey George, you might want to throttle back just a tad"" The Cohen brothers are geniuses; but not here. The only actor that fairs well is Tilda Swinton which is a testament to her prowess and intelligence shining through. Here is the thing: Everyone in ""Burn After Reading"" is stupid playing stupid as opposed to stupid playing smart--which would be funny. There is no inherent irony in the characters. And in the case of Clooney, Pitt, and McDormand their characters have the I.Q. of squash. It's like paraphrasing Forrest GumpStupid is, as stupid does. Rather here: stupid is stupid, and not funny.And with the characters that are not stupid like Malkovich's Osborne Cox; the man is an arrogant unsympathetic ass. I think Swinton, who plays Osborne's wife Katie in part gets a pass for having to put up with all the other idiots and her insufferable husband. Swinton's performance is killer, and has the only semblance of authenticity. Fortunately, the minor characters like the CIA guys, Simmons and Rasche, remind us that ""Burn After Reading"" was intended as a macabre comedy. Giving the Cohen brothers their due: They execute the incongruous and macabre elements to perfection.""Burn After Reading"" is the collision of the stone cold stupid and the heinously arrogant. Osborne Cox (Malkovich) is demoted as the CIA's top analyst, because he is an alcoholic. Instead Oz quits the CIA, and embarks upon writing his memoirs which would reveal classified information vital to national security. Oz's suffering wife is successful physician Katie Cox (Swinton). Katie is secretly having an affair with obtuse Treasury Agent Harry (Clooney). Somehow Oz's memoir CD turns up at a health club, and in the hands of Chad (Pitt) and Linda Litzke (Francis McDormand). Chad realizes that he and Linda could exhort the CD owner for a fortune. Aging personal trainer Linda sees this as the leveraging point for getting the money she desperately needs for cosmetic surgery and liposuction, which her HMO refuses to pay. Self absorbed Linda also pursues a relationship with the married Harry (Clooney) through an on-line dating service. Linda is blatantly unaware that her boss at the club, Ted (Richard Jenkins) is in love with her. Philandering Harry also promises Katie (Swinton) that he will leave his successful Children's book author wife Sandy (Elizabeth Marvel). Well, not really. All is intentionally and needlessly convoluted. In the end we really don't learn a f---ing thing. More disappointingly, ""Burn After Reading"" is not really funny.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Brilliant dark comedy,"I just watched Coen Brother's latest film, and what a surprise. As I read somewhere this movie is about nothing at all and the premise is almost an excuse to make a movie.A great movie may I add...Burn After Reading is a dark comedy which purpose is nothing more then to entertain, and this is entertainment at his best.Obviously the A-list actors push the movie to a different level. George Clooney plays (again), a charming womanizer but this time with a little twist, he's a bit paranoid and obsessed with sex. Frances McDormand does a hell of a job as the 40's gym employee who needs a ton of cosmetic surgeries in order to reinvent herself, and John Malkovich although he doesn't get that much screen time, he did well as the government worker and his ""wtf"" is priceless.But as I see it, Brad Pitt is the star of the movie,all his scenes are hilarious and who knew he could do comedy like this? He is one of the most accomplished actors I know and one of the most underrated as well, and I think he can pull off any type of role.In the end as the CIA superior says, ""we learned nothing""... but we sure as hell were entertained.8/10",,Anonymous,Crime
Smaller The Better,"Many people absolutely adored last year's Coen brothers effort No Country For Old Men. It was praised both by the critics and the general public and won Best Picture. Facing a great expectation, No Country is no followed by the new spy thriller comedy ""Burn After Reading"". Despite the exciting premise and the excellent acting, the film suffers from fractioned storyline and some very annoying characters.The story is definitely not something that can be explained briefly. It is very convoluted, layered and with many intertwining plots. The general plot of the film follows a disc that contains sensitive materials of an ex-CIA analyst. After a botched blackmail attempt, the events that follow creates a dark and humorous result.The film's strongest point is the acting. The film is full of A list actors: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Richard Jenkins, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, John Malkovich and JK Simmons just to mention a few. Even when you cannot like the characters they are playing at all, you are still awed by their acting capabilities. Brat Pitt and JK Simmons are the best out of all in this movie.Similarly, the film makes a good use of black comedy. Despite the fact you usually don't laugh out loud to horrific deaths in films, the excellently written, twisted dialogues cannot help but to bring a smile to your face. This film is a very good example of dry humor. The use of black comedy is a trademark in many Coen films. There are many parts in the film where you burst out laughing for long periods of time. The issue in connection with the overall picture of the film is that the humor is rather spread apart with frequent dry bits.Similarly, despite the excellent cast and the inclusion of praised Coen film elements, the film's story stands on the weak end. There is a lot of things going in the film and it is not told in a very effective way. There are plot holes and many events in the film are left unexplained. Not only that, the film has a very slow beginning where the central ""plot device"" is not even shown until about 20 minutes in.Finally, some of the characters are so irritating and bothering that they take some of the enjoyment out of the film. It is a bit of a shame to have talented actors and actresses playing such forgettable characters. The amusing aspect that you tend to notice and enjoy the performance of smaller characters. Brad Pitt and JK Simmons, again, are prime examples. The ending, despite its abruptness, is a very funny one. It does not explain everything but the humor is top notch and very well done. Overall, the advice when seeing Burn After Reading is not to think of it as a pure comedy. As I have mentioned before, you will not be laughing for the whole duration of the film and there are some serious parts as well. I suggest going to a matinée showing for this film due to the fact that I've noticed that many people found certain aspects of the film unappealing.7/10Matinée",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A comedy of errors,"This movie finishes where it starts off with one woman needing some repairs. It is hilarious. From the makers of one of my favourites, ""Fargo,"" the Coen Brothers deliver another subtle comedy of errors. Whenever I tried to retell Fargo to friends or relatives I could not get it out because I was laughing uncontrollably. This might not be up to the level of hilarity as parts of Fargo but it is pretty good. It has the best actors with the likes of George Clooney and Brad Pitt plus a few others of that calibre. The audience gets what the characters do not which is what the Coen Brothers do best. They use unintelligent, naive people to bite off more than they chew with very funny consequences. It is clever and will provide some good laughs.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not the Coen brothers' best ,but fun either way","Mystery, mayhem, massive mix ups of people. Misunderstandings and wrong interpretations. Deceit, trickery and complete astonishment. That'd be the keywords for this film. It's not the first comedy done by the Coen brothers and I surely hope it won't be the last. After their previous, No Country For Old Men, it fell a bit strange and it might even have pulled a partly wrong audience to the cinema, but it works for me, I've been watching their films ever since I found myself crying with laughter over Raising Arizona and have been amazed at their combined talents quite a few times.Anyway, this film starts rolling when two workers in a health/fitness center find a CD full of what they think to be government secrets. The trail of events that starts there is far fetched but not so far it becomes entirely unbelievable and the trail of people that is followed through the film is both long and highly varying. The effect of that is that there is always something to do on the screen, making the film rather entertaining. Some of the characters fall a small bit out of place but not so far that they become a true nuisance.Finally, the show is stolen by three players: Brad Pitt who returns a small bit to the marvelous role of a madman he played in Twelve Monkeys by putting down a somewhat slow health-care/fitness agent here, Frances McDormand who spotlessly plays a somewhat neurotic coworker of Pitt and John Malkovich who puts down the angered special agent with a class only he can. The rest of the casting is very good too, but for me the above three really pulled the film.All in all this is not the best work by the Coen brothers (for me Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski outclass this one as comedies) but it delivers and that's good enough for me.7 out of 10 secrets uncovered",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Burn After Reading presents a unique and fascinating storyline with dynamic and unpredictable characters,"I recently revisited Burn After Reading (2008) on MAX. The storyline revolves around some gym employees that unwittingly come into possession of a lost government disk with undisclosed secrets. A government employee, amidst a brutal divorce, grows increasingly frustrated as the gym employees attempt to extort money for the return of the disk, leading to an epic eruption of events.Directed by the legendary Coen Brothers (Raising Arizona), the film stars Brad Pitt (Fight Club), Frances McDormand (Fargo), George Clooney (The American), John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich), Tilda Swinton (Michael Clayton) and Richard Jenkins (Step Brothers).Burn After Reading presents a unique and fascinating storyline with dynamic and unpredictable characters. The characters' mannerisms, dialogue, and reactions are memorable, hilarious, and perfectly executed. The cinematography adeptly captures facial expressions and reactions, with standout performances from Pitt, McDormand, and John Malkovich. Numerous supporting performances enhance the film, and the ending, especially the closet scene, is perfection.In conclusion, this Coen Brothers masterpiece is an absolute must-see. I would give this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
An entertaining dark comedy from the Coen Brothers,"Even though the characters are quirky and funny, it's kind of hard to find them likable or feel invested in them since they're scummy people. But then again that's the whole point of this movie - it's trying to make fun of all these types of people. Chad is by far the dumbest and most innocent character I've seen Brad Pitt play. And I mean that in a good way, the character he plays literally lacks brain cells. He was a real joy to watch - as he always is. John Malkovich is hilarious. His fits of rage in this movie always made me laugh. Clooney and Frances were great and so was everyone else.The movie has a kind of random and ridiculous situation, but at least it's funny the way they present it. It's entertaining to see how all these characters are connected through someones screw up. There's some funny stand out moments. Like the scene with Pitt and Malkovich meeting in the car. And when Clooney's character gets all paranoid at the park. The way the Coen Brothers are able to make paranoia a funny thing is a feat in and of itself.The Coen Brothers' random humor is well throughout the movie. Burn After Reading is a satire on bureaucracy, of the government and of the people who are in these high positions. It's about dumb people, idiocy and incompetence. Moral of the story: don't get involved with anything to do with the CIA, the government or any sort of idiot people. It's not the Coen Brothers best movie, but it's one that's worth checking out if you want some good dark comedy and a wacky story.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Eerily predictive of the current Zeitgeist (2018,"Back in 2008 this film was really a fun engaging thriller/black comedy. Brad Pitt and JK Simmons especially were hysterical and fun. The labyrinth of a plot was a great send-up of thrillers and kept you guessing how it would end. Add in the Coen Brother's attention to detail and the rest of the performances this was a comedic thrill ride. But time has been extremely kind to the film.Osbourne Cox, played with the right tone of condescending hubris by Malkovich, is the sort of petty incompetent jerk that unfortunately has worked his way into the public consciousness. Indeed, the general idiocy of the characters capture the beguiling mixture of malice and stupidity that is the hallmark of this era. These characters are easy to understand in their psychological drives and if they weren't so damaged, short sighted, and small they would not put into these traps of their own making. The film's commitment to giving characters what they *don't* deserve-the worst character gets what they want, the best character absolutely doesn't-ring extremely true of the current situation.This film is so funny at pointing out how stupid we are it hurts.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Subtle Satire:  What ""location"" means to the Coens","Can't help but offer my comments on this movie. The setting of the story and plot are very important. The movie offers subtle but acid satire about the strata and subcultures of the Nation's Capital. Having spent nearly 30 years there, I nearly split my sides snickering at the characters and plot.For that reason, it offered to me the same entertainment value as Tom Wolfe's novel, ""Bonfire of the Vanities."" This pattern of setting and characterization is just as certain in another film by Ethan and Joel Coen -- ""No Country for Old Men.""Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand are hilarious; John Malkovich and George Clooney play their roles to the hilt, as does Tilda Swinton.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A dark Coen brothers comedy.,"Some of the charm of this movie comes from the actors. Most of them are playing parts well below their normal charisma levels, which leads to some realistic characters. You can definitely tell that they enjoyed themselves working on this project, which is exhibited well in the trailers. That being said, it's still dark comedy.
Needless to say, most of the funny material of this movie was shown in the trailer. The plot definitely felt at times like a campy soap opera, and lacked structure past the bumbling of blackmailing gym trainers. If you can't stand somewhat complex plots and the quintessential Coen brothers senseless violence, you might want to stick to renting this film. Otherwise, perhaps wait until it hits the cheap seats theatre.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
What a Shocker!,"I was expecting great things from this movie - my appetite had been whetted by an amusing trailer (which sadly contained all the funny moments which the movie had to offer), by the presence of the likes of Bard Pitt, George Clooney and John Malkovich, and by the fact that the film as directed by the Coen brothers whose most recent film, No Country for Old Men, I thought was excellent. Alas, Burn After Reading was a huge disappointment - incredibly slow, confused, unsure of what type of movie it really wants to be. There are a couple of genuinely funny moments, one or two shocks, but that's it. This was described as a 'comedy' thriller but, in comparison to the likes of Big Lebowski or Oh Brother Where Art Thou, it simply isn't one! In short, a bit of a turkey!",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Good Job, Once Again Coen Brothers","Last year, the Coen brothers took us on a journey through a dark thriller, called No Country For Old Men. This year, they have gone back to comedy, with a smart, clever spy comedy called Burn After Reading. This movie was a brilliant comedy, and I was laughing so hard! The acting is great, the writing is great, the direction is great, what more could I ask for? For some of the characters to smarten up a bit. There are points in this movie where the characters are extremely stupid, but I guess that's the point. That was the only flaw for me in this movie.

Another great dark comedy by the Coen Brothers.,"The Coen Brothers make very unusual, yet good movies. ""Burn After Reading"" is a definite exception of their work. They capture the quirky yet likable characters fluently and deliver a pretty witty script.For such a big ensemble cast, I was well-pleased by each of the actors performances. But I think the real geniuses are Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, J.K. Simmons and Brad Pitt. Especially Pitt. He had to have had a blast making this movie. He is so irresistibly funny, making it hard at times for me to breath. Frances McDormand has excellent chemistry with Pitt, and also with the other actors she gets involved with. As with John Malkovich, he's his own character. His fits of anger get so intense that it is hard not to laugh at.J.K. Simmons, although only in the film for five minutes, delivers clever lines one after another that make me want to fall out of my chair with laughter.

Good God it was Great,"Burn After Reading is one of the funniest movies I have seen in recent years. I used to write a great number of movie reviews on IMDb but have fallen out of the habit, and it's so refreshing to view a film so good that it makes me feel compelled to spread the word.The plot concerns a CIA operative played by John Malkovich whose writings and memoirs from his job fall into and out of the hands of such crazy characters as: paranoid sex-addict George Clooney, ice cold bitch Tilda Swinton, Plastic-surgery-seeking Frances McDormand, and last but not least, hands-down the funniest performance of his career, Brad Pitt as a dim-witted personal trainer.Pitt steals the show with his perfect delivery and commitment to his role as the very stereotype many have labeled him past and present.This is not to say by any means he is the sole reason for watching this film, however. All of the actors have such wonderfully wacky characteristics and play off each other so well you'd swear the film was a documentary on the secret, bizarre lives of Hollywood's finest.They would have had such a hard time making a story like this work if it weren't for the amazing script written by the Coen Brothers. It is an actor's dream to have a script so perfect in plot and dialogue, and it is an audience's treat to have something so fresh presented before them in this era of Reboots, Remakes and Sequels.Dare I say this..? I almost believe this film deserved an Oscar more than No Country for Old Men.Burn After Reading is a film that keeps you laughing until the end; a film that you allow to swallow you whole because it is simply too much fun to pass up.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Spy vs. Spy...,"I like pretty much everything the Coens have ever done. There is something about their filmmaking style and oddball humor in tense situations that appeals to me. While Burn After Reading doesn't rise to the same heights as The Big Lebowski or O, Brother Where Art Thou, it is still a lot of fun with an excellent cast and the same great writing we have come to expect from them. For being a heartthrob, Brad Pitt has made a great reputation for himself as a character actor. He has never taken his ""sex appeal"" seriously, instead opting to hone his comedic chops and be very discerning when it comes to the projects he selects. George Clooney on the other hand, has always been less discerning about his projects, and at the time of this movie, he hadn't hit his stride of confidence. He isn't necessarily bad, but he isn't as smooth and funny as he would prove to be in later projects. Frances McDormand is decent though she is probably a better actor than the role requires, so she does seem uncomfortable at times. This is definitely a fun watch, and very obviously a break for the Coens who just wanted to have a good time rather than constantly pushing out Academy Award darlings. Their fun and games film is still way better than most people trying their hardest to make a brilliant movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

This a Fun Coen Comedic Spy Thriller,"The style of this movie is very different from the feeling and normal pacing of a Coen Brothers movie, but it is still very good. What is retained is the quirky, unusual nature of the characters. John Malkovich is sharp and funny. George Clooney reminds us here that in addition to being a great action and dramatic star, he is also very funny. Here he plays an awkward buffoon, rather than a sex symbol. Malkovich's separation from the CIA, his pending divorce, and memories set the stage for this crazy film. Brad Pitt offers one of his quirkiest, funniest, and best performances here. Frances McDormand is her charming and engaging self as the woman whose desire for immediate cash for her plastic surgery sets the entire series of crazy events in motion. Richard Jenkins and Tilda Swanson round out the great, great cast. Direction, cinematography, and the script are always high level in Coen Brothers films-true here too.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Painfully bad, but that doesn't matter, it's a Coen production.","People have probably rated this movie highly out of respect for the Coen's previous work. Other motives may include self delusion, as is so often the case. But Noel and Ethan's latest 'comical' entry was every inch as bad as their previous attempts featuring among other abominations ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" and ""Intolerable Cloonety"".I have yet to see a film by the brothers Coen that would inspire me to see it through to the end and ""Burn After Reading"" didn't give me much hope for the future either.This Coen artifact is once again a film in which they attempted some weird and annoying amalgam of all sorts of movies that simply doesn't work. Adding to this a really abhorrent screenplay and the worst acting by Clooney and Pitt to date. Big names do not an utter miscast conceal. Maybe next time actors like Steve Martin, Lesley Nielsen or Jim Carrey could play the clowns in yet another meagre and clunky rip off of previous efforts. Not that I will bother to watch the next one, but at least people will have an honest warning up front.Not really much to say about this movie other than that I struggled to make it through to the one hour mark before eventually I had to give up, that it sucked in every regard one could think of judging a film of comical intent and that once again the general public can't tell shït from Shinola when it comes to rating a movie.Cheers and thanks for reading.*/****",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Genre: Coens,"It's good to watch a film by the Coens, no matter what they do. They are clever filmmakers, who have their creations always embedded in cinematic reflections, which is to say, their films exist because other films exist to support them, and for us to fully appreciate a film by these brothers, we must have a knowledge of previous creations. So far, with that work of deconstruction of genres and previous films, they have created very strong and important films, like 'Miller's Crossing' or 'Big Lebowsky'.Other times, they're just not so incisive, and they just make films to amuse themselves, and the audience. This is the case. We can understand how their previous 'serious work' influences this one, but this was made out of pure fun, and says nothing they haven't said before. But it is still fun to watch:We have a story about people who follow people, plots and subplots. Everything twists around infidelities which cause chain reaction events. Each character thinks he controls the game he is trying to play, but everybody has somebody tailing him and something he doesn't know. These lives are observed, from an upper level, by someone who has the access to all the information but simply doesn't know what to make of it. This is epitomized by the initial and ending images, satellite captured images, 'google earth' type. It gives you the whole world, but it tells you nothing about what happens down to earth.This is probably a money raiser project, something in which the brothers had a lot of fun, but in the whole body of their filmography, it is not important work.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Crime
"""You are part of a league of morons.""","The Coen brothers Joel and Ethan put their distinctive comic spin on the spy genre with ""Burn After Reading"". Although it's not quite as good as ""Fargo"" or ""Raising Arizona"" in this viewers' humble opinion, it's still funny enough and smart enough to qualify as a good time. It works because its characters are clueless and naive and totally out of their depth, and it's fun watching a bunch of talented stars play these grasping bozos.Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt play Linda and Chad, two schmucks who work at a gym called Hardbodies. One day, the janitor finds a disc in a locker room that turns out to have VERY mildly interesting stuff on it. As it turns out, this disc contains the memoirs of a disgruntled CIA agent named Osborne Cox (John Malkovich). Linda and Chad figure to capitalize on this find somehow, but their plans go awry. Meanwhile, womanizing Treasury agent Harry (George Clooney) manages to fool around with both Linda and Osbornes' fed-up wife Katie (Tilda Swinton).It's a testament to the abilities of this cast that ""Burn After Reading"" is as entertaining as it is, but the script by the Coens was already pretty amusing. One has to wonder how fools like Linda (who's desperate to ""improve"" her appearance with a series of plastic surgeries) and Chad can possibly extricate themselves from this mess into which they've placed themselves. And Harry has his own problems. Not only has he obsessed over creating his own hilarious gadget, but he ends up faced with a problem that completely unnerves him since he presumably had quite the ""safe"" career. (He claims he's never had cause to draw his weapon.)Clooney and especially Pitt are hilarious. Malkovich does a lot of yelling in an amusingly unsympathetic role. McDormand is a delight. And Richard Jenkins, Elizabeth Marvel (as Harry's wife, a successful author), David Rasche, J.K. Simmons, Olek Krupa, J.R. Horne, and Jeffrey DeMunn add to the hilarity with their expert performances.Everything leads to a priceless series of revelations / resolutions dictated to us by Rasche, and Simmons' reactions in this finale are simply great.Overall, this is a good comedy that is well worth a look.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A very funny comedy from the coen brothers,"The Coen brothers follow-up to last year's successful No Country for Old Men, is an entirely different project. Burn After reading, is downright hilarious, a solid dark comedy, that does a good job showcasing its actors, the writing ability of the Coen brothers, and their unique approach to comedy in films. Now I didn't think it was as great as Barton Fink or the Big Lebowski, but it achieves on a lot of the same levels that those 2 films did, as well as the likes of Fargo.Brad Pitt and John Malkovich are both very good in roles that are not alike stuff we are accustomed to seeing them in, and Frances Mcdormand, is absolutely hilarious and brilliant as an insecure fitness center worker, who dreams of bettering herself for all the wrong reasons. There are some great exchanges between Brad Pitt and Malkovich as well.

Coen Brothers did it again !,"Coen Brothers did it again... I loved ""O'Brother Where are Thou"" made by the duo so much and ""No Country for Old Men"" was terrifying yet entertaining.The latest offering ""Burn After Reading"" falls in league of dark comedies with smart presentation. The Director duo rightfully presented a chain of events due to leak of a secret CIA data. One thing that lead to other was really engrossing and so much fun to watch. The background score was awesome. The beginning and ending of the movie with an aerial view of earth from space was really really innovative for this visual effects lacking movie.In performances, Francis Mc Dormand as Gym worker, online date searcher and looking for cosmetic surgery was simply stand out. Without pretending, her unhappiness with loneliness and growing age was clearly reflected on her performance. Brad Pitt as macho gym instructor was convincing. Tilda Swinton and John Malkovich as frustrated husband-wife pair is fun to watch. What disappointed me was the role of George Cloony.

A great satire,"Burn after reading might not be the absolute best Coen bros. movie but it might be the one I enjoy watching the most.
The Coens have always made movies as parodies of genres, and here obviously the subject is spy movies. Yet it is also in my opinion an understood satire of the American intelligence community and a certain political atmosphere that was prevalent in America when the movie came out.These movies are always such delicate and enjoyable mix between absurd comedy and serious filmmaking. It has a delicate sarcasm, that is very unique. The closest filmmaker with that kind of humour would be Tarantino, but his movies are very distinct stylistically that make them unique in a whole other way.The power of the Coen bros. is that there is no identifiable style. The style of the movie is the style of spy thrillers. Spy Game, the Recruit, Enemy of the State those are the kinds of movie that are made fun of. However, the movie is not overtly a parody, it is subtle and ironic, rather than referential and comedic. There are no real flaws in this movie. It is very funny in a sarcastic way, but they still find ways to have jokes (the Mac or PC line).The actors are all fantastic and give great performances. I think that JK Simmons might be the one with the best performance. But, one of my favourite scene is when John Malkovich spots someone following him and in true spy fashion thinks it is an opposite agent, but then it turns out it is someone delivering him court papers. There is this build-up of the spy craft and intrigue and then it turns out it is this mundane issue, something that could happen to anyone.The movie does this repeatedly. It juxtaposes the spy thriller tropes with the buffoonery of the extramarital affairs of its plot. The movie is laughing constantly at what it shows and invites the audience to laugh with it.
And that is why I enjoy this movie so much, because it does such an efficient job of taking something serious, and in this case the almost ominous tone a lot of the movies of the genre have, and turning it upside down into an absolute farce.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Strange but satisfying,"The Coen brothers' have recently struck form with their dark, tense and stylish neo-Western ""No Country For Old Men"", which was more in tune with their past films such as ""Blood Simple"". With ""Burn After Reading"", they return to the territory of ""The Big Lebowski"", with a dash of ""Fargo"". This is at times hilarious, suddenly brutal and violent and quite bewildering at points. It is hard to describe the experience of watching this strange cocktail unfurl, but, at the end, it is found to be a satisfying experience.This film, which is at its heart an absurdist rip-off of spy films, struggles to find itself, initially. It toys around with the idea of being some kind of modern day, mid-life crisis drama, but this jars with these characters who are designed for farce. As a consequence the film is a slow starter, and throughout the film the ""drama"" comes back briefly and never works, except in the case of Richard Jenkins' gym manager, who is truly sympathetic.After half-an-hour, though, the comedy starts and grows throughout the film. At the head of this is a magnificent performance from Brad Pitt as the idiot Chad. Yes, the character is grotesque and two-dimensional, but it is a brilliant comedy performance with perfect comic timing. The star-filled cast is excellent, though some feel a little constrained (Clooney most obviously). Nevertheless, they and the Coens give this film many memorable moments as the comedy generates from a genre which should be dealing with world powers, where this film is actually concerned with ordinary people doing bizarre things which are, to the outsider, inexplicable. It's all summed up by the brief but memorable appearance of a bewildered J.K. Simmons as a CIA chief. Halfway through he delivers the line ""Report back to me when it makes sense"" and, at the end, he says ""What a Clusterf***"". These, essentially, sum up the film.As for the Coens, although their script is a little confused, their direction is spot on. From the opening shot to the last, they take the parody of overblown spy films to the extreme. The look, sound and feel of the film are nearly perfect. The zooming in for no reason, the ludicrous music and many other stylistic touches make this highly enjoyable at every turn.Is it perfect? No. Not by a long shot. Is it up there with ""Lebowski"" or ""No Country""? No. What is the film then? It is intelligent, bizarre, funny, confused, stylish, confusing, at times brilliant, often strange and a satisfying and enjoyable time at the cinema.4 stars out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Taking the concept of ""comedy of errors"" to a whole new level, ""Burn After Reading"" guarantees laughter for the absurd situations generated","The plot is composed of a network of pathetic characters who have no idea what they are doing, where they are going and where they are fleeing from. Their motives are ridiculous, their interests are petty, and their ambitions are small. But this is their world, and in it they move like rats in a maze, bumping heads and causing small earthquakes wherever they go, without thinking much about the consequences of their actions. And it's amazing how, even so, they manage to advance in their goals, even if they face some penalties and losses along the way.If the structure of the script is surprising, other details conquer the audience even more, such as the ""Greek choir"" (the two policemen played by David Rasche and J. K. Simmons), who comment on the case without being able to understand absolutely nothing of what is happening. There are so many mismatches, mismatched information and wrong perceptions that ultimately lead nowhere that it is impossible not to laugh at such idiocy together. With an amazing cast and an incredible reception from the public, ""Burn After Reading"" achieved an unprecedented feat in the Coens' career - it debuted at 1 at the North American box office! Also critically successful, the film combines good humor with breathtaking performances by actors who are completely committed and confident in their directors, who are sure of what they want and how to get what they are looking for. Finally, there is the soundtrack, which is very entertaining and effectively contributes to creating a climate of constant conspiracy, but completely paranoid.Taking the concept of ""comedy of errors"" to a whole new level, Burn After Reading is the first work the Coens have done without the assistance of fabulous cinematographer Roger Deakins since they started their partnership on Barton Fink, in 1991 (they will be back to collaborate on A Serious Man, next year) - but that doesn't hurt the film as well as it might, since, replacing him with the equally brilliant Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men), the filmmakers do admirably well in their effort to satirize several of the visual tics employed by spy films. In this sense, by the way, it is ironic that the project debuts in Brazil alongside ""Ridley Scott's Body of Lies"", which dives into several of the very same conventions (such as the aerial shot that simulates satellite vision) that the Coens developed. Engage in ridicule.""Burn After Reading"" is, above all, a film of characters and actors. Despite a coherent and thought-provoking story, the gathering of great stars in a work where everyone has an optimal level of paranoia, almost in the Almodóvar style of building his hysterical women, is the main motto for us to create identification with what is being seen. Influenced by the same clichés that compromise so many productions of the style, the characters of ""Burn After Reading"" seem not to know how to differentiate them from reality - and, thus, when they find documents that they deem valuable for National Security, the stupid Chad (Pitt) and Linda (McDormand) can't think of anything better than selling them to the Russians. (Which elicits the following disbelieving reaction from Simmons: ""The Russians? Really?"".) Likewise, the growing paranoia of George Clooney's character, Treasury Agent Harry Pfarrer, sounds pathetic not only because of his false sense of self-importance. Of the subject, but also for the implications that this brings to his strange love life.Clooney, by the way, returns to indulge in the old acting tics that he seemed to have abandoned some time ago: speaking quickly and exaggerating in grimaces and head tilts, he is visibly interested in making people laugh - which, of course, of course, instantly takes away much of the fun your character could have. The same mistake, incidentally, is made by the usually reliable Frances McDormand, whose excess of grimaces already in her first scene establishes a revealing contrast with the much more restrained (and amusing) performance of Jeffrey DeMunn, in a short appearance as a plastic surgeon. On the other hand, John Malkovich, an actor who became fascinating precisely because of his tendency to go overboard, here surrenders completely to histrionics, which proves to be perfect for his unstable character (suffice it to say that he makes the phrase ""What the f...s this?"" a kind of personal catchphrase).And if Tilda Swinton and Richard Jenkins gladly embrace the roles of the project's only ""normal"" characters, doing predictably well as Malkovich's wife and McDormand and Pitt's boss, respectively, it's the amusing J. K. Simmons (better known as Peter Parker's boss and Juno's father) who almost steals the movie in his short but hilarious interventions as a CIA bigwig who asks his subordinates to keep an eye on the actions of the other characters more out of curiosity than worrying about what they might do, as if he just wanted to watch a bunch of clumsy monkeys in the zoo. And if Simmons ""almost steals the film"" it is because Simmons' task was made more difficult by Brad Pitt's impeccable performance - this, yes, the unquestionable highlight of the production. Showing hair with highlights and a different hairstyle than we are used to, the actor embodies Chad as a guy who faces the world around him with empty and stupid eyes that never quite understand what they are seeing. Hilarious in all of his scenes, Pitt rivals one of the dumbest (and funniest) characters in comedy.The impression we get from ""Burn After Reading"" is that all the characters want to do exactly what the title says, burn, destroy, put an end to a chapter of their lives. Divorces, plastic surgeries, changing professions, trying to be brave, trying to hide bigger problems... everyone wants to burn some part of themselves or of a group they are part of, after having read certain actions and dissatisfied with the result. The only character who does not go through this (although he is no less enigmatic or suspicious) is Chad, who, due to his almost innocence and lack of demonstration that he wants to change something about himself, has an uninviting fate, too soon. Throughout the film, these many stories intersect, worsen and culminate in a crossing of catastrophes, an option in the script that disperses the viewer a little. There are many characters in his short chronicles who end up crossing paths due to too many coincidences. This element is even organically placed in the narrative, but it is not good enough to maintain a solid text, with a story from which we can extract more than just an absurdity on the surface of the displeasure of some and the incompetence of others.Perhaps because they wrote the film's screenplay while adapting ""No Country for Old Men"", the Coens opted for a different treatment of violence. As much as there is distinction in the attitude of their characters, they end up being villains, causing bad things for others, even unintentionally. All, however, are very stupid and/or alienated, and most of them are supporters of the cult of the body, of appearance. This beautiful and fitness superficiality that masks the inner ugliness and villainy has a great purpose in itself, but, in a more rigid analysis, it does not support exactly what the film pursues all the time, the directors' humorous and absurd line to talk about. Something seemingly commonplace, targeting the government and its laws and what people in other small institutions expect from it. Here, the Coen brothers surprise the viewer with yet another fine example of the genre - something that, by the way, establishes a revealing contrast with the way they deal with the fate of Josh Brolin's character, in ""No Country for Old Men"", proving the duo's intelligence and good narrative discernment. And what about Clooney's ""invention"" in his basement?With a well-knit cast and inviting cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki - he creates the opposite of the soundtrack, making us feel comfortable and welcome in a universe that is neither one thing nor the other - Burn After Reading is a work of art. Seemingly simple, but with much more to make you think than meets the eye. By this I do not mean that there is psychological depth or quantum subtext in the film. But there is a cynicism embedded in the script that encompasses different sectors of our society, which lives in constant change, burning parts of itself and moving forward, doing its best so that the memory of tragedies is hidden and no one knows about them. As a final result, Burn After Reading guarantees laughter for the absurd situations generated. The way in which events are resolved by the characters is milli metrically calculated and stylized with the characteristic humor of the Coens. However, it lacks the emotional hook that connects the viewer to the film, making the work almost expendable compared to others from the duo, such as Fargo and No Country for Old Men. The serious tone of the work prevents us from interpreting it as pure non-sense comedy, something that works in The Big Lebowski, guaranteeing its quality.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
MY REVIEW: Laugh While Watching!!,"Guy 1 is fired from his job. Girl 1 the wife of Guy 1 does not like it and is already cheating on him by having affair with Guy 2. Guy 2 is also dating one other Girl 2. Girl 2 and his friend Guy 3 find something worth blackmailing Guy 1 for the sake of some quick money. Guy 3 is accidentally killed by Guy 2 in the house of Guy 1 and everything gets messed up. There is also a Guy 4 who is boss of Girl 2 and Guy 3. Guy 4 actually likes Girl 2 a lot but she never sees it. Guy 4 also gets involved in the whole mess. If all this sounds interesting to you, then Burn After Reading is a treat to you because it is packed with witty funny dialogs, unmatched performances and tight execution by Coen brothers. What movie only lacks is the logic that does not seem very important as whatever is happening is just a farce anyway. So sit down, relax and enjoy the ride with talents like George Clooney and Bard Pitt who strangely don't have a single dialog between them in the whole movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Coens entertainingly preach to the choir.,"The Coen's are creative at conjuring up absurd stories to fascinate us. However, I personally feel that Blood Simple and Fargo are still the best examples of their genius.Burn After Reading is darkly humorous, sarcastic, and, as usual, nihilistic. We clearly understand an underlying premise to the story during the end credits when ""CIA man"" is blurted out in raucous song to celebrate the agency's supposed ineptitude.It is easy to recognize a liberal slant (not surprising) in the Coen's endeavor to proselytize. In the beginning, a principal character is accused of having a drinking problem. He recoils to his accuser, ""You're a Mormon. Next to you everyone has a drinking problem."" My first thought: How much more that would have gone over if Mitt Romney had been chosen as McCain's running mate for president. Hollywood is now a ""vatican"" for liberal dogma. My philosophy teaches that to change minds, you should not be afraid to step on everyone's toes. The Coens only preach to the choir.Burn After Reading is full of cultural satire, but lacks universal appeal and is arguably less believable than the lunacy found in Dr. Strangelove: a film just as comically stark yet more appealing to young and old audiences.In any case, this film takes us for an enjoyable ride, but only while it lasts.

Not at all funny,Bad plot - I found this to be just a Misha mash of characters and ideas lumped together. It was at best confusing but mostly just dull. Even worse dialogue. Do they Coen brothers really think that using the same pattern of swearing over and over again constitutes dialogue? It is lazy and annoying. Ordinary acting. Especially Brad Pitt and Tilda Swanson. That raises another point for me that is important in any movie. I just didn't care about any of the characters. They were all devoid of any likable qualities. In short this film was not funny at all! One review said this was laugh out loud funny. It didn't even raise a titter from me!

What a cluster-F...,"Burn after Reading while it may not be the Coen's best effort, succeeds and hits all the right spots. A highly likable dark comedy with an intricate web of storyline and chock-full of hilarious and delightful characters makes this film a winner. It couldn't have been better with the Coen's on board, a saucy, stylish dark comedy that delivers all the punches and succeeds with the narrative and character development. The acting is superb from frequent Coen collaborators Frances McDormand and George Clooney to explosive and charming performances from John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton and Brad Pitt.Although if you sum it all up, you'll find that the plot is basically just an excuse for a movie about nothing but the Coen's made it seem like it is about a lot of things.

Walking A Fine Line Between Nihilistic and Pointless,"This film has been the subject of a heated debate between me and a woman who hates it with irrational passion. If I could summarize her vague but strongly worded points about the film, I would say she found the film to be ""Pointless, artistic for the sake of it without actually making a point"". She often cites a story told in a behind the scenes segment, where the crew describes making Brad Pitt's tie out if felt in an attempt to make him seem more dopey. She makes a decent point, at least about the casting of Brad Pitt. I can't really speak on the tie thing, I haven't been able to find any sources on that.Burn After Reading has everything you would expect from a Coen brothers joint: subtle but adept cinematography, comedically awkward dialgoue that bleeds humanity, charming characters, and a justifiably contrived plot. This is not my favorite Coen brothers film. I'd probably place it somewhere in the middle, below A Serious Man and above O Brother, Where Art Thou (a controversial opinion, I know). That being said, this film has some of my favorite scenes the Coen brothers have ever brought to screen, most of them featuring John Malkovich. Admittedly, the casting in this film is clumsy, but entirely star studded, so it was more or less impossible for the performances to be all that bad.The question of whether or not this film was a success, for me, is in the feeling I had once it was over. I do believe that this film is a successful film about nothing, about how nothing matters, that life is complicated, messy, and usually anticlimactic. I don't think everyone wants to see a movie with an intentionally overcomplicated plot, but for those that do, this movie should be on your list.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

My two cents..,"I am late to this particular message board/thread because tonight was the first time I have watched this movie.I initially was a bit nervous when I saw all the name stars (and who those particular stars were) in the opening credits, although I love these actors and many of the films I previously have seen them in.But, it's been my experience that when you get this many talented folks of this caliber, unique styles, and given the types of projects/genres you usually see them in, together for an ensemble piece like this that takes on the ideas that it does, that there could be a higher probability that the film will devolve into being more of an artist's project for the artists' sakes, and that the script, the direction -- the acting, the emoting -- are going to be more intensive than may be needed at times, and that the story may risk feeling a need to be 'profound' or 'profound-like' in place of finer distinctions and cleverly-placed subtlety that would perhaps ensure a better overall film and viewing experience.Woody Allen has managed to pull off this type of ensemble casting well in some of his films (although he often doesn't care to interject profundity or subtlety), but he also has a somewhat rigid direction style and he doesn't give many of his actors much time to mull over their roles, frequently giving them their scripts, or skeletal scripts to allow some ad lib, the very day of a shoot.I thought Malkovich was suited for his role.Pitt was miscast to the point that someone on this board thought that he was gay.Jenkins was good but did not say much.Frances McDormand was good but still miscast. Clooney despite being outshined by the other cast member was not miscast and thus fun to watch.I almost expected Phillip Seymour Hoffman to do a five min cameo due to the cast heavy approach by the director.I don't want to sound unkind by pointing out the high rates of narcissism that can be found in the acting profession because I have some dear friends who are actors, narcissistic traits aren't necessarily a bad thing when in this particular profession, and any 'downside' from this can often be ameliorated if there is good strong direction to help support when it can be of value to a project, but also to reel it in when it can be a deficit.I just feel that you put too many of these types of folks -- folks who often play quirky or standout/standalone, and often unforgettable, characters in film -- together in a project like this, that there will be expectations, however tacit those expectations may be, of each one having their own unique, quirky, and/or profound character to play and lines to deliver, and after awhile this amalgam can morph into a 'herding cats' situation -- it can become crowded and non-cohesive.Then, if you add layer upon layer of several intertwining metaphors (some very obvious while others were more subjective/projective 'Rorschach test' metaphors), drama-esque exchange relationships, stark punctuating events, the characters milling about in their foggy and/or distorted views of life and love and death, and most not being able to truly attach, or for any length of time, against the backdrop of an underlying message that 'everyone lives and dies alone', while simultaneously being the star in their own life drama AND while being an 'every man/woman', that you risk ending up with overly spiced mud soup. More is not always better.As I said, there *were* parts of this movie that I did like, but the further I got into the movie, the more out of control the structure and direction seemed to be -- the more the characters came together the more disjointed they seemed to become, and not for any redeeming value that I could ascertain and I'm not sure that it was all that intentional. I suppose it could be yet another metaphor for something like the inevitable entropy of the life process along multiple dimensions, but that would be stretching it a bit thin.A clever idea overall, but one I feel that had too many cooks and too many customers in the kitchen without enough structure, without enough reinforcing of 'less can be more' when needed, and I must say that it did come off a bit pretentious here and there.I had a similar experience with 'Angels in America' – I absolutely loved the first half or so of that series and there were certainly bizarre, unsettling, and 'swervy' scenes in the first parts, but the latter part just seemed to wander off and then over a cliff.So.some people absolutely love this film while others don't think so highly of it.I say: Enjoy a film if you like it!Just my two cents.Peace Out :)",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Burn Before Watching,"This movie isn't so much bad as it is disappointing, given the A-list cast and the Cohen brothers' flair for dark deadpan comedy. Whereas the likes of Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski were able to weave quirky supporting characters and bizarre situations into an engaging main narrative featuring a strong lead, here there is no lead and the entire ensemble is a bunch of supporting characters in extended cameos. The ostensible main narrative, such as it is, is flaccid and uninteresting. The whole thing is a series of quasi-comedic vignettes about relationships but without a compelling foundation or cohesive frame. The filmmakers were apparently trying to go self-deprecating and meta in the final lines (spoken by J. K. Simmons.) But unlike Barton Fink, here the attempt feels trite and lazy.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Nutshell Review: Burn After Reading,"Fresh off their triumphant victories with various awards for No Country For Old Men, the Coen Brothers Joel and Ethan return to open this year's edition of the Venice Film Festival with a colourful satire in Burn After Reading. Writing this screenplay in between that of No Country's, these two movies couldn't be any more different from each other, one sombre in mood, and this one very much lighter, but no doubt having a chock full of undercurrents flowing throughout its relatively breezy pace.Watching this movie and sitting through the web of relationships between the characters, would also play on your mind how each of them are linked through six degrees of separation. For instance in Michael Clayton, George Clooney and Tilda Swinton share only one intense scene toward the finale which was quite powerful, but here, they turn into strange bedfellows when their characters Harry and Katie share beds and makes a cuckold out of Katie's husband Osbourne (John Malkovich). Or how the Ocean 11/12/13 collaborators in Clooney and Brad Pitt grace this film by sharing one crucial scene which turns the tide of the mood. It also marks the return of Coen movie regulars Clooney and especially Frances McDomrmand, having roles in Fargo, Barton Fink and Raising Arizona. And that's already discounting future collaborations with Swinton and Pitt in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. The list goes on to muddle your mind.I'm still at awe with admiring the Coen's screenplay for Burn After Reading. Characters get so carefully crafted that they're never one dimensional, each with their own load of problems to deal with, and having almost everyone related in some way to another. It begins in a rather mundane fashion with Malkovich's Osbourne being surplus at Langley, before heading home to prepare for a party of sorts with wife Katie, whom we learn is having an affair with Harry. To have a brief introduction of the main players, we have gym personal trainers in Brad Pitt's Chad, whose colleague Linda (Frances) is having a professional and personal crisis in being too old looking for the job, and wanting to undergo a costly plastic makeover.Throw in some infidelity amongst the characters, and you have a premise set up for pandemonium when Osbourne's memoirs somehow got leaked, and begins as a catalyst for a series of events that will turn everyone's life topsy turvy, bringing out wonderful performances from the ensemble cast. You'll have rug after rug being repeatedly pulled from under your feet by the extremely mischievous screenplay, while on one hand taking its time to build up some strange tension, and on the other just let everything that could turn into comedy, punctuate their way throughout.It's a fantastic satire on the state of intelligence of the intelligence gatherers and community in general, where troops on the ground get unceremoniously dismissed despite the good work done because they don't know how to play boardroom politics, where people high up the food chain just want to hear what they want to hear, only the good stuff and none of the bullshit problems, making decisions on fanciful whims to nobody's advantage, sweeping aside anything that could be kept in a closet, or swept under the rug. Ordinary folks too were not spared, with the poking of fun in people's fears in the current environment, as well as blowing things way out of proportion, making mountains out of molehills, thinking that there is value in blackmail.We know how Brad Pitt can turn out some of the most amazing performances. From the brooding cop in Se7en to the crazed inmate in 12 Monkeys and his action-figure role as Achilles in Troy, I'm inclined to say that his innocent gym trainer role here beat them all. As Chad the simpleton, it's just incredible how his little nuances speak volumes, and one of the most memorable scenes involve those where Chad acts out his ""good Samaritan"" role, trying to be more than meets the eye, only to great comical effect. The other role that stood out is George Clooney's Harry, who's somewhat of a sexual predator, and cooking up something that would not look out of place in a typical Wong Jing movie, possibly getting the thumbs up for the most innovative device created.That said, Burn After Reading is an excellent watch and comes highly recommended.

Our National Security,"In the tradition of Fargo, the Coen Brothers have come up with an ironic comedy
which plays havoc wit our national security and shows how paranoid folks get
about it. There's also an 'on the other hand' in this film where it could be argued that a bit of paranoia is healthy every now and then.John Malkovich is an employee at the CIA whom his employers would like to ease out of his job. But Malkovich who drinks a lot won't take any hints. It's
put to him bluntly to get out and he does. But he also dictates a memoir on a
computer disc.Said memoir is found at a gym Malkovich goes to by employees Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt. Not being the brightest two around they decide this
might be worth some big bucks to somebody. Even the Russians.My mind goes back to the Cold War days when such a film could never have
been made. Apparently the concept of treason is not factored in anyone's
thinking. Including married bureaucrat
George Clooney who is kanoodling with Tilda Swinton who is married to
Malkovich. Loyalty and fidelity are out the window too. Clooney finds out about the memoir and decides to also exploit the situation. He's being watched, but for his extramarital activities.Burn After Reading has a necessary anti-climax where top level CIA hears a

Zany screwball paranoid thriller with faux suspense and real laughs...,"Remember that quote from Bart Simpson about cartoons being just a bunch of hilarious moments with no messages at all?Well, you can believe ""Burn After Reading"" says something about the incompetence of secret services, the growing paranoia of the post-9/11 era and how you could make a mountain of nonsense out of the smallest piece of randomness, it's tempting to see some hidden meanings behind the madly elaborate plot, but I'd rather take the 'Bart Simpson' option and see this as another proof that the Coen brothers don't need to conform to any specific style or narrative. In other words, they're just having fun.And why shouldn't they? After ""No Country for Old Men"", they probably wanted to get back to their roots and make a screwball comedy à la ""Raising Arizona"" without the luxury of a heart-warming subplot, though Frances McDormand's obsession with her plastic surgery carries something poignant despite the ridiculous height her obsession reaches. The Coens had won a Best Picture Oscar with a movie that provided one of their most iconic characters, they couldn't possibly surpass themselves two years in a row, so before turning to more serious movies, they had to make ""Burn After Reading"". I read many critics trying to give it more meaningfulness than it has, but what these critics lack is obvious perspective, when you realize that they made after it their personal masterpiece, ""A Serious Man"", you see ""Burn After Reading"" as a relaxed step backwards before another big leap.And relaxed seems like the fitting word, it is remarkable how the actors are having fun playing either against type or their usual type to over the top proportions, revealing so many weaknesses and insecurities you realize this is one of these rare instances where a film is only driven by losers, even ""Fargo"" had bad-ass state trooper Marge Gunderson played by Frances McDormand.Speaking of this great actress, we know she's never been a sex symbol or bound to pretty glamorous roles, so it's a credit... even if they used a double- to her to set the tone right at the start when we see a doctor checking the flaws of every single part of her body, her floppy underarms, her belly but there's no voyeurism in that scene, nor is it played for cheap laughs. It is the most important scene of the film, because for all the hilarious gags it paves the way to, if the film ever had one pillar, one pattern, one unshakable element is Linda Litzke's desire to have a complete plastic surgery. Unrealistic? My wife wanted a nose surgery ever since I married her, now, she's done it so I could relate to Linda's obsession. Actually, I was surprised by the number of situations I could relate to.The film opens with the firing of CIA analyst Osbourne Cox because of an alcoholism problem and the way the whole scene is played works perfectly. I giggled a little during the interactions between John Malkovich (Cox) and his officer (David Harshe) but then I laughed during the confrontation with his wife, a domineering nagging ""stuck-up bitch"" played by Tilda Swinton, accusing him of relying on her money. And I lost it when he said he was going to pull himself together and do some... consulting or that he's always dreamed to be a writer. Anyone who's been unemployed know that ""consulting"" and ""writing"" are like the euphemism for being a job-less schmuck moving in circles and slippers in your home. Some fancy words to describe the obvious yes, Cox is a loser and his wife makes him even more of a loser, she is just so unbearable, you've got to wonder what Harry found in her.Which takes us to Harry, George Clooney as a man married to a successful children book writer... also a bored womanizer. At first, Clooney plays it like his usual Cary Grant of the 2000's but then he channels the performance of Tom Ewell in ""The Seven-Year Itch , it's fun to see actors playing in or against their own tropes, Tilda Swinton being more stuck-up and pompous than usual or Clooney trying to convince us that he can be a loser too. But the gold medal of playing against type belongs to Brad Pitt, I wasn't fond of his Aldo Raine in"" InglouriousBasterds"" but ""Burn After Reading"" was the perfect platform for an over-the-top comedic performance, as a dim-witted gymnasium Dude who try to play a game too big for him, and endanger his life while a simple smack in his face almost ran him to tears. Pitt's performance is a highlight in a movie, you could tell he was still carried away by his zany persona in Tarantino's movie but it didn't fit.Here it does because the film IS a joke, it's not meant to make a point but to make you laugh, there is some intelligence behind its seemingly pointlessness but there are two key characters in the film who act like a Greek chorus. The officer who fired Cox and his boss played by JK Simmons, their reactions to the current events are just pure bafflement, they're powerless and can only wait for ensuing development. They perfectly embody our position as viewers and while not tying the movie together, the ending provides the perfect punch-line, not that it doesn't end in a rather anticlimactic way, but it's a movie whose McGuffin is a CD that is given more value than it deserves, maybe a clever reference to the film's plot. Who cares of its meaning when it's played for gags? When even a simple picture of Putin hanging in the background make you laugh for no reason.Once again, the only unshakable truth is that Linda wants her plastic surgery, and that's enough to drive a plot, and everyone crazy in the process, Americans, Russian and CIA included.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Enter the original post Cold War entertainment,"The casting was hit or miss. Amazing work by Brad Pitt, John Malkovich and all of the supporting actors. I did not believe Tilda Swinton, George Clooney, and Frances McDormand. Their profiles were too posh and the acting too detached and sophisticated to work with the plot.Cinematography and soundtrack were exquisite. The story was there. In order to create proper comedy from stupidity you have to get to that level of stupidity, rather than just look down on ""the idiots"". It is a good movie to just watch, thinking is optional.The Cold War bit is a trope which was tiresome and boring to watch. Would have been funnier if they went to the media.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pleasant surprise,"I really didn't know what to expect from the film at first, though 'Burn After Reading' managed to exceed any expectation I could've had.The cast performs tremendously well, Brad Pitt's character in particular, who actually made me laugh more than once, (which doesn't happen quite often when I watch a comedy film nowadays). But also Frances McDormand has some pretty funny moments. George Clooney and John Malkovich, however, I thought are less interesting than the other characters, although their acting is top notch! Tilda Swinton isn't in the film for laughs, but rather to tie loose ends together and she does that rather well with her more than bitchy character.The plot is also quite interesting, though maybe confusing at first. Actually, the whole story revolves around nothing important. Then everything gets blown out of proportion because of the stupidity of the characters, which makes this film so funny. All of the characters are tied together in a complex way, with some pretty dark comedy as a result. Truth to be told, dark humor is required in order to like this film. It aren't really the jokes that make the film interesting, but rather the situations and the responses to those situations by the characters.All in all, I think anyone who appreciates dark humor and an unconventional plot, will also appreciate 'Burn After Reaing'.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Fast paced and witty,"This film is about two gym employees trying to sell a CD Rom that they believe contains confidential CIA data. Their plans go horribly wrong, costing them in ways they never imagine.""Burn After Reading"" is enjoyable to watch. It is fast paced, witty and has lots of twists. It has got a great cast so watching them is already a pleasure. Characters are introduced and developed well, and I care about them. Out of all the characters, I like Ted (Richard Jenkins) the best because he is the most sympathetic. He did not know about the plot until right at the end, but got dragged into it with a rather sad result. Chad (Brad Pitt) feels a little weird, I think Brad Pitt is not so suited to the gym instructor role.The ending is a little rushed, as it wraps up the fate of all the characters in a short scene.

Not excellent but a good and likable little watch,"With the Coen brothers you maybe expect a great film, filled to the brim with smart jokes and a super engaging plot. With Burn After Reading you kind of get both but just not as much as you'd like, sure the movie is funny and the story gets oddly thrilling after a little while, but I did feel maybe this was not what they were going for. Nevertheless the Coen's do create something intriguing and different and also add in a cast that is just top class really, I could say they squander the chance to use them fully but in any way, the movie is better having them in it.The story basically revolves around a few different things, we have John Malkovich's character Osbourne Cox who knows his wife (Tilda Swinton) is up to something. George Clooney plays a player of sorts, married but definitely wanting some things on the side, Brad Pitt alongside Frances McDormand as gym workers who find some CIA files(but aren't really all that important). All the things that go on you could say are intertwined together and I think that is what the Coen's achieve well as they seem to be able to mix everything well but also fit it into the relatively short running time.As for the brothers direction we see a kind of fast paced approach, the writing also means that the characters lines are really speedy, the plot does actually gain from this as it never gets bogged down in boring chatter. I think the best part of having the Coen's on this movie is that it can at times get weirdly dark humour and then seemingly seconds later a kind of silly joke backs it up too, they make it funny in a few ways, but it isn't always that hilarious. I can see why some people and critics disliked the movie, it starts very slow and after 20 to 30 minutes I felt maybe this would progress into a piece of pretentious movie making but I was mistaken. Don't get me wrong the movie isn't great and I was far from loving it but I did like it and I think many will too if you haven't seen it, worth a re-watch actually one day.The Coen's achieve in this movie what I feel they wanted, to make each character a complete idiot, everyone in this has their own insane issues or stupid actions, it culminates at the end in which I felt was a strong ending. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography also gives us a nice vibe within all the comedy, some of the shots onto the stars faces are great and the camera moves fast quite a bit, it not only draws you into the picture but also lets you enjoy the little things the movie has to offer (Brad Pitt chewing gum is somehow engaging).I think although this is not the Coen brothers best work it still stands up and shows us what they can do with comedy yet again. I think they wanted fun and they got it, not only is the film good entertainment but it also brings us characters that by the end whether we care about them or not, are still enjoyable to watch. I also just want to commend Brad Pitt and George Clooney for their roles here I mean Pitt is hilarious at times and really gets into the role; he makes ordinary scenes more lively. Clooney is at his comedic best and we don't always see it from him, the jokes the script gives him are delivered well and there is one seen when he is kind of a little shocked in the park (won't ruin the plot) and the faces he makes are just fantastic.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Coen's Return to the Roots,"""Burn After Reading"" was an incredible effort from the Coen brothers, right up there with classics like ""Blood Simple,"" ""Fargo,"" and ""the Big Lebowski"" - you can even see how the film draws from its predecessors. One can see why the critics panned it, it is quite odd - but the didn't the same thing happen to ""Lebowski"" a decade ago?. The Coen's like to mix up their films (""Lebowksi"" after ""Fargo,"" ""Reading"" after ""No Country"") - and they shouldn't be faulted for it. The movie, very ""Lebowski"" meets ""Pulp Fiction"" - yet much more complex features masterful performances from Frances McDormand, George Clooney and Brad Pitt (who, in my opinion, should rival Heath Ledger in early Oscar consideration for Best Supporting Actor). Tilda Swinton and John Malkovich toed the line, and J.K. Simmons does a great job in a small cameo at the films end. The films strength is the acting - the plot is weak at times (perhaps even unconsciously borrowing elements from ""Pulp Fiction"") - but the cast pulls it through. Pitt's mannerisms are worth the cost of admission alone. Clooney's character is questionable, but he saves it with his Carey Grant-esquire charm. To enjoy this film one would have to be either a Coen brothers fan or a fan of cinema - the casual movie-goer would likely pan it (like so many critics). Definitely a must see - but you can probably put it off until the DVD release.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fargo meets the CIA,"When the Coen Brothers deliver comedy, it's usually not the belly-laugh kind of humor. Their humor is more subtle, resulting from the activities of ordinary humans caught up in ordinary life situations. BURN AFTER READING is no exception. I took away 2 stars for only one reason - that I've seen the ""basic"" plot done before (and done better).The basic plot - a CIA employee is called into his supervisor's office to be given a demotion. The CIA employee then decides to leave the agency and write his memoirs. Afterward, all hell breaks loose. This is the basic plot behind BURN AFTER READING ... but is also the same basic plot behind the 1980 film, HOPSCOTCH.But back to BURN AFTER READING. The motivating force behind the plot has less to do with the CIA analyst's memoirs and more to do with one woman's fierce determination to raise enough money to pay for four cosmetic surgical procedures. It would not be a spoiler to say that, by the end of the film, she gets her wish. This is because the complicated maze of intrigue and farce needed to achieve that end is what propels the film.Again, the Coen Brothers deliver a solid film that connects all the dots of plot in such a way that it entertains - in a deadpan way, perhaps, but that's their forte. I only differ with other reviewers in one respect. I think the MOST solid performance was delivered by John Malkovich ... who plays the somewhat manic CIA analyst whose memoirs create deadly headaches for himself and a number of others who come into contact with those memoirs - directly or otherwise.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Oh Dear,"I think the funniest thing about this movie is the comments being left to confirm it as 'such great work' or comments where people are simply gushing that it's definitely 'one of the coen brothers' best?? I was in a cinema packed full of people to watch this 'comedy'. With such a high profile cast, this film surely should have been a doubtless hit? I think not. The only thing comical about it was laughing about how utterly boring it was whilst we walked out of the cinema around an hour into it (and I'm amazed we gave it that long).For those lovely people leaving such insulting comments on threads about how some people may be too stupid to catch on to the comedic moments - I'm reassured that those commenting are clearly biased fans of the Coen brothers, considering that we were followed out of the cinema by plenty of people equally as p**sed off about the fact that they'd spent good money to waste time watching a film trying to be something it clearly isn't (a comedy).",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Report back to me when it makes sense,"""Burn after reading"" (2008) is the last episode of the trilogy of idiocy the Coen brothers made with George Clooney starring as the idiot. The earlier episodes are ""O brother, where art thou?"" (2000) and ""Intolerable cruelty"" (2003).The film was a disappointment after the highly rated ""No country for old men"" (2007). Personally I don't like ""No country for old men"" very much so I would rather compare the film with ""Fargo"" (1996). In both cases an attempted extortion by amateurs goes horribly wrongHowever also this comparison with ""Fargo"" is to the detriment of ""Burn after readuing"". ""Fargo"" is darker and the characters have more complexity. The characters of ""Burn after reading"" are more caricatured in nature. This sets a limitation on the performances of the cast, which besides George Clooney consists of stars such as Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich and Tilda Swinton. They all give a decent performance and their characters are funny in a peculiar way, but it remains rather superficial. The only exception possibly being the performance of Frances McDormand symbolizing a body culture that is hard to combine with female emancipation.As already said the extortion is done by amateurs and lacks any logic. When the Russian embasy gets involved and the CIA gets interested they have a hard time discovering the (non existing) logic behind the scheme. One CIA boss sighs: ""Report back to me when it makes sense."". It never does!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

There are some good moments in it and if you're bored it's worth a look but don't expect anything too amazing because you won't, in my opinion, get it.

"If you get it and you get the Coen brothers, you'll love this film","Sometimes the most genius films are the ones that draw the most criticism. ""Burn After Reading"" may never reach the elite of IMDb top 250 and confuse and bother a lot of viewers, but if that's you, then you simply have yet to watch enough Coen brothers films to understand and appreciate the deep intelligence that this film possesses though it acts like it doesn't have.Famous in their comedies for creating over-the-top idiots who concoct schemes way over their heads, the Coen brothers have made no exceptions with ""Burn After Reading."" This time everyone's missing something, usually the common sense part of the brain, but the trouble is caused by two gym employees (Pitt and McDormand) who come across a CD with CIA code on it belonging to an ex-CIA analyst (Malkovich), thinking they can blackmail him and make money.Surrounding all that are other characters vital to the story: Malkovich's wife (Swinton) and her lover (Clooney) who is having multiple other affairs regularly in spite of his marriage. Much of the conflict and plot in this actually revolves around the shambled marriages of these couples and actually not on the CD, which of course is all part of the point.Like all Coen brothers films, including their award-winning ""No Country For Old Men,"" when you sit back and think about this film everything seems to click. It's difficult to explain without revealing the plot, but the important thing to keep in mind when viewing this film is that it plays on our perceptions of movies being great mystery thrillers that you have to try and figure out. You also need to remember that it's supposed to be a comedy. The Coen brothers will do everything to trick you into thinking it's more than just a comedy, but it's not.Comedy is also not a word used lightly. This is easily the funniest Coen brothers film short of ""The Big Lebowski"" and what's even better is it has guys like Pitt and Clooney playing complete goofballs unlike their usual typecast. This is easily the most enjoyable part of the film. Actors like McDormand, Malkovich and JK Simmons continue to provide the Coen brothers more great talent for their gem of a script.The Coen brothers want you to take ""Burn After Reading"" seriously and will use all of Hollywood's standard smoke and mirrors to align this film with your mental framework about movies (suspenseful music, dramatic and thoughtful camera angles, etc.) but the ability to step back and understand the directors' intent here is the key to loving this film instead of liking or being completely confused by it. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

The premise is flimsy and the characters with one or two exceptions are unlikeable. Pitt's portrayal ranks alongside his outstanding effort in ""Snatch"", and Clooney's comedic talents have long been on show, but for mine Malkovich was one paced, Tilda Swinton wooden and Frances McDormand sounded too much as if she'd just stepped out of her police uniform and off the set of ""Fargo"". For me a great disappointment watching a film patiently anticipated.

If you've seen the previews, you've seen about half of the funny parts. There are a few more good moments, but they are few and far between. Really far between. Several times during the movie I realized how long the entire audience had been silent. Silence is a great sign for a drama, lousy for a comedy. The actors do a fine job with the material, but the material just isn't that good. Seeing Brad Pitt and George Clooney make funny faces can only carry a movie so far.

The Coens strike lucky with another hit,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningCIA big shot Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) is uncerimoniously fired from his high level job over an apparent drinking problem and tries to solve his woes by writing his memoirs of his time with the agency.

Unknown to him, she and her work colleague Chad (Brad Pitt) have got their hands on a copy of Osbourne's memoirs...and this plunges them all into a chaotic game of cat and mouse, by turns hilarious and deadly.You know when you're watching a Coen Brothers film. No other directors can match their unique sense of style and atmosphere. And given most of their films have tended to be good rather than bad, this isn't a bad thing. Though their preferred staple genre would appear to be the thriller mould, they have always toyed with elements of humour and absurdity, and Burn After Reading is the first film of theirs that I thought tended to focus more on this than the thriller part. And, like the long list of thrillers they've made before it, it's a genre they've pulled off well.As the main character, Malkovich has to carry the film, and as intense a dramatic actor as he can be, here he is given a springboard to show how funny he can be too. His voice and the way he pronounces words, mixed with the awkward and far out situations he finds himself in here, make for comedy gold. In support, Clooney has aged so his good looks aren't something to fall back on so much, but he's his usual chirpy wise guy persona. Coens regular McDormand gives her all in her role too, and there's decent support from Pitt and Swinton as well.It ends rather abruptly, but by the time it comes, all you're really left wondering is: will the Coens ever make a really 'bad' film? ****",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Interesting story that brings together people whom...,seemingly have nothing in common. The basic story is the Cox's are getting a divorce. Osbourne Cox just got fired from the CIA and is writing a book. He loses his CD that contains his rough draft at the gym. Two gym employees think it is a CD filled with top secrets. First they blackmail Osbourne for cash unsuccessfully; Then they try to sell the info to the Russians.All of these circumstances lead to some very unfortunate events in everyone's lives.Some of the funny points are Linda just wants the cash for multiple plastic surgeries to help her image at the gym. She uses online dating and that's how she meets Harry. It just happens that Harry is also having an affair with Osbourne's wife and is being followed by the CIA. The CIA has no problem with disposing of bodies. It's too bad about the hatchet and the gym manager.

Laugh While Watching,"Burn After Reading is an infectious comedy from those pesky Coen brothers. Too bad that many reviewers here couldn't appreciate it. Like all Coen movies, it's strange and often unlike anything else you've seen before. It's fairly characteristic of them rather than a departure from their previous style, so if you've enjoyed their old movies then you should check this one out.I think it's the kind of movie that grows on you, and which you're going to like even better over the years; the movie has many subtleties in it which you can only spot and appreciate over repeated viewings. But don't worry, you'll get most of it the first time.Essentially, the movie shows fairly average beltway denizens behaving stupidly, with a good amount of bureaucracy and bad luck stirred in for good measure. It's not so much intellectual satire as much as smart slapstick. I'm not going to go into the cast, but it's both A-list and excellent. Even the bit parts are memorable, and will hopefully provide rich pickings for other directors. And it's got David Rasche (Sledge Hammer) in it, and he's awesome yet again!Kind of hard to rate this one, but for sheer entertainment value it'd be a straight ten.Just a few Q&A's you might want to know about this movie:*Is it a poignant satire of the CiA? A damning indictment of the American secret service and military community in general? Or of the Bush administration? -- Not really. It's not political, it's simply a comedy.*Many people seem not to have liked this, why? -- Beats me. Maybe they were expecting poignant political satire, when really the movie is just comedy. And the story is fairly complex so that you're left a bit puzzled when the titles roll.*What's that wedge pillow which Clooney's character takes with him when he's leaving his lover? -- It's a sex wedge, a pillow designed to facilitate the bumping of uglies.

a funny film about stupid people,"There is one mis-perception that this film fixed in my mind - there are not really funny films about stupid people. Stupid people are ... well ... stupid, their behavior is by definition subject of easy jokes, so for smart and educated audiences laughing at stupid people comes together with a feeling of guilt. No fun.What makes 'Burn After Reading' different then? I think that one of the reasons is that this is not only a comedy about stupid people, but more about a stupid people in a stupid system. The Coens attack, catch, and dissect a lot of holy cows of the American political system (the CIA, the government secrecy), morality (matrimonial fidelity), social habits (Internet dating, the gym) and national obsessions (the shrink, the divorce lawyer, the plastic surgery).Almost nothing that is a cliché in the average American behavior escapes becoming a victim of their cynical look.While the script has certainly its role in the success of the comic experience, the story by itself does not try to be more than a funny chain of coincidences that hit a bunch of characters that act according to their immediate instincts and bad planning, something that brings us back to the time of the great comedies in the 30s and 40s of the past century. It would have been of no special effect without the master story telling skills of the Coen brothers, which pace their gags and laughs in the 96 minutes of screening (low figures well below recent Hollywood average).Overall however the film succeeds through the perfect casting, and the brilliant manner by which the Coens succeed to bring the best out of their actors. John Malkovitch is an actor of all seasons, one of those that brings his personality in any role he does. Not here, where he melds into the alcoholic spy clerk, who loses his useless job and wife, hates the whole world and nobody cares about him, his life, or even about him losing the secrets he was supposed to have learned during his career. Frances McDormand who was the Coen's unexpected heroine in 'Fargo' is back in the role of a gym clerk who does not hesitate to betray her country to finance plastic surgery, but worries even more being in time at her workplace after leaving the Russian embassy. Brad Pitt is her gym trainer companion, looking flat-minded and younger than in the teen years of his role as Benjamin Button.And then George Clooney. I feel every time that I write about Clooney in the last few years that I need to apologize (to myself of course, as he does not read me or care) for having underestimated his talent and having considered him yet another TV actor and beautiful face. His work as a director and his last performances as an actor are better and better. Here he is superb, the happy husband who cheats his wife with Internet dates without knowing the reason, the involuntary and hysterical killer who associates with other stupid people in senseless actions.Yes, it's a cynical view of the world - but hey, this is entertainment, these are the Coen brothers.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Leaden Unlikeable comedy,"To be honest I only made it to the end of this out of a sense of duty, being an admirer of the Coens, but a more tedious and unfunny comedy comedy would be hard to imagine. The major problem is the sheer unlikeability of the characters, narcissistic, cynical and devious. After 15 minutes I was ready to quit, but the appearance of the reliably quirky Frances Mcdormand, managed to sustain my interest a little longer.Another major problem is the lack of funny situations. A guy having his head shot off in the closet is not funny. Neither is another one being hacked to death. Nor is having Malkovitch and Clooney engage in such displays of wit as ""f**k you you f**ker!"" What ever happened to the Coens's ability to write evocative and witty dialogue? The only mildly amusing scene was the unveiling of the mechanised dildo machine in Clooney's basement, but that had absolutely no relation to the rest of the film.Incidentally, it is revealing that the only people who end stickily are a couple of ordinary and inoffensive guys who work at the gym, and not any of the selfish wealthy narcissists. I'm guessing this is a little window into how Hollywood views the common man nowadays.The dreadful ending seems to have been conceived in the wake of No Country For Old Men. In that the ending worked, but comedy is a different business and the Coens have conceived enough good ones to know that.This is perhaps the first film of the Coens where I sense they might be succumbing to their own hype.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very Funny Black Comedy - A Coen Brothers Tour de Force,"The movie follows an unlikely scenario where a data file is discovered on the floor of a gym which is then used by staff members to attempt to extort money.This film is very 'Fargo' like with the funniest moments being the most gruesome. There is definitely a shock factor when a surreal plot in a contemporary environment suddenly shows violent acts such as the Brad Pitt punch on the nose.I loved this film and found it very funny but I laughed out loud during Fargo as well so I guess I'm just a sucker for well made, well acted black comedies.I recommend it highly and I have been surprised to read that some people did'nt find it a real belly laugh - takes all sorts I guess....",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Lighter But Still Good,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which sees the Coen's get back on more comedic ground after the darkness of ""No Country For Old Men"".I think I read somewhere that a lot of movies are about ordinary people who find themselves in extraordinary situation through no fault of their own. In this film the characters seem to get themselves into trouble through their own character flaws, greed, stupidity,paranoia,and hubris to name a few.The acting is excellent. Pitt has no problem making himself look foolish. Malkovich plays the self absorbed former CIA agent brilliantly. McDormand is great as the unhappy gym worker, determined to turn her life around at almost any cost. However I find myself tiring of twitches in Clooney's performance that he seems rely on in most of his comedic performances such as in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" and ""Intolerable Cruelty"". Pesonally I was delighted to see David Rasche, from the brilliant ""Sledge Hammer"" TV show of many years ago.It is certainly miles away from ""No Country..."" but the Coens still though a few curve-balls at us when we least expect them and that helps the film rise above run of the mill comedies.Treat yourself to a good laugh, go and see this.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Confederacy of Dunces,"Burn After Reading is a smart dark comedy about a cross section of DC area paranoids and functional idiots who seem determined to bungle their way to self destruction. Redeemable qualities are hard to find in any of these self absorbed but engagingly quirky characters who actively deceive partners while unconsciously living an existence of self deception themselves. It can and does make for a lethal combination.CIA operative Osborne Cox refuses a demotion and quits his post much to the chagrin of his ice cold wife whose having an affair with Harry Pffarer a US Marshall and a sex addict. Cox decides to write his memoirs but has a disk of material lifted by his wife whose about to begin divorce proceedings against him. The disk is then lost at a gym where two brainless, body conscious employees hatch a bribery scheme against Cox. Matters are further complicated when Harry begins an affair with Linda Litsky, one of the extortionists. Before you know it the CIA and the Russians are involved.This is the sharpest film the talented team Coen has made since The Big Lebowski. By insinuating much and revealing little they slyly keep the audience off balance throughout with a blend of comic detours and sudden violence. Their signature unpredictable style is well in evidence as they refashion stark characters of similar plots and manipulate star power to their advantage by casting Hollywoods two reigning hearthrobs, George Clooney and Brad Pitt to play narcissistic nitwits, which they do with aplomb.Francis McDormand as the dense Linda, John Malkovich as Cox, Tilda Swinton as his wife and Richard Jenkins as the gym owner are all letter perfect as well. Peripheral characters also register heavily, providing the Coens room for some Swiftian social commentary. A cosmetic surgeon, a divorce lawyer and two high ranking clueless CIA officers who confuse the audience and themselves in an hilarious epilogue say reams about today's society.Burn After Reading displays the Coens once again at the top of their game with an original and refreshing work that avoids the formulaic boilerplate and works outside the Hollywood box. It's visually tame for the Coen's but edited and paced in a way that demands such restraint, accenting both the suspense and the comedy with subtle movements that hold the same weight and impact of some of their grander flourishes. In doing so they have re-stated their claim to being America's best film makers.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Clumsy And Mean Spirited,"Just when the Coen brothers start getting some respect from me (No Country for Old Men) they put out something like Burn After Reading that makes me start to dislike them again. Smug, Smart Ass and Condescending the movie seems to be a joke on the audience (how dare you take us seriously!) If this is satire, its pretty heavy handed. As a comedy it comes up short as well. There are some sporadic laughs but they aren't really worth the investment. The plot in a nutshell: 2 brain challenged Health Club workers (McDormand and Pitt) come across a computer disk left by an nut case ex-CIA agent (Malkovich) When the ex-agent (who's just been fired) doesn't want to give them a reward, (it's his memoirs) they decide to see if the Russian embassy might want to buy it. Malkovich is married to Tilda Swinton who is having an affair with George Clooney who is also boinking McDormand on the side. It all sounds complicated, but it isn't very involving or funny. The movie takes a long time to get going, then it doesn't really go anywhere. One scene where someone is dispatched is so clumsily shot and edited you aren't sure what happened. Another likable character in the film is killed off and we are supposed to laugh at the gruesome details. The actors are mostly wasted though Pitt, McDormand and Malkovich do wring some laughs out of it. THe 2 actors who play he CIA agents come off best. All in all, a major disappointment. For die hard Coen fans only.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Burn After Reading"" is one quirky comedic ride with great acting from everyone involved.","Coming off of the hype surrounding ""No Country for Old Men"", Joel and Ethan Coen go back to their roots with this hilarious, offbeat comedy. While this humor might not be for everyone, this film is a delight for the die-hard fans of the Coens. Both Joel and Ethan are brilliant directors, writers, and producers as they have proved with each and every film they have released. ""Burn After Reading"" is probably their quirkiest film to date and with the help of the stellar cast, it could go down as one of their best.""Burn After Reading"" tells the story of a CIA official Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) who gets fired from his job because he is rumored to have a drinking problem. The fun begins when the two gym employees Linda (Frances McDormand) and Chad (Brad Pitt) find a disk that contains what is believed to be secret CIA information. It isn't long before Osborne discovers that he is being blackmailed by these two gym employees who will stop at nothing to get the reward money they feel there are entitled to. Hilarity, great acting, and ""Fargo"" style humor ensuesThere have been plenty of films over the past few years that have had a cast as big as this one but most of them fail to live up to their true potential. Luckily, ""Burn After Reading"" uses the entire cast as successfully with all the actors and actresses involving giving hilarious, off the wall performances. I could probably go on all day talking about how George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, Tilda Swinton, John Malkovich, and all the rest of the cast shines thanks to the well written characters and witty dialogue.Both Joel and Ethan Coen wrote the script for ""Burn After Reading"" and I have to admit the script is the core reason why this film worked as well as it did. When the film first starts you feel that the movie will be extremely complex with a lot of twists and turns but by the time it ends you just laugh because it's such a twisted, silly and overly simple plot. Only the Coen Brothers would be able to pull this off with such style and humor. Besides the plot, you have to applaud the witty and sarcastic dialogue. It's hard to really describe the screenplay as it's like low-brow humor for a high-brow crowd. It's oddly clever.In the end, ""Burn After Reading"" is a laugh riot from start to finish. It's not your typical mainstream comic caper as most of the humor would be considered ""off beat"" by most. For fans of the Coen's earlier work like ""Fargo"" and ""Raising Arizona"" this film will not disappoint. The cast is superb, the screenplay is quirky and original, and the direction is as great as always. Most importantly, this is a fun film that proves Oscar winning actors don't always have to play a serious role to prove how talented they truly are. I applaud Joel and Ethan Coen for creating a truly unique and funny film that breaks through the mainstream stereotype of what is funny.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Burn After Reading"" is a 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good, But Confusing!","Don't get me wrong, but I was pretty darned confused after watching this movie. I still liked this film, but I was amazed that I was very confused. That normally doesn't happen.The plot is kind of hard to explain. The story is about two gym freaks obtaining a CIA CD by theft and it contains a memoir written by a recently-fired CIA drunk. Now the two gym freaks want to exchange the CD for money so one of of the freaks, Linda can have four plastic surgeries.The movie is filled with talented actors and they live up to expectations. George Clooney did excellent but I was really impressed with Brad Pitt. He is the goofball of the gym freaks. He looks younger in this movie than he really is. Frances McDormand was so-so.I can't see why some people are saying that this sucks. This movie is certainly confusing but not so confusing where you have no idea what the hell is going on.

A Coen comedy of Shakespearian proportions. An American Farce,"Lsst year saw the Coens reach a new height of success with their multiple Oscar winning, gritty, tense and relentless masterpiece: No Country For old Men. This year they've gone for a more light hearted and comical addition to their film archive with Burn After Reading.To put it simply, its about some supposedly confidential CIA data that ends up in the hands of some low brow gym workers that want to sell it back to a CIA analyst. The story slowly unravels and the genius of the Coen's screenplay unfolds.The cast is simply fantastic. Brad Pitt, George Clooney, John Malkovich, Frances Mcdormand and Tilda Swinton. Whats unusual about this cast is that they all have a relatively equal role in the film rather than one actor given a leading role to push for an Oscar (like Brolin in W.). Its a film of supporting actors that pull off exceptional performances. In terms of Oscars, I could see Malkovich's portrayal of the clinically insane CIA analyst Osbourne Cox receiving a nomination and possibly Pitt's performance as the dim-witted Chad getting some notice. But all in all a group of convincing and hilarious performances. I could see the Coen's get a nomination for their script but I doubt the academy will give them the award twice in a row unfortunately but a nomination alone is enough to value its merit.The Coen's comedy is very dry and whats so clever about it is that the humour comes from very topical and trivial situations rather than the cheap comedy you get in spoofs etc. This is clever comedy. For example, Osbourne's over-swearing is oddly hilarious but all the Coen's are doing is presenting a natural reaction. It seems as if they haven't gone out of their way to include the comedy in the script, the comedy speaks for itself in the characters.Now lets take a step back from the specifics of the film. To put it bluntly, this film is a series of mishaps, follies and misunderstanding between a bunch of incongruous characters. Much like Shakespeare's 'Much ado about nothing', this film is about nothing, being made a big deal.I may be jumping the gun here, but I do see this as modern Shakespeare. The nature and unusualness of the story seems to match the quality of Shakespeare's 'Much ado about nothing' and possibly some of his other poems. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a complex drama but the irony of the story just cries Shakespeare to me. Also, the governmental satire seems to hint Kubrick's Dr Strangelove which is also a film of mishaps met with stupidity.The Coen's have devised a very smart piece of comedy. I see this as the 'Much ado about nothing' and 'Dr Strangelove' of our time, met with the usual high standards of direction and cinematography with the Coen's Apologies if the reference to Shakespeare appears pretentious as I don't want to present this as a pretentious film. Its a fun, crazy and dryly hilarious.Absolutely excellent film 8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""Burn After Reading"" is good. It is very good.","I have a strange and disturbing relationship with movies made by the Coen brothers. More often than not I will go to see one of their films at the cinema, dislike it intensely, dismiss it and then months or years later, after re watching it on DVD or TV, discover that it is actually a little masterpiece. It happened with ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""Fargo"". It didn't happen with ""The Ladykillers"" and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (I hated them both) or ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" (I loved them from the start).I wasn't even going to bother to see ""Burn After Reading"". No particular reason. I just didn't fancy it. A lot of A-listers acting dumb in a clever-clever movie? Nah. Thanks, but no thanks. It was only a 'I've-missed-the-bus-what-else-is-on-at-the-cinema?' scenario that led me to deciding that it might be worth a look.I am so glad that I did. I thought that ""Burn After Reading"" was kind of wonderful. Farce is a very difficult thing to pull off, but with ""Burn After Reading"" the Coen Brothers manage it with aplomb. I thought it was a very funny film.I think the key to the success of ""Burn After Reading"" was down to the way that the Coen Brothers cast every single role perfectly, openly utilising the common public personas of their very strong cast. Frances McDormand is kooky. Brad Pitt is a himbo. John Malkovich is strange. Tilda Swinton is an ice queen. J. K. Simmons is gruff. George Clooney is... what else? A ladies man. (George Clooney, in fact, is truly superb and has never been funnier.)Of course the plot is guff. Some nonsense about spies, secrets, infidelity, misunderstandings and sudden death (very surprising that bit). Maybe the Coens should have called it ""Spy Farce""?

"Great, Great movie if you know what to expect","I thought this movie was great! I read a lot of reviews and comments that said there was too much swearing and parts were unnecessarily offensive/shocking...but I am assuming that a lot of these people are not huge fans of the Coens, because if you really, truly know the Coens, what the Hell else did you expect? This is a classic Coen comedy.Another thing bothering me about the reviews are people commenting on specific performances and how great they were, this is a waste of time and effort. The ENTIRE cast brings their A-Game and if you have Pitt, Clooney, Malkovich, McDormand, Swinton, Jenkins and Simmons bringing their best, then you have a powerful ensemble cast to be reckoned with. It would be unfair to point out how awesome Clooney was or Pitt or any particular person because every single actor in this movie does a spectacular job. They embodied their characters humorously and realistically, I have a feeling people are mistaking more interesting characters for better performances.The story, upon some scrutiny is a bit jumbled and hackneyed, which is the only reason it didn't get a 10/10 from me. However, the slightly muddied plot never once interferes with the pure joy and FUN being had by the cast, the filmmakers and therefore, the audience. That's what Burn After Reading is all about having some goofy, if at times dark and adult, FUN! These are some of the best actors/directors of our time just saying ""Screw it! We just did a serious film, let's goof off for a while"" and I can attest I enjoyed the ride thoroughly.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

I will not remember this film tomorrow and this is a sign of bad cinema. It didn't move me, it didn't make me smarter, it didn't impress me on any level (esthetically, intellectually, psychologically, technically, nothing) i just can't find the point of making this movie.What is the message here?People are stupid,greedy and skin-deep? Everything (including intelligence and political rivalry)is full of incompetence, laziness and randomness? Life is a grim farce?Well, we know all that, we have been told that thousand times, its nothing new.

A disk containing the memoirs of a CIA agent ends up in the hands of two unscrupulous gym employees who attempt to sell it.,"After last year's ""No Country for Old Men,"" the Coen brothers decided to take a lighter turn (not really) by directing ""Burn After Reading."" What can I say about this movie? Well, it reminded me a lot of ""Fargo."" They're both dark comedies. As you can predict, this film would probably not be their best film to date. However, it's still a really good film.What I loved about this movie is that it's filled with coincidences. I love these type of movies. This person is friends with that person who is married to this person who's cheating with that same other person who's--you get the point. Seeing this, of course it's going to be confusing if you don't have a paper to write every characters' name down and what relationship they have with the others. But it's not that confusing if you'd think hard enough. It's all part of the fun.Frances McDormand has, yet again, created a lovable quirky character. John Malkovich, George Clooney, and Tilda Swinton all do a decent job with their roles. However, who stood out the most was Brad Pitt. Other than Heath Ledger's fantastic performance as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" I think Pitt should get nominated as a supporting role. He's that good because you have never seen him act like the character he plays in your entire life. He also provides a lot of laughs in this film.Although not the Coen's best film, the movie is pretty good to what it has. It's amazingly short (about 90 minutes), which is a bad thing because I wanted it to be longer. There are equal moments of some funny bits and depressing moments but the film tries its best to lighten up the dark scenes. With it's fantastic characters and semi-confusing plot, this is a must see in the cinemas. Oh, and if you think ""Eagle Eye"" created paranoia, you haven't seen this film, yet.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Burn After Reading""- A brilliant film that is primarily about... absolutely nothing!","To say ""Burn After Reading"" has very little plot is an understatement. In fact, upon closer observation, that seems to be the exact point that the Accadamy-Award winning directors the Cohen brothers are going for. Despite all the chaos, cursing and violence in the film, it is all for almost no reason whatsoever. Well, actually, the film is about something, and it isn't something the previews will tell you about- it is about Frances McDormand's character trying to get plastic surgery so she can ""reinvent"" herself. That's about it for the actual plot.And to a lesser extent, you could say it is about a love ""octogon"" (I don't say ""triangle"" because it doesn't have enough sides for this film) between the characters portrayed by John Malkovich (an ex-CIA agent who is becoming increasingly erratic), George Clooney (An oversexed agent who is cheating on numerous women- including his wife- simultaneously) and Tilda Swinton. (Malkovich's wife who wants a divorce- she is sleeping with Clooney and apparently wants to be with him.)Oh, and you get Brad Pitt in a scene-stealing performance as a very enthusiastic fitness instructor named ""Chad"", who doesn't know how to stop even when he is in way over his head.Yeah, the movie is about those guys too. It is also about Tilda Swinton's character copying all of Malkovich's files onto a CD so she can nail him financially with a divorce AND financial claims. And the CD just so happens to get lost, and unbeknown-st to her, it also (accidentally) has some ""highly classified"" information on it. Oh, and the beginnings of Malkovich's memoirs. Yeah, it is about that too.And how Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt find the CD and want to use it to get a ""good Samaritan"" reward from Malkovich by blackmailing him with the information on the CD. The ""good Samaritan"" reward will of course go to McDormand's surgeries. (Quite funny is the first interaction between the three, over a phone, with Brad Pitt in a very confused state being verbally destroyed by Malkovich.)Oh, and McDormand tries to give the CD to a Russian embassy for a reward after a disastrous meet-up with Malkovich; Clooney is working on a ""mystery"" project in his basement that turns out to be nothing you could ever expect; etc.You will notice by now two things-1) I am using the actor's names as opposed to the character's names. I am just doing this to make it easier to understand. and... 2) This movie is the most convoluted thing out there!Yes, and oddly enough, despite its level of convulusion, it is very easy to understand and enjoy. And even relate to a little bit. Just like real life, it doesn't have to make sense, nor does it need a real purpose.Basically, what it boils down to is this- it is a film about characters and their motivations and reactions to one-another. And in that sense, it is very realistic. The events in the movie, maybe not so much, but the characters are fleshed out perfectly.This definitely is the perfect follow up for the Cohen brothers to the somber and at times almost disturbingly low-key ""No Country for Old Men."" That was a film to make you think the deepest of thoughts- THIS is a film to sit back and enjoy, and maybe think a little bit after it is said and done.And although it can't quite reach the level of perfection seen in Cohen pictures like ""No Country..."" or ""Fargo"", this one comes pretty darned close. In fact, as the last scene ends, you will realize this is the closest to perfect you can get without crossing that sacred thresh-hold.In other words, this is an excellent movie, with very minimal flaws, about realistic characters in a bizarre situation. (Believe me, I didn't even get to any of the sub-characters, including the brilliant J.K. Simmons!) This gets a very good 9 out of 10 for me.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another great movie from the Coen brothers,"I must say this is the best film I have seen this year. The acting is strong all across the board, with Brad Pitt giving an especially good turn and Frances McDormand was worthy of an Oscar nomination. The movie feels like something of a combination of the Big Lebowski, Fargo, and Syriana. In a way, it is the darkly comic twin of No Country For Old Men. I was just expecting a fun dark comedy, but the social commentary was actually well done and gave this film a better feel to it. The humor in this film was great. My theater was cracking up for half the movie. Great visual gags, Clooney's sex life, the one liners, and the quirky characters and conversations make this movie funnier than Step Brothers, Pineapple Express, or Tropic Thunder. Of course, this film isn't as good as No Country For Old Men, but this is still one all Coen fans should go see.I give this movie a strong 8/10, and put it at #88 on my top 100 list.

An entertaining comedy crime romp from the Coen Brothers,"There seem to be no morals in this comedy spy caper from the Coen Brothers. Adultery, blackmail and murder – it's all here wrapped up in an unpredictable and witty dialogue, with an all-star cast and skilled direction and writing.I'm not normally a big fan of action comedies, which is what this film is billed as. But even I could appreciate the trademark dark humour, and the two leads Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand were simply brilliant, although it's a slight shame about the first 20 minutes before they are introduced, which drags somewhat.The premise of the film is that two gym employees (Pitt and McDormand) find a disc containing the memoirs of ex-CIA agent Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich). The two embark on a mission to track down said CIA agent, hoping to coerce him into paying them a reward for returning the disk to him.What follows is a hilarious scene with Brad Pitt at his best as a comedic actor, as the dumb jock Chad attempts to blackmail Osbourne Cox over the telephone, as Malkovich portrays a man who has been woken up in the middle of the night by an idiot perfectly, with a slow boiling rage before exploding.The plot is ridiculous, unrealistic and filled with holes, but it makes for great entertainment. The film is not overlong either at just 90 minutes in length. As well as an action/crime/comedy the movie also provides us with a character study; examining the selfishness of the characters and their true desires. None of the main characters seem to have a bit of integrity to rub together, and don't expect too many of them to still be alive by the end of the film, just enjoy the ride. And remember...appearances can be deceptive ;)",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A great Coen Brother Comedy,"I saw this film opening night. I had pretty high expectation of this film and it honestly lived up to it. Every character is played to a T, and the no nonsense directing only helps propel the film. To begin with something must be said about Brad Pitt's performance of Chad, the very ignorant yet ever energetic gym trainer. This is easily one of Pitt's funniest performance, and one of my favorites as it drops the usual weight attached to most of his leading roles. This brings me to the next great thing about this film, each of the stars gets about equal screen time, there really isn't a 'supporting' actor in this. George Clooney is equally as entertaining as the playboy adulterer. Frances Mcdormand is as charismatic in this as she was in Fargo, it's good to see her with the Coen's again. The Coen's directing in this is one of the best things about it, the shots and the music are all done as if it were a serious spy drama, which of course it isn't. What this creates is a brilliant spoof of the spy genre, not in an over the top sort of way but with subtlety. IF you are a Coen's fan see this. While it's not as outrageous of their comedy magnum opus The Big Labowski, it is on par with their other comedy effort such as O' Brother and Raising Arizona.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A sizzling comedy is another fine Coen picture,"Osbourne Cox (Malkovich) quits his job at the CIA and puts his thoughts onto a disc, which is picked up by two gym trainers.The imagination and bizarreness of the Coen brothers will never be appreciated enough and this creative realistic look at the CIA mixed with mid life crises is right up there with Lebowski and Fargo.Opening from space and zooming down right into the heart of a CIA building will surprise even the hardcore Coen fans and the directional magic the pair conjure never lets up as a camera stays at foot height for the opening sequence, following Malkovich into his destination. The immediate interpretation of the organization is stereotypical sensation, a cold hearted bunch of men in suits telling their man his day is up. Malkovich's reaction is a marvellous turn of anger and amazement and the ""In the line of Fire"" actor never lets his guard down for the entire film.When we see a group of A list celebrities collaborate it will either be superb or it will fail, and here, everyone is superb. Pitt's s*** stirring Chad is a comic revelation next to Swinton's bitchy stuck up Katie. McDormand may not be as strong as her pregnant Police Chief Marge from Fargo but you will laugh along with her all the way through, and her reaction to seeing Clooney's invention will be with you long after viewing. Speaking of Clooney (Ocean's Eleven) he plays a somewhat significant role to the proceedings. His uninvolved protagonist Harry becomes the King of the chess board at the end of the film, and as we get there, we are seeing a modern day male player, filled with that cheesy charm that you simply have to respect. The star of the show is Pitt who seems to get better and different with every film and that in itself is not easy to do, especially after performances like a certain Tyler Durden. J.K Simmons must be the most under-appreciated actor of the 21st century; he is in all of 2 scenes and has the most memorable impact on the forever twisting narrative.When looking back, Burn after Reading is hard to cement into a certain genre. The obvious dealings with CIA and the illegal activities fall into the crime, but though a fast ending is not sharp enough to be categorized into a thriller. Not to mention the gritty realism gives the drama and the characters deliver the comedy.Sharp and gritty, this 2008 Coen picture is equally as impressive as their previous releases and with such a brilliant ensemble of actors, it is unmissable",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
No-one loves a loser more than the Coens do,"So far I have not seen any comments from the UK so hopefully I will be among the first. (Thanks to a free preview screening.)This is one of the funniest films I have seen for a long time.I can not understand how, in some of the comments, people could find it unfunny, slow (what???), or pointless. Or why they are offended by a few f-words. All a matter of personal taste I suppose.The film is similar(-ish) to Fargo in that it depicts people who are in over their heads (and in this case EVERYONE is in WAY over their heads), except the tone is not as dark and it is all mostly played for laughs.Brad Pitt is an absolute joy as Chad. Why oh why has he not done more comedy before? George Clooney is great and Frances McDormand is a delight. John Malkovich is, well, just scary.The film is a cleverly-constructed farce. But there is more to it than that. Recent news stories about missing government information on mislaid disks give it a measure of (maybe accidental) topicality. Besides that, this is a film for our times, depicting paranoia, dishonesty, stupidity, and a sense that no-one from the lowest worker to government high-ups has a grasp of what the real truth is behind any event.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Whacky noir comedy with happy cosmetic surgery ending: govt rules!,"Besides brothers Ethan and Joel Coen, and their absurd sense of directorial humor, BURN AFTER READING boasts a magnificent cast that includes such luminaries as now three-time Best Actress Oscar winner Frances McDormand (Joel's wife, too!), George Clooney, the superb John Malkovitch, the ever reliable Richard Jenkins, the unsettling Tilda Swinton and, last but by no means least, Brad Pitt personifying the most idiotic character I remember in the movies.McDormand and Malkovitch deserve special applause for sheer naturalistic brilliance.Blend all those great names and you get a deliciously weird soup with a taste of the CIA and government playing the part of cadaver disposers and wipers of any potentially incriminating evidence, with senior officials J K Simmons and David Rasche genuinely puzzled by the identities - or lack thereof - of those in the mounting body count.Wonderfully screwball script by the Coen brothers, superior cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki.I enjoyed it, found it stunning from beginning to end! 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Nice semi-intelligent farce,"A refreshing, dark comedy (in a funny sense) with intricate twists and turns. No ""cliche"" easy one-liners here but a well-acted character study with range and comedic depth unlike anything you're used to seeing from Hollywood these days. Malkovich is pretty much the only character that shows resemblance to former roles but his intensity and absurd situation keep with an edge needed to keep the action interesting. Pitt like you've never seen him before. Clooney with a swagger but very vulnerable underneath it all. No ""Oceans XX"" for either of them.

It was very well done, but the movie IS too short imo.The Coen brothers are just shockingly good at making movies... the only thing that they could have done to improve the movie, was to make it longer, as 90minutes really isn't enough... if this movie was 120min-150min, then I'd probably have given this movie a 9/10 or even 10/10... but otherwise than that, this movie is fantastic.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Burn After Reading is one you can add to that list. The plot is what you can expect from the Coen brothers, it's quality writing, full of good twists, hilarious moments and in the end everything comes perfectly together. The cast is like always excellent, and consists of familiar faces we get in their movies, like Frances McDormand, George Clooney and Richard Jenkins. Other great actors like Brad Pitt, J.K.

Ages like fine wine,"To be honest when I first saw this movie I didn't love it. I thought it was a bit of a waste of a fantastic cast, and I expected something much more serious and much less goofy/farcical. With repeat viewings though I've grown to love this movie, the light tone of it makes for a great rewatchable, but everything about the confusion and misinformation and data leaks and obsession with physical appearance and using the internet to hide your intentions/who you are it all works orders of magnitude better in 2023 than it did in 2007 when this was filmed. Also, this cast was great at the time, but a lot of the lesser known cast members have gone on to do much more since, which really adds to the whole thing. There's a lot more I could say about this movie but I think it's just best to give it a watch, and just know that it's much more Fargo/A Serious Man than than No Country For Old Men. All 3 of those movies are in my top 25 so there's no good/bad, I just think knowing this going in will vastly improve your experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

The trailer portrayed a movie filled with whit, spy blunders, and John Malcovich acting like everyone's an idiot. Sounds hilarious, right? Then I actually watched the movie. The first thing that rubbed me the wrong way was the very dry feel of the movie designed by the Cohen brothers to create a sense of monotony in the characters; the only thing was, once the dynamic of events occurred, the film was still incredibly monotonous. After the ""excitement"" of the film begins to build, everything goes down hill and by the end of the movie when J.P. Simmons is trying to make sense of events, nothing makes sense.

They are scabbards of a society that teaches what is good and bad without explaining. Thus, we are converted into stupid people with stupid plans.

"Burn After Reading is dark, funny, and solidly smart with a wise direction","This satirical dark comedy isn't terribly astonishing or groundbreaking in any way, but being another outing from the Coen Brothers, the masterminds behind films like 'Blood Simple', 'Raising Arizona', 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski', and their most critically acclaimed 'Fargo'; it is difficult to resist the curiosity of this darkly funny picture. From beginning to end, it comes clear that Joel and Ethan Coen still have the smart and talent they brought have to the screen since their debut in 1984 with Blood Simple. Starring an all-star cast of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, and Tilda Swinton; this intelligent dramedy piece mixes the directors' signature style of humor and violence, with a decently crafted plot to keep viewers engaged. In the end, viewers will have experienced another triumphant piece of cinema by the efforts of the Coen Brothers. The film enters John Malkovich as Osbourne Cox, a Balkan CIA agent who is resigned from his position due to his alcoholism, and decides his best chance of making money is through starting a writing career. He types up a memoir of his life and saves it on a disc which is unexpectedly found in the hands of Fitness manager Linda Litzke (played by Frances McDormand) and her assistant Chad Feidheimer (played by Brad Pitt). The two dimwits make a desperate attempt to sale it for money, but end up involved a series of unfortunate circumstances including a dangerous encounter with Harry Pfareer (played by George Clooney), a man who Osbourne's wife Katie (played by Tilda Swinton) is secretly seeing.If you've followed through the Coen Brothers' filmography, you are likely to be aware of some their trademarks including their aestheticization of dark, morbid humor and idiosyncratic characters -- both of which are encompasses in this; and like in their previous work, it is all done with the directors' beautiful writing and style of direction. The plot, though nothing special, is beautifully crafted and moves at an appropriately steady pace. As the plot goes on, it spends just enough time to develop the not-so-smart characters while setting up some unpredictable thrills that are bound to take you by surprise, some of which end in bloody results. While there isn't too much thrills to experience, there are a fair amount of laughs to endure not just from the darkly humorous dialogue through the characters' stupidity in confronting dangerous situations. Yes, the characters are dumb and the movie is aware of this, but they're also charismatic thanks to the Coen Brothers ingenious writing. Frances McDormand, Joel Coen's wife and frequent collaborator of the brothers' filmography, comes out on top above the cast, delivering an endearing performance; perhaps even more so than her Oscar-winning as the pregnant police chief in 'Fargo'. This actress bring immense charm and humanity to her character. By the end, it is say safe she steals the show. Brad Pitt is also very appealing in his role, both funny and intriguing in a way that makes his character not stand out, but decently likable. George Clooney and John Malkovich are also granted their time to shine here, and the same can be expressed about Tilda Swinton as the wife of John Malkovich's character. While I can't say their performances fall in the Oscar calibur, they are with all honesty, difficult not to admire.Burn After Reading is immensely entertaining with tremendous performances, an engrossing direction by Joel and Ethan Coen, a beautifully crafted plot, and a fair share of hilarity mixed with a dark atmosphere. This movie offers just another decent opportunity to experience the extravagant filmmaking that makes the Coen Brothers two of the most acclaimed filmmakers in the realm of cinema. In fair words, this one is definitely recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Wild, crazy, bizarre, unpredictable; it must be the Coen brothers.","This is one strange movie. I cannot remember the last time I walked out from viewing a movie and thinking to myself, ""what the heck did I just see?"" I'm not sure this is such a bad thing. The first time I saw it, I was completely dumbfounded and flabbergasted. I couldn't believe this movie was written, produced, and directed by those genius brothers that made last year's masterpiece that was No Country For Old Men. However, since it is the Coen Brothers, I decided to give it a second chance and I am glad to say many things were cleared up, but not all.First of all, you have to look at this movie from the Coen's point of view. Here they are, coming off winning three Oscars for making No Country For Old Men. If history is any indication, they are next in line for a much more light-hearted story than the last one they did. This offer is certainly the most bizarre of any Coen movie I have ever seen, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing. The acting is terrific all the way around with an all-star cast worthy of watching. George Clooney is funny as a womanizing CIA goof, John Malkovich is also very good as an alcoholic, foul-mouthed former agent, Frances McDormand is beautiful to watch as a woman who thinks she is going down the tube, and Brad Pitt gives perhaps the best performance as a complete numbskull of a gym trainer trying his very hardest to help out his friend Linda (McDormand). Other supporting characters, such as the lovable Richard Jenkins and the cold-hearted Tilda Swinton also score.I have come to the conclusion that this movie is really only for those who are a fan of the Coen's previous indie-type comedies. No Country wasn't mainstream, but it certainly had Oscar written all over it when it was released. This movie reminds me of back in the late 90's when the Coens made Fargo, won an Oscar for it, then released The Big Lebowski two years later. They weren't going for gold, just trying to get some laughs. And they did, creating a movie that is considered a cult classic some ten years later. If you appreciate the Coen's special brand of dark humor and wild storytelling, give Burn After Reading a chance. If not, don't bother; it's not your cup of tea.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

An absolute ten to the Coen brothers,"The Coen brothers are back to their filming roots with this movie. Burn After Reading is a film with no pretensions, its only purpose is to entertain the viewer with some fantastic black humor, a characteristic in Coen's films, and very nice action and adventure. It has a very simple yet interesting story and a very well developed plot about A disk containing the memoirs of a CIA agent ends up in the hands of two unscrupulous gym employees who attempt to benefit from the discovery, a paranoid married man who is having an affair with the CIA agent's wife and the one gym employee becomes inadvertently involved. Each character of the movie have a conflict of their own but at the same time shares a common conflict. The movie starts with a slow rhythm but as the movie moves along it take a quick step until the end making it a very enjoyable movie. The cast is wonderful full of all star actors. John Malkovich in the role of an ex CIA agent is wonderful, Frances McDormand's performance is excellent, George Clooney is also very convincing and funny, Brad Pitt is fabulous is his role of a clumsy gym employee, he is a natural comedian, David Rasche, J K Simmons and Richard Jenkins are very good in their supporting roles, the only one I felt wasn't in the same mood as the others was Tilda Swinton, her performance was good but without the necessary energy.

The Laughs are there. It's up to you to find them.,"I've sampled some of the comments on this movie and,while most are quite positive(as this one aims to be as well),the negative comments went something to the tune of this:people acting stupid and situations not making any sense blah blah blah I was bored. This sucks! etc.Well,folks,did you honestly expect a Coen Bros. suspense/comedy to be linear or NOT over-the-top? Seriously?Following the monster success of No Country for Old Men,Joel and Ethan roll out a bizarre,wannabe spy comedy---""wannabe"" because practically ever member of the central plot are convinced that they're in on something of major government intelligence and sensitivity--that seems to be cloaked in the mundane. To explain the connect among the following characters would,in my mind,be over-indulgent of myself and be risking leaking a spoiler or two: a disgruntled,unemployed CIA point-man(John Malkovich,slow-burning and emotionally irritable as ever),his brittle,cheating wife(Tilda Swinton,pitch perfect);the man she's cheating with(George Clooney),a loopy ladies man who aspires to be an entrepreneur; a strangely insecure and manic fitness trainer(Frances McDormand,in character #877 of her rich array of types she can limn flawlessly);her friend and fellow trainer(Brad Pitt,who you can tell is having fun here),a guy who's emotionally sixteen years old and has an IQ about half that;their boss(Richard Jenkins),a lovestruck sad sack; a bemused KGB man and two utterly confused CIA chiefs(David Rasche and J.K.Simmons,dryly hilarious) all are woven into this tale,patiently inserted into the storyline to make a largely effective and(I think it's safe to say)fairly unique film.While I cannot quite call this my favorite Coen brothers movie(that distinction would probably go to Raising Arizona,Fargo or The Big Lebowski),it's certainly a strong contribution to the canon. Yes,the story moves at an odd pace,the actions and events can be real head-scratchers and the performances can be very love it/hate it(particularly Pitt's and Clooney's),but the humor is definitely there,and if you can find it you will definitely like--maybe even love--Burn After Reading.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
fantastic but not a comedy,"This crime, thriller comedy is another coen film found hard to categorise by critics. Burn after reading is once again a brilliant crime based film by the coens. The film stars; Frances Mcdormad as the clueless gym employee looking for some plastic surgery money, George Clooney as CIA treasurer and womaniser Harry pfarrer. When Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) is fired from the CIA and his wife (tilda Swinton)(who is having an affair with married man Pfarrer) searches for a divorce, cox's memoirs go missing. Pfarrer is also seeing Linda Litzke (Mcdormad) who is friends with other 'moron'/gym employee Chad Feldhiemer (Brad Pitt). Chad and Linda attempt to blackmail Cox without Linda Knowing Pfarrer's full story. The story line as you may have guessed is complex yet very enjoyably tied up by smaller performances from; J.K Simmons and Richard Jenkins etc. However every performance from the cast was great and the characters created by the genius of the Coen brothers and stylishly shown by their bizarre yet amazingly independent.

Burn After Reading,"Burn After Reading is a darker comedy about several very interesting individuals who all cross paths with each other, which is not necessarily a good thing at all. We have a CIA agent who has just been fired and decides to write his lifelong memoirs, the ex CIA agent's wife who is having an affair with a womanizing playboy who is also having an affair with other women that do not include his wife and we have two dimwitted fitness trainers at a workout gym who one is pretty brain dead while the other who isn't very smart either, hatches a plan in order to raise several thousands of dollars to pay for numerous plastic surgery operations that she thinks she needs. Throw in some paranoia, the Russian embassy and the CIA and you have a lot of weird things going on. Pretty much all of the main characters I have listed for you in this film are very into themselves and in a sense they are all pretty nihilistic and with no morals or anything righteous about them. The only really kind, or nice character in it is a supporting character who works at the fitness gym. Having said that, I think that the characters are all the more interesting because of this. Burn After Reading is a very quirky comedy and I admit that within the first 15 to 20 minutes of the film, I was not really sure what would be happening, or what type of a film I had just walked into, but needless to say I liked it a lot. There have been some pretty original and unique films this year so far and I would add this one to the list as well. Everything is so over the top and unusual that I think it is hard not to acknowledge what an original piece of work this is. The actors all do a great job of playing their characters and I think that they really hold the film together because if it wasn't for this great acting ensemble, I don't think the film could have been pulled off as well as it did. Also the original script and direction makes for very entertaining viewing and this is definitely a very interesting watch. I myself am a fan of darker comedies and this one has elements of very juvenile almost ludicrous elements of comedy, yet at the same time it is also done with great writing skill and the darker elements thrown in also add a lot of neat twists, turns and surprises that for me at least, were very enjoyable and to say the least, unique. I admit that the advertisements of this film do make it look very stupid and the film deals with a lot of stupid people, but the material is razor sharp and once you watch it you will realize just how many brainy ideas and thoughts went into this film. Burn After Reading is certainly not going to be a good time for everyone, but those who enjoy the writer/director team's other efforts, should know what they are getting into and hopefully you will have an enjoyable a time as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Don't burn this, watch it again!","I find that a second viewing of any Coen brothers' film helps me settle into that particular story's groove and overall, I enjoy it much more than the first time. The initial impression is we were thrown a curveball when expecting a fastball down the middle. And this certainly applies to ""Burn After Reading"".This comedy is very funny and those who aren't hip to the Coen trip will probably not enjoy it as much as their core audience. Espionage gets turned back assward into the harsh winds of adult games like infidelity and social posturing. A never funnier Brad Pitt is the dimbulb that lights up this crazy ensemble and his colleagues Frances McDormand and Richard Jenkins get to be most effective playing ordinary folks who are in way over their heads.George Clooney is too often expected to be Mr. Smooth in many of his roles. Here, he'll entice the ladies and also disgust them with his ""how the hell did this guy get that job?"" role. The man whose top priority is getting a run in before hitting the sheets at night gets much more than he bargained for.John Malkovich is brilliant, as always. I hope he works with the Coens again soon. His over the hill bitter lemon of a male finds himself hating everything in the world and not much good can come from the dark cloud his brain is immersed by.The Coens may be guilty of many things, but repeating themselves isn't one of them.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
a country for old and young men and women,"After the Coen brothers won Best Picture for ""No Country for Old Men"", I hoped that they would follow it with something good. They did just that. John Malkovich plays an fired CIA agent - actually, he got demoted, and preferred quitting to getting demoted - who writes a memoir. The only problem is, his wife (Tilda Swinton) wants a divorce, and so she copies his memoirs onto a disk and leaves it in a local gym, where two employees (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt) get their hands on it! And the story snowballs from there! Seriously, don't get me started.In my opinion, Brad Pitt's character is easily the best in the movie: he's an immature dope with a go-nowhere life. I'd say that George Clooney really has his moment right after he...well, if you see the movie then you can probably guess to which scene I refer. I should say that the movie probably won't induce belly laughs; it's the subtle humor that you have to catch. And you're sure to enjoy it once you catch it.What's the movie's overall point? Maybe there's none, but there is one possibility that I interpreted. When I saw how Pitt and McDormand come across the disk containing Malkovich's info and cynically set out to use this rarity for their own benefit, it reminded me a bit of Chuck Jones's cartoon ""One Froggy Evening"", in which a construction worker finds a singing frog and tries to make money from it. But that's just conjecture, so don't quote me.Anyway, I truly recommend ""Burn After Reading"". You're sure to like it.

Simmons (Peter's boss in ""Spider-Man""), Devin Rumer, Olek Krupa and Dermot Mulroney.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Disappointed,"I wanted to enjoy this movie because all the Coen bothers previous work I've loved. But this is a weak storyline and the acting, by mostly good actors, isn't convincing. It's as if they don't believe in the narrative either. Not all actors, however talented they are, can play comedy and that is very apparent in this movie. There's a lot of hammy and superficial acting.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Central Idiots Agency,"The Coen brothers' filmography appears to follow a cyclical pattern: in 1998, after winning the Best Screenplay Oscar for Fargo, they released that piece of cult insanity known as The Big Lebowski. Ten years later, courtesy of their recent Oscar success with the stunning No Country for Old Men, comes Burn After Reading, another piece of zany, irresistible madness. On one level, it is also a perfect companion piece to their previous film, showing once again that America really is, forgive the expression, no country for old men. Especially the ones in suits and specs who trade secrets.One such man is Osborne Cox (John Malkovich), a bad-tempered CIA analyst who is fired for having a drinking problem. Since he all of a sudden has a lot of free time, he thinks an appropriate way to spend it would be writing a memoir, much to the chagrin of his uptight wife Katie (Tilda Swinton). Unfortunately, the disk containing a small part of his remembrances is found on the floor of a gym locker. The manager (Richard Jenkins) wants nothing to do with it, whereas Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand), desperate to have a series of surgeries to look better, and Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt), a fitness-obsessed doofus, see it as an opportunity to make some easy money. While the two try to carry out their bizarre blackmail attempt, Linda gets involved with Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), a Treasury employee who is also sleeping with Mrs. Cox. Needless to say, there will be chaos, hilarity and the occasional squirt of blood.The magic of Burn After Reading lies in how Joel and Ethan Coen approach their satirical handling of all things spook-related: instead of hitting the full parody mode, à la Austin Powers or Johnny English (in which, coincidentally, Malkovich played the villain), they envision a pretty generic spy story (their inspiration, or so they claim at least, was The Bourne Identity) and then just pinpoint the natural absurdity of these scenarios, especially the major coincidence of all the people involved being connected somehow, leading to everyone being paranoid about everything (the classic ""walk in the park scene"" is a must-see) and a clueless CIA director (J.K. Simmons) wondering what the hell is going on. That's actually the big message the Coens deliver: most of the time, even secret agents have no clue of what they're doing.The dialogue is, as always with these writers/directors, comedy gold, from Harry's priceless rendition of something as simple as ""Well, hello!"" to Chad's blackmail phone call (""Osborne Cox? I thought you might be worried... about the security... of your sh*t!""), and all those classy lines are served to perfection by one of the most committed ensemble casts the Coens have ever assembled: regular players like Clooney (partially spoofing his Oscar-winning role in Syriana), McDormand (a brilliant self-referential performance) and Simmons know what to do and comply hilariously, while Swinton, the new girl on the block, uses all her scenes to the max in her reinterpretation of a ""cold, stuck-up b*tch"". And then we have Pitt and Malkovich, who need a separate mention: the former, dim and proud of it (with a laughable Johnny Suede haircut), is happy to toy with his image playing what is essentially ""The Dude"" Lebowski's stupid cousin; the latter, doing something of relevance for the first time since he lampooned himself in Being John Malkovich (1999), transcends all the villains he's played in the past with a turn that reeks of borderline craziness and instant comic appeal.""So, what did we learn?"", one character asks at one point. Applied to the audience, the answer would be: a) the Intelligence community is a league of morons; b) this might even be the Coens' funniest movie ever. A gem.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Remember, it's a Coen Brothers Movie","First off, before you go an watch this movie and jump straight to giving this movie a 4/10. Stop and remember, it's a Coen Brothers Movie. So in that being said you have to look at the comedy from the perspective of watching another Coen movie. I knew when I read that the Coen brothers made this movie and picked up on it being a comedy I knew it was gonna be good. Another thing, its nice to see Clooney and Pitt playing characters that are far from their typical styled roles in movies. I mean come on, Brad Pitt as an athletic instructor at a health and fitness gym, and George Clooney as an everyday man pretty much. So overall I give this movie about an 8.5 or 9 outta 10. A high rating I know, but this is grade A Coen Brothers at their comedic best. Give it a chance and watch it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
An experimental comedy.,"I won't be making any long unnecessary intro and will immediately say that this movie was a definitive refreshment. Why? After years of film-making, it's widely known that screenplays and plots (in general) tend to end up unoriginal. You have to dig through many movies to find yourself the one you really appreciate. In my opinion, comedies recently have become horrible and it's just hard to find a decent movie with a decent sense of humour. As well, many writers and producers try to combine various genres of movie/film to yield a piece which, sometimes, turns up to be a complete failure.However, this movie is a complete success. It incorporates elements from different genres which fuse together and produce a funny, yet tragic story that will keep you interested throughout the movie. I consider this movie to be very experimental due to its selection of actors and stories. Each and every actor has something special and represents a unique position in the story. And, just when you think that you can categorize and sort this movie into certain genre, another scene pops up and you're (once again) forced to reconsider your choice.I think this movie is a perfect solution if you're looking for something that's going to make you laugh, but at the same time thrilled and sad; and - frequently surprised.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good but not great comedy,"I watched this movie with my friends in the Kinepolis theater few days back. Frankly speaking I was simply curious and kinda influenced others to watch this one over ""The Day earth stood still"" and ""Australia"" because of its impressive casting. When we got out of the hall we all were discussing nitty-bitties of the film and we asked each other ""do you like it?"", everybody said ""yes"" but then the extra enthusiasm was missing in saying that. I personally believe that tells the story.I don't think anybody would dislike it but it could have been better. It is hilarious, okay, that was also the plot but can it not be made more comical? Individually all characters played their roles pretty much as expected to their acting images, specially John Malkovich and George Clooney were at their best. Frances McDormand as Linda Litzke becoming crazy to get her beauty operations is as believable as Brad Pitt with his rather shorter role trying to spy on the Osbourne Cox aka Malkovich. Specially the last conversation between two CIA officials played by J K Simmons and David Rasche was extremely laughter provoking and I cannot but help to give some part of it (not word to word) Simmons: What did we learn from it? Rasche: I don't know sir, perhaps you can tell. Simmons: We should not repeat the mistake we did...a pause....only if we knew what did we do wrong in the first place. So in my view Coen brothers did a good job after ""No Country for Old Man"" but may be they could work little bit more to create more plain comedy rather than ""intelligent"" comedy to get that extra ""wow"" from the viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Little Bit Of Potential Lost In A Whole Lot Of Muddle,"""What did we learn, Palmer?"" ""I don't know, sir."" ""I don't f...'in know either. I guess we learned not to do it again."" That exchange between the head of the CIA (I guess) and one of his agents closes out this movie and about sums up my reaction to this movie. After more than an hour and a half, I don't really have a clue what happened, and I sure hope it doesn't lead to anything else!There was some potential, and I confess that I really did chuckle a few times at some of the ridiculous situations that were portrayed, but overall this whole thing was a muddle of those ridiculous situations. The basic premise seemed to be promising. An ex-intelligence officer leaves a disc with what appears to be classified information on it at the gym after a workout. It's found and two employees - Linda and Chad (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt) - decide to use it to make some money to help Linda pay for some cosmetic surgery she wants. It almost sounds like it could have been a slapstick sort of semi-spy caper, but it just didn't seem to work. The attempts to get laughs out of the viewer seemed too forced - everyone seemed to be trying too hard to be funny, but humour needs to flow more naturally to be truly funny. Of all the cast, the only one I really enjoyed watching was Brad Pitt, who was cast a bit against type. He's a sort of gay-like (because that was never really spelled out but seemed implied) fitness coach. Other than that, I was quite underwhelmed by everyone and everything. 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

Smart Film from the Coehn Brothers.,"Burn After Reading is a suspense film with a humorous tone. For those who would walk in the movie hoping for a comedy, they're going to be disappointed since most of the funny parts are in the trailer. The movie had strong cast of Clooney, Pitt, McDormand, and Malcovich. All four of them did a great job: Brad Pitt's did excellent in his satirical role, McDormand and Malcovich didn't break character, and Clooney recovers from his last performance Leatherheads. When it comes to the story, viewers really need to ""read between the lines"" to full enjoy this picture.Burn After Reading reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock films since it had a clever storyline, interesting people, and similar camera motions.

Another superb Coen Bros. movie.,"Only the Coen Brothers could pull off such a crazy, goofy, and ridiculous black comedy such as this superb movie. Middle aged people in all sorts of crisis, the CIA, greed, marital infidelity, tying people together until the end, when the characters have no idea they are all connected in a weird bizarre way. It amazes me sometimes the writing style of the Coens, and where they get these wild insane plots, that they continue to make work, movie after movie. This is not a LOL movie, but when one of the gags really hits home, you'll certainly get a good laugh. Brad Pitt is very funny, George Clooney is excellent playing a character caught in the middle of all the confusion, John Malkovich is extremely funny as the foul mouthed CIA analyst who quits his job, Frances McDormand is again dead pan humor at its best, and Tilda Swinton is excellent in a minor role, but a direct tie-in to all the madness.I absolutely loved the movie, and to me, this is very intelligent dark humor mainly for intelligent movie fans. The Coens are not known for making what you might call, normal movies, ""No Country for Old Men"" was as close to normal as they will usually ever get. ""Burn After Reading"" is a Coen classic, and a major league hoot of a movie. Incredibly entertaining, to say the least.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Well Done, and with a great after-taste","I am generally not a huge fan of movies which are all over the place and require one to carefully follow plots, sub plots and innuendos to be able to appreciate the flick. Having gone through the reviews on IMDb about Burn After Reading, I was fearful of this turning out to be exactly one of those kinds. But then, this ain't anywhere near that genre. T=And that is even more surprising because even though I thoroughly enjoyed this satire on humanity, I am still unsure as to which category does this movie classify into. We have had the Ceons deliver simple-plot-gone-terribly-wrong even before, number of times. But even so, this one was a class apart. This is a direct assault at each one of us, anyone who even briefly has day dreamt of being in a spy thriller in real life. Real life people do real life things and have visions of grandiose fed by high budget flicks and fast selling novels. Burn After Reading goes all out in squashing us common masses with batons of humor and ends up squeezing laughs and revenue out of us. Simply and truly fantastic. The plot - at first simple and stupid but by the end is complex and brilliant. All the threads weave in together perfectly by the end to create what one can safely call a perfect design. Throughout the movie we anticipate any (or all) of the characters to deliver a larger-than-life moment, an act of sheer genius, a dare devilry or at least a twist of ingenuity. And that is the beauty of this flick. Normal people, do normal things. The movie, in essence, communicates one thing - ""Never underestimate the predictability of stupidity"".",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Major waste of time,"Over the years, friends have warned me about Coen Brothers movies. ""Not for you,"" has been their advice, knowing my aversion to violence in any form. But this one is billed as a ""comedy"" and my partner was interested, so I sat down with him to watch.This is a truly terrible movie. I did not care in the least about any of the characters and could not find anyone who wasn't shallow, self-involved and completely unsympathetic, so strike #1 was no one to empathize with. Perhaps that is the Coen brothers' style--I don't know--but a little character development might have held my interest and made this less than a total waste of time.Strike #2 is all the killing. Admittedly, I did not make it to the end--I checked out at the first murder--and am sorry I watched any of it.

The Burn Supremacy,"Burn After Reading is in many ways a typical Coens movie. It's filled with dark humour and quirky characters. But after No Country for Old Men, a fantastic movie, they decided to reinvent not only one but a few movie genres, including their own of course.The A-list cast serves a well-defined purpose, which to an extent is to parody themselves. With the exception of Tilda Swinton, all of the characters were written with the specific actors in mind, and it works very well. In particular Brad Pitt seems to be having a lot of fun and Clooney plays one of his strangest and funniest characters ever. Coens ""Regular"" McDormand plays a cosmetic surgery / internet love obsessed gym staffer and Malkovich, well, he has had some experience with self-parody and it shows.In fact the whole movie is a role-reversal of sorts, specially spy/thriller movies - Burn After Reading has all the right elements but twisted in the Coens own particular way. One of the reasons this movie works is because there is a constant feeling of ""what's gonna happen next?"", which keeps it interesting; and the constant surprising twists and turns the story takes. Even the McGuffin element here works this way.This is a sometimes dark, but always humorous film - the CIA scenes in particular cracked me up. If you're a Coens fan, this is an obligatory treat.However, if your first and only exposure to the brothers work was No Country For Old Men, be prepared for something very different in both scope and approach; perhaps a viewing of their previous movies would be in order for this to be fully appreciated.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the Funnier Coen Works,"I heard one reviewer say that this film is a ""Bubby Movie,"" yah know one of those films where every actor is friends with every other actor and the director (or in this case directors) and they all basically just dick around on camera for 2 hours and call it a movie. I wouldn't call it that necessarily call Burn After Reading that but I would call it a ""Hollywood Indie."" A Hollywood Indie is a mainstream Hollywood film with a big budget and a huge A-List cast, but whose script sounds like it was written by a struggling Brooklyn artist who previous experiences in film consisted of making Pods for Current TV about how great Barrack Obama apparently is.The Coen brothers seem to be the kings of Hollywood Indies, since they directed half of the ones I can name off the top of my head. Burn After Reading will most likely be counted among the lesser of the Coen Brothers films, and rightly so since it does seem to lack the aesthetic appeal of their previous films, but I don't think this film should be counted as one of the their funnier films. Most of the Coen Brother's ""Comedies"" aren't really comedies, their more like movies that are weird in a kind of funny way. Yet the Invisible Pigeon Holeing Society must assign these films a genre, and since their not weird enough to be labeled surrealist or experimental, they get the title comedies simply because a few people in the theater may giggle a few of the ""Jokes"" in the film.The point I am desperately trying to get to here is that, I didn't laugh at either The Big Lebowski or O' Brother, Where Art' Thou despite the fact they are rather funny, I laughed several times at Burn After Reading, and I laughed rather hard to. Burn After Reading is weird, as are all Dark Comedies, but it's not quite to the level as most Coen films, weather this a complement of an insult is a matter of interpretation.What really impressed me in this film was Brad Pitt's and Frances McDormand's performances, everyone else's performances were ""take it or leave it."" Brad and Frances are like some kind of weird Fitness Center Employee Duo who stumble upon CIA secrets somehow and try to milk to cow for what it's worth. I knew Frances was a good actress, but Brad Pitt acting well is something new to me. I mean I always through his performance in Fight Club was good only because he really was playing the same character he usually does but this time in a quality film. I don't know if the Coen Brothers did something to him, or maybe he's been hiding something from us, but his character is by far the best in the film. But then again his character is a dribbling idiotic health nut with some mildly homosexual personality traits, so maybe Brad wasn't even acting, maybe he was just being himself (Ha Ha Ha).What makes Burn after reading less of a film then most Coen Brother's work is that there is not any real thought involved. The second I pressed the stop button on my DVD I almost totally forgot about the movie, a good film is one can't get out of your head for a week after watching it, and most Coen Brother films do that. Listen, Burn After Reading is out on DVD now so it's defiantly worth renting, especially if you have Netflix. It's good for some laughs, and it's still rather Coen-y so go pick it up.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The ending conjures many loose ends that are never tied up. Most of the plot didn't make sense or was completely ridiculous.

"Post ""No Country"" comedy","I would have given a negative review if I discussed this movie right after seeing it, at a screening. After seeing the trailer, I thought the Coens' would yet again follow one of their critically successful thrillers with a zany, nonsensical, off-the-wall, immediately critically panned, but destine-to-be-cult-classic comedies...and I was excited. So in comparison to the wackiness of ""Lebowski"" or even ""Hudsucker Proxy"" and ""Raising Arizona"" in my opinion, this movie seems dull and the ""no ending"" ending seems like a cop out.However, given the massive public and critical success of ""No Country"" this movie has a different audience then the previous Coen comedies. I think they try to cater to fans of old and new with this movie.In comparison to ""No Country"", I think it must've been somewhat of a joke to use similar ""no ending"" endings to leave the audience with such different feelings. In ""No Country"" I felt a sombre sense of reality with the ending. Where as in this movie, I feel like everyone's time has been wasted by any work at all involved with this movie. This both drives home the absurdity of the intelligence community, and plays a great joke on me the audience member.Again, as in ""No Country"" there are a lot of slow, suspenseful buildups to the action scenes. One of them involving almost seems like a practical joke from the Coen brothers, in the making for one and a half movies (I don't mind discussing the ending, but I think it is a SPOILER if I say what the joke is). Another scene is extremely graphic, it is out of nowhere, reminding us that the person, and the movie is nuts.The movie might not have as many memorable quotes as previous Coen bros. comedies, but the running jokes involving swear words are hilarious. The Coens' could teach a course in film school entitled ""How to swear in the movies"" to screenwriters and directors. And if ""How to swear in the movies"" was taught to actors, I could think of no one to profess better than John Malkovich. At the very least, these running jokes will keep you smirking during the movie.For the Coen bros. fanatic, this may not be the best, if you feel like watching the a movie like ""the Big Lebowski"", then just watch ""the Big Lebowski"" again - it gets better every time, right? However, if you are torn between ""the Big Lebowski"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"" then try ""Burn After Reading""",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

At last the Coens' biting satire is back,"Following their hugely successful and equally brilliant No Country for Old Men the Coens have returned to their all too familiar territory: the black comedy. The good news is that their approach was different than in case of Intolerable Cruelty and The Ladykillers, which were in my view lesser works for their mass appeal oriented humor. With Burn After Reading the biting satire is back: plastic surgery, internet dating, body building/shaping, the marriage-adultery-divorce triangle and even the CIA are all targets that get their fair share of the Coens' poisoned arrows. As always, a terrific cast supports this endeavor. First and foremost Brad Pitt has to receive special credit, not only for being the funniest of the lot but for willingly making a complete fool of himself for the role and doing it brilliantly. Actually this shouldn't come as a great surprise since he was equally hilarious as Mickey in Snatch and also as Jeffrey in Twelve Monkeys but this time he's funny in a completely different way. And this is a quality great actors share: always showing something new, something we haven't seen before. As for the rest of the cast it seems that the males got the funnier parts, Malkovich is great, Clooney is good (somewhat reminiscent of the character he played in O, Brother), while Frances McDormand could've been funnier (her name is spot on though). Other highlights include all the scenes that take place at the CIA (the concluding dialog between JK Simmons and David Rasche is a killer) and the first phone conversation between Pitt and Malkovich is deadly, too. So, what we get is a true Coen-style black comedy that provides numerous laughs and altogether great entertainment. And if you want to search for something meaningful beneath all this fun, you'll find that the movie is about how egoistic, lonely and lost we are when we elbow each other out of the way to accomplish our petty goals. It may not be as strong as The Big Lebowski but nonetheless proves that when it comes to sarcastic humor the Coens still stand way above the rest.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another well done comedy from the Coen brothers,"While the Coen brothers have had their greatest critical successes with their more serious films they have always had a taste for comedy, particularly when it comes to dark humour. ""Burn After Reading"" is a film that illustrates this tendency.The film features a serpentine plot built around a pair of vacuous gym employees, an ex-CIA agent, his wife and her lover. When an apparent breach of security opens up potentially lucrative possibilities these varied individuals collide in ways that are both comical and unexpected.The cast is well-stocked with talented individuals. The always dependable Frances McDormand received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance but in my opinion it was Brad Pitt who gave the best performance. He steals the show as a dim-witted gym employee trying to orchestrate a blackmail plot. John Malkovich is also quite entertaining, whether he's flipping out or going on about his memoirs (the way he says 'memoirs' cracks me up). Tilda Swinton & George Clooney don't do much for me here but I think that's mainly because their characters are less interesting than the others. Meanwhile, the supporting cast is reliable and includes notable contributions from Richard Jenkins and J.K. Simmons in smaller roles.As always, the direction is appealing, as is the entire visual aspect. Carter Burwell's score isn't particularly worth remarking on but good use is made of the Fugs' ""CIA Man"" for the closing credits. Overall, the film is solid in its construction but not especially noteworthy.Ultimately, ""Burn After Reading"" serves as an entertaining dark comedy that falls just a bit short of the heights that the Coens are capable of. Nevertheless, a minor disappointment for them still equals a standout comedy for anyone else, so I'd recommend giving this flick a shot.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A fine entry to the Coen's catalog.,"Burn After Reading is one of those cool movies that dabbles a bit in more than one genre. It somehow manages to be a comedy, a spy- thriller, and a relationship study. How many movies can claim all that?A quick glance at the cast is all it takes to see that this picture is pretty star-studded. The Coen brothers must have used their Hollywood pull to get all this talent together, but thankfully the casting never trumped the roles. Everyone fits their characters so well, and there's quite a few unexpected performances to be seen. George Clooney was especially memorable, I don't think that I've ever enjoyed one of his performances this much.Burn After Reading isn't a rapid-fire comedy, but instead its humor is the kind that keeps a smile on your face basically the entire time, and then widens it with a chuckle or two every few minutes. I hesitate to say that it's for everyone, but I recommend that everyone give it a shot to see if it's there cup of tea. It certainly was mine.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Everybody laughed,"This is a really funny movie. It seemed like everyone in the theater enjoyed it -- there was frequent loud and extended laughter. The last line (spoken by the ubiquitous J.K.

Perhaps they saw some other movie titled ""Burn After Reading.""These characters were not designed to be taken seriously. Part of the fun was in the repetition of bizarre behavior. Brad Pitt was especially funny, with his gum-chewing, head-bopping characterization of a naive, not-too-smart personal trainer. John Malkovitch and George Clooney are masters of this kind of stuff, and Tilda Swinton got laughs out of her trademark uptight persona, carried to the nth degree.And what can I say about Frances MacDormand? She has been terrific in every part I've even seen her in.Only Richard Jenkins seems to be in another movie, a more sensitive tearjerker, not this uproarious black comedy.Back to J.K.

The Coens troll their audience with riotous results,"The Coen Brother's Burn After Reading is the duo at their height of trolling the audience, a mood they seem to make some of the most devilishly funny films of their career. This one reminds me of long days full of running around, confusion and missed appointments, days where I get home and reach the end only to realize that for all the frenzy, nothing I did all day was really of any consequence. This film is sort of like that; a whole lot of clandestine nonsense and tomfoolery that adds up to.. well, not much of anything in the end. If that sounds like I'm being negative, I'm not. That's part of the Coen's charm and a core aspect of what makes this one so hilarious. It's also full of complete dimwitted morons, which only adds to the chorus of lunacy. John Malkovich teeters on the borders of mania, scary and funny as ex CIA half wit Osborne Cox, in a performance so utterly Malkovich that he almost seems like some other actor parodying him. He's got a cold hearted witch of a wife (Tilda Swinton) who is fooling around with even bigger idiot Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney is a riot) who is also fooling around with anything that has a pulse, being the squirrelly sex addict that he is. Cox has started a memoir (or, 'mem-wah', as Malkovich ludicrously intones it), the contents of which are on a disc that end up in the hands of yet even bigger idiots. Linda Litzke (Frances Mcdormand) and Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) run a gym called Hardbodies (only the Coens, folks) and see the disc as 'secret spy schit' they could use to make a buck. That's where the plot hollers off the rails into pure madness, as each and every character makes the dumbest possible decision along the way. J.K. Simmons and David Rasche are gold as two CIA honchos who are more puzzled than the audience, Richard Jenkins trolls perhaps the subtlest of all, and the cast also includes Jeffrey Demunn, Olek Krupa and a meta cameo from Dermot Mulroney. Among the cloak and dagger chaos, the Coen take every chance they get to spoof and lovingly ridiculue society's cringe inducing stereotypes, until you start to realize they're levels of exaggeration aren't all that over the top. Pitt is gold as the air headed gym rat, Clooney pure screwball, and Malkovich is a force of demented nature, his exentuated word pronunciations reaching a boiling point of absurdity here. This is up there with the Coen's best, and certainly one of their funniest hours.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not funny--a complete waste of time and money,"It is hard to believe all the good reviews this movie has been getting. From the trailer, I expected a solid comedy. Instead, I saw a movie with thoroughly poor acting and a script that sounded like it was either non-existent or written the night before the movie was shot. There is an awful lot of swearing for no reason. The storyline is haphazard at best and looks like a bunch of separately shot scenes scrambled together without much planning.The ""jokes"" don't come across as funny. I didn't hear a single laugh in the entire cinema. After half an hour, I had enough of this nonsense and walked out of the cinema.

The best Coen brothers comedy,"I have never really bought into Coen Brothers comedy ethos. Apart from ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" which i hated , i have quite enjoyed their films but i have never found them funny. The humour seems to wash over me , so i wasn't holding out a great deal of hope for ""Burn after Reading"" . It just goes to show how wrong i can be !Osbourne Cox is a low level analyst at the CIA, after leaving his job he decides he will use whatever knowledge he has gained within his long years at the CIA to publish a tell-all memoir, Osbourne starts writing every juicy tidbit of information he can come up with, on his home computer. Unbeknownst to him, his wife's divorce lawyer advised her to make a copy of his hard drive's contents on to a CD, should he be withholding personal financials.Through an odd turn of events, said disk ends up being accidentally left in a local gym by the divorce lawyer's receptionist, and ends up in the hands of two scheming idiot employees at the Hardbodies Gym, Chad and Linda . Believing they hold some valuable secret information, the two attempt to blackmail Cox into paying them money to live their ambitious life plans.Characters are what the Coens do best. Whether it be The Dude in ""The Big Lebowski"" or Jerry Lundegaard in ""Fargo"" or even Anton in ""No Country For Old Men"". In ""Burn after reading"" we are spoilt with fantastic characters.Brad Pitt is superb as the slightly camp gym instructor Chad Feldheimer. I loved his phone conversation with Osbourne Cox when he informs him that he has his computer disc.The anger that comes from Cox and the surprise from Chas is brilliant. Pitt seems to put everything into this role and thoroughly deserves his BAFTA nomination for best supporting actor.George Clooney is also great. He plays a paranoid sexual deviant that uses women for his own pleasure. His scenes with Frances McDormand ( Linda) are very enjoyable. especially the moment he shows her his new sex machine that he has made in his basement. The conversation goes something like this..Linda:What is it? Harry : What is it? Harry : You sit down there, make yourself comfortable, put your feet in the stirrups, and... Linda : Oh my God. Linda :That's fantastic.!The film is packed with conversation like this and i hate to admit it , i laughed my socks of throughout !John Malkovich (Osbourne Cox) and J.K. Simmons ( The CIA Superior) deserve a lot of credit for their dark comedy acting also.This is by far the best comedy the Coen brothers have done and even makes me think that i should go back and watch their back catalogue to see if i have missed something the first time round and if i have , in the words of the CIA Superior "" What a Clusterf''k!"".8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The First of More To Come,"Hollywood's fall lineup has had as one of it's leadoff pictures ""Burn Without Reading"". Yes, film entertainment is just like the fashion industry, introducing the season's must-have (in the case of movies, must-see) items early on. Along with Spike Lee's ""Miracle at St. Anna"" these are the best of September's offerings.The plot, as it were, primarily centers around the existence of a disk containing the writings of an ex-CIA agent (John Malkovich) and the attendant goings-on of nearly all the remaining cast. The departure here from the normal spy-chase cum thriller is that not any of the behaviour or antics of the characters matters one whit in the final analysis. But it does make for an amusing ride.George Clooney (cast as a Treasury agent, though that matters little) is the lover of Tilda Swinton, the wife of the aforementioned CIA agent. Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand are employees of a gym. How all these characters get involved with the disk and with each other I leave for you to enjoy.This is definitely a film that will satisfy all fans of Coen Brother's offerings.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Technically superb and complex Coen Brothers offering, but not without flaws...","The Coen Brothers have touched upon so many film genres and combinations that it's getting harder and harder to keep track. Their follow-up to Best Picture of 2007, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, is a delightfully complex comedy noir/thriller (that's the best description I could come up with) that won't win any awards but will live long in the memory.The plot is complex, as expected, and filled with numerous twists (also expected), and most are done in an intelligent and complex manner. The cast is brilliant, with George Clooney (who seems to save his most hilarious performances for the Coen Brothers and Steven Soderbergh) leading the line in fine form. Frances McDormand is equally superb. Tilda Swinton apparently reprises her ice-queen role from THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE. John Malkovich takes advantage of his (apparent) semi-retirement to produce a quite captivating performance. Brad Pitt is good, but in my opinion there was a degree of (warranted?) overacting to his role.BURN AFTER READING is not a masterpiece. At its worst it is an entertaining ride, full of unexpected plot twists and intertwining characters. At its best it can make for a delicious study of comedy noir/thrillers. The Coen Brothers rarely (if ever) disappoint. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Recommended, simply because it's the Coen Brothers, and it's (therefore) unique.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pure Coen genius!,"I just managed to watch the film yesterday and I have to admit that I consider it already as one of my favourites not just among the films made by the Coens, but also in general. Sure, if someone compares it to last year's ""No Country"", ""BWR"" might seem a little ""light"" or, as some fellow viewers have put it, ""pointless"" or even ""rather stupid"". I wouldn't like to disagree with the people that didn't like the film, since, when it comes to art, we all know that points of view and tastes can be as many as the grinds of sand on a beach. However -and in my opinion- two things could be universally admitted: a) Every and each member of ""Burn after reading"" all-star cast puts on a fabulous performance: John Malkovich as the ex-CIA analyst who's flipped out right after his firing from the ""firm"", Tilda Swinton as the cold-blooded ""career woman"", George Clooney as the ""classic"" womanizer, Frances McDormand as the insecure (yet absolutely determined when it comes down to getting her cosmetic surgeries done) all-American female and (my personal favourite) Brad Pitt as the totally clueless gym employee. b) Despite the fact that this flick is under the ""comedy/farce"" genre, it is actually one of the most ""political"" films of the Coens, in a very smart yet ""underground"" manner, covering a very wide variety of issues concerning the American society, such as the condition of ""holly matrimony"" in the USA nowadays (apparently, every married man or woman in US seems to be ""doing"" everyone else except their ""better half"" without any hesitations), the way that the American State behaves to people that seemingly have ""served well"" their country for many years (John Malkovich's character in this case), the fact that the average American (""Linda Litzke"" in the case) is willing to ""sell"" his/her country to the enemy (Russians) for something as simple as having his/her ass and breasts fixed and, finally, the annoying -especially if you are white and you belong to the middle/upper class of the US society, like all of the main characters in the movie- fact that each and every American probably carries a certain amount of pure stupidity and ignorance. In other words, ""Burn after reading"" even though it does not really ""take off"" at any point during its 95 minutes- is perhaps the best way to say ""America, this is who you are, today"" in the most hilarious yet discrete manner imaginable. I,.e., «The Coen's manner». Two thumbs up!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Excellent follow-up to ""No Country for Old Men""","How do you follow up a dark drama masterpiece like ""No Country for Old Men""? With an excellent comedy-drama, ""Burn after reading"", and in a very short space of time. When most directors would be happy to take a break after making one of history's great movies, and winning 4 Oscars for the effort, the Coen brothers immediately get back in the studio and make a great quirky comedy-drama. Like they did after ""Fargo"", with ""The Big Lebowski"". (Though I feel The Big Lebowski surpassed Fargo, while Burn after Reading doesn't beat No Country for Old Men).Great mix of comedy and drama, though sometimes the two do get a bit mixed up and you don't know whether to laugh or be shocked.Excellent performances from an all-star cast including George Clooney, John Malkovich, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton.

Very Good,"I was distracted at the start. It didn't engage me. It was a bit slow and not much happened. I like Malkovich but i didn't really want to watch him anymore after seeing so much of how funny Brad Pitt looked from the trailer.Don't read into it that much, the start was still better than half of the generic movies out there right now but it didn't match up to the rest of the movie. This doesn't mean that Malkovich is the short straw either as he and his character do get a lot better.Brad Pitt as I pretty much already guessed stole the show. Just as Robert Downey Jr. in Tropic Thunder and even though in a whole different context Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. If he doesn't get his 2nd Oscar nod (maybe 3rd if The Curious Case gets him one as well) for this then there is something cruelly wrong with this world. He's a shoe in for the golden globe nomination at least.The plot is so Coen-esquire that you just can't help but smile the whole way through the film, even through some deliciously dark parts. Its laugh out loud funny and subtle funny at the same time. It's quick, sharp and breathtaking film-making.Stellar performances from Pitt, McDormand and the minimally used J.K Simmons with apt help from Clooney make this the Coens best non serious movie since The Dude's last sip of his white Russian.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"intelligent, humorous, but ultimately pointless","If the point of a movie is to take the viewer on a journey then this movie runs out of gas on the driveway. I was really looking forward to seeing this film having seen the trailer but all it's savvy and undeniably fantastic performances from all the actors (particularly John Malkovitch) could not make up for what this film so obviously lacks.None of the characters is likable - I mean, to think of any film randomly, in 'American History X' for example the viewer is led to sympathise with the protagonist who is a horrible murdering racist (once he's reformed obviously, which shows that in that movie there was at least some point to the story) showing that with the right screen play an audience can be made to identify with practically any character.Conversely Burn before reading is completely bland in that respect, it fails to draw in the viewer, at no point did I even care what happened to any of the characters - I can't work out what the film is trying to tell me (if anything). I have just spent a totally beige evening with this movie, watching this is the equivalent to eating a bowl of sawdust for supper.There may be a multi-faceted plot and a few laughs (derived from stellar performances rather than script) but there's no story, no character development, no twist, and then, when you're starting to wonder why you forked out for the DVD it comes to an anticlimactic, sudden and disappointing end.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wild and Crazy Coens,"http://entertainmentblur.wordpress.comBoys will be boys. The same goes for how the Coens will always be the Coens. Following their most successful movie in their career, No Country for Old Men, they return to their quirky selves with this goofball, spy-thriller, comedy or something like that. I don't know, I can never quite categorize a Coen brothers film.Anyway, here's the plot in a nutshell and I promise not to give too much away. CIA agent Osborne Cox (Malkovich) quits his job after being demoted because of a drinking problem. His wife, Katie (Swinton), is having an affair with an ex-secret service agent Harry Pfarrer (Clooney). Harry debates whether or not to leave his wife for Katie, but at the same time uses online dating for one night stands and meets Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand). Linda works at a gym with her bumbling friend Chad (Pitt) who stumbles upon a disc of CIA information that traces back to Osborne Cox. Their scheme is to blackmail Cox for money that Linda needs for cosmetic surgery.Okay, is your head spinning? Because mine sure was during the film. Nonetheless, the Coens found a way to make this silly spy satire into something extremely enjoyable. All of the characters were memorable and it was just pure fun to see these actors in roles they have never played before (besides John Malkovich who always plays the foul mouthed, angry and bitter man). There were a number of minor plot twists to prevent this film from committing clichés, and a fair balance of comedy and depth to keep me interested.If you're expecting another Oscar contender from the Coens, you will be disappointed. But if you're looking for a smart, zany film then Burn After Reading will please your needs. It's not the Coens' best work, but it's still pretty darn good.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is a lively, intriguing film which, nevertheless, may not be the Coens best work but which is certainly far above the Hollywood grind-em-out machine.

Coens are back with a bang...,"The first thing which is noticeable about the movie is the cast- George Clooney, Brad Pitt, John Malcowich, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand & Richard Jenkins. Last years academy award director duo-Coen Brothers are back this year with what they are best at- wry dark humor & situational fix drama but this time burning their bucks on huge star cast (as you see the above list). CIA agent Cox was fired & his CD containing his memoirs became the object of turmoil in every character's lives. It's quite complicated & insulting for the film if I write anything further about the story because that will mar the mood for its viewers.Well the movie is short & so every character has to play a limited time roll & scenes to show their talents within the complicated script. For example- Brad Pitt's character is just surprising & seems like a guest appearance. Apart of all the characters & actors here the script is the real hero. Out of all glossy star cast the full marks goes to Francis McDormand's performance that put a life in such a complicated character. Movie isn't brilliant piece compared to the early track record of Coen Brothers but it's definitely one of the fine attempts of the year representing the meaningless tragedy depicting human absurdity with black humor.

And the Cohens scores again!,"You could certainly tell that the Cohens had a lot of fun with this one. I guess they needed that after 2007 offering. The story is like a intentional train-wreck, a dryly humorous and satirical (not biting)downwards pointed spiral of misunderstanding. John Malcovitch is as always great, and he was the biggest reason i went for it, but even more amusing was Brad Pitt as a complete idiot and George Clooney as Mr schmuck nr1. Liked what he did to his face! Overacting, yes, but the film called for it. The thing is, on their own all this characters would grow unbearable quickly, but the Cohens never lets them have to much screen time. IIts defintly a film about unfullfilment, this characters are all on the pathetic side, shallow and narcissistic. but as parts of a the bigger story they are funny, and hell, even a bit endearing.

Easily one of the five WORST movies I've ever seen in my life,"Burn after watching.If I had the opportunity to rate this movie with negative stars, I would give it a -6. It is easily one of the five worst movies I've ever had the displeasure of seeing and it may be among the top three worst movies. Unfortunately I paid good money to see it. It's 97 minutes of my life I will never get back. It was nearly as disturbing as 'Nowhere' and almost as boring as 'American Movie'. The last two minutes were humorous, but the five minutes prior to that were so unnecessarily violent and disturbing that the ending did nothing to redeem the film. The first 40 minutes were so boring I nearly left the theater - in retrospect I definitely should have done so. If I had any real hope of success, I would write to the Coen brothers and demand my money back. Avoid this piece of refuse and condemn it to the bit bucket where it belongs!",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Joel and Ethan Coen's Arm's-Length Scoff at the Modern Age,"""I would tell students to make their characters want something, even if it's only a glass of water. Characters paralyzed by the meaninglessness of modern life still have to drink water from time to time. One of my students wrote a story about a nun who got a piece of dental floss stuck between her lower left molars, and who couldn't get it out all day. I thought that was wonderful.""  Kurt VonnegutThis comedy, Joel and Ethan Coen's arm's-length scoff at the modern age, never started from ideas but from character. And what interesting characters they are, all embodied sharply by a dream team cast of some of the most wonderfully enjoyable actors and actresses working today. We have never seen Brad Pitt or George Clooney play such inane and idiotic characters, and they are in top form. Pitt just got finished giving a chillingly real and bafflingly evil performance as Jesse James. Now he is playing a happy-go-lucky fitness trainer with nothing but air inside his head and a pompadour on top of it. Clooney, who even in his least emblematic performances as the title character in Michael Clayton and Bob Barnes in Syriana, has always played cool, level-headed earthy 1960s throwbacks, here plays a jittery, quick-tongued swinger with a double life. As such, not only do we feel as if Clooney is making fun of himself but he does as well, and accordingly his character's paranoia and overreactions are squared and cubed.I have not laughed as loud and as extensively in a long long time as I have at John Malkovich, a poised and sophisticated veteran CIA analyst brimming with frustration and stress, thus a drinking problem, whose therapeutic endeavor to write a memoir is sabotaged by a bunch of complete idiots. His enraged reactions and bloodshot peeks through the cracks of his elegance are some of the funniest comic acting in the world. He reinvents the phrase ""F***ing morons!!!!""What you know of the plot from trailers and TV spots is enough. It is not a film that relies on plot. The plot hinges desperately upon the inanity of the unabashedly modern characters that screw it up to the point where the film itself basically resolves with two sideline characters, one of them a government man played with the trademark dry and straight-faced insensitivity of J.K. Simmons, implying that there really hasn't been much point to any of this. ""What did we learn? Not to do it again. I don't know what we did, but...""The absurdity of its characters, with the exception of Malkovich's CIA rogue Osbourne Cox and his shady wife, played with Tilda Swinton signature brand of pompous feminine callousness, is silly in every way. Their reasons for doing the things that they do are regarded by them with such ardor and desperation, which causes you to find yourself laughing even when there is no verbal or visual punchline. And what makes this comedy what it is is that there is no real farcical contrivance. It is a farce sparked by the decisions of these goofy dimwits, the most determined and driven of whom is Frances McDormand's Linda Litzke, who has the same go-getter willpower of most of her characters. How does she always seem faultlessly cast in everything she does?What is most admirable about this work by the Coen brothers, still spinning with the oomph from their inordinately brilliant landmark comeback No Country For Old Men, is that they initially intended to sit down and write a spy movie, because, what the hell, they had never done one before. But they came up with this, the only espionage-related traces of which are in the mere occupations of very few of its characters and the incidental effects of the rest of the characters on two CIA superiors and the very confused Russian Embassy. Joel and Ethan were fine letting the ideas come and the juices flow and letting the script go where it wanted to go. If they had worked through any doubts with what it was turning into and restricted it to the bounds of a spy movie, it would not have been nearly as good and we would never have been granted this skillfully pointless portrait of, as CIA analyst Osbourne Cox puts it, ""the idiocy of today.""What the Coens have maintained is the sleek cinematography and occasional and completely unexpected outbursts of brutal violence that one expects from an espionage film, not to mention completely facetious typewriter-font captions as displayed by the main credits and location footers. This is really the scaffolding of the film's charm.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Dark Romp,"This is a real kick of a movie. Ethan and Joel Coen are noted for their dark humor and absurd situations, and in this film, they give the audience a witty satire on the security community - throwing in a neat stab at the attitude of those who man the exercise centers of our country. Be aware that just about everyone in this film is a dolt, and if not a dolt, a bastard or a bitch. Throw self-centered security and exercise nuts together and shake - you get Burn After Reading.The basic plot is fairly simple - simple, that is, as the ultra creative Coens can make it. A security man has been forced out of his job and decides to write a tell-all memoir. His discontented wife is having an affair with another security man - a sex manic who seeks pleasure with every woman he meets. A disk containing some data for the memoir is found by a exercise consultant who thinks she needs extensive, very expensive plastic surgery in order to attract a man. She and her fellow worker decide to hold the disk for ransom in order to raise the money for the surgery. As I said, simple! Handled in the wrong way, this absurd plot would have been a silly, juvenile mess, but the Coens have taken this ludicrousness and made a highly entertaining romp. It is the directing and acting that bring this beautiful farce to its high altitude. Needless-to-say, the Coens are geniuses at this sort of thing, and they have a stable of super actors to bring their warped vision to fruition.John Malkovich plays the disillusioned security man on his way out. He's a drunk, and a surly drunk at that. He pretty much hates the world and wants everyone in it to suffer. Malkovich has the unique ability to play such a character and still make the audience feel a little sorry for him.Tilda Swinton plays Malkovich's bitch of a wife who is having an affair with the sex-crazy guy. She is a pediatrician who hates children. What more needs to be said? Swinton plays this cold woman to the hilt.George Clooney is the lover who can't get enough sex from anyone. Plus, he is probably the second biggest dolt in the film. Clooney is just great in this role - a real treat to watch.All of the acting is superior - including all supporting characters - but Brad Pitt absolutely steals the show as a not very bright fitness nut determined to help his friend finance her plastic surgery.That friend is played wonderfully by Frances McDormand. She has mastered the technique of making even the most outlandish character believable, and she certainly pulls out all the stops on this one.It is beyond my belief that a large number of critics did not like this film. I can only assume that they have completely lost their senses of humor and absurdity or never had them in the first place. Burn After Reading is an absurd delight created by super directing, a very witty script, and exceptional acting. I feel sorry for anyone who doesn't get one good chuckle after another from this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Burn Baby Burn, It is a Coen Comedic Farce Inferno!","Let me spark up this film review of the new Coen Brothers' offering ""Burn After Reading"" with witty pun banter in order for you not to burn before reading. The Coens return to their screwball dark comedy noir with ""Burn After Reading"" that, by the way, practices the cinematic characterization of ""no country for dull men"". The film's central characters possess an unremitting egoistic-burning sensation that intertwines swimmingly with their screwball behavior for supreme sheer entertainment value. These quirky characters nearly supersede and extinguish the plot of ""Burn After Reading""; because I would burn up with laughter every time they displayed their surreal eccentricities and not care so much on the narrative's developments. But there is still a plot to be told of ""Burn After Reading"". John Malkovich plays Osborne Cox, a hot-tempered CIA Analyst who writes a memoir after he wrathfully resigns from his CIA long-term employment. Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand exercise their acting by portraying Chad & Linda, two gym trainers who inadvertently end up with a copy of Cox's CD memoir and consequently want to play the blackmail game with The Wizard of Mad Os. George Clooney plays Harry Pfarrer, a neurotic U.S. Marshall whose mentally-deranged marshal plan is overflowed with profound paranoia. Harry is having an affair with Cox's domineering pediatrician wife Katie played by the stupendous Tilda Swinton. Character-actor king Richard Jenkins plays Ted Treffon, the reserved gym owner who craves for the romantic acceptance of Linda. David Rasche and J.K. Simmons play two CIA Operatives who are trying to unscramble all this burning mess into a concise, well-read depiction. Are you now burned out after reading the mishmash chaos of ""Burn After Reading""? Whatever the case, Joel and Ethan Coen continue their hot Hollywood streak by cleverly writing up characters which encompass scene-stealing qualities. I will be burning mad if the film does not garner a Screen Actors Guild ""Best Ensemble Acting"" nomination. All the actors were phenomenal. But primary props have to go to Pitt's hilarious performance as the dumbbell Chazz, McDormand's usual skin-deep wondrous acting as the cosmetic-surgery obsessed Linda, and Malkovich just being the great John Malkovich as the mad Cox Osborne. My only minor burning issue with the auteurs here was the slight overacting of George Clooney, but maybe I am just being too paranoid here a la his character Harry. So maybe you have read other film reviews that outmatch mines on the breakdown & analysis of ""Burn After Reading"", but I do not think you will find another ""Burn After Reading"" film review that has as many ""Puns During Reading"" as the one delivered by yours truly. Burn rubber today and book a visit to ""Burn After Reading"". ***** Excellent",,Anonymous,Crime

A Coen Brother gem: Cluster f*g at high level intelligence. Hilarious. Superb acting. Terrific story.,"The Coen Brothers wrote, produced and directed this gem. If you know these 2 brothers you wouldnt be reading these reviews, because the Coen Brothers are the pinnacle of genius of independent american cinema.

First I was surprised that so many parents had quite young children watching this film, with its language, sexual imagery and violence. No one in my audience laughed except a couple of chuckles scattered throughout, the CIA dialogue at the end was the funniest part of the movie. I'm giving it a three simply because I like watching moving images on a screen and because some of the characters were very likable, also like interiors and exteriors of houses. The Tilda Swinton character was very unpleasant. . . kind of hard to believe the George Clooney character would have spent any time with her at all.

Go figure . . .,"""Every man is surrounded by a neighborhood of voluntary spies."" Jane Austen Go figure: The acting ensemble of the year and two acclaimed directors can't save a movie dud. The Coen brothers' Burn After Reading is a forced comedy about a couple of fitness center workers (played by Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand) who find a CIA memoir disc and attempt to extort $50,000 from the author, Osborne Cox (John Malkovich).I say ""forced"" because even the best performance, Brad Pitt as knuckleheaded Hardbodies worker Chad Feldheimer, is wrenched out of an actor better suited to non comedy. Even George Clooney, who sharpened his comic timing in Three Kings, plays smarmy a bit too goofy ans sleazy for my taste.Long gone are the outrageous characters of my fav Coen comedies Raising Arizona, Hudsucker Proxy, and Fargoall of whom seemed to be underplaying compared to the attempts here.But it's Malkovich who takes the prize for the actor who brings his acidic, loud-mouthed, sneering persona into every role. Frances McDormand is nowhere near the shrewd good ol' girl in Fargo.Respite from the non subtle comes in the screwball comedic exchanges between Hardbodies employee Linda Litzke (McDormand) and Chad and a comical denouement with CIA brass scratching their heads over the absurd activities.I just wish the Coens had brought their quirky, iconoclastic attitude into this one.",,Anonymous,Crime
Another Great Coen Bros. Comedy,"I love that BURN AFTER READING is an engaging, and often hilarious, spy movie without any actual spies. Sure, the whole premise is centered around a former employee of the CIA but he's no more than an analyst (and a pugnacious, raging alcoholic). The actual CIA of the film has no idea what's going on, what these people are engaged in, or whether it's worth their time to investigate. The movie comes from the Coen brothers, a writing/directing team that I've yet to see fail. BURN AFTER READING probably ranks towards the top of my favorite Coen films (but it's no BIG LEBOWSKI). In the film, Osborne Cox (Malkovich) is fired from his position as an analyst within the CIA when his alcoholism becomes a problem. Meanwhile, his wife (Swinton) is debating whether to leave him for her lover, a paranoid Marshal (Clooney). Falling into depression, Cox decides to occupy his time by writing his memoirs, a memoir that soon lands in the hands of two inept gym employees. Linda Litzke (McDormand) obsesses over the damage age has done to her body and formulates a plan with her gung-ho, hyperactive coworker Chad (Pitt) in a plan to return the memoir, which they've mistaken for confidential documents and a threat to national security, for a reward. When their plan falls apart, Linda decides that drastic times call for drastic measures and she'll get the money for her plastic surgery one way or another. And so begins an espionage adventure where no one involved knows exactly what is going on.I love how clueless the characters in this movie are. I wasn't originally so keen on this movie and it took a few viewings to really get into my head. The marketing had painted this movies as a bit goofier and it wasn't what I expected to find when I sat down to watch it. Plus, I was put off by the movie's abrupt ending (the details of which I'll spare here in case someone who reads this hasn't seen it). I remember thinking, ""This is it? That's all there is?"" Now that I've seen it a few times, I really like it. It's a great ending for this particular movie. The Coens are fantastic writers and this movie is a prime example. It's sharp, funny, and tense. The characters are perfectly bizarre and the casting is perfect. The movies features a top of the line cast: John Malkovich, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand, etc. These people are over the top and just a little insane. Linda and Chad actually believe they are trapped in a spy movie scenario and react as anyone would, with only TV and movies as a source of knowledge. Shady meetings, breaking into Cox's home, and even Russiansthe two incompetent gym employees are in way over their head. Or not at all. I guess it depends on whose perspective. BURN AFTER READING is a subtler, darker comedy and might not appeal to people who usually prefer their laughs in the form of a Kevin James or Adam Sandler film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Even a ""bad"" Coen Brothers movie...","...is better than other ""good"" movies.Yeah, I'll admit that ""Burn"" is a little weak; not operatic, like ""No Country,"" which at least was based on a piece of well-turned literature.I watched ""Burn,"" and felt that I'd been sort of burned. But over time it starts to grow on you.There's a common thread to the Coen's films: They're all about the primacy of the human spirit. Sure, they tend to take up themes in which this truth is showcased in negative situations, but spirit continues to be the focus; the Coens see to that.And that's the simple message in ""Burn."" There's one particularly salutary side effect of this emphasis in a spooked-themed movie. The anti-""Burn"" movie could be, for instance, ""Enemy of the State."" I mentioned this in another of my comments. ""Enemy"" commits the sin of hewing to the convention that what we really want is to be reminded that ""they""--you, know, ""them""--are out get ""us."" And ""Enemy"" goes to insanely high-production, high-dollar ends to drive that theme a mile into the ground.The Coens will never do this. They will never, ever let us off the hook; that sharp little hook that is the eternal truth that we are responsible for what we choose to see, and are therefore responsible for who we allow ourselves to become. And for that, I'm thankful. And that is a redeeming aspect of ""Burn."" It's another notch on the handle of the crossbow the Coens use to shoot down the most sacred of the human race's sacred cows: That we can--nay, must!--point to someone else and blame them for our oppression.So, I guess my net impression is that, ""Burn"" is a sort of yawpy romp, but in the Coen tradition; which means that this yawpy romp is better than other more ""serious"" films which nonetheless commit the error of encouraging us in our blindness.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Middle Life Death,"Middle Life -- when does it come? Really depends on your development curve. For some at 50, for some at 30. You reach a dead end in character development, what the writer (e.g. Little natural selection and such) to do? Kill, let them still float if they can, but somewhere out of sight. I gave this an 8, because I believe, even if unknownly, the Coens bring this meaning of life question: the answer in the title, burn of living, nothing's left. I know the spy movie thing, the sexual comedy, the dunning kruger effect, the great show piece for particular actors, the dark humor -- all is there too, and not too well developed or used.

The Coens have created another Original Masterpiece,"The Coens have done it again! A year after their instant classic No Country For Old Men, they create another original and ambitious film! Burn After Reading is not for the faint-hearted. It has a lot of dark humor, it has a tone unlike anything I have seen in years. Comparable to their classic Fargo, this film has great writing and an amazing ensemble to back it up. Frances McDormand gives another great performance, one that is similar and different to her Oscar-nominated performance as Marge Gunderson more than 10 years ago. She deserves her second Oscar nomination! Brad Pitt continues to amaze me. After having his best performance in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, which is also his finest work and one of the best films of the decade, here he comes again, in a totally opposite performance. He will sure get the most buzz out of this movie, and as of now, he delivers an Oscar-Worthy performance. John Malkovich, never having really seen a lot of his work, gives such a great, cold performance. George Clooney, after also having a good year at the Oscars in 2007, delivers his best performance. I usually do not like him much, but in this movie, he proved he is a very versatile actor. Tilda Swinton is also very good, but has less amount of work to play with.The script is just so well thought out and written. This is truly a film for idiocy and stupidity, and the script explores all of that. The ending is in a way as provocative as No Country For Old Men.The film has beautiful music and cinematography, in a different way to the Coens' other films.Burn After Reading is just as great as the Coens' best films.

Their mind doesn't understand that but their subconsciousness does. That's why the allogamy is the only thing left to them. And a good portion of laugh by looking in the mirror.,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Probably the only person here who thought it was crap...,"After some thought I have decided to give this film a 4, bearing in mind that whilst I have never reviewed a film before I would say that I am very generous person with points, therefore I am even more surprised how nearly no one had decided to criticise this film as it was. Frankly, I would have thought the average points on here would have about 4-5, to see that it got a 7.7 was shocking, to say the least.The high score given here was the main reason why I went to see the film in the first place, little did I know that it was another one of those artsy fartsy films that certain people (probably those who would actually bother to leave a score) would rate it highly, which is exactly why I too decided to rate this film because I want to give this film the score it really deserves.Immediately I noticed the similarity with 'The Big Labowski' and guessed that they were probably by the same writer. I never had the chance to finish 'The Big Labowski' mainly because I fell asleep after roughly half an hour of it. Honestly, who finds watching a sad ass loser living out his crappy life funny? Not to mention entertaining! This film and 'The Big Labowski' together are easily some of the worst comedies I have ever seen in my life, both films had showed no end of complete pointlessness and stupidity blown out of all proportion, with ridiculous story lines, though I am less sure about 'The Big Lebowski' because I didn't actually finish, and having sat through another film (and fighting to stay awake through some parts of it) by the same writer I am not sure that I want to.Now, back to the film, I will try to analyse without giving away too much of the storyline. It is essentially a string of completely random story that is somehow connected and intertwined, an exploration of the famous six degrees of separation if you will (though a study by MS on msn found it was more like 7), a clever thing to write, true, but the way it was conveyed doesn't do this type of story justice, if you want to see lives intermingle, then watch 'Car Crash' or something. If you are looking to have a good laugh, well, you are much better off looking elsewhere, whilst there were the odd funny moments it is far from being funny enough to keep you entertained, which isn't helped by the severe lack of a realistic storyline, it becomes more believable as the story evolve, with people feeling the pressure and starting to break down, still it was like Alice went to wonderland without following the rabbit, it doesn't connect and thus makes no sense. A recent film that I had seen, 'Ghost Town' was far funnier.It lacked any big idea, you can argue that it's about human nature but the film's portrays humanity in such a way that it assumes all men (and women)are evil/selfish, an overly pessimistic view of life, I am surprised how the Coens brother haven't yet committed suicide if that was what they thought of the world.What surprised me even more, though, was the long list of brilliant actors, truth be told they did a tremendous job making the funny moments... well, funny. I think the only reason why they signed up to the film was because it was written by the Coens brothers, who seems to have had a long list of highly rated films.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
A soap opera without a point,"Here is the guy. He is the central point. And you know nothing about the many guys on the screen. But he is the central character. Fine. And when you expect to find out something about him, here's his family. So we spin into a second plot. Ten minutes later I assure myself it's about him and his family. But no. Here's another star. And a second family. And there is a relationship. We are mid season in this cheap soap. So it's the main guy's family and this other guy's family. By the 25th minute there is more. And more characters get into the story. Surely there is a connection and by the end of season two we'll know. And there are more stars jumping in. And there are more side stories. Is there a main story? I never got to find it.",,Anonymous,Crime
Awful! Complete waste of time,"OK, Brad Pitt did kind of a funny acting as a gay gym teacher. George Clooney also had a couple of good times in his rule. In the overall, the film is boring, not funny. The script is very weak. Stories cross in an artificial way and you can't tell it's a comedy until the film ends and you start to think: ""Well, a drama it's not and I'm pretty sure not an action or triller film either. So, it must have been a comedy! But why the heck didn't I laugh, then?"". It's very disappointing when you go to see a movie from Cohen Brothers, with such a cast (Brad Pitt, George Clooney, John Malkovich) and it still is a bad movie. You gotta work hard to do this. Has been done later, though (remember Ocean's 12?). My advice is to not go watch the movie for its cast. It's hard to believe the actors accepted to work on it.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Craft of the highest order,"Right where to start. This in not one of the great Coen brothers movie's, but rest assured this is still so much better that most of what passes for a movie in today's day and age. It just does not hit the heights of their greatest movies but this is still a extremely well crafted movie than is really an enjoyable romp of a film. As usual with the Coen's you get great casting, direction and a script tighter than a gnat's chuff. The premises here is almost all completely a mcguffin with the supposed finding of some top secret documents and what they mean to all involved. But really with are left with a lot of unsavoury characters who all have their own agenda. All played to perfection with Tilda Swinton and John Malkovich's characters being particularly poisonous, where as the always great George Clooney and Frances McDormand are just needy. It is left to the superb Brad Pitt to give the movie heart and here he is ably supported by Richard Jenkins (the dead father from 'Six Feet Under') to give the movie its heart and soul. So life changing? No, but extremely enjoyable and full of treasures to enjoy again and again.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Solid For The Most Part,"Like many other Coen Brothers' Films, this film manages to be well-acted, well-shot, well-edited, and most of all entertaining. I found the story to be engaging and the characters to be interesting. There were times when I felt the story stopped, but I wasn't extremely affected by it. Overall a very solid movie and I recommend you see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
