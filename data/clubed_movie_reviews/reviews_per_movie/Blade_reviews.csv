Great Vampire Flick,"Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, a half human, half vampire known the daywalker. He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since he teamed up with whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries, but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans (Food as he calls them) and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the world.This movie is well cast, written and directed; ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish. Packed with great fight sequences and slick dialogue, Blade is certainly more action than horror, but it definitely delivers.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Blade"" is a strong, mature comic-book film, with outstanding performances and a unique visual style...","Stephen Norrington's 1998 release ""Blade"" (based on the Marvel comic character) is the film that arguably lead to the recent trend of comic-book movies. It's success (along with that of ""X-Men"") caused people to do something they always should have- take comics seriously as an art form and a medium for storytelling. The film is an incredible, Gothic ride with great performances and unique visuals, and should be seen by any fan of action, horror or film in general.Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a half-human, half-vampire. His mother was bitten while pregnant, and his blood was infected by the vampire virus, granting him some vampire-like powers (such as inhuman strength), although he also suffers from ""The Thirst""- the vampire's natural need to feast on human blood, which he combats using treatments and serums, almost like a drug addict. Blade and his mentor Whistler (Krist Kristopherson) spend their nights hunting and killing vampires who feed on the humans.At the same time, a vampire named Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorf) is plotting to overthrow the noble heads of the various vampire clans, and using them as sacrifices to bring about ""La Magra"" a vampyric blood-god, to destroy humanity and grant himself untold power. Blade and Whistler (along with help from a pathologist played by N'Bushe Wright) must figure out a way to stop Frost's deadly plans before he wipes out all of humanity.The film is truly dark and Gothic. Norrington's direction sets an ominous and deadly mood, and the visuals are all well-crafted. The score by Mark Isham is tragic and melancholy, with some nice techno-y action music thrown in for good measure.Acting is generally good (though Dorf does get a little hammy at times) and everything meshes quite well. The action is nice, though it feels a little staged and over-choreographed, and the visual effects, for the time, were outstanding. I should also mention that this is a violent, violent film. It is the bloodiest of the three movies, and has a lot of gore, which actually almost took me ""out"" of the movie a few times- some scenes felt campy with the sheer amount of carnage and goo being flung at the screen.In addition, there are a couple of scenes and jokes that stick out like a sore thumb, and the tone is a bit too oppressive, making this a hard movie to sit through if you are not in the right mood.I'm giving this a good 8 out of 10. I'd highly recommend it to fans of action and horror. It is a strong vampire film. (Also, a cool note, this movie is one of the several pre-""Matrix"" films to utilize ""bullet-time"", that cool trick where action slows down dramatically to the point where you can see individual bullets whooshing through the air. Just a fun little piece of trivia- ""The Matrix"" did not invent this trick.)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very stylish and entertaining!,"It seems to me that a lot of people don't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the likes. What all these heroes (and in the case of X-Men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring. So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe. At least until he was reinvented.David Goyer did a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight. He can't take all the credit though and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character. The Blade character (Wesley Snipes) is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness. Snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character. He is, however, a pretty rigid actor both in voice and in posture and is only interesting enough for one film (which is clearly seen from the inferior sequels). Kris Kristofferson is good as well and really brings the tormented character of Whistler to life with energy and sense of timing. N'Bushe Wright, however, is fairly weak as a leading lady making her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character. German, Udo Kier, should also be mentioned as he brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race, probably born of his experiences from playing Dracula. Stephen Dorf provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screen villains I have perhaps ever seen.The story is good and, I feel, renews the vampire genre (something that hasn't been done since Robert Rodrigues' From Dusk Till Dawn) by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel. By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. A lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible. Including the effects which are pretty good for their time. I found the vampire ""dustings"" to be a very nice touch. In stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously com-bust which looks great. The fact that the overall effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film which would otherwise have fallen flat on its face.As previously stated Norrington has a very distinct visual style that sets him apart from the directors of the following Blade movies. Del Toro is nearly as skilled but I prefer Norrington's style. His style gives the film a very special look and feel but most importantly it gives the film atmosphere. A very tense dark atmosphere which works great in tune with the main character and story. Along with the visual style the music which also works fine and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie.All in all Blade is a very entertaining movie that should probably have had an 8 from me but a few annoying flaws (which cannot be revealed without spoiling the movie, suffice to say, many of them are located near the ending of the film) does that the film must settle with a high 7.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Let There Be Blood...,"Beneath the streets, behind facades, above the law; conglomerations old and new, slash, shear and saw; unseen but all around, vigilant of every sound, taking lives, destroying chances, tooth and claw.A hero's born to halt the chaos and confusion; to unmask, the guarded secrets of illusion; dressed in black, with sword on back, a mighty strength that others lack, a force arrives to clear the air, remove occlusion.One of the more accomplished takes on the vampires taking over the world genre, with one of the more accomplished, and even to this day spectacular incarnations of a vampire slayer there's been.The blood flows proportionally.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyably stylish flick that gets the dark tone almost right,"Blade was only a foetus when his mother was attacked by vampires and left for dead.  When he is born he is born a half-breed.  As an adult he has been joined by Abraham Whistler, a vampire hunter, to fight the secret war against the vampire culture.  He hunts the impure-blood vampire Deacon Frost who plans to summon La Magra - the Blood God.Now approaching it's second sequel, this film was a dark surprise to me as I didn't expect too much from it.  The plot sees Blade hunting a dangerous vampire seeing to unleash the power of La Magra and take vampires from their shadows into the real world; we also get a bit of back story as well. This plot gives all the best lines to the vampires and not enough good scenes with Blade himself.  I like Blade for the same reason as I like Batman - they are both messed up superheroes of a sort.  The film tells us how Blade was created but it doesn't delve deep enough for my tastes - only once or twice did I really get a feel for his cruel, darker nature (`Please, I only work for them').  I suppose this was to be expected and it certainly manages the darker tone much better than the Batman films did (in the long run).The action is good although it never really gets to the peak of the opening nightclub scene but is good nonetheless.  Some of the effects in the final fight are a bit lacking and they make the usual horror movie mistake of showing too much and having it be less effective than the build up and suggestion of the monster was.Snipes doesn't exactly display a great emotional range here but he is good in the title role nonetheless.  He is a commanding presence and physically good at the action stuff.  Dorff is pretty good as the main vampire - he is slick and plays it well to be a good representation of the `new breed' as the script requires.  Kristofferson is cool and Wright is sexy while still being a good actress!  The support cast contains no real standouts; Lathan is no more than a cameo and isn't really good while people like Lords only stick in the memory due to their name and not their performance.Overall this is an enjoyably slick vampire/action movie.  The end product may be more style than substance but the character of Blade is darkly interesting, even if neither Snipes nor the film really give too much away in terms of his inner workings.  I have yet to see the sequel but I would hope that it keeps the same dark tone that makes this film stand out.",,Anonymous,Horror
Brother Darkness walks at daylight,"Hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read!Let's start with the good things! The quote ""strong bloody violence"" (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well. This is not a movie for kids! Or for the faint of hearted! It has Blade as a central character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to hold/justify the action scenes! The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. The action scenes are great here too.OK over to the things I didn't like. The overall story is too thin. It's enough as I've written above to hold the action scenes together, but there could be more. And a character like Blade deserves more (imo). The drama therefor isn't the best ... also it's use of clichés doesn't help. Some characters are underwritten ... That's that! :o)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant vampire action thriller from the better half of the 90s,"Fantastically shot, well paced.. arguably Snipes' most impressive performance to date and lots of fun martial arts fight sequences involving swords and guns - not to mention the unique and timeless soundtrack. Blade is one of my favourite action movies of all time, up there with Die Hard and Predator.Director Stephen Norrington is what Chris Cunningham (Aphex Twin videos) would have been if he dropped the weirdness and went into more conventional movies.. or if David Fincher stopped with the thrillers and did straight action. It is a massive shame we couldn't see more from Stephen, but at least we have Blade.Certain special effects haven't aged well (and are in desperate need of a remaster!) but aside from that, this movie is great visually. Norrington's choice of shots, the way scenes are lit is masterful.The performances he gets out of his actors are great too. It's not surprising Snipes loved the Blade character so much as to later method act and speak to cast/crew in character.. not surprising at all when the first movie of the trilogy this strong (though I pretend Blade 2 and 3 never happened) Watch this movie if you haven't already, especially if you love the 90s aesthetic or if you enjoy vampire-related movies/TV shows. The Blade character is iconic and Snipes was born to play him, and this movie is a 2 hour proof-of-concept for Norrington being the greatest director nobody ever talks about.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The way a comic book flick should be made,"I didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic flicks. Ever since the ""Batman"" series, ""Spawn,"" ""Judge Dredd,"" and many other pitiful p.g.-13 bombs, I dodged everything at all cost. I would question in my mind, ""why can't someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story, how difficult is that?"" And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade. This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, the good against evil, etc. Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies, and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the movie was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first. Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks I've seen in a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The best vampire slaying movie ever my number one favorite Blade film,"Blade (1998) is the best action/horror vampire slaying movie ever made! I always have enjoyed watching Blade. My number one favorite Blade film I love this film to death. It is one of the best action sci-fi films of all time. Wesley Snipes best role till it's days ever! No one can play Blade like Wesley Snipes did! Blade is not an origin story, but it is a real world of darkness. Blade is just so bad and anti-hero which is perfect for the world he drives in. It is my favorite comic book Vampire movie. I love this film, I love the action and I love everything in it! I love Wesley Snipes and Kris Kris Kristofferson so much they have such a chemistry between each other. Wesley Snipes Kicks ass!!!!! This is the most super hero Vampire slayer film ever made!It is been so long since I last watch this film. I kept watching it 11.year ago in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was been released I kept watching Blade 1 and 2 on my CD on my computer and on VHS tape that I had this film. Blade of trilogy was the only film I owned on VHS I did not owned Blade II or Blade: Trinity at that time, but I have now the whole trilogy on Blu-ray. The best dang vampire slaying movie ever (say that fast five times)! Its funny too, it shows him killing a bunch of vampires but then regular people are thinking that he is killing humans! I watch this film as a child and all the blood in it and the violence made me crunch. I grew up with this film, 11.years ago kept constantly watching this film over and over, till it's days it is my favorite best Vampire flick. Blood and the crunch in this movie is AWESOME!! Just awesome!So In this movie Blade is a half human, half vampire, hybrid he protects the human race from other vampires and in this movie he has to stop Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff). Deacon Frost wants to resurrect the blood god ""La Magra"", And he needs Blade's blood and he needs 12 volunteers. So that he can walk in the sunlight and declares extinction to human race. Blade is humanity's last hope!Wesley Snipes plays a half-mortal, half-immortal charged with ridding the earth of a race of vampires led by Stephen Dorff in this action-packed blockbuster.This movie right here oh my god! is this movie AWESOME! Watching this as kid you really don't know much, other that Wesley Snipes is a Bad Ass!!!! But now when you are older you can really know how much of a bad ass Blade really was and he does making a point! Wesley Snipes is AWESOME! Yes awesome!So yea... Wesley Snipes does a good job in this movie, everyone does a great job in this movie, so far, even Donal Logue as Quinn with a long hair and beard hi did a wonderful job. Stephen Dorff is actually pretty good, I haven't really seen much of Stephen Dorff's work yet, I'm pretty sure he is not even around today, I am not sure what happened today, I'm not sure if he just drop off the map or if he just quit acting all together, but yea. You would never guess this was MARVEL movie because MARVEL's name was nowhere near this property so far. So that was kind a odd to see this choice but yea, we all knew who he is anyways, so that become kind a cool, and yea violence, blood, the gore amazingly AWESOME!!!!! Yea, I brought the word amazingly back. It is crazy, over the top, sword fights, knives throwing's, all this wrapped in the one and you get that final fight between him and Deacon, dang that is good time! That is good awesome times you know. And it is just nothing like that right now and I am hoping that we get another sequel to Blade: Trinity. The actress Arly Jover who played Mercury, Deacon Frost's girlfriend was so sexy and hot and she is so awesome with her hair and changing her hair styles for 11.years I was confused with a thought that Deacon's girlfriend was played by Traci Lords because she is blonde. It took me so long to figure it that out, that it was Arly Jover played Deacon's girlfriend and not Tracy Lords.What I like about the character Blade are his gadjets, the sharp ones in particular and his outfit and style! Bottom of line It is my favorite best film still I think Blade II is a little better than Blade, but I still love the trilogy. Movies like this don't exist today. The rating I give to Blade is 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

It still feel FRESH to WATCH,"To Re-Live my childhood memories I went for this movie without having any expectations in today's generation, because it was released in long back of 1998. But this movie is still fresh man! It's Actions, BGMs, Style, Technology everything is still fresh surprisingly 2 and half decades later as well. I liked the way of Hand to Hand combat between characters and of course those High Tech guns of that time. Although it doesn't paid attention to the origin of the Vampire Society and their work cultures among human beings yet they focused on their hunting skills. I think in the later part of this series they will pay attention to their origin and work culture.Overall a good movie for Action Lovers! And apart from bloody violence safe to go with family. 7 Out of 10 Stars from my side..",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A palatable offering of Snipes and dice,"Blade is everything Spawn wanted to be and wasn't. While Spawn was a loud, obnoxious, incoherent mess that should have stayed in Hell with its erstwhile hero, Blade is a relatively subdued (it's nice to actually hear the soundtrack), stylish, well-directed movie that actually tries to build empathy and pathos into the characters. While both are adaptations from comic-books, only one is a page-turner.Blade, or Eric as his mom calls him, but which superhero would command respect with the name Eric, is half-man, half-vampire, made so by his mother, who survived a vampire attack long enough to give birth to him. This gives Blade a certain edge in his understandable grudge against vampires, ""all of our strengths and none of our weaknesses"" as his main vampire nemesis attests. The aforementioned nemesis is Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) who wants to unleash a vampire apocalypse on the world, decrying the Mafia-type approach that has served vampires so well up to this point - ""humans are our food, not our allies,"" he explains. Blade is aided by his mentor/weapons specialist Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) and a female hematologist he rescued, Karen. Her expertise lends her to both create anti-vampire blood, and a possible cure for Blade that would make him fully human again. Although one gets the sense that Blade's fate isn't entirely tragic. He relishes kicking vampire butt.The movie Blade succeeds for two reasons. It's technically polished, with good acting, excellent directing and production design, and awesome special effects - the way the vampires turn to skeletons and blow away like dried parchment when they die is way cool. There are three accomplished action sequences, the opening party scene which Blade inconveniently crashes, a brush with death on a subway, and the final conflict, with some special effects I can say, as a movie seasoned veteran, I've never seen before. The second reason is that Blade understands the inherent pull of the vampire myth. Vampirism represents a life given to sin, essentially. They are sensual creatures, dependent on flesh and blood for survival, shirking the light, and yet eternal, like evil fleshly lusts the Bible warns about. Vampires are not tragic, like Interview with a Vampire would have you believe, but fun, cool, and sexy. That's their power. Is not sin sexy? why would it be tempting otherwise? Vampires are cool because they live in sin without paying its consequences - death. But for that reason, they are the enemy and must die. For sin is, in the final analysis, bad. This essential good/evil conflict must be there for this type of story to work. Spawn had neither this nor the technical excellence Blade has, which is why it sucks so bad. Blade reminded me of another good vampire movie, Bram Stoker's Dracula, by Francis Ford Coppola. They would make good companion pieces on video.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Iconic Opener,"That blood bath club scene was so awesome. Best part of the movie in my opinion and set the tone going forward.'Blade' is credited with starting off the success of Marvel films, and even saving the comic book genre in general. A year before we had 'Batman & Robin' which was so full of camp you could have roasted marshmellows in the theatre. Watching 'Blade' 25 years later, it still has some corny moments, though it fits right in with the late 90's and was simply the times.Wesley Snipes was the perfect choice for Blade, no question. Still waiting for the new adaptation, and although I have every bit of confidence in Mahershala Ali, he has big boots and a sleek leather jacket to fill. I don't think Stephen Dorff gets enough credit either as the villain, he was very good too.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very stylish movie.,"This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it.  It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever.  I liked this one even more than X-men.  In fact, this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either.  Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade.  He is just not an emotionless super hero.  Also, this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating.  Sure comic books are for kids mainly, but I like a little more in my movies. Let's face it, if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic.  This comic book adaptation also has something that many don't.  A good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy.

"Thin On Plot, But A Fun Ride","Occasionally ridiculous, sometimes technologically dated, never less than fun. Snipes is really well cast as Vampire Terminator. Plenty of spectacle and good action sequences, directed with a very straight ace that still allows for dashes of humour if not quite managing winks to the camera.

Maybe it's my 90s nostalgia,"But this movie is great. I love the cinematography (I mean the opening blood rave scene is just epic), the soundtrack and Wesley Snipes as Blade.I'm not sure how it ended up on such a low rating, because this movie is better than most modern 'superhero' flicks and miles better than Underworld.
It's an excellent dark comic translation, packed with great fighting scenes and style. It's not bloated with special effects; it's dark, minimal and gritty.I recently re-watched Blade II, which was directed by Guillermo del Toro, and was equally surprised by the rating. It stayed true to the vibe of the first movie. I would rate II overall a bit less, but not by too much.Conclusion: It's going to be hard to make a remake worthy of Wesley Snipes and his Blade legacy.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Unfortunately, there is a vampire who will try to conquer the earth, but up against Blade, who knows.

Cheesy fun,"Blade (1998) is an entertaining action film that looks and sounds good - or should I say ”cool” because that surely has been the aim with all the sunglasses, swords, camera-run gimmicks and whatnots. Wesley Snipes plays (and growls his way through) the lead – a vampire hunter called Blade – and does it rather well. A lot of action set to the heavily tecno/hiphop -based soundtrack is what the film is all about, with some humour and drama thrown in time to time. Kris Kristofferson (Whistler), N'Bushe Wright (Karen) and Stephen Dorff (Deacon Frost) support in the cast. The film's opening scene is a great one and it's rather sad that the rest of the movie doesn't quite manage to stay on the same level – we've seen the best the film has to offer after the first ten minutes or so.Blade is kinda cheesy fun, a guilty pleasure of some sort. It's over the top in in a lot of ways (starting from Wesley's growling, continuing with the often ridiculous use of music and ending with the endless sunglass-related jokes) and does it shamelessly too. You might not love the movie or anything but somehow you take a seat on the sofa every time the film's on TV. 3/4",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Style, Class and gallons of blood!!","This film is superb! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade the vampire hunter with pure class, he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make Bruce Lee proud. The movie is a fast paced, thrill ride of action and superb stunts. The first action scene and last are outstanding and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads. The script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too. Wesley should have done more action films than he has, i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all, only Bruce Willis, Stallone and perhaps Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) come close. Also aswell as Wesley being quality, Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy. It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes should come across as menacing, but he does. Overall the film is sharp, stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Genuine Trailblazer,"Is it just me or does it feel like Blade has never gotten the proper recognition it deserved for being a trailblazing film?Think about it, it was the first majorly successful Marvel film (Blade predates both X-Men and Spiderman) with a hard R rating staring a black superhero protagonist. Not to mention, it's also a techno-heavy action film complete with leather jackets, sunglasses, Kung Fu, and slow-motion bullet dodging that came out a year before The Matrix did.Blade really was a movie that was ahead of the curve in many aspects but it's still far from being a perfect masterpiece. For one, the film hasn't aged particularly well, especially in regard to its CGI effects. This was back in 1998 so CGI was far from being perfect but even still, T2 and Jurassic Park used it much more effectively several years before Blade did and it still looks very crappy here.Tonally the film is also fairly inconsistent bouncing around from dark and somber to outright campy and cheesy. But even at its cheesiest, Blade is undeniably a fun time. This was one of the earliest R-rated movies I watched as a kid (it was shown to me by my grandmother oddly enough) so I will always have a soft spot for this film. Wesley Snipes is clearly having a ball playing a vampire-hunting badass and all of the Kung Fu/gun fights are a ton of fun as is the gratuitous gore.All and all, Blade is a wildly entertaining Action Horror Superhero film that was ahead of its time and helped pave the way for all dark superhero movies to come. And for that alone, Blade is a movie that deserves respect.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
fun action,"Blade (Wesley Snipes) is born to a mother who was bit by a vampire. This gave him superpowers which he uses to battle evil vampires with the help of Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). The robotic acting from Wesley Snipes and the constant cool pose fighting are what makes this a fun watch.The story seems like just filler for the next action scene. Stephen Dorff and Udo Kier make for good creepy villains. The dialog is fairly lackluster. The production value is good for this B-movie. It does have a dull look to it all, and needs more flash. If you love blood splattering gore, this is a good watch.N'Bushe Wright plays the doctor that Blade rescues from a vampire. She's not up to scratch. She doesn't have the screen presence or the joyful innocence to provide a good foil to Snipes. She's almost as robotic as Blade.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

By the time drs were able to get him out of his dying mother Eric had already undergone exposure to the vampire virus. As he grew up, he developed incredible strength, endurance, and reflexes. Along with the ability to heal from injuries much faster than a normal human. Unfortunately for Eric though, he also acquired the vampires need to feed on blood.Along with Abraham Whistler (both friend and mentor), Eric adopts the name Blade and begins exterminating vampires wherever they can be found.I'd give a score of 7.5 for the whole Blade trilogy. The reason I'd say that score instead of an 8+ is bc of the 3rd movie. Blade is an awesome ride with a great cast,, and Blade II is even better (of course I think that can be attributed to the genius of Del Toro as director). Blade Trinity is a fun ride as well, but not as good as it could've been. Apparently there was a LOT of trouble on the set of the movie, and it sounds like most of the trouble was coming from Snipes himself. Thankfully,, due to Reynolds and Biel, as well as a very good supporting cast, it's still enjoyable enough to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One great DVD version of this gory action film.  9 of 10!,"This is a comment on the home DVD version of Blade.  For its type of action/shooting/blood and gore movie, I give it 9 of 10.  But those who don't like this type of movie, skip it quick!!First let me state that the DVD's picture and soundtrack are very close to the best there is.  Surround sound is used just as it should be, and the explosions sound about as real as any I've heard on DVD.  It really gives your subwoofer a workout.  The DVD is worth a watch just for the sound!Blade is a comic book story put to life.  Wesley Snipes is just perfect in his role as Blade, the half-vampire fighting evil and trying to eradicate all vampires. The effects are creative and the whole 110 minutes of the movie will grip you.  Very exciting!However, there is a lot of blood and gore, and I found myself turning away a few times.  If this is not your type of movie, don't watch it. Period!!",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good effects and much fighting, but no horror","When I saw the first announcement for this film, I thought it must be great (I'm a big Wesley Snipes fan). Seeing the preview lowered my expectations, and the movie itself was a disappointment.It is most of the time nothing but an average action movie, and even if the effects and fighting scenes are good to excellent, the story itself was quite flat and boring, and there was nothing about horror. The vampires were just evil humans with some special abilities, not a symbol of forces or fears in our subconciousness, our animal inside, or of natural forces (such as the pest), or such. The start of the film is the best part of the whole picture; Traci Lords plays Racquel (even if nobody ever calls her with a name in the movie), a vampire woman, which takes a human victim (a man which believes she loves/likes him) to a vampire disco. That whole scene culminates more and more and really makes you shiver - it was a very good start --- until Blade appears and starts the first of the well known boring good hero fights: the good hero kills everybody (i.e. every vampire) and is soooo cool and soooo invinceable and sooooo boring... one of the vampires he kills is Racquel, and later I thought that this was quite symbolical, for she has been the one which had ruled the only really good scene of the movie. The later film never comes back to the level of the start. There are some nice jokes in it (exploding vampire blood etc), and many effects are excellent (but not that strange scene where the blood god is created. that looks just absurd), but the fighting is nothing but the well-known typical unrealistic stuff. In all his films, Wesley Snipes is a natural cool one; but here he _tries_ to be cool all the time, and becomes, of course, very uncool this way.This film has been compared to Spawn, but Spawn is a totally different kind of film; a good family movie where good fights against evil, and good wins. At least that movie was not promising what it cannot keep. Of course, the film about Spawn was very different than the comic; while Blade was really close. But I expect more of a vampire movie, especially if they have such excellent actors, than only an action movie with expensive effects.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really fun Scifi rip on Vamps,Never read comics don't care about source material.Wesley does a great job at bringing a comic character to action scifi stage.All this before it was really a popular thing happened now and again mostly bad tv shows and made fors.In this movie you get a full circle start to finish on Blade.There were sequels but they were lesser and just for money not for story.Stephen Dorph/F plays big bad well kinda.A bunch of other 90s actors and Kris Kristopherson fill cast.They all do ok to good but it is not a big acting movie.Soundtrack is good as are FX they hold up surprisingly well even better than Spawn.Guess I will have to revisit other two eventually.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody Vampire Film,"This isn't a bad vampire film at all. It takes on a new direction from the usual 'Dracula' style and has similarities to 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' and True Blood, both series that I rate highly.There is a cheesey element to things as well as the blood and gore and kick-ass fighting scenes.Snipes has a great presence as the title character and no one sticks out as wrong in their part, except perhaps Pearl, who is just wrong on all sorts of other levels.Considering the age of the film, it has stood the test of time well, but it will be interesting to see what Marvel do with it as they release the new series.I've got Blade II and Trinity lined up to watch as well. I will be curious to see if they are as good as I remember.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The one who saved Marvel,"""Blade"" slices through the supernatural genre with Wesley Snipes at the helm, delivering a stylish and gritty vampire action film that stands the test of time. Snipes embodies the Daywalker with a magnetic coolness, a perfect fit for the vampire hunter draped in black leather. The film editing crafts exhilarating fight sequences that blend martial arts prowess with a razor-sharp edge. The strength of the movie lies in its unapologetic approach to a darker corner of the Marvel universe, setting the stage for a new era of superhero cinema. However, the weakness may emerge in moments where the narrative succumbs to genre conventions. The music, composed by Mark Isham, adds a pulsating electronic beat that echoes the film's edgy atmosphere. With an 7/10 rating, ""Blade"" is a cinematic stake through the heart, proving that sometimes, to combat the supernatural, you need a hero who's just as extraordinary.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Has it''s Flaws but a Neat Stylish movie,"I saw it when it got released back in 1998.
I saw it again today July-2019, that's a 20 year aprrox. evolution on my overall psyche ...and I found it stylishly made even today, too. Judging with todays standards where we are bombarded with cgi in plethora ..name it.. avengers, spiderman, aquaman...etc etc. These are graphics made from software that was available in 1998, so they are not groundbreaking , but it passed off even today to label it ''stylishly made then''.
Wesley looks good, at times very good, Leather jacket and all and cool crew cut.

Undeniably cool,"Blade deserves a lot of credit for essentially kickstarting the modern superhero genre, as it came before X-Men and Spider-Man.

A Marvel-lously enjoyable vampire flick.,"Long before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a thing, director Stephen Norrington gave us Blade. Based on Marvel's comic-book series about a vampire hunter who is part bloodsucker himself, the film starred Wesley Snipes in the title role, with Stephen Dorff as his nemesis, nasty vampire Deacon Frost, who is attempting to take over the world by resurrecting an ancient 'blood god'.Norrington does a great job in translating the comic to screen, delivering wonderfully choreographed fight scenes, plenty of stylish visuals, a smattering of gore, and a pounding techno soundtrack, with only a smidge of unconvincing CGI to occasionally ruin the effect. Snipes, a solid actor and skilled martial artist, fits the character to a 'T'; able support comes from Kris Kristofferson as Blade's mentor Whistler and N'Bushe Wright as helpful hematologist Karen, who is unwittingly caught up in the battle between good and evil.Also joining in for the fun are cult favourite Udo Kier as 'pure-blood' vampire Dragonetti (who has the best death scene of the film), Donal Logue as Frost's rowdy right hand man Quinn, and Traci Lords as sexy vamp Racquel (whose screen-time is all too brief, her character destroyed in the film's blood-soaked opening nightclub scene).8/10. Still holds up as a very worthy Marvel movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Far too graphic, but it has a nice look","I dont think much of Blade as a film, it was not particularly entertaining, and it certainly did not add anything new to the cinema world, or the tale of vampires for that matter.  It has a very modern, cool look to it.  Blade has a nice costume and some extra special weapons which he puts to good use. But some of the violence was a bit too graphic, and unnecessary.  The story itself is quite stupid and Dorff is really annoying as the evil vampire, although not quite as annoying as his bimbo blonde side kick who really should take some acting lessons.  I was just really bored by the whole experience.  A total waste of money and time, but it could have been so much better.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

a movie that can make you climb but that can't carry you,"""Blade"" is a very, very interesting film. A very raw and bloody film, with very explicit scenes. Blade is a great protagonist and I don't know whether to describe him as a hero or an anti-hero. A great character that I can't wait to explore. The plot of the film is very simple, Blade trying to stop the advance of vampires, and it works, and also thanks to the good writing I got bored little, maybe the duration should be disposed of. The actors were very good: Wesley Snipes was great and the other actors also did a great job. The characters are well characterized, I also liked Whistler. The antagonist Frost is an excellent antagonist, well played by Stephen Dorff, motivated and charismatic. The action and combat scenes are well structured and thought out, with great special effects that make it more realistic and beautiful to see. I really liked Norrington's choice of director to make the film more enjoyable for the viewer with little story and a lot of blood, managing not to bore those who watch the film. But, as I said, I would have shortened the duration a bit. Anyway this is a film that has good values both technical and entertainment, but unfortunately it is not one of those movies that haunt your mind for days after viewing or that have such extraordinary points that you appreciate the film at high levels. "" Blade"" is a normal cute movie of the superhero world that is bloody as it needs: it can make you climb but then can not carry you. I'm still curious to see the other 2 subsequent chapters of the trilogy and I'm very curious to see the remake next year..

Amusing,"Blade is amusing. It's cheesy and dated, but also competent. First, the writing is efficient. Blade's backstory is explained quickly and the narrative jumps right into his vampire hunting. Next, the R rating suits the edgy mood. Also, all the characters have motivation and purpose. Blade is out for revenge, Whistler is a role model, Dr. Jenson creates antidotes, and Frost is an insecure outcast among the vampire elite. Dialogue is cringey, some plot points are nonsense, and Blade's character is inconsistent, but this is forgivable because Blade is having fun with itself. It lacks depth, but Blade provides enough to be enjoyable.Technically, Blade is proficient. The sound is sometimes unconvincing, but that's offset by complex combat and symbolically muted sequences. The excessive leather is corny, yet also trendsetting. Plus, the gory atmosphere is refreshing from a superhero movie. The editing has energetic fights, measured emotions, and occasional creativity (though, the runtime could've been trimmed). The CGI has aged poorly, but the practical effects are welcome. Also, the imagery captures action clearly and includes dramatic framing. Overall, Blade has engaging sequences (especially the intro), a balanced tone, and enthusiasm. It isn't a masterpiece, but Blade is fair entertainment.Writing: 5/10

Fantastic thanks to Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff,"Blade is a great adaptation of the famous comic book series of the same name.  I'm actually surprised Entertainment Weekly gave it a D+.  Wesley Snipes is one of my favorite actors and is perfect for the role of the tortured half man, half vampire Blade.  Stephen Dorff is totally cool as Blade's young and psychotic arch-nemesis, Deacon Frost.  Blade's tight looking weapons too.  They range from a double-bladed boomerang to little capsules loaded with stuff that will blow up vampires.  Blade is a great film with two great stars, perfectly executed fight scenes, and lots of cool shots of vampires heads exploding. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
About half a good movie,"The movie started out great, a little bit of that Matrix thing going on. The concept is great, a ninja batman half vampire hunting vampires. However, about half way through you pretty much noticed they ran out of budget or something and you see far less visuals of vampires burning up as they die and they resort to simply background flashes. Of course this all culminates into one of the worst CGI monsters in the final act, it looked like the rendering wasn't completed.Storywise it was also pretty good until the 2nd half where it becomes just a bit too convoluted and pointless to follow. So by that time I pretty much fell asleep.Overall a slightly above average film that will entertain you for a night with friends, but ultimately forgettable after a couple of hours.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Exhilarating and Exciting Action/Thriller Masterpiece!,"Blade is a fantastic action/thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would say to be his best performance yet.This film has everything that you would ask for in an action/thriller, it has plenty of blood, guts and gore, a twisted, disturbed bad buy, moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twists.Their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects, Wesley Snipes fighting movement is fantastic.This film is in my opinion a must see, Wesley Snipes cool, solid appearance makes this film and I can't wait for the sequel 'BLADE 2' being released next year.My IMDB Rating - 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Interesting spin on the vampire myth,"Blade is a movie based on a comic book of the same name. A vampire, Blade, who has enhanced ""powers"" is a vigilante... out to stop the underworld of the vampires.Blade is an interesting twist on the tired old story of vampires - with visually impressive (for the most part) action, special effects and design. The basic premise is pretty good although the story doesn't really last for the long running time of almost two hours. Quite possibly - this movie would have been a hell of a lot sharper if the editor cut half an hour out of the movie.Also - the film goes out on a whimper... If there was a better ending - it would have been a more satisfying ending.The movie seems to pay homage to both Hong Kong action films and newer stuff like ""Mortal Kombat"" (eg: lots of martial arts set to a thumping techno soundtrack) - although I wish there was a bit less orchestral music and more techno!Wesley Snipes is impressive in the action sequences but his character is a little bit shallow (makes Batman look deep!).OK - but could have been much sharper and better!",,Anonymous,Horror
Staggeringly Mediocre and Mindnumbingly Dumb,"I really wanted to like this (a fantastic hero hunting vampires in the big city; sounds like good fun with action thrown in), but it's almost unwatchable. I like it when the movie sucks you in with a plausible story, believable characters and at least a little respect for the viewer.This movie fails almost entirely on those counts. Right from the opening scene, too many things made suspension of disbelief nearly impossible for me. Even in a comic hero movie your science should work; positing the existence of vampires in the first place is fine, but don't do a lot of stupid NON-vampire things unless a reason is given or it's obvious why it works this way instead of how it works in our world. The main villain has no presence or sense of menace whatsoever.I was going to go on, but it's not worth it.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A broken promise,"What began as a great promise of a dark film with plot weight, quickly fades into a children's story that only serves as an excuse for fight choreography and to show a couple of visual effects that don't end up being convincing, considering that this same factor is presented as a great card in the first half of the film. The plot becomes superfluous, with no real purpose and even when the villain seems to succeed, only half of what was prophesied happens.I enjoyed the gore sequences and the practical special effects, but it could have been much better. Blade is a character with great potential, inserted in a great universe, unfortunately wasted this time, ending up not being a good action movie, much less a good horror movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Its nineties stylings only occasionally come close to cheesy and its relatively generic plot isn't quite so much 'seen it before' as 'I can tell where it's going to go', but the hyper-energetic action set-pieces and confidently laid-back spirit are infectious in a surprising way. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Blade is the first Marvel movie to be a massive success and it has everything expected of a good adaptation: adrenaline-packed action, vampire killing, and an ominous vibe. Wesley Snipes is awesome as the main character. Some may criticize the movie for minor reasons, but the majority of action fans liked the movie as much as I did.

Excellent vampire action,"I gave this movie a ""10"" and I feel it is my duty to explain why. It is important first of all to realize what this movie is and what is not. It is an action movie, it is not a masterful exploration of the human condition. ""Blade"" is right up there as my favorite action movie of all time, with the possible exceptions of ""The Rock"" and ""The Matrix"". It does everything an action movie needs to do and then some: it has a fast-moving plot, engaging characters who drive the plot rather than bog it down, it creates a desire in the viewer for the good guy to win, and this last it does better than in any other movie I've ever seen, it creates a pulse-pounding visual experience. Another way in which ""Blade"" goes above and beyond is in its having a ""gimmick"", if you will. Just as ""The Rock"" had that awful poison gas and Alcatraz, and ""The Matrix"" had . . . well, go see it for yourself, Blade has this whole vampire culture it depicts, and a conflict of identity for the title character that comes into play at several points in the movie and does nothing but enhance the experience. Snipes is incredible. Every single gesture, change in posture, and facial expression is just wonderfully intense and perfectly befitting a vampire hunter. The camerawork includes several shots using a fascinating pseudo time-lapse technique which make you nervous even when the characters are just driving. The fight scenes are unparalleled, and as the official site said, there are weapons and techniques rarely seen in American action movies, you really have to see the way these guys move to believe it. What really sets this movie apart is that every scene is intense, there is not a boring scene in the whole movie. The presence of the vampires is constantly felt after the opening scene, and the pressure never lets up. Even the character development scenes make you nervous, because there is almost always some helpless human that you are afraid a vampire is going to chomp into any second, despite the fact that the threat is taking a backseat to the dialogue for a moment. Also, even when nothing tangibly exciting is happening, there is this kind of weird lighting that sort of puts you on edge and makes you enter Blade's world, making you feel what it's like to be a vampire. I saw this movie with a bunch of guys, and when Blade started up his motorcycle, all of us yelled ""yeah!"", it's just that good. If there is any criticism for this film, it could only be for its plot, but I found there were enough twists and turns to keep it from becoming predictable, and besides, you honestly won't have time to be thinking about the plot. This was a movie that had my friends and I pumped the whole way home from the theater. My comments may be a little biased because I like movies and TV shows with vampires, and am a regular viewer of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but even if Blade was fighting nuns this movie would be awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Wesley & Kristofferson Had a Ball,"Enjoyed this blood sucking and nipping at the neck film, the plot had many different twists and turns and if you are looking for lots of blood and gore, this is the film to view. Wesley Snipes,(Blade), did a great job of chopping and cutting up any blood sucker that came across his path. Kris Kristofferson,(Abraham Whistler), gave an outstanding supporting role and assisted Blade through the many problems he had to face to avoid from being over powered by the VAMPS. There is also some very hot looking females to add lots of sex and action to this story, which is not your usual run of the mill vampire flick.

The Blade is dull.,"3.5 out of 10Blade's opening segment, an action-packed gun/martial arts battle set in a blood-drenched nightclub, is a knockout action sequence.  It's fast-paced, stylishly directed, and edited for maximum intensity.  It's also the movie's only watchable scene.  The rest of the film devolves into a silly tale about reviving blood gods and whatnot, most of it incomprehensible junk that serves as filler in-between the action, which quickly grows redundant.The movie is packed to the brim with stunts and fight scenes, but most of them lack the precious sense of fun that makes the best of action movies exhilarating (the recent Equilibrium wildly succeeds with its action in comparison to where Blade resoundingly fails).  Director Stephen Norrington has an eye for stylish visuals, but fails to bring invigorating energy to the proceedings. As the lead, Wesley Snipes is brooding and bland, a complete failure from a dramatic standpoint.  His impending crisis is neither engrossing nor particularly interesting, just another bland subplot in this soulless action thriller.",,Anonymous,Horror
The Sharpest Blade,"Blade (1998) Review: Blade gives a rather new twist to vampires. With Wesley Snipes as Blade, expect some action. I looked forward to this. Here we go.Our hero Blade stalks the night. He hunts vampires. Unlike Vampire Hunter D, he's not a bounty hunter, he has an agenda. The villain is Deacon Frost done well by Stephen Dorff. His agenda, to rule the world.The action is tight and quick. Blade seems rather unstoppable. His sleek and destructive way of dispatching the vampires is damn cool to watch. Wesley Snipes is pretty good as Blade. his performance is quite good and gritty. Good choice as Blade.The atmosphere of the movie is perfect. In the dark and decadent city, vampires lurk for prey, so does Blade. The scenery is very stylish, dark and corrupting. Another plus is Blade is not just another faceless hero, we get character development. Blade is not in the mood to talk about his past. You will find out why.Blade also has a decent plot. The villain here has a rather sinister plan at hand. Blade is also not a goody two shoes. He pretty much lets his actions speak louder than his words and is brutally honest. I like the gritty hero, not the milk drinking, say your prayers, and eat your vitamins hero. Blade is the better anti-hero. Blade does have a few drawbacks, the bad vampire henchmen are not that menacing. Most are just a group of faceless mobs that are dispatched with ease. The only henchmen worth looking out for is Quinn played well by Donal Logue.The Last Word: Blade delivers. I enjoyed this one the most. This is a stylish take on vampires. One more thing, Blade is violent, so sent the kids to bed and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Gritty Superhero Horror Flick before the MCU,"If one wonders where the real success for Marvel movies kickstarted, it's not hard to look back on Blade with Wesley Snipes. Released in the summer of '98, the film was a smash hit with audiences and went on to set the stage for future adaptations of the company's iconic work. Alongside being one of Snipes' most signature roles, the film has landed a strong following, spawning two sequels and a short lived TV show on Spike TV, mainly due to it being a much darker horror flick than most features in the superhero genre. So looking back on the movie almost 25 years later, how does it hold up in today's day and age?The film follows a human with vampire strengths named Blade, who together with his mentor Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) and hematologist Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright), fights against vampires, namely the exceptionally vicious Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff). With a concept like that, one would imagine a lot of extravagant action packed moments, and the film more than ever delivers on that. Each choreographed set piece allows for a lot of high stakes to occur whenever Blade is duking it out against specific foes, from pompous vampire rebels to full on demons. In addition to Wesley Snipes' martial arts background, the character of Blade himself is fully jacked on weaponry, battle armor, and all sorts of crazy attire that one would expect from a dangerous bounty hunter. Given how Blade came to be in the first place as a half vampire half human, the film allows just enough breathing room for the titular character to showcase his true soft side hidden within his cold buff exterior. From heavy origins to an understandable demeanor, Blade himself remains a thoroughly thought out flawed antihero.That being said, while the title character may be intriguing on his own, the movie itself could have benefited from stronger substance. Considering that the main antagonists in the film are a group of modern day vampires that Blade has been against since his beginnings, that premise does sound very intense on paper. However, in execution, the film goes for a more good guy vs bad guy approach in Blade's biggest enemy Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff). As a result, a lot of the film's slice and dice action becomes fairly repetitive to the point of almost taking center stage of much needed character development. While Karen and Whistler fulfill their roles pretty well, they remain fairly two dimensional just to move the plot forward, even with top notch performances from Wright and Kristofferson. Even most of the vampires outside of Frost are pretty bland as far as tropes go, many of whom literally being used to kill human beings, stop Blade and that's it. One could imagine a film like this intentionally being straightforward to save room for the action, but that may have been a double edged sword.On to the notable highlights, the film is quite a visual spectacle in terms of playful filmmaking. A lot of extreme camera angles, modernesque macabre costumes, exaggerated lighting, and fast paced cutting between long shots are shown through many heavily coordinated set pieces, and one can tell how much hard work the production team put into the feature. As for the VFX, given director Stephen Norrington's background as a special effects artist and sculptor, the work shown on display does look outdated and cheesy by today's standards, but creatively frightening nevertheless. Outside of the practical blood effects, the more imaginative work is shown through the work of computers, especially once the third act kicks in. Lastly, outside of the production design and crazy effects work, Mark Isham's score might be the most successful at recreating an intensely action packed horror flick, with a lot of haunting tunes fading in from the more rock heavy sequences. If the script and character development are fairly lacking, at least the film knows how to throw a good visual punch.So while Blade might not have the finest story in tune for an otherwise iconically gritty superhero, it still remains a thrilling action flick with enough highly tense fight scenes, solid performances, flawed albeit creative effects and appropriately jarring music. Regardless if you've seen this movie before or not, it's definitely worth a watch purely on how much it set ahead for comic book film adaptations today. It's been announced that the MCU will be bringing Blade back to the screen with Mahershala Ali, but if you ask me, Wesley Snipes will always be the definitive cinematic representation of the martial artist daywalker.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A subject that may be now rejected by people,"Blade was the first of three movies that presented a black superhero to the silver screen. David Goyer the writer of Blade knew what he was doing when he was writing the first film knowing some people would reject it the first time watching it. The movie is beautiful itself; the theme, atmosphere, story, and character development all come into the mind as you watch it. However, the action sequences could use a little more lest than what it had, but that is stupid Hollywood for you never making it believable, I just laziness. I felt really good after watching it, and understood that something's things really aren't the way you perceive it.

great action/horror based on a comic,"For a few years now I HATE cinecomics with all my heart because for years now Hollywood has no longer been able to make good ones, but now between political correct and woke between the inability of directors and screenwriters to create interesting works the cinemacomics genre is became one of the most aberrant things in the seventh art.Years ago however it wasn't like this, years ago films based on comics that were really good films were made and Blade is one of these, in fact it is one of the best ever, certainly the best of the trilogy even if it is common opinion that the best is the second chapter, but for me it's not like that, blade 2 is very nice, but the first is better.The atmospheres of Blade are very dark , not glossy and light like in today's cinecomics (Morbius??? Venom????) violence is present, the film is truly brutal, there is no feeling or love, Blade is a weapon, his purpose is to destroy vampires and his limits itself to doing that, as it should be, the villains are truly cruel, Deacon Frost is truly phenomenal, thanks to Stephen Dorff's excellent performance, the film flows very well and never gets boring and of course Wesley Sinpes is truly legendary as this dark and brutal hero.I read online that the reboot is in trouble and risks being cancelled, well I hope with all my heart that this happens because I'm sure it would be yet another horrendous, woke and idiotic film like they do today.May the trilogy remain immaculate and may nothing else be made.Blade is definitely in my top ten of the best vampire movies of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Full on action packed vampire flick. Tough, gritty and bursting onto the silver screen!","Gritty, tough and full on hard action. Great thrill. However silly the story, it fascinated me from start till finish. Seen it for a second time now and it still impresses!Yep, this is the real thing. Forget about all the sequels the first BLADE movie has got cojones.The good: it 's wild, bleak, tough, energetic, mesmirising and over the top out of control. And I like it. Yes I do.More good: excellent action photography, really good. And I NEED these technical details to be yummy, in order to really get into this silly story about vampires.Even more good: terrific actors are lifting this movie up to the stratoshpere. One of Stephen Dorff's better roles of his career. What a terrific creep. And Kris Kristofferson is the MAN, cool, calm and collected.Not any bad? The last half hour is a bit of a let down, with several cheap plot turns and fake looking CGI effects. 1 point less because of that kinda silly ending.The ""story"": Wesley Snipes has got a blade and he kills vampires with them. Lots of them. Stephen Dorff is his ultimate enemy. Who will prevail?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An entertaining action vampire movie,"This is a really fun superhero horror movie that I have watched. I like the idea of a half human and vampire fighting against vampires to take them out. It's action-packed with him going against a bunch of vampires and the different types of weapons he used throughout the movie. The actual story isn't the strongest point with an evil vampire that needs his blood to summon an ancient vampire to conquer the human race. It's rather generic motive, but it is built up pretty well with the backstory and the steps on Blade looking for him. The movie does flesh-out character with backstories of them and their motive of why they do these things. But the strongest aspect is the action scenes, which are suspenseful and entertaining, with Blade fighting against the vampires and the ways he kill each of them. And the climax itself is suspenseful and intense. Also, the movie has a couple of comedic moments that are either funny or not. I found the characters to be pretty developed and memorable throughout. The special effects range from looking good to outdated. I like the couple of makeup effects you see in parts of the movie and look pretty detailed when you see it. The movie contains a couple of graphic deaths in it with either the vampire exploding with the injected with a serum or burning in the sunlight. But the CGI looks outdated on the time it was made on the vampires' death scenes.Blade is a fun and entertaining vampire action movie that I enjoyed watching and is highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wesley Snipes' action star moment,"Wesley Snipes was a rising action star in the 90s but he seemed a little bit like a second-tier guy compared to Stallone and others he worked with. I think Blade was his shining moment where he got the spotlight to be the lead star. Another highlight actor is the charismatic Kris Kristofersson as Blade's ""Q"" type weapons supply sidekick.I saw this film in the late 90s and my memory was that it was pretty good. Now I watched it again after a long time. It was good but not quite as good as I remembered...but it has enough entertaining value to not be boring.Pros: Snipes is a very cool Blade. This is casting done right. He looks great in his leather coat and he also does some great looking fighting moves. I don't know if that's any particular real martial arts style but the only thing I'm considered is that it looks good. I mean...it looks even more cool than masters like Bruce Lee...Minor cons: The plot is ok but it's a bit cliche and not as great as I wished for. Special effects...not aged very well but the good thing is that the movie relies more on physical actors than shiny effects so this is not a big deal. Music: some techno/industrial that tries to make the movie feel very ""hip"" for the 90s' kids but feels a bit dated now. But it's only occasional so, once again, I can live with it.Overall: a little bit better than average Marvel movies. See, Blade doesn't feel like a comic book superhero movie in the first place. Even though it is based on a comic book character, the movie's style is more like ""90s' action film"". It might not be a super classic but I recommend to watch it once if you like action films.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's not the greatest action flick ever, but it keeps moving and there is some nice character development.  The relationship between Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristopherson is rich and provides a good dramatic background.The art direction is excellent.  There are deep colors and attractive settings.

Brilliant!,"I watched this film a couple of nights ago forgetting how awesome it really is. I remember when I was younger I never really understood what I was watching and honestly? this was probably like the 5th time watching it since those days. Firstly this film sticks to good and simple Vampire lore, not giving the vampires too many advantages over the humans and not giving them so many weaknesses that they become laughable. The Character Blade is a total Badass! he honestly could not have been portrayed by anyone else than Wesley Snipes! this guy is an awesome Blade the best adaptation I have seen to this date, werther it's from the comics, the old Spiderman cartoons whatever Id probably say this is Wesley Snipes best role since Demolition Man, I find the narrative to go in a steady but creative pace, The character of Whistler is really awesome, he's that old kind of been through it all here and back again knows his sh*t sort of old dude who you just shouldn't f*ck with, I couldn't have asked for a better supportive actor than Kris Kristofferson.The main protagonist couldn't have been anymore evil than he was, Deacan Frost! like wow! I wish this guy had more screen time, he was so bad! his own kind didn't even like him (Stephen Dorff's best role I have ever seen!)this film has good sometimes witty dialogue with that slight subtle humor to it, great martial arts action scenes throughout leaving you wanting more, definitely a very simple but effective Vampire film! and I would recommend this to anyone who likes good action and Vampire films.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome!!!!,"Blade is a great movie. This film has so much energy that even I'm ready to go hunting vampires. For a film geek like myself, this film has it all. Wesley Snipes can finally have an action franchise and Stephen Norrington will be working in Hollywood for awhile. The screenplay is great, the cinematography is great, and the editing is awesome. The special effects are in a world of their own. This is one of th most thought out comic book based films you will ever see and it has a great cast. It's good to see Kris Kristofferson and Udo Kier. The only weak point in the whole film is the performance of Stephen Dorff. Dorff's character, Deacon Frost, seems rather weak for Blade. Can't wait for a sequel!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"OBlade: Embracing Flaws, Celebrating Action","Wesley Snipes, while not often celebrated as a versatile actor, proves his mettle in the role of Blade within the 1998 film. His portrayal is charismatic and powerful, bringing a captivating edge to the character. Snipes' ability to embody the essence of a vampire hunter contributes significantly to the film's success.The plot, however, does have its share of holes, introducing moments that may leave viewers with questions. Yet, the film manages to redeem itself by emphasizing its strengths as an action-packed experience. The narrative may not be flawless, but it serves as a suitable backdrop for the intense and stylishly choreographed fight sequences that define the movie.Despite the limitations of CGI technology during the 90s, the film deserves a pass in this aspect. Viewers can appreciate the filmmakers' efforts within the context of the era, acknowledging the constraints they faced. The CGI's shortcomings don't detract significantly from the overall enjoyment of the film, particularly when considering the other cinematic elements that contribute to its enduring appeal.Blade stands out as a classic in the superhero genre due to its distinctive atmosphere and memorable characters. The edgy tone, coupled with Snipes' commanding performance, elevates the movie beyond its plot imperfections. It successfully carved a niche for itself within the cinematic landscape, leaving an indelible mark on the action movie genre. For fans, the film remains a thrilling journey into the supernatural world of vampires, where flaws become part of the charm, making Blade an enduring and influential piece of 90s cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great Character - Patchy Movie,"Blade is a quality comic book adaptation with some real visceral action and possibly the best opening sequence to any movie of this kind. I wont spoil it to much for those who haven't seen it but Blade wiping out vampires in the opening club scene is absolutely awesome. Even with the 100's of millions of dollars thrown at the likes of Spiderman, X-Men etc the effects in Blade for the most part still hold up today.Of course the problem with a great opening sequence is can you build on that and top it come the end of the movie and unfortunately this is what holds Blade back from being a great movie. Wesley Snipes was made for the part of Blade both physically with his fight stunt work and in his brooding performance and thats what makes this film. Anyone else in the role is unthinkable. The problem comes when Blade isn't kicking a** the movie really slows down, also none of the action sequences really match that first adrenaline rush. The plot is mostly irrelevant there's something going on about a blood god but really who cares it's all about Blade looking cool and kicking vampire a**.A quality movie for action and comic book fans that just falls short of being great 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great story but incredibly dull,"Back when I was a kid, this series was fantastic. Well, I guess I liked Blade II more? I don't really remember that much. I'm revisiting the series now, in my 30s.This first instalment, well for the time it was incredibly cool and I can see it's influence on something like The Matrix. It's a great story, but it is inadequately told. I would have loved some myth-making, some character building from the bad guys. Every character is very one-dimensional and I feel like the cool fights and mood took precedence over some more time at the writing table.That said, I liked it better than the last time I saw it in 2017, but I feel like it is severely lacking. Stephen Dorf seems to be having a lot of fun in this role though.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Makes hunting vampires look like fun...,"I never did read the Marvel comic books that this 1998 movie ""Blade"" is based upon, so I have no idea of how true the movie is to the source material. However, even without having read it, it should be noted that ""Blade"" from writer David S. Goyer and director Stephen Norrington is still a very enjoyable movie.The storyline in ""Blade"", as written by David S. Goyer, is fast-paced and entertaining. It is a storyline that immediately picks up the audience and brings you on a wild ride. The narrative is good, and the story is spiced up with a lot of nicely choreographed action and martial arts.The character gallery in ""Blade"" is every bit as good as the storyline. There are lots of interesting characters with different agendas, different motives and drives. And the characters are given enough contents to actually make them feel nicely fleshed out on the screen.Something that makes ""Blade"" work nicely, aside from the action, is the cast ensemble. They definitely put together a great cast ensemble for the movie. Wesley Snipes is carrying the movie quite well, with his brooding and semi-silent half-vampire character. Aside from Wesley Snipes, the movie also have great talents such as Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, Donal Logue and Udo Kier on the cast list.Visually then ""Blade"" is quite good. The world in which the story takes place feels alive and realistic, and the visual presentation of the world and the characters adds a lot of flavor to the movie. The special effects and CGI are good, and that really counts for something in a movie such as this.""Blade"" is a movie that you definitely should take the time to sit down and watch.My rating of ""Blade"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's not full of CGI which is a plus for me.The acting is solid and brutal and reminds me of a different time for actors.Blade is an adult vampire adaptation of a comic book as it should be -so they don't hold back on language and gore.

Decent Action Movie,"The best part about this movie is its action and editing - director Stephen Norrington really knew what he was doing. While the story is a lame excuse for some strong and violent action, the movie definitely has its moments. Wesley Snipes was perfect for the part (Like Stallone in ""Judge Dredd"") and the cast of characters is satisfying enough. I also liked the way modern music was used as soundtrack (instead of some classical sort of music) - it really contributed to the mood of the movie. You're bound to like this movie (like me) if you're looking for a good action flick on the vampire genre (with some interesting details) but if you prefer the ""serious"" kind (like Bram Stoker's Dracula) you're bound to be disappointed - think of this movie as a ""Spawn"" with a vampire storyline.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Movie That Broke New Ground - A Classic,"If you like your science-fiction action packed, or your action movie to have a brain, then this Blade is for you.The first is still the best in franchise.Between Snipes' potent machismo and Norrington's stylistic eye, Blade pulsates with pounding vitality.An intensely thrilling comic- book story.Lots of pumping blood and superhuman feats power this Wesley Snipes- as- half- vampire flick above the norm.A hugely entertaining supporting cast. This film was a very welcome surprise.Glittering and gruesome, slickly assembled and strangely serious for the genre.Blade has style and substance. The setting of ""Blade"" is ingeniously evoked, at once wildly unreal and entirely believable.The heroin chic, nihilist couture and Sybaritic abandon of New York night life are all marshaled to create a portrait of a lumpen class of hip parasites who are constantly on the prowl for their next sanguinary fix.With his pasty, punkish look and slouchy sexuality, Dorff is a vampire for the millennium -- Bram Stoker by way of Robert Mapplethorpe.With the help of Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) -- who makes Blade's massive, silver-stake- throwing guns and hollow-point bullets filled with garlic -- and a pretty hematologist (N'Bushe Wright), Blade seeks out Frost for the ultimate battle.Norrington, whose background is in makeup special effects, preserves comic-book reality with sped-up action, camera zooms and flash edits.Wesley Snipes has found a role worthy of his suave physical powers, and Stephen Dorff, so good in ""Backbeat"" and ""I Shot Andy Warhol,"" once again brings superb focus and conviction to his role.

Blade was a game changer,"Bryan Singer's 'X-Men' (2000) is often credited with closing the door on the campy comic book movie era epitomized by Joel Schumacher's 'Batman and Robin' (1997), but it was really Stephen Norrington's 'Blade' that set the tone for the more serious approach that was to come. It also helped to introduce the kind of stylized action that would almost become cliché after the release of 'The Matrix' a few years later.Though there is a decidedly 90s zeitgeist to it all, 'Blade' is a stylish, well-made take on the whole vampire mythos that holds up surprisingly well sixteen years later.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
derivative climax?  improbable ending?,"I just saw ""Blade,"" and while a good film for its action content it seemed to me that the ending took a little from ""The Dark Crystal"" (but in a melodramatic and backwards effect)--hardly creative.Also, I found it incredulous that Blade would be able to ""mix it up"" with La Magra (The Blood God, who was possessing Deacon Frost)... Hello?!  La Magra is/was a *god* and Blade is just a half-breed ""daywalker.""  Shouldn't La Magra have just wiped the floor with this guy?  Even for a movie based on a comic book, that's a bit much.I gave this a 5 out of 10.  Pretty average fare, and plenty of gore.

Weirdly as entertaining as Wesley in drag.,"Wesley being tough is easier to watch than him in drag as in To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar. But it still doesn't make it enjoyable!OTT in every department, but especially Wes' acting! The unnecessary posing, glancing and weapon shots pale in comparison to the floor shots in the midst of a fight scene- atrocious!The story doesn't add any punches, either: just a day walker hunting his maker. The reveals are dropped like hot potatoes and not much ceremony around the details. And the ending seems like a train wreck. All the new info is released at once, and the finale passes by while ends are tied up, sometimes ridiculously.Without revealing too much of the story, an ancient evil is released, momentarily, a mother presumed dead by bite shows up, and the guy Blade's been hunting so long is behind the whole shenanigans!

Over the top shootouts sequences mixed with well choreographed fighting scenes.,"""Blade"" is a good 90s Marvel movie pre-MCU. It really managed to pump me up during fighting scenes, as they used old school drum and bass and techno as background music. A peculiar choice that perfectly works with the action shown on screen. The film is violent and gruesome, there are a lot of explicit scenes showing off guts and blood. Even if the CGI aged quite badly, I have to say that they did their best with the tools and the budget available at the time. There are some special effects that are quite impressive for 1998. I wish that Disney would not be so scared to push the boundaries and maybe reboot ""Blade"" or even create a brand new movie about a very dark character from the comics.The plot is predictable, but this is compensated by well choreographed action scenes and a dark, grimey photography that set perfectly the mood. There are some cheesy comedic moments here and there, to lose a bit of the tension, and they are well fitted, nothing feels forced or over the top. Side characters are essential for the main story and they really contribute to accomplish the final goal of Blade. I cared about them and I was always rooting for this small team. The acting from Wes Snipes is good enough, but nothing that left me impressed. Whisper was in my opinion too forced and stereotypical, while the weakest member of the group was N'Bushe Wright as Karen, who felt really flat in her performance. Stephen Dorff is just not credible as Frost, the main villain. I did not feel menaced or scared by him. He was pretty weak in his acting. The cast is not the best and for sure some actors should have been replaced completely.If you are a Marvel fan, it is good to go back to the past, discovering some small gems like ""Blade"", before this company would build its immense narrative universe. This is a simple and standalone film. It gives a small hint for a possible sequel, but the ending would have worked even without a second film. If you are looking for a fun, mindless night, ""Blade"" might do the trick.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

An Alright Horror themed Superhero movie,"Blade is one of those earlier movies that released before the creation of the MCU in 2008. For the time period it was created, it has good visual effects (definitely better than the Fantastic Four that released 7 years later).Blade does encapsulates horror while maintaining a well developed story. It doesn't just have Blade going on a killing spree. That or a villain going on a killing spree and Blade has to stop them with him being a superhero. There's some sense of a story being developed at the same time of killing. I feel like this would be a good superhero movie to watch during the Halloween season with being horror and having vampires.One thing I would change is to show more of Blade's childhood to show what's it like growing up being half vampire. This is supposed to be the first movie and what I expect from the first movie in a superhero trilogy is how they become a superhero and how they adjust. Besides that I don't have much complaints.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Marvel movie that set the ball rolling,"Back in the nineties, DC (comic book) movies seemed to rule the big screen (i.e. Batman and Superman being the main two) whereas Marvel (comic book) movies seemed to be destined to fill up TV stations with men in skin-tight lycra running around throwing weak punches here and there.Then came Blade. Blade is not your typical superhero and this isn't your typical superhero movie. He's half human and half vampire and he spends his time ridding the world of the undead. And he does this in more of a brutal way that your average superhero.Since Blade, Marvel seemed to realise how to make a superhero movie and since then, it's overtaken the DC universe. Maybe it's because Blade is such a broad movie - it's action, horror and superhero movie all rolled into one. Of course it's definitely not a comedy. There are few moments of light relief as it's pretty serious through and through.If you like 'classic vampire movies' (i.e. before Twilight) then you should give this a try. It's quite an epic from start to finish. It spawned two sequels, the first of which was actually almost as good as the first (some say better), whereas the second one left audiences split.However, the original is definitely a stand out movie. Anyone who likes horror, action, martial arts or superhero movies should love it.Now all we need is a 'Blade vs Twilight' movie. I for one would pay good money to see him rid the world of creatures with big, sculpted hair who twinkle while they pout at teenage schoolgirls.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Before the hard-R superhero movie ""Deadpool"" there was ""Blade""","At this point, I'm painfully bored with superhero films (I'm a huge Joss Whedon fan and I can't even bring myself to watch his Avengers films), but if more film adaptations took a tone like ""Blade"" I'd probably start showing interest and showing up to the theater again. Almost 20 years before audiences flipped out over the hard-R superhero movie ""Deadpool,"" the lesser Marvel Universe superhero Blade smashed onto the scene with with this ultra bloody tale of modern day vampire hunting. Wesley Snipes plays Blade, a half human/half vampire who can walk in sunlight and uses that to his advantage as he hunts his vampire quarry. In this vampire universe, vampires have an underground secret society, who use their wealth and power to hide their existence and keep themselves well fed. That is until upstart vampire Stephen Dorff decides vampires should come out from the shadows and should claim their rightful place at the top of the food chain. It's a cool story set up, but what makes this film great is Snipes as Blade, the ultra slick direction by Stephen Norrington, and the unapologetic gore that made this movie standout at the time (though it still manages to stand out to this day among superhero films). Sure, ""Deadpool"" and ""Kick-Ass"" were super violent, but they were done with a a fair amount of humor. ""Blade"" is a humorless and completely serious of film, mixing action and horror. In many ways, it's more of a hybrid of ""The Matrix"" and ""The Hunger"" and is less similar to any other superhero film of the past 20 years. ""The Crow"" is probably is probably the most similar of comic book movie to this one, although I don't know if I'd really consider ""The Crow"" a superhero movie either. Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" may be the only other superhero movie since Blade to take what I'd consider a serious tone that wasn't afraid to embrace downbeat themes and not worry about being a wide audience crowdpleaser. I think Ang Lee intended his film to be a crowdpleaser, but it ended up not, although I think ""Hulk"" is highly underrated and I would argue is the best of the recent big budget Marvel films (even if they rebooted the series and do not consider Lee's film part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe). But back to this film in particular, Wesley Snipes commands the screen as Blade, in what' is likely his most memorable onscreen role. His stoic low-voiced man-of-few-words demeanor does border on parody and will admittedly come off as silly if you're not into the spirit of the film, but it worked for me. Also, Snipes, a trained martial artist, has some of the best fight sequences of his career. In terms of story, writer David S. Goyer took the unique approach of not making the movie about Blade's origin story and instead the audience finds themselves thrust into the middle of a long simmering war waged by Blade agains the hidden vampire world. The audience's is introduced to Blade and his secret war by way of N'Bushe Wright, an innocent human who finds herself suddenly caught up in fight when she's attacked by a vampire. Director Norrington, as well as director of photography Theo Van De Sande, get a lot of credit for the film's slick look, with tightly edited action sequences and a cold austere vampire world bathed in cool blues and blacks (until it explodes in blood red). The film also greatly benefits from its' supporting cast, which includes not just Dorff, but also Kris Kristofferson as Blade's human helper, making all his weapons and gear, Donal Logue as Dorff's primary henchmen, Udo Kier as an establishment vampire opposed to Dorff, and even Traci Lords shows up as a vamp. There's also a fine atmospheric score by the always great Mark Isham. Also worth noting are some excellent practical special effects, particularly a memorable sequence with a Jabba the Hutt-like vampire is tortured by Blade's ultraviolet flashlight. However, there are some significant downsides to this film. The main one is that the film's best scene, the vampire rave blood bath, is the first scene of the movie and nothing that follows lives up to it. It really is a dynamite scene, with New Order music blasting, sexy vampires cavorting, and blood spraying down from the ceiling where the vamps have rigged blood to rain down from the ceiling fire sprinklers. That is until Blade shows up and mows them down in his trench coat with guns, stakes, high kicks, and samurai sword. Also to the film's detriment are that the characters are all rather underdeveloped. Sure they all have a backstories, but they are more archetypes than relatable or empathetic characters. The story also meanders a bit and loses momentum at times. There's also a rather lackluster and disappointing climax that didn't seem consistent with the rest of the film's slick modern setting. Writer Goyer has a pretty hit or miss track record and his best films included either co-writing credits by others or were made by strong directors like Christopher Nolan, Alex Proyas, or Guillermo del Toro, the director of the far superior Blade sequel. Left to his own devices, I'm not sure Goyer is that good of a write outside of developing solid story set-ups. Another complaint is that while the films did feature some excellent practical special effects, the CGI is consistently awful throughout the film. The CGI blood looks like Magic Marker, the vampire disintegrations from stakings and whatnot look like a bad TV show superimposed images, and when the vampires swell and explode the CGI just looks completely off. The CGI was distracting and takes you out of the film. Still, despite these fairly major deficits, ""Blade"" manages to be a memorable horror/action film hybrid that is well worth watching flaws in all, although Guillermo del Toro's terrific sequel should have been the first film to launch this franchise and is the high point of the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The usual action film,"Blade introduces few new ideas as far as an action film goes. This film produces a lot of blood and violence, the usual predictable ending and a very thin plot. Some have compared this film to Spawn which is much worse and could even make this film look good.Wesley Snipes plays this role with little emotion, a cold killer with the advantages of being half-vampire, half-human and none of the disadvantages that go with either. I never really cared for Blade or his mentour and couldn't really get behind any of the vampires either. Without anyone to endorse, this film is nothing more than a 120 minute special-effects-filled trailer.I must note that a sequel is being made to tie up the loose ends left by this film. However, after watching this film, I can't see why anyone would even care about a sequal. Even fans of the comic book must be disappointed by this effort.I would recommend this film as a rental for an evening when there is really nothing to do. Don't make a point of renting this film if you are looking for a story, because there simply isn't one here.5/10 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
7,"I rewatched the movie of my childhood, but I don't really like the first part of Blade, despite the great visuals of the late 90s, the well-written plot, and their motives, everything looks almost great, but not very interesting. I liked the main character, he didn't talk too much, but sometimes he was slow and stupid, and the main villain somehow didn't impress me, and the secondary plan too. The action is great and creative, the vampires look beautiful and stylish, the humor is present, even the intrigue is there. Well, that's all I wanted to say about this movie, my rating is 7/10, almost unchanged.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Positive within the context of the genre,"No-one offers a new slant on the vampire genre these days, so you expect either a fast pace or elements of noire (ref. Kathryn Bigelow's ""Near Dark"").  Blade isn't perfect and is a bit inconsistent but has that zip to it that is necessary to overcome the expected script and originality flaws. One gripe: was it really necessary to the flow of the story for the woman Blade saves at the beginning of the film to be a haematologist? Corny or what?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good 100% action movie: no plot,"I've really liked Blade. I think the atmosphere of the movie is very well chosen, as well as the techno music background. If you like action movies and want to have some fun for two hours watch Blade.Plus, vampire stories aren't that common; at least not in the latest big hollywood productions.However, I must say the plot isn't very original: good guys shoot bad guys. But the special effects fill this gap.Conclusion: Blade is great, as long as you don't only watch this type of film and keep a few Woody Allen's not far from your VCR/DVD player.",,Anonymous,Horror
It's refreshing to see the superhero genre outside the sterility of modern kid friendly vacuum,"As I wrote in the title, MCU and DCEU are walking a very thin line and doing work with very sterile scenarios in order to reach large audiences, target young adult and child audiences, and at the same time not to antagonize their parents.Although we see good works emerging in this narrow field, the era of superhero movies has become quite suffocating lately. That's why it was so enjoyable to watch a dark fantasy-themed one free of 21st century social concerns.Dark fantasy is a genre that does not have many examples and is becoming increasingly rare nowadays. I wish there were more movies of this type. When combined with the stylistic and artistic achievements of those who made this type of film, a film with great viewing pleasure emerged. Personally, I am not a fan of the grotesque scenes typical of 90s movies, so these scenes, which were included here and there, did not interest me much.Another thing I would criticize is that there are too many luck and coincidence scenario elements that shrink the world of the movie, which is also typical of 90s movies. The fact that the problem goes hand in hand with its solution is a bit of an unpleasant cliché for modern cinema.Still, filmmakers of the age of superheroes need to take a lot of inspiration from those times and produce more comic book cinema in this style.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blade A Decent Vampire Movie,"Balde is a decent vampire movie from director Stephen Norrington who does a good job in making this but the lack of suspense, the dialogue at times, and a rushed finale are what weigh it down. The film does however offer just enough cool mart arts action, impressive special effects, and solid performances by the cast. Wesley Snipes is admirable in the title role of Blade a half-human half-vampire who becomes humanity's protector from the sinister forces that threaten their world. Snipes is believable in the role especially in the action/fight sequences. Stephen Dorff is effective as the villain Deacon Frost but he isn't given much to except for a few action sequences and his showdown with Blade at the end is sort of a let down. Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, and Donal Logue are good as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Udo Kier and Traci Lords show up for brief appearances but neither of them ever get the chance to leave an impression. The action/fight sequences are well executed featuring fierce bone crushing moves but the final fight between Blade and Frost was a bit disappointing compared to the ones that came before it. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times either and the lack of suspense weighed down a bit but everything else made up for it's flaws. Despite it's problems Blade is a decent adaption of a comic book with enough impressive martial arts action, cool special effects, and solid performances by most of the cast who make it worth watching if only the film had been a little better I would've enjoyed it more than I did.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still a great movie,Blade is my favorite Vampire Action franchise. Wesley Snipes as one of the coolest action characters the world has ever seen. The fight sequences are top notch and still very entertaining to watch. The Story is pretty linear but that's not a bad thing for movies like this one in my opinion. The special effects are a little trashy sometimes but regarding this movie as 20 years old it's still pretty good.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad,"This movie was very entertaining. In my opinion probably one of the better Marvel flicks. The movie was fun and was action packed. The only thing the movie was lacking a bit we're the graphics. The blood graphics were not very good, but the worst graphics I saw in the movies was when Blade kidnapped the doctor and then threw her to the other building. It looked so bad, and you could tell they used a dummy. Overall the movie is a fun, action packed, and entertaining movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Martial Arts, Big Guns, Vampires, and Great Techno Music... what more do you want?","I just got back from seeing Blade and I thought I'd give it a quick review. This isn't the kind of movie critics usually like, but, as they should be, most reviews so far are pretty good.Let me start of by saying that I don't usually go for the corny comic book style movie OR the usual shoot-em up action flick. I do however appreciate well-choriographed martial arts action and a good horror flick. Blade manages to combine martial arts action with John Woo-style gunplay, a good horror-vampire plot, funny-but-not-too-funny dark humor, and an ausome techno soundtrack. A little something for everyone. It actually works in every catagory and turns out to be one he** of a fun movie.The directing has that cool music video feal too it and it works perfectly for this type of movie. Wesley Snipes does a good job as Blade and, although sometimes he seems a little too bland, he generally does an excellent job. The rest of the cast does a pretty descent job too.The martial arts action scenes are some of the best ever. Wesley Snipes manages to combine great fighting with guns to create some highly entertaining action sequences.There's not much else to say about this movie. The plot is pretty good, the action scenes are GREAT, there's plenty of humor, the special effects are pretty good too, from the numerous vampire death sequences to some pretty interesting characters that I don't want to give away. This is just a plain FUN movie. One of the best of the genre.ONE LAST THING-- I thought I'd give the FIRST scene of the movie a quick review too. You see, this scene is by far the BEST scene in the movie (don 't get me wrong, the movie is pretty good- but this scene is one of the greatest of all-time).This scene is one of my favorate action scenes of ALL-TIME. The credits are still rolling and already you get the feel for the rest of the movie. A rave-type club full of vampires attempt to feast on an innocent human as SHOWERS of blood begin to POUR from the ceiling. It becomes chaotic as everyone is going crazy to the ausome techno soundtrack. Blood is everywhere, vampires are every, the camera is rapidly changing back-and -forth between slow-motion and fast-forward, they're all about to feast on this guy when BLADE bursts out to kill some Vamps. Now you have gallons of blood covering everything and everybody, you have Blade kicking people all over with both cool martial arts action and special anti-vampire guns, and of course the techno music is still playing to give the audiance that extra rush. It just can't be explained. This scene alone is worth the price of admission.Jesse (pulpjes@aol.com)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Provides exciting action,but little else","Blade is a decently entertaining action flick thanks to its stylish film making and cinematography . It has some pretty cool thrills and good action scenes. Sadly that is the films strongest point. Most of the main characters a thinly developed and are only a bit interesting. Blade himself is cool and tough and has a interesting back story but really isn't that compelling. Karen,a girl he saves who then becomes a main character is as dull as dishwater and her acting isn't very good. To be quite honest Wesley Snipes doesn't turn in a great performance either. His blade is very one note,cool tough guy. This is sometimes very entertaining but other times it doesn't serve the movie very well. Whistler however is a different story. Whistler is Blades mentor and serves as a father figure for him. He is very well played by Kris Kristofferson and injects some much needed humanity in this film. The other great characters in this movie are the villains Deacon Frost(Stephen Dorf) and his right hand man Quinn(Donald Logue) they add some menace and humor to the film. My only other complaint about this movie is the CGI. CGI was very hit or miss in the 90s and this film is no exception. What I hated the most about it was that whenever somebody was killed by silver they would dissolve into dust. I have two problems with this.ONE: I like seeing lots of bodies after a huge action scene,its just really cool.TWO: the CGI looks especially cheep during these shots and it is very distracting. But despite it's many flaws Blade is a very entertaining film thanks to its style,energy and great action scenes. And Kris Kristofferson is really cool in this movie,always a plus",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thank you lord I was born later,Finally watched the original blade. I grew up with xmen and spiderman and now the mcu. I really wanted to like this film for Wesley for marvel Fandom but man this film is not it. I can see how this worked in the 90s but the film has aged horribly from cgi to having a thin plot this was not it. Hope the new blade is levels better than this and it probably will be. If this is the good one of the franchise then man can't imagine how bad blade trinity is lol. Anyways film was disappointing.

Too violent ?,"Whilst visiting Los Angeles for my first holiday in America, I  happened to be staying around the corner from the Mann's Chinese Theatre one night whilst I was going past it I happened to notice that the premiere of BLADE was on. I was quite excited about this as I have always been interested in films and have always wanted to attend a premiere. So there I was watching all the actors and actresses arrive in their limos and go into the theatre. When the premiere was over ,I begged my parents to let me go and see BLADE. they finally gave in . The advert didn't look to violent from what I remember from it,and it didn't say much about Vampires in it. So a few days later we went to see it, it was rated R and my parents weren't sure of what it meant.I finally persuaded them, so we went to see it. In the opening scenes my mother wasn't too happy with me seeing it, she said it was too violent ! My father said nothing so we continued to watch it. Finally it got too much for my mother so she dragged me out, I was quite disappointed at that. She said it was totally unsuitable, my father agreed. He said that it should have been NC-17 as it would and is an 18 in the United Kingdom. I did enjoy the film despite the gore, and I think  Wesley Snipes choegraphed the scenes very well . I think Stephen Dorff and Wesley Snipes acted really well and were chosen well for the parts as enemies. I hope the sequels are going to be just as good. But meanwhile my ambition is too see the end of the film, maybe in a few years !Catherine Jones",,Anonymous,Horror
Good 90's action,"The 1st Blade film is the best in the series and a box office hit that would set things in motion for more comic book adaptations to come on the big screen. What we have here is an avalanche of action with a 90's techno soundtrack. The action is quite stylized, with a whole lot of it, borrowing a lot from Hong Kong action movies mainly with some early CGI f/x. The tone of this film is very dark and is grounded by an excellent performance by Wesley Snipes as the title character. He does not need to say much to convey the hatred and coldness of his character and as such is singularly focused at taking out the vampire populace for the pain and struggles he had in his life as a vampire/human hybrid. Kris Kristofferson is great as Whisler, a Van Helsing type and father figure for Blade. Steven Dorff is lousy as a villain opposite Blade, it seems he tried too hard to play a cool villain, but comes off as a annoying dufus. The support cast is pretty strong with Udo Keir(who would have been a better choice as the title villain), Donal Logue and N'Bushe Wright who appears as Blade's love interest, sort of, is really good as well as gorgeous. There is no shortage of hot chicks either,early in the film we have a cameo from Traci Lords. It has been a while since I have watched Blade and comes across a little dated, but is still a good action movie that would be influential to movies like Underworld.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
You watching as a Kid VS You watching now,"Yes, I watched this movie when I was a teenager, boom that whole effects and blood just a normal action move. Stylish as Blade is, but. When you know how a movie make and simple needs a good screenwriting, you see the lack of story. Lot of pow-pow movies got good stories, but this lack a lot.Maybe I just liked much in the past because vampires licking each other, and sexy scenes, just a dream to a teenager.Good: Stylish, crazy, Snipes fear nothing, got this you damn vampire.Cons: Vendetta, much sexiest, boring at some moments, predictable.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blade is the man!,"Blade is a great film without the always common Gothic look. Wesley Snipes (Blade) gives a great performance. Stephen Dorff also gives a memorable performance. The beginning of the movie was very provocative whereas it started off in the real world, and after the night club scene it went into a cartoon world. The only thing that bothered me was that Blade didn't use the traditional weapons of holy water and the crucifixion. I believe that Dorff will be remembered forever as Deacon Frost, because the character was and will be more flamboyant than any other character he has or will play to date. The supporting cast was also excellent. Without a doubt Blade will always be remembered over the other two sequels (Blade II & III). Not going Gothic made this film the best anti-vampire movie in history.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blade will cut you like a pine tree,"Blade is awesome!!! Blade rules!!! Blade kicks ass!!! ... and so on and so forth. Well, I have been a die-hard fan of comic character Blade and I had decided to give this movie a shot. Wesley Snipes lives up to all my expectations. His moves are so freakin' slick, I had to replay every fight scene to keep the adrenaline pumping. Secondly, I really appreciate Kris Kristofferson in the role of Whistler and by God, I wish he was part of the Marvel universe. On the other hand, I wasn't really much impressed by Stephen Dorff coz I found his performance very crummy. He isn't a so-called ""formidable enemy"" like those with honour, pride, ambition. Good one-liners, superb action & direction and great soundtrack. Give this one a shot. You wont be disappointed",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dull,"The seriousness with which this movie took itself kept me from enjoying it; I wanted to laugh, but the wall-to-wall gore n' lore didn't allow it.  The incessantly unpleasant tone makes for a terribly boring moviegoing experience, unless you're the sort that pores over Fangoria magazine.Most offensive are the movie's calculated images- every single moment, practically every shot, is designed around the premise ""what would look cool?""  This renders characters, exposition, dialogue and action completely unbelievable.  It also has the unfortunate- and perhaps intentional -effect of glorifying some truly repulsive, blood-drenched violence.  We can expect as much from a vampire movie, but there's no subtext or allusions here (other than to other movies) and director Norrington shows no understanding of implication or restraint.Not to mention, Mr. Snipes is so pompous, I would rather have seen Blade bite it.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great comic-book, kick-butt, vampire-slaying action fun!","We thoroughly enjoyed Blade (Wesley Snipes as Buffy the Vampire Slayer?). We realized from the beginning that it wasn't going to be _great art_. After all, it was based on a comic book. Visually it was a lot of fun, and the action sequences were wonderful. Of course, Wesley Snipes is wonderfully visual in the role, his sculptured physique accentuated by the hairstyle, neck tattoos, and costuming. Guys will probably appreciate N'Bushe Wright, who plays the female lead.By the way, let me put in a plug for the DVD version, for those who have a DVD player. There is wonderful commentary by Goyer (the writer), Snipes, the director, and at least one other principle. It is a lot of fun to see how the creative decisions were made.In summary, if you are in the mood for a good martial arts, kick-butt, vampire action flick, this is a fun one!",,Anonymous,Horror

Blade: A True Vampire Slayer,"Brief Overview: The movie I am reviewing is Blade which was released in 1998 and is really the first major Marvel film to hit the big screen. Blade is a human/vampire hybrid who takes it upon himself to eliminate the vampire ""species."" For the time this movie was made I believe it is a really good film, and still is a must watch for comic book fans.The Positives: The first thing I really liked about the film is the actor who plays Blade. Wesley Snipes is perfect for this role; he goes through the film showing almost no emotion which perfectly portrays the vibe given off by the character in the comic books. The rapid fire, intense action sequences is the real pinnacle for the film. It's really fun watching Blade take on 20 vampires at a time in a highly complex style of fighting. This flick will definitely keep the attention of the general audience.The Negatives: I had several issues with the 1998 Blade, but none were so severe that I would not recommend this movie. At times, the acting was a little overdone and the CGI was cheesy, but you must keep in mind when this film came out. Also, there was way too many needles in this movie; at times I was wondering, ""Is this a super-hero movie or a film about some advances in virus vaccinations?"" (No, in all seriousness, it really isn't an issue, unless you have a phobia of needles. If so, proceed with caution!) And the last problem I had is the story line. It wasn't really that bad per se, but it just wasn't a very intriguing angle.The Conclusion: If you like vampires (or hate vampires), enjoy high intensity action sequences, sword fighting, blood and gore or just a comic book movie fan, this is a must-watch movie. I highly recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Half-Human, Half-Vampire, All Hunter...","""Blade"" could have been yet another overblown blockbuster, but it differs in that its relentless nature builds excitement rather than smacking of desperate CGI-laced attempts to keep the audience interested. Wesley Snipes plays the ultra cool hero and you definitely root for him. Although it seems that sometimes he tries too hard at being a hero but most of the time he succeeds. What makes Stephen Dorff's character scary is his intelligence, which is expressed beautifully in the actor's eyes. He is probably one of the most convincing comic villains since Jack Nicholson in Batman. The acting is pretty run of the mill for the most part, with the standout acting being done by Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost, spoiled brat and complete maniac (and vampire of course) and Udo Kier (even though he isn't in the movie for more than 5 minutes total) as Dragonetti, the head of the pure blood vampires. While Frost isn't your typical buff, brawny villain, he makes up for his conscipicous scrawniness with his intelligence and ruthlesness As I first saw it, the images blew me away. The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed and shot and there's a really stylish atmosphere to it. The industrial soundtrack adds to the rhythmic editing and accelerates the fights. The special effects are somewhat weak, but this is a glossy B-Movie and that is part of the fun it provides. As I saw the brilliant ""Matrix"" one year later I realized that some shots seemed very familiar to Blade. The sardonic nature of the movie is further enhanced by the ability of the characters to poke fun at the ludicrous nature of the hyper-intense fights that propel Blade in his quest to rid the world of vampires. It's a journey that's enjoyably involving, despite the frenetic pace, and that's a rarity with any action blockbuster.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fighting Modern Vampires in the Big City,"It's a glimpse into how Hollywood works and thinks that, with all the primo Marvel super-heroes to choose from, even including 2nd-tier heroes like Luke Cage & the Panther, the first successful big budget Marvel film is based on an obscure supporting character from the little-known 'Tomb of Dracula' comic book. The key to the success was upgrading the Blade (Snipes) character to be a cool bad-ass in the big city, with neat weapons and wardrobe, not to mention super powers lacking in the original comic book version. On initial glance, the movie could be a standard action thriller from the nineties, but director Norrington imbued this with enough style and mythology to make this a cut above most of those. Rather than an old Gothic atmosphere, everything points towards the modern, the sleek. The actual 'Dracula' character isn't present; instead there's an entire secret cabal of vampires, ruling in secret - for one reason or another it seems all of the police force is employed by them. There are different 'grades' of vampire in this story - those born as vamps and those turned. The so-called pure bloods form a ruling council. They exist in an unspecified truce with human bigwigs i.e. politicians - which comes as no surprise, I suppose - all bloodsuckers would support one another, right?Also borrowed from the comic books is the villain vampire Frost (Dorff), portrayed as an elder man in the books, but here a turned arrogant punk aiming to change the status quo. The more interesting aspects of the story have to do with the internal conflict among the new age and the older generation of vampires, not the usual battles between humans and vampire monsters. Blade himself in not really human, being a kind of hybrid, having the strengths of a typical vampire and none of their weaknesses (sunlight, garlic). His fights are martial arts-influenced, with the added FX shots of his opponents disintegrating as a fatal blow is struck. Some dark amusement is provided by Donal Logue as Frost's no.2 vamp, never quite getting that killing blow from Blade, just losing a limb every other scene. Logue and Dorff, tho, never seem quite in sync in their scenes together, with Logue stressing the humor and Dorff playing it very straight. But they manage, in conjunction, to provide the necessary menace for Blade and his allies to stand against.The film veers a bit into inane territory for the climax, when Frost is planning to unleash something called 'La Magra' on the world, which I believe was meant to turn everyone into vampires. Instead of the planned 'blood god' FX, we get a souped-up version of vampirism in Frost and some extra martial arts effort from Blade to wrap things up. Snipes is stolid as the hero, letting loose a grin every now and then when the prospect of graphic violence rises up. He and fellow vampire-killer Whistler (Kristofferson) are supposedly close friends but you get the impression they're together only because they both hate vampires. It's a rather somber unemotional world they both exist in, with nothing more than resolute soldiering a guiding force. Blade would continue to soldier on in two sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wesley Snipes at His Best!,"This film is absolutely incredible! Wesley Snipes is at his best!The film is about Blade, whose mother was attacked by a vampire whilst she was still pregnant with him, which made her water break and she gave birth to Blade, but died in the process. A half vampire half human, he has all of the vampires' strengths and none of their weaknesses, bar one...the thirst to feed on blood! Having been found by Whistler, they decide to team up to take on the vampires.From the go, this movie is action packed with Blade entering a vampire nightclub to kick some ass! The film then continues to show how the vampires lived in secrecy but Deacon Frost wishes to take control of the world using 'La Magra', the blood god!The music from this movie is great, its filmed very well and the story flows completely.

Slice Blade,"'Blade' would be an extremely above-average comic-book, vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible Blade/Snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole ""Yes!"" fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 Bad, no make that horrible, CGI – even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout. Okay, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'Matrix' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior. So maybe 'The Matrix' copied 'Blade.' At any rate, it's a very movie for multiple genre-loving audiences: Comic Book geeks, action fanatics and horror/vampire lovers. So, we have Blade, half-man/half-vampire, or ""day-walker"" and his accomplish, Whisler (a la ""Batman and Alfred"") battling the undead who, apparently almost out number humans. Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blade's more of an antihero) our sword ninja/vamp rescues a newly infected (coincidentally) blood specialist/doctor. Meanwhile, trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants (you guessed it) supreme power and needs Blade somehow to obtain it. It's not the most original concept, if you read what I just wrote, but still highly enjoyable. You will want to see Blade succeed, you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms. And you will know what's coming as this is the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction movie. Still, watch this without trying to go too deep. Such as Vampire SPF-1000 ""suntan lotion""? Really? What about the scalp? Wouldn't that still burn? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Uh, okay, I am going too deep. Once again, sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of THE best!,"A half-human half-vampire out for vengeance on all vampires? Sure it may sound like it's tedious and tiresome, but all that will change once you see ""Blade""Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a vampire slayer who will stop at nothing to rid the Earth of vamps forever. With the help of his friend and mentor Whislter (Kris Kristofferson) and a beautiful female doctor (N'Bushe Wright), they try to save the world from the evil vampire overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff)This movie is well worth the see. It has action, suspense, humour, horror and even a little tender love in there as well. Snipes does very well as the stern hunter and Dorff is deliciously evil in his role. Supporting cast includes ex-Melrose girl Traci Lords, Arly Jover, Donal Logue and Udo Kier.One sequence that I thought personally was cool was when Blade, weak and un-nourished is asked by the doctor to drink a little of her blood to restore him back to health.

Bloody good!!!,"Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a half-human, half-vampire who makes it his personal mission to rid society of vampires (who live in the underworld, but move freely with 'human society'). Blade is assisted in his mission by Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who has raised Blade since he was a teenager and Karen (N'Bushe Wright) whom Blade rescued shortly after she has been attacked by a vampire. Blade learns that the vampires are plotting something that could prove catastrophic to the human race and with the help of his small team he sets about trying to stop the vampires.Blade is just one of those films that is just pure fun from start to finish; it's chocked full of impressively choreographed fight sequences, incredible special effects, quick editing (which admittedly looks a bit choppy at times). Whilst it is a fun film, the plot and tone mostly remain dark (meaning that it's a film that's fun, but in a way where it can still be taken seriously rather than being fun in a dumb way). The special effects are impressive and whilst, arguably, they may still be the star of the show director Stephen Norrington does still allow room for the story to breathe - the character of Blade is given some depth and never remains one dimensional. The story is a little bit silly and many of the antagonists are more cartoon-like than menacing but in a film that's this much fun it never really matters and the film still remains enjoyable (as long as you know what to expect from it).As well as the Matrix-style fight choreography and impressive special effects the film also benefits from a good performance from Snipes; here he's able to effortlessly switch between delivering dialogue in bad-ass serious fashion to kicking a load of ass and delivering one liners in a typical 'tongue-in-cheek' manner. The supporting cast are all fairly good, but it's only really Stephen Dorff & Kris Kristofferson who are any sort of match for Snipes.I can't deny that Blade is not likely to appeal to all audiences - it is pretty violent and gory and the Matrix-style fight sequences and OTT special effects won't meet with approval from everyone. However, I happen to like these things and coupling these things with a reasonable story (it isn't a brilliant one however) and a rather 'knowing' performance from Snipes it all equates to 2 hours of unpretentious fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great style and tone,"Blade gets off to a very bold start with one of the best openings to a comic book film I've seen. It's just a shame that the rest of the film never quite manages to carry this forward.Wesley Snipes gives a terrific and commanding lead performance and the supporting cast, while occasionally cheesy, are all solid too.The plot is a tad tired and formulaic, and is unlikely to blow you away. It is still entertaining though.The effects are a bit of a mixed bag. Some of them hold up surprisingly well, particularly where practical effects were used. However some of the CGI shots are jarringly bad, but that is forgivable given the age of this film.Where Blade really shines is in its action. As I mentioned it gets off to a wild start with a fantastic set piece, and there are plenty more scattered throughout the film.

The coolest action hero in years!,"A cool outfit, trendy sunglasses and awesome weapons. Blade has got it all.Blade is the coolest action hero in years and the movie is certainly one of the most original vampire movies. The atmosphere is dark and cool and the strange but nice cinematography by Theo van de Sande adds to that.The cast is good and the characters are pretty cool especially the main villain Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is awesome but also Wesley Snipes seems to be born to wear the dark cool Blade outfit. Unfortunately the female actresses (N'Bushe Wright and Arly Jover) aren't the world's greatest, to put it gently.The best thing about the movie are the fights. I even recognize some of the style in ""The Matrix"" and even the atmosphere is almost identical. The success of this movie also inspired to make other super hero movies (Spider-man, Daredevil, Hulk, X-Men etc.). Some were successful, others were not.The special effects are also nice and sometimes even gross. (Exploding vampires!)Just a cool nonsense movie that's very entertaining.Recommendable!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

THE original vampire action flick...,"You might think, from my IMDb reviews, that this mid 40's film-lover just doesn't ""do"" comic book action films. I don't 'do' bad ones but Blade I've always really liked.Apart from the odd, obvious computer graphic, this near 15 year old film still looks fresh, with witty exuberance and big, impressive sci-fi sets. The range of characters is suitably colourful and impressive, with a great turn from a gruff and scruffy Kris Kristofferson, as The Whistler (who's a vampire hunter) and sexy, sultry black girl Dr Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright).However, it's Wesley Snipes, always looking lean, mean and imposing and great in his black leathers that transports the film from a hum-drum half-hearted affair to knock-out action movie. He's mean with his fists, shoots 'em up like a mean mother and snarls impressively quite a lot. Stephen Dorff, as the evil rival who's intent on entrapping clubbers at his nightspot and using them for him and his pals to feast on.As a vampire story, it's an interesting and entertaining twist on the familiar theme. Yes, the film does rely a huge amount on CGI, but for once the SFX add to rather than swamp and they still look really good.Above all, Blade is brisk, smart, flashy and violent but with enough of the other bits to stick it all together, really rather nicely. Superb.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ordinary action blockbuster instead of a horror movie,"I really have a lot of difficulties to appreciate modern movies about vampires as the ""Underworld"" saga, the ""Nochnoy dozor: Night watch"" and its sequels or the Blade saga. I'm a fan of old and sometimes even modern horror movies (""30 days of night"" is a nice modern film about vampires for example) and I leak to read horror literature too, but this movie is not convincing me at all.Wesley Sinpes plays a cool and tough guy and is doing a quite well job even though he is maybe a little bit too ""gangsta"" for such a movie, there are also some nice fighting and gore scenes, but this film has an important lack of horror elements, of an interesting and suspenseful story and a horrifying atmosphere.The movie is much more an action movie with some surprising lengths in the middle of the movie (while movies as ""Dead snow"" or parts of the ""Underworld"" saga still have much more adrenaline) rather than a horror movie. I would compare this movie to the first ""Matrix"" movie, this one being also a wanna-be cool action movie with a pseudo science-fiction background instead of a horror background like in this one.I give the four points for the acceptable first thirty minutes, the action effects, the style of the actors and the special acting of Wesley Snipes. I haven't seen the sequels but this one didn't give me the state of euphoria to head for the other ones at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Blade Franchise: The first film!,"Blade (1998) was the first film of the Blade franchise. Loosley based upon a character that appeared in Tomb of Dracula. Blade (Wesley Snipes) is the son of a vampire. Half human and half vampire, he's what you would call a day walker. But he needs to feed on blood in order to survive. The movie follows Blade as he prepares to wage war on the vampires. Within the vampire organized society, there's a struggle for power. Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) wants to become the new leader. Dragonetti (Udo Kier) doesn't want to relinquish his title so easily. Will Blade destroy the living dead blood suckers? How does Deacon convince Dragonetti to give up his title? Do they change a lot of Blade's original character? To find out you have to watch BLADE!!An interesting loosely based on the Marvel Comic Book character.

One of the better comic adaptations,"Blade is violent, unpleasant, cliched and even a bit corny. But it is still a fairly entertaining movie and a classy action/horror film. Yes the script is flimsy and the storyline a tad unlikely but that doesn't stop this film from being interesting. I felt that it started out quite strongly, not being familiar with the comic I was intrigued at the possibilities, but faded badly at the end. Anyways, don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. But if you're prone to queasiness and don't like the latent sexuality behind all that biting, sucking and blood, give Blade a miss.

Fav,"Blade has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. (Side Note: L.L. Cool J. was approached for the role of Blade....eww} Blade came along at a time when I was discovering Wesley Snipes as a martial artists. Demolition Man, another all time favorite was the first time I saw Snipes display his martial arts skill & from then I was hooked on Snipes as a martial artists & not so much as an actor. There are actors that embody certain characters. To me Michael Keaton will always be Batman on screen but Kevin Conroy will always be his voice. Snipes & Blade are one in the same to me. However, I'm not against a reboot. If Snipes reprises the role that would be great but if they refresh the franchise I already have a nomination for the role of Blade. Martial artists & actor Marrese Crump (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2800599/?ref_=nv_sr_1) The first time I saw him in action I felt the same way I felt when I discovered Snipes for the first time. His style & the way he performed stuck out to me & fits perfect with the Blade character. STICKY FINGERS SUCKS, as Blade.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a nice little action film that wooed the world,"The film Blade took the world by storm when it first came out and people loved it. Despite its sub par critics reviews the movie still managed to make 70 million domestically and 131 million worldwide. It became a film that was beloved for its action set pieces and the interesting character of Blade, but when I watched the film today while I can see a lot of great action here this film lacks on giving a compelling and interesting enough story and it also ails in making the characters really that interesting either. While Blade is great to see on screen being portrayed by Wesley Snipes all the other characters along with the main villain do nothing for this story to make it interesting.N' Brush Wright's character could have been really something interesting, but she is not and instead feels very pale compared to Wesley and she and Blade have no chemistry together on screen.Stephen Dorff is a character that could have been great but is instead merely just a sideline Marvel villain before there was a MCU. Which is quite sad to say cause I saw some potential at the beginning of the fill for this character, but sadly he is nothing of notable interest.Overall Blade does have good fight scenes and is defiantly different from most vampire films. It has great action and great cinematography, but it fails in characters and story that are interesting enough to make the action understandable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody Cool,"I really liked this movie. It was made at the same time as the Matrix so it has a kind of similar style. There is kung fu, guns, trench coats, and techno music. Some might say that stuff is cheesy but in a good action movie I think it's cool. It is a bit scary and there is lots of blood. So if you don't like that sort of stuff you might want to skip this movie. It is about a guy who is half vampire and half human and he runs around with guns and swords hunting down vampires. It is a really great idea for a story. There is nothing more badass than hunting vampires. Wesley Snipes is great as Blade. He doesn't really talk much or have much emotional range but that works for a tough guy character. He nails all of the action sequences doing cool spin kicks etc. Stephen Dorff does a great job as the villain. He is a jerk but in an entertaining way. The whole idea of an evil group secretly running the world who view humans as cattle is another thing that I think is a good political point.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still efficient and entertaining 27 years later!,"I saw this movie a couple of times when it came out and I remember really liking it. It was definitely peak 90s for this type of sci-fi action, only topped a year later with The Matrix. I was afraid it would have aged badly but after the Deadpool & Wolverine cameo I had an urge to give it another go. And I was pleasantly surprised how well it stands the test of time and how thoroughly entertained I was from beginning to end. The questionable CGI and campy dialogue only add charm to it in my opinion! And I still think it has one of the best opening sequences for that type of movie.

"'Blade' is perhaps not great art, but certainly great fun...","Wesley Snipes stars as Blade, an immortal 'day-walker' who considers it his mission to hunt vampires. Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire during her pregnancy, which passed a variety of powers on to her son. Blade benefited from the best attributes of both vampires and humans, and grew up to be a vampire hunter in order to avenge the death of his mother, and to find the means of becoming ""human"" once more. Snipes does his best ""Terminator"" impression by hiding almost all of Blade's emotions beneath a macho facade. This approach works on a certain level  it makes Blade a more dangerous and ambiguous figure, but it also prevents the audience from connecting with him. But, before he can dream of becoming completely human, he must deal with the new leader of the vampire nation, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), whose stated goal is nothing less than the complete domination of the world. Despite being over-the-top, Stephen Dorff fails to imbue Frost with the ferocity necessary to make him a memorable villain. Blade is aided by Adam Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who provides him with a range of high-tech solutions. The grizzled sidekick lays down a nice character role performance for the future installments.N'bushe Wright is simply boring. The supporting cast includes the internationally known Udo Kier as the vampire whose position Frost inherits, and ex-porn star Traci Lords as Frost's long-toothed mistress.A fine combination of action, science fiction and horror, 'Blade' is one of the best comic book adaptations to date. The performances in Blade are serviceable. While hardly deep or cerebral, they manage to capture much of the spirit of the original comic book and succeed in not turning it into a children's cartoon. The film provides plenty of action and effects, fights and blood. The violence is successfully broken up with a variety of one-liners and humor.The atmosphere is so well-developed that it's easy to forget how derivative and monotonous the plot is, and to get lost in the darkness of Blade's paranoid, vampire-filled world. Blade is fueled by a kinetic energy, and there are scenes, such as the opening dance club sequence, the ""Blood Bath"", that functions as exotic, erotic assaults on the senses. Ultimately, that all turns out to be a rich icing on a half-baked cake. Blade has the capacity to dazzle, but it also will leave many viewers dissatisfied. Stylish and entertaining, 'Blade' is perhaps not great art, but certainly great fun.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Daywalker.,"Half human and half vampire, Blade's function in life is to rid the world of vampires, he is driven forward by the notion that his mother was killed by his half brethren.This is no ordinary vampire film, this is nothing to do with bearing crosses and creatures making music of the night, this is armoured weaponry, dazzling swordplay and a protagonist that is as cool as anything that has leaped off of the comic book page. Wesley Snipes (perfect piece of casting) is Blade, a much troubled superhero (aren't they all?), he has to take a formula suppressant to keep away his inner vampire cravings. Aided by trusty pal, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), they wage war against all blood suckers and here they must stop the sinister Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) from executing his monstrous plan.There are no cranial pondering's here in this piece, this is a joyously high velocity action horror movie, containing great choreography and retaining its comic book heart. Blade is pure popcorn fodder for the MTV generation, in fact director Stephen Norrington utilises his music video background to great effect as the combat scenes are scored with delightful sledgehammer precision. Blood brains and gore flow freely as the film hurtles towards the head splitting conclusion, loud, dark and tinged with brooding menace, Blade is hugely recommended for a ripper of a night in. 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ended up being pretty fun to watch unfold,"'Blade' is not entirely what I expected. I had no clue this was about vampires, like at all. I evidently knew little about these films, I was anticipating a relatively standard yet stylish superhero flick - based upon the lead character's look, which is the only thing I knew of.That's not a criticism, as the vampire stuff ended up being pretty fun to watch unfold. I will say that Wesley Snipes is the reason for that fact though, as Stephen Dorff and his band of one-dimensional renegades are only just narrowly watchable. Snipes as the titular character is excellent though, while Kris Kristofferson and N'Bushe Wright are good too.The special effects haven't aged the best, though some parts are still decent and, to be honest, even the less than good pieces still work. For example the effect used when the vampires are killed looks fine, though the end with Frost's blood does look a bit dorky now - but again, works.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Over Rated,"I love Vampire Movies, Underworld Is one of my favorite Movies, but I find this show is very lacking. It's mostly about Wesley killing/beating up vampires the entire time. The plot of the show isn't very good; extremely lacking, the lines are terrible, and the CGI is really bad. The filming is okay, but the gore is way over done making the show distasteful. It would have been nice if Blade himself would have had more of a character. He literally is just a ""Tough Guy"" who broods all the time. I do enjoy the action in the movie and the different views of how a vampire can be hurt or their abilities they wield. Since every show has a different opinion on the vampire, it's always entertaining to see the differences.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Underrated,"Im having a hard time understanding how so many people choose to over-analyse instead of taking this film for what it is; Entertainment. It never tries to be anything but entertainment, and it deserves to be criticised as such, not as some new attempt at Schindlers list.Yes, Wesley Snipes is a p***-poor actor. Yes there are s**tloads of plotholes and incoherency with the science/supernatural stuff. Yes he looks dead silly in that armor getup.So what? What you're missing out on is a wicked soundtrack, very well executed camerawork, fight scenes echoing hong kong cinema nicely, some astonishing set pieces and the best kid-pitch ever seen on film!I love films by directors such as Akira Kurosawa, David Lynch, Steven Spielberg (of course) and Stanley Kubrick, but i dont see why my love for so-called ""intelligent"" cinema should shadow out the school of filmmaking known as entertainment :PSit down with friends, 5 gallons of coke and enough candy to blow your teeth to shreds in a matter of minutes, pop this one on and just be mindlessly indulgent.

No blood on that blade...,"Blade has one of the most cool openings of any super hero movies. It is with pain that I watched the rest of the movie, seeing how all of that could be so much better than it is. My biggest issue with this movie actually has nothing to do with story or acting. No... It's about blood. When Blade enters that club at the beginning of the movie, you expect to see a monstrous bloodshed. I mean, it's not like it's problem to show blood, they already drenched the whole club in blood. But no, when Blade kills vampires, they just disintegrate. Why?! It feels so out of place and wrong, it literally pains me to see action scene potential not being used to it's fullest. So, what you have left is vampire killing machine who kills vampires, but that killing doesn't look as nearly as spectacular and fun as it could look. And when you add to it the odd pacing of the movie and the way characters are developed, it doesn't really make us care all that much and in the end, you are left with really mediocre movie that could have been so much better if it's makers knew what they wanted to do. 6/10, try to watch it for fun...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

GREAT ACTION OK PERFORMANCE,"Wesley Snipes has just recently found a passion for the martial arts film genre that he never had before.  On screen (in Blade) he was up there taking the role very seriously (action wise).  As far as the character's personality goes, he wasn't serious enough.  He made fun of the original character's personality, instead of creating a new one or just ""acting"" the part.  Though his performance was less than fair, it did not ruin the film in the least.

The plot was rather generic, the acting was average and there has this ""corny or cheese"" type feel.Besides the character of Blade and Whistler we don't care for anyone else. Did not care for the character of Karen as she felt forced and was in the film for a larger portion than needed. The villain of Frost was nothing special either but he wasn't terrible.

"BAM! Nonstop energy, impressive photography, brilliant film!","To be fair, I am posting this review AFTER my review of the sequel.  Why? The sequel sucks for very specific reasons, plot elements and devices present in this film are sorely missed in the sequel.This film exists solidly on the ""serious"" side of vampire flicks - ""Dracula"", ""Shadow of the Vampire"" and ""Interview with a Vampire"" - not the campy cheesy schlock of ""John Carpenter's Vampires"".  Why?  It makes vampires seem very real, as opposed to the pure shlock of evil undead coming ""to get you"" - ala ""Evil Dead 2"" (without the satire).The film starts with a dramatic introduction to the world of the vampires, from a very personal angle.  The energy is built in the intro, and carried to the hilt by superb physical acting by Snipes, with outstanding action sequences that are unequalled in Western cinema.  The main characters are very strong, very distinct, and very realistic.  Even though all of them could of been torn from a comic book, this film's photography and sound editing put you right there in the middle of it all.  Unique set design and shooting locations also give this film an eerie ""every city"" feel - beating ""The Matrix"" to the punch by as much as a year.Stephen Dorff shines as a villian, and is so good at being bad you'd think he was the protaganist (there are many other reasons to see that as well). While some critics can't get past the gratitious violence and well, gallons of blood, open minded viewers may see the bigger message in this film. Tucked neatly into the subplots are a good protrayal of a gen-x class struggle, led by Dorff's character.This film's greatest strength is the plot.  Make no mistake: this is not average 80 IQ plot here.  This is pure neoclassicalism.  If you don't see it, you're missing the point of this film.  The sequel has no plot - the lead character is just moving through a series of action sequences to get ""the bad guy"".  In this film, Blade struggles with personal identity, family, love and love lost - and a plot development that is a real double whammy.I really can't say enough good things about this film.  The costumes and set design set the scene; the indulgences of wealth and power. The photography immerses the viewer combined with a perfect soundtrack and choreography. Fantastic casting and unbelievable direction make this film a winner.If you like pure slasher fare, this film will entertain - but if you want some serious backstory, plot & character development added to your violence (like ""The Matrix"") look no further - and skip the pedestrian sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sharp,"I have not had very much experience with the comics, so I cannot make many comparisons to them. When you unleash Snipes, it's pretty hard to mess it up. This manages to lift it beyond that, and while the action(which is never excessive, and always forwards the plot), cool and well-done shoot-outs and awesome, well-choreographed martial arts alike, is all intense, fun and exciting, it does marvelous on almost everything else, as well. From my understanding of the title character, this really nails it(and the gallery, including and beyond that, is magnificent, very colorful and imaginative). The psychology is accurate, and it's also communicated nicely to the audience, not talking down to us and not being too obvious. Design is excellent, the utilitarian approach to the weapons is spot-on. The casting is great, Dorff, Lords and Jover make such good vampires. So does Udo Kier, but A, this isn't the first time he portrays one, and B, everybody who's seen the man in anything could have told you that. For such a subject, this is somewhat different than the traditional movie about the creatures. It is rather bloody, violent and gory, and not everyone will have the stomach for it. The tone is brutal and gritty. There is convincing atmosphere and suspense in this. The acting is a tad mixed, though there are no downright poor performances. CGI isn't bad, it was done on not that huge of a budget considering the amount, and it certainly works. The music is kick-ass. This is nicely stylized, and it doesn't go overboard. The humor is genuinely funny, very natural, and doesn't try too hard. Script is well-written, dialog and story alike. This is paced well, very fast and smooth. The cinematography and editing are flawless and just a little bit creative, without this becoming an experimental film. There is plenty of strong language in this. The DVD comes with an informative commentary track of several people(cutting back and forth between them), two featurettes I will review on their respective entries here on the site, half a dozen minutes or so of random behind-the-scenes footage, and a few short, and spoiler-free, interviews. I recommend this to fans of those who made it, and anyone who enjoys Wesley fighting on-screen. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Vampires Galore,"Blade starts off exciting and with great special effects, but it ends the same way and that's why it loses it's punch. Rather than have a better ending fight sequence with some new and exciting moves or some fresh F/X, it just has a longer fight sequence and the same F/X. To be more specific Blade (Wesley Snipes) does the same thing in the beginning that he does in the end, except it's more drawn out. Since the film is an action film we don't concern ourselves with the terrible all around acting, but you need to change things up a bit if you want to prevent a tacky ending to an otherwise mediocre film. All around though it was not too bad and I give it just a little over average for an action film because it has plenty of action. The story is about a good vampire (Snipes) with superhuman abilities fighting bad vampires. Along the way he utilizes the help of some friends.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
'Enter the Dragon' meets 'The Matrix',"""Blade"" has little to do with ""Dracula"" and more to do with Chinese martial arts films and CGI SPFX technology.  The movie is still good, and still enjoyable.Blade says a little bit of everything and, to be fair, says a lot about nothing.  Taking into account the amount of public interest in 'Goth' themed films, horror and otherwise, ""Blade"" follows suit.  Underground dance-clubs will never be the same.Finally, some of the characters in Blade reminded me of other ones in other films (Case in point, that fat underground vampire made me think of the spice-worms and the overfed caterpillar in ""Dune"").",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really cool!!!,"This was one movie really worth a look. I enjoyed it thoroughly and thought it was really cool.  Most of the music fit its scene and it had some great fighting scenes.  Great special effects, too. Awesome!",,Anonymous,Horror
The all inclusive vampire-action-sci-fi package,"Vampires have been hands down the most popular subject of ""monster"" related films and books for centuries, their popularity going as far back as the early 1700s though their origin much, much earlier. ""Blade"" is what happens when classic vampire lore meets 90s action movies, a fusion of stylized action and vampire myths. Yes, Blade--the vampire hunter-- carries a shotgun that fires off silver stakes. While stylized action and certainly vampires are nothing new, together they pack an highly entertaining punch.The Blade universe is a modern one where vampires live among men, turning them to vampires only at a rate that is enough to ensure their survival. But one of these turned vampires, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), wants more for the vampire race and studying an ancient vampire bible, learns of a way he can awaken a blood god that would turn the world population into vampires. Standing in his way is Blade, (Wesley Snipes) a vampire-hunter who is born a sort of half-vampire (his mother was bitten during pregnancy) and possesses all their skills with none of their weaknesses. Hating the creature buried inside him, Blade is motivated to kill them, straight up.Blade is one of those mysterious, dark, cold and emotionless protagonists. That makes Wesley Snipes perfect for the role. It helps to have not so good actors in these stoic roles because they play them better than anyone else (take Keanu Reeves in ""The Matrix"" for example). While Blade of course is forced to get in touch with his emotions in the film, this of course is not of our concern. What is of our concern is that Snipes kick a lot of ass and look cool doing it, which he certainly does. Sometimes quite humorously, which is always a plus of stylized action. The only other performance worthy of mention is Kris Kristofferson who is typecast as the grumpy old human vampire hunter who makes all the gadgets and would rather shoot himself than become a vampire.Stephen Norrington (whose biggest credits include creature effects work for James Cameron's ""Alien"") brings Blade's world to life. Norrington brings you everything you could want in a vampire action movie, even if you don't know what that is yet. It's sleek, cool, very bloody and moves at a strong pace. For one thing, ""Blade"" doesn't get dull. David S. Goyer, who wrote the script based on the relatively unknown Marvel Comics character, gives you exactly what you expect from an action script without going overboard on the one-liners. The intrigue of the vampire lore he's created is enough to help you get by the few annoying parts that come up in addition to the unnecessary swearing that was likely included solely because the action would guarantee an R rating anyway.""Blade"" is not a consummate action hero movie, certainly not by 21st century standards the way the market for these films has exploded and produced some incredible films, but it's fast-paced, entertaining and full of goodies for people who like action and vampire mythology. The special effects are strong for 1998 capabilities too, which doesn't hurt. Basically, it's enough to emerge a winner despite some bad acting and its predictable action hero plot and script. Not even just a winner, but some of that predictability still scores big points even if it's familiar because the movie is very cool.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A bloody good time,"After seeing nothing but movies about Dracula when it comes to vampires, Blade brought a new spin on an old story. This was a great, wild and funny film, thrown together with some genuinely chilling moments and cool special effects. The action industry actually did something right by making a film with some intrigue and intelligence. Wesley Snipes fit the role of Blade perfectly, never indulging us too much with sly dialogue, instead proceeding with the standard butt-whooping. Movies like this are just great to watch, especially the last fight scenes with Blade and Deacon Frost (thank goodness they changed the ending).

Blade 1,"Is this the most forgotten, good comic book movie out there? Before the MCU, before the DCEU, there was Blade. Yeah, some of the effects don't really hold up, but considering the time, I'm not holding that against it. Every time I see this though I'm reminded that this was actually really good. Snipes is PERFECT as Blade. His actual martial arts training is so obvious here and adds a level of realism to all the action, even when he's kicking stakes into exploding vamps. Whistler Kristofferson going ""Damn it"" over and over? Priceless. Dorff makes for a great villain that I love to hate and Wright, last but not least, plays this wonderful ""victim"" that isn't just sitting back and taking it. I love how Wright's character is so proactive and insistent that she's not going to just be a damsel and I love that.The problem with Blade is, I really do think Snipes was perfect here and as much as I'd love to see them bring this character back, I don't know that I want anyone else wearing the shades!

Absolutely nothing short of awesome,"In order for an action movie to be a good action movie, it must have two things. One is a plot and the other is good action sequences. Blade definitely has both of these aspects. Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff were excellent in their roles as Blade and Frost and the other actors did a good job as well. The action was so fast in this movie I had to see the film twice just for the action sequences alone.  With vampires, martial arts, and a great soundtrack, I expect this movie to do well in the box office.",,Anonymous,Horror
This film gets better with a second viewing,"I really did enjoy watching ""Blade"" in the theatre at the end of summer.  I had resisted it at first, having been burned by New Line's other recent comic hero film, ""Spawn"".  But ""Blade"" is a true treat.  Having enjoyed Stephen Dorff in ""City of Industry"", it was fun seeing him portray another bad boy.  The casting in this movie is wonderful (has Traci Lords ever been more suited for anything than her walk on here?)  Wesley Snipes simply won't settle for any one genre, and it's great to see.I really must agree with some of the others who've commented here about the New Line Platinum Series DVD--it is exceptional. I haven't seen or heard a better film for a home system.  DVD owners everywhere should be supporting New Line's incredible series which includes ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Dark City"" special editions.

"Fun, but just too slow.","Blade (1998) follows a human/vampire hybrid as he spends his life hunting vampires for a living. This was a pretty decent film and I understand why it was so universally loved! I'm not sure if it fully holds up today because the driving force isn't strong enough and it isn't entirely engaging.My favourite part of this film was definitely the visuals, there were some very pretty shots! I enjoyed the camerawork a lot and the colour palettes were very strong with good lighting. I also really liked the use of flashing lights. The effects haven't mainly aged pretty well and I found the gore to be very tasteful when used, it also looked pretty realistic. In addition, the fight scenes were incredibly well choreographed and I loved watching them!The score was a bit forgettable and I don't really believe there's anything to point out. However, the sound design made up for this as it was very well done and the audio was mixed well!All the characters were likeable in their own ways, but Wesley Snipes completely stole the show as Blade. He was charismatic and incredibly badass, I found it so easy to root for him! The dialogue was good, but nothing special. This would've been fine, but the film is quite dialogue heavy at times so I feel it should have been a bit better.The movie is pretty slow paced, and I wish it was a bit faster at times. The opening was engaging, but from there it took a while to get going and wasn't consistently engaging. Personally, I found it dragged a bit and the structure felt messy. The story itself unfolded fairly well but was just too predictable and ended up being quite anticlimactic.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blade delivers solid comic action fun!,"All this movie needed to impress me (and all I expected from it for that matter) was excellent action and intriguing special effects. This movie delivers these aspects in spades. I was very impressed. Amazing choreography of fight scenes, and the CGI effects blend nicely with the action...The story line is your basic comic book routine: super evil bad guy has plot to take over the world. Mysterious, troubled hero must stop him. Final showdown occurs, and...well, I'll let you guess what happens. Its not the story line that is impressive, it is the presentation that makes this movie worthwhile.Slick directing, cool weapons, excellent action sequences, nice special effects with a sharp attention to detail in the use of CGI. The sets are spectacular, and the acting passable. What more can you ask from an comic action thriller? Not oscar material by any stretch of imagination, but certainly a interesting way to kill 2 hours if action and special effects are your bag. My imdb rating - 6/10Noob Aalox",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blood pumping,"Blade is one of the best action movies I've seen!Starting out with a mysterious and shocking nightclub scene, the titular antihero quickly arrives to clean things up. With suave one liners, formidable weapons and deft martial arts, Blade piques the audience's interest as we wonder who is this leather clad hero and what his mission is.More shocking revelations follow as a corpse seems to come back to life in the hospital and escape, showing us that a vampire conspiracy is taking over the world with humans as the new cattle.Through the eyes of a hematologist plunged into this strange new world, we follow Blade as he uncovers a plot by the main villain Deacon Frost who is forging his own path amongst the vampire society.Although the plot is nothing special and the villain is lacklustre, the execution of the film is glorious. Wesley Snipes perfectly embodies Blade with his icy veneer and vulnerable and conflicted core. The action scenes are highly dynamic with wild acrobatics befitting the supernatural powers of this world. The editing and pacing make every scene follow rapidly one after the other like beats of a drum that absorb us in a frenetic crescendo. Overall - a film that gets your blood pumping!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The first successful Marvel adaptation,"Before this film, it was clear that any Marvel comic adaptation to the big screen was not favored by many. Howard the Duck (1986) impressed very few and The Punisher (1989) did not even get a chance to be released in U.S. theaters. It was difficult to say how Marvel would perform after such mishaps. Thankfully, they came back with one heck of an action-horror film starring one of the most popular actors at the time - Wesley Snipes. And was it a great casting choice; thank you David S. Goyer.To be brief because it was already explained, Wesley Snipes plays a half human, half vampire named Blade who takes it upon himself to slay every vampire that he comes into contact with. Just because, he doesn't like being part vampire himself. Accompanying Blade is his weapons maker called the ""Whistler"" played by Kris Kristofferson. Both Snipes and Kristofferson show great chemistry on screen will give a real sense that these two guys have been at it for years. Snipes plays his role with a controlled anger and moves with style, while Kristofferson lightens up the air with lines that any old man would say.Witnessing these two handle their work is a medical examiner Karen (N'Bushe Wright) who also shows off some feminine power when she's given the chance. But just like any other female character in an antihero movie like this, Wright's character will not be a love interest and I am totally fine with that. Same goes for what should be for Marvel's The Punisher, Daredevil and Ghost Rider. Playing the villain, Deacon Frost is Stephen Dorff and he too gives the cold shoulder (pun intended) to many of his enemies, including his own. He doesn't even seem to really care about his partner Quinn (Donal Logue), a fellow vampire. That's selfish man.Along with a set of great characters, comes some fierce stylized action, cool special effects and dark music. The writing is where it gets a little cliché. Because Wesley Snipes holds several degrees in martial arts, it should be no surprise that the action will be stylized to a level that will entertain and not be over top. And because this movie is rated R and is about vampires, there will be blood. In fact, I think it's appropriate to say that this movie was under the ""Marvel Knights"" logo before it was even introduced with Punisher: War Zone (2008) and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2012). The atmosphere is dark and gritty. Which is exactly what fans enjoy and want with comic book characters. Also, the special effects were evenly distributed as well, nothing seemed fake.As for the music composed by Mark Isham, I found it to be effective because it contained a lot of downbeat tones that helped emulate how dark this movie was. But I also found it lacking because there was no reoccurring theme for the main character and it also wasn't present as often as it should have been. Again, when it was present though, it was effective. As for the writing, what didn't work for me was the whole prophecy concept. That and the ""chosen one"" line. Even if that phrase were left out, it would not have sounded so cliché. But overall, this is one early Marvel film, no one should miss.Wesley Snipes does a great job portraying Marvel's first antihero. The action is tight and the score is dark and brooding. The writing even allows for good dialog but its back-story is too cliché.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Entertaining for what it is,"The premise of this movie didn't look very interesting to say the least. So it was only natural that i was skeptical when viewing this for the first time. But i was actually surprised at how entertaining this movie turned out to be! Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a half man, half Vampire who hunts evil Vampires and try to protect humans from the bloodthirsty creatures of the night. Now however he has become the hunted one. His special half-breed blood is interesting to the Vampires since they think it can be used to summon the mighty blood-god.There is mainly one reason why this movie works so well. And that is the action-scenes. There is a frenzied pace here that just keeps going throughout the whole movie. The acting is of course over the top, but still suitable to the movie. Stephen Dorff is entertaining as a Vampire leader, Wesley Snipes is suitably hard and composed as the hard-case Blade. There is some gore in this movie, but i think it's balanced quite nicely. It never becomes excessive.So watch this movie for the heart-pumping action and high pace. It's not movie of the year, and it's not Oscars material. But entertaining it is.

GOOD ACTION/HORROR MOVIE!!,"This was one of those slick action movies that was made to look good on screen, and it did, the vampire fighting sequences were excellent, there was plenty of blood and gore the whole movie looked good to the eye. It was a fun watch and very entertaining. Good movie but I didn't like how Blade could slice vampires in half and they would just die, it looked good but vampires don't die by getting sliced in half. Other than the vampires and how many rules were not kept to in this movie, Wesley Snipes gives a good performance as Blade and Stephen Dorff is great as the evil vampire. The story is when Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire during pregnancy, she did not know that she gave her son a special gift while dying: All the good vampire attributes in combination with the best human skills. Blade grew up to be a vampire hunter for revenge on his mother's death. The vampires, who managed to infiltrate nearly every major organization, need Blade's very special blood to summon La Miagra, the blood god, in order to gain reign about the human cattle, as they call us. If you beleive that vampires can only be killed by a stab to the heart and the weapon must stay in the heart and chopping the head off are the only ways to kill a vampire you won't find that in Blade. But Blade has it's moments and I would recommend it as a good horror/action movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great martial-arts action,"My Age: 13Blade, played by Wesley Snipes, is a half-vampire, half-human, who became that way when his mother was giving birth to him just after being bitten by a vampire.

Together with a man named Whistler, played by Kris Kristofferson, Blade wages war on the vampires with an array of different weapons.  His main enemy, Deacon Frost, played by Stephen Dorff, a vampire overlord.Without really needing great acting, Blade boasts some of the fastest martial-arts action which is very entertaining.  I warn the faint-hearted to avoid this, though, as it one of the most violent and gory films that I've seen.  This film has a fantastic techno soundtrack booming behind all the martial-arts throughout, and the ending is a very good one.

Blade,"The film Blade, is one of the very first all-out action vampire movies that are often seen today in modern horror films. What's great about Blade is the likability of the two main heroes, performed by Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson. Stephen Dorff also was tremendous as the ruthless Deacon Frost, that was the leader of a group of young club-going vampires. The filmmakers didn't shy away from their use of gore and take advantage of the R rating being an extremely violent movie. The gore could have even been better though, if the filmmakers didn't use the cheap trick of dissipating vampire ash when struck with silver.There are many horror films out there that are pretty brainless, but Blade is brainless in its own way by having top-notch fighting sequences and a story that's fun and easy to follow. It's slightly outdated, but nostalgic in the fact it's one of the very first, fast-paced superhero movies, which are all too common place nowadays.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

All the actors playing vampires, are made up to look like a vampire but not too much like one.

"Old Blood, New Bottles","Is there anything more ridiculous yet still fascinating than vampire movies? I cannot explain their almost 100 year old appeal but Blade is another in a long list which I enjoyed and here is why.First there is a style twist in Blade combining 40's film noir with vampire conventions. (In a much stranger way Dark City also tries for this kind of look.) Second, our vampire is the opposite of the usual sophisticated blood sucking aristocrat. Blade's central character is a Schwazenegger Terminator macho antihero except that Wesley Snipes can act.Add some martial arts, lots of shooting, vampire mumbo jumbo, gross zombies and you have an above average action film. There is a Ghostbusters apocalyptic subplot that I was able to ignore almost through the entire movie until it overwhelms the story. But soon that was finished and Snipes went on with being cool.Speaking of Snipes, he just oozes a menacing intensity. Coupled with Kris Kristofferson as the grizzled side kick and N'Bushe Wright as the damsel in distress and you have the foundation for Snipes to be his big, bad self.Blade is basically an action film that has the right mix of movie styles to make it worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

An above-average comic book movie.,"Not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series, I expected this film to merely accomplish the basic: introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics, present a plot, and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel.  And that's exactly what this movie happens to deliver.However, unlike with most other comic book movies, I felt that this one did it with a bit of class.  Risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes, ""Blade"" presents a very modern, believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dread--as minor as it may have been--from a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional (i.e., sappy) aspect is concerned.Yes, the movie has innumerable plotholes, and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years.  But when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie, and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this, what else matters?  It may run a little long, but for what it sets out to do, ""Blade"" stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic,Late 90s action .... not really horror just vampires. Some blood made enough money to start marvel movies. A good trilogy. Not really bloody for teenagers. One of my favorite wesley snipes movies.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Buffy, watch out!","Wesley Snipes certainly is one of the best tough guys at the movies! This tale of modern vampires and an attempt to wipe out the human race is not a story to be underestimated! Out of all the trashy vampire movies we've seen like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", Blade easily tops them all! I couldn't believe my eyes at the thought that had come into this! Blade is certainly one tough dude and the sequel, coming out in 2001, looks like a must-see. The vampire-explosion scenes and blood were extremely fake and the fighting not always realistic, Blade is an action-packed ride that has ""entertainment"" printed all over it!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Anyway,"I've voted 10 for the film, 'cause to me,  it's a great example of the genre (comic-book based cinema). It has everything it should have. If one has that in mind, one shouldn't blame Wesley Snipes and all the others for playing, maybe most ""stiff"" roles in their careers -- it's just the character, that doesn't leave much space for movement...Great cinema...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Get Those Fangs Into It...,"Blade looked like an intriguing idea from the adverts, so I decided I would follow my instincts and go and see it. Although Blade is not a great film, I certainly enjoyed myselfMeet Blade (Wesley Snipes). From the outset it's clear this is a troubled hero - a pre-credit sequence has him enter the world shortly after his mother's fatal encounter with a pointy-toothed demon of the night. Hardly your model birth. But every superhero has their dark side to wrestle with and being half-vampire just leaves you with an aggravating desire for meat cooked very, very rare. With a nifty serum suppressing such cravings and equipped with weaponry by grizzled armourer Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), Blade launches a one-man crusade to rid the world of vampires, forsaking the classic cross and holy water combo for a more forthright reliance on weighty darts, bullets capped with garlic essence and a sword edged in silver.With an opening sequence to die for, it is certain Blade is going to be lots of fun. Wesley Snipes is perfect for his role, and Stephen Dorff is a superb villain. Kristofferson is also very watchable. The direction is enthralling, I look forward to see some more good stuff from Stephen Norrington in the future. The script is flawed but enjoyable, and the art direction is fascinating.Blade is a film you can really get your teeth (or should I say fangs?!) into, I recommend it for action fans who want a scare!I rate Blade 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Too violent, way too violent","I don't care whether this is a ""comic book movie"" or not; it's far too violent. At one point, the villain actually throws a little girl across the street into a kiosk. She goes through it and lands on the street in front of a bus, glass flying everywhere (and gets nary a scratch, of course, in true ""comic book"" style.)Perhaps the filmmakers thought this was acceptable because the ""bad guy"" did it and Wesley Snipes saves the girl, but I was horrified. I actually cried out in shock and anger in the theater. I'm surprised Stephen Dorff agreed to do it; he should be ashamed of himself.Of all the money obviously spent on effects, could they not spare a few more dimes for the script? I'm sick of hearing that I ""want too much"" from action movies, that I should just sit back and enjoy the ride. No, thanks very much, I want a decent story. I want some character development (a 10-year-old could come up with better than what ""Blade"" provided). Most of all, I want some decent dialogue (""A cold heart is a dead heart""? ""Maybe you should just let it go""? Somebody stayed up all night writing those lines, didn't they?And for heaven's sake, what's with all the evil Asians? Nearly every single vampire henchman was Asian, and an silent, chop suey type Asian to boot. As an American reporter and movie critic living in Tokyo, I was embarrassed to sit in the theater, surrounded by Japanese journalists. By the time it was finished, I wanted to throw a bag over my head and dash for the door in shame.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Gripping, action-packed, and, simply, awesome","Ok, fine, this movie isn't too hot on the whole character development, lets win an Oscar for best Screenplay type thing.

With the awesome fight scenes, classic one-liners, brilliant hero and ubiquitous evil enemy, this movie has all the blood, gore, action and classic comic-based storyline to not only be watchable, but one to watch, and be thrilled by, again and again.",,Anonymous,Horror
Could have been more interesting,"Although Blade was far superior to Vampires, which came out around the same time, it was lacking in some areas. Blade is clearly a comic-book super-hero movie, fixating almost totally on Blade's inner struggle and total supremacy over his enemies. You can only watch so many Faceless Guys in Black Jackets and Knit-Caps get pummeled before it gets tedious. The action is clearly in the ""Boss Man stands on a table and bad guys throw themselves at him to be killed one at a time"" which I've always found inferior to more realistic, down-and-dirty action. I kinda wanted the camera to move over a few feet to reveal the Nameless Baddie Geneterator that spews out the cannon fodder. I would have liked to see the Vampires get a little more personality. Instead we have the Wise-Cracking Vampire, the Sexy Vampire, and a whole bunch of Stoic Vampires.However, Blade has some pretty good choreography, and Wesley Snipes knows his stuff, though I thought it was more than a little homo-erotic the way the camera focuses so lovingly on his massive pecs.All in all, Blade does have a generous amount of moments that make you say ""Hey, that's pretty cool,"" so its worth a viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Surprisingly Good Comic Book Adaptation,"Having seen this only after watching 'The Matrix' I can tell where the latter film got all of it's ideas. Subway and Lobby scenes, graphic martial arts, thumping music. All present and correct, and though 'The Matrix' does all of these things better and is in general a far superior film you have to give it up to 'Blade' for thinking of them first. I admit though that like many people I watched 'Blade' without the faintest idea about the comic book it was based upon and I still don't know anything about it. Like many big screen versions of such comics it fails in that it tries to deliver to both fans and newbies alike. Frankly I got the idea but I got the definite feeling that there was a lot more back story and a whole new universe which wasn't particularly well expressed throughout the film. Also, the similarities to the TV series 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' were quite obvious, though who came up with it first is debatable. Basically I liked it though Snipes brooding, invincible character made the film a little too clearcut. The man seemed to have no weaknesses, either emotional or physical, and so it was clear to me who would 'out'. Still, it's unlikely that 'The Matrix' would have turned out to be such a brilliant film had it not been for this merely average actioner so hats off to it for that.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Action Packed and at Times Frightening,","Blade is a great movie with a very work developed storyline and a talented cast.Wesley Snipes does a great job in his first outing as the well known superhero,he really did put in a great performance as this soulless and emotionless character.There are several scenes in the movie that are surprisingly frightening,and I wouldn't recommend parents allow their young children watch it,while it is a superhero movie,the vampire elements make it very frightening for a younger audience.Blade is an action packed and highly entertain going movie that I would recommend to fans of action,horror and superhero movies.A half vampire battles the forces of a rogue vampire who plans to bring permanent night to the world.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blade:  One Bad Mothersucker!!,"Blade, Wesley Snipes' better hero performance, continues the story of Dracula in a twisted but cool, ass-kicking way. This is not your father's typical vampyre film. ""Blade"" is the newer & fresher version with vampires living in luxury, blending into every facet of society without much notice. Wall Street, off-shore accounts, condos, fancy cars, & club-hopping is the flavor that is favored in this film, neighbor. There has never been a vampire hunter more skilled, more prepared, and more ruthless than Blade. Blade has a score to settle with the Vampyre Clan, and that is the bloodsucker who killed his mother & made him who he became.In ""Blade"", Blade is the tortured soul, half-human & half vampire hunter from the comics who takes on a renegade vampire Deacon Frost & his posse of blood sucking idiots bent on human & the vampire kingdom domination. The Vampyre leader, Dragonetti, thinks that Frost is a major risk to his plans & orders him to take care in his behaviors. Blade has trained most of his life to effectively destroy any & all vampires in his path. He has become the one man all bloodsuckers fear, and with good reason. The heavily tattoed Blade hates a part of himself & is on a mission for a cure to end his thirst. Along with fellow hunter & father figure Abraham Whistler, Blade goes out on nightly suck-head fests kicking all the vampire ass he can to a sweet soundtrack & fabulous martial arts choreography, not to mention using the most technological weaponry. Blade, taking rare pity, saves the life of newly bitten hematologist Karen Jensen & takes her back to his hideout. Karen proves her worth by creating a vampire blood weapon which explodes them once injected. Blade & Karen find out that Frost is making big plans for the Vampyre underworld from Frost's wannabe & the archives beneath the city. Frost captures Dragonetti, takes him to the beach, & watches him burst into flames during a morning sunrise. Now that Dragonetti is dethroned, Frost takes over the vampire hierarchy & captures Blade and Karen, he beckons to use Blade's blood to release La Magra, the Vampyre God & envelope his power. Frost also assembles the entire Vampyre Council to use in summoning the Vampyre God. Blade, severely drained of blood, meets his birth mother, who was turned by Frost when she was pregnant. Blade releases his mother from her curse & gets a blood power-up from Karen. Once his strength is regained, Blade takes on vampire soldiers & finally meets Deacon Frost, freshly upgraded to Vampyre God (incredible fight choreography). After a spectacular final battle, Blade destroys his nemesis Deacon Frost & saves the world.Blade will not disappoint the hard-core vamp fans & does his karate best to impress. Good ensemble cast with Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, Stephen Dorff, & Traci Lords. Great costume design, ultra-cool tattoos, & kick-ass weapons (beautiful sword) designed for Snipes, who plays his role with a superb tough-guy flair & quiet inner storm.

Very good action movie,"As nearly every other person has commented, the action sequences were definitely the strongest point of this film.  They were great. The film was created very well as far as keeping with its theme and comic book origin.  I don't think Wesley's poker faced acting was a ""bad"" thing. How many conflicted superheroes in comic books are anything but the same?It's definitely a macho, testosterone-filled ride, but don't think that women won't like this movie! After all, there are plenty of scenes that show off Mr. Snipes' significant bodyshaping work!Yes, the special effects were corny at times--not cheesy or badly done, just corny. But, my main thing is this: a key element for an action film is comic relief. This seems especially important for a movie with a dark theme.  ""Interview with the Vampire"" had its funny moments.  This movie had virtually no funny lines. They tried, but it simply didn't happen.  The guy who kept losing his hands, and kept giggling all of the time, was supposed to make us laugh. It didn't work.I thought Stephen Dorff's Deacon Frost was a bit corny at times. But, I really enjoyed this movie. It was one of the best ones I've seen this year. The ending was a bit of a let-down, and it wasn't funny but even so it still was a pretty fantastic action flick.  The action sequences alone make up for any lacking in other areas.",,Anonymous,Horror
Blade,"Wesley Snipes is ""Blade"" - an immortal half-breed charged with protecting mankind from the menace of the ever-peckish vampires with only his quirky sidekick ""Whistler"" (Kris Kristofferson) as an ally. Finally, the vampire council decide it is time to rid themselves of their nemesis and so ""Deacon Frost"" (Stephen Dorff) is tasked with bringing him down. I was always a fan of Dorff - never the best actor, but he had a bit of presence on screen - a good looking bit of rough, I suppose - and here is is a good counterpoint to the fastidious man-in-black whom he is out to destroy. The fight scenes are too choreographed for me, way too much acrobatics that detract from the menace of the story - it's supposed by about vampires, not rhythmic gymnastics - but it still moves along well as ""Frost"" tries to summon the blood god ""La Magra"" to give him the ultimate power to defeat our hero. This doesn't hang about, the action is fast-paced and the effects and characterisations gel quite well together for an enjoyable, if predictable story that is by far the best of the sequels it spawned.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Daywalker,"Blade is the marvel superhero movie staring Wesley snipes as blade. Who when his mother was pregnant with him was attacked by a vampire and became a half vampire hybrid,who can withstand sunlight and inherent all the strengths of a vampire. He runs the streets hunting down vampires, along with his mentor Abraham Whistler(Kris Kristofferson). They're tracking a vampire cult. Meanwhile a vampire by the name of deacon frost(Steven Dorff) is secretly plotting a master plan to overthrow humankind and make himself a god. Blade was one of those films at the time that made waves primarily because of it's tone. It was one the first rated R comic book it had swearing and it had blood. It was a movie targeted more toward serious readers. Wesley Snipes was the perfect casting for blade he stoic and serious badass but snipes still adds some wit to to the character. Alot of his action scene are nicely choreograph many the hand to hand combat is really entertaining. I know Disney working on a film with Mahershala Ali but,Wesley is blade and that gonna be some difficults shoes to fill. That's primarily because Snipes himself really wanted to do this movie, he had the passion for this similar to Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. When you actually have an actor who really cares for their role they're going to always give it their all. Kristofferson As Whistler is good a great as blades mentor You feel a strong bond between these two even though it more that macho non expressive relationship. The character of Karen is honestly pointless. Outside of her being hematologist There's no reason for her to accompany blade around. Stephen Dorff you can take him for what he is, he's not imposing he's not scary or a badass. He's a modern teen drama vampire. A rebellious guy who looks like a whiny douche, that looks more concern with his hair and throwing a fit. He not a character you would expect For a blade movie you look right at him and Immediately think of course blades gonna kick this guy's ass. The movie shot good Though there's is some of that 2000s fast editing where the film speeds up. Most of the effects for time are great when the vampires disintegrate,The make up effects. There are a few visuals that do not hold up today.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
just barely cuts it,"This movie is not for everyone, but if you're into some mindless action, this movie just might be for you.  It's based on a comic book character, and the movie kind of plays like a comic book.  But it's got plenty of style. There's something cool about watching some martial arts set to rave music (e.g. Mortal Kombat, another mindlessly fun movie).Some complaints - most of the 'bad' vampires I found pretty annoying.  And sunblock?  C'mon.  Some of the lines and posturing in this movie is ridiculous - but if you don't take it too seriously it's good for a laugh.One other thing - I saw Wesley Snipes on the Letterman show when he was promoting the movie, and he came out in full Blade uniform (sans his pigstick).

The action scenes were better than most of this genre' and the plotline made more sense than most other comic-movies.  Snipes proved himself to be a consummate action-figure star once more in this film. The only disappointment I had with this film was it's en-masse treatment of most of the vampiric characters... but that's more a problem with my enthusiasm with real horror films than with this production in particular. This is not a real horror film, and horror film fans will be disappointed - but if you want a hell of an action ride, see this film!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Move over Buffy, here comes Blade!","Before watching this film, I had relatively little knowledge of the comic book character Blade. I'd only seen him as a special guest' once or twice on the animated series of Spider-Man I was watching when I was in my early teens and the only things I remembered, were that he was a vampire hunter and that he seemed to be a native American. In the film version dedicated to Blade, he still hunts vampires, but instead of being a native American he is black. I, for one, do not care, but if there would be a film with a black Spidey, an Asian Wolverine, a blue Hulk or a black Kingpin in a Spider-Man film, I don't think I could bare it. Now I'm not judgmental or something, so I would not dismiss different colored characters immediately, but I guess for some characters it would be harder for me to stomach, because I like them more than others.Getting back to this film, I must say that it starts off great, with an original insight into the lifestyle of modern vampires and some good old action. The film just immediately finds it's pace and luckily it stays on it for the bigger part of the picture. The contributors to the films capability to do that the actors. Wesley Snipes is good as vampire hunting Blade as is Kris Kristofferson as his elderly sidekick Whistler. The best performance though, in my opinion, comes from Stephen Dorff, who not only seems to enjoy playing Deacon Frost but seems to actually become Deacon Frost just for the take of each scene he is in. He doesn't just act Frost, he breathes Frost, he IS Frost!The direction of the film, is OK. Nothing great, nothing bad. The choreography of the action sequences is mostly good and there are just some minor things (which are present in almost every film) that could have been improved in those important departments (important for an action film that is!). The things I do not like about this film, I would like to blame on the script. First of all I feel that Blade's personal drama could have gotten a bit more attention, so that he could have more depth as a character and second of all I didn't quite like the ending of the film. Why? Well, first of all, the ending is somewhat predictable. Secondly, I felt that it could have been more original and spectacular. I mean, throughout the film Frost makes such a big fuss about La Morga, that  in the end I couldn't believe what kind of wuss the prophecy foretold. Last and maybe least, the lines in the end aren't too good. Well maybe that is putting it a bit too harsh, but Blade screaming Frost' over and over again seemed a little lame and unoriginal to me.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

In fact, I'd have given it a 1.On second viewing, it actually isn't that bad, and is far better on the small screen.Wesley Snipes is half vampire [his mother was bitten when she gave birth to him] and his life is dedicated to some kind of revenge, in eradicating them from the planet.The action scenes are well choreographed, Snipes is better than he usually is [not wooden at all for most of the film], and even an appearance by the under-rated Kris Kristofferson can be spotted as this comes towards what is a rather predictable climax, though well put together.One for watching by the less serious moviegoer, it's hardly Citizen Kane, but then again it's not Billy Zane either.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great action flick,"Blade was simply fun. Ignore the critique a while and just sit back to watch the movie. I wasn't expecting Wesley Snipes to go Braveheart with the humans over the terror being brought down by evil vampires. I expected good action, martial arts, and lots of it. Blade delivers as an action flick. Some of the characters maybe like cardboard, particularly Blade himself, but it's not so to hurt the movie. It doesn't become too melodramatic to a degree unlike many action movies try to do with their heroes. What you get from Snipes is a good I-can-own-your-ass-anyday performance. What more do you need? About the only negative side of the movie I can tell you right off would probably have to be its reference to vampire history. ""Pure Bloods""? Vampire eccentrics will cry infamy over this novelty but that's about the worse of it.I was disappointed at the ending though, and so the DVD version is a MUST see with the alternate ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A movie that is better than the comic,"1.) I feel Wesley Snipes was born to be Blade. In the movie he looks and acts so natural like the role was made for him. He might be the best action hero ever, reminds me a little of Batman because of his tragedy. This makes him more human and his quest becomes very personal and emotional. 
2.) Story of the movie is catchy from the start, as a viewer you instantly relate to 
that newborn child. As the story develops you get pulled into the dark world of modern vampires. The rest of the story is O.K. and keeps you interested.
3.) The movie gives an interesting idea that vampires could be among us in their own secret world and society.The disco scene is shocking and coupled whit perfect soundtrack. For me this is the best scene of the entire movie.
4) Action scenes are very intense and you must love the way Blade destroys his enemies. Almost showing off. The scenes are vary well shot, from interesting angles and CGI elements are used to enhance the intensity in a good way. 
5) Stephen Dorff played a bad gay to truly hate, an upcoming vampire with the ambition to take over the vampire kingdom by all means. Perfect!

One of the better modern-day vampire movies,"We've kind of been overdosed on vampire movies in recent years, most of which being total The Lost Boys rip offs, but Blade is probably the best of the new spate of vampire films. It's about a man named Blade (Wesley Snipes) who is a vampire slayer. Ironically, Blade's mother was attacked by a vampire while pregnant with him. Seeing as he was not directly attacked, he is now a half vampire; basically he is a vampire but has blood substitute to eat, and is referred to by vampires as ""the daywalker."" On the baddie side is Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) who isn't happy with all the pure-blood vampires (lead by Udo Kier)ruling the vampire kind, so takes over with his own little gang and tries to resurrect something evil known as La Magra.Fast paced and intense, it's clear to see why it has become so popular and Wesley Snipes is fantastic in the lead, plus the leather-clad look suits him. And Dorff, as his nemeses, surprised me. Despite playing a baddie that seems like yet another David-from-The-Lost-Boys rip off, he is very good at portraying that somewhat evil yet not pantomime-esquire baddie. And he clearly loves playing the role. Of the supporting cast, Udo Kier and Donal Logue are the most entertaining; Kier (once again playing a vampire) delivering the sort of subtle evil performance he has been famed for and, in some lights, does look incredibly creepy, even though he's not really portrayed as a baddie at all, and Logue is wonderfully upbeat and frantic as one of Frost's little cronies.If the movie does have any drawbacks, at two hours, for some people it can get tedious, and the obese vampire is absolutely hideous, but the movie is so fast paced you probably won't have time to get bored, and that hideous vampire is only in it for about two minutes, plus you can't help but sympathise with it when Karen (Blade's love interest, played by N'Bushe Wright) is pretty mean to it.Overall, it's a very watchable movie that you will most probably enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best action movies in recent years.,"Having just read some of the other user comments in IMDb I felt as though I had to respond with my own opinion on 'Blade'. Some comments referred to it as 'average', or 'just another vampire movie'. I totally disagree.I think this is, without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest vampire movie and one of the best action movies in the last 10 years. This is high praise indeed, but permit me to explain why...It opens with one of the most original beginnings with the bloodbath club scene. This is fantastic. The use of red against the dark, eerie backdrop of the club is excellent, as is the pumping crescendo of the soundtrack. Then in steps Wesley. This is the part he was born to play. The arrogant smirk, the tough exterior, the 'do not mess with me approach', allows him to relax and enjoy playing this comic book hero to the max.Stephen Dorff as Frost is also excellent. He steals the show in many of his scenes. He is cold, calculated, arrogant and evil. He is also very stylish and wears a cool shirt for most of the movie. Which brings me along to the costumes. Blade's long black leather coat, in fact all of his leather gear, along with the guns and weaponry, is original and cool. In fact, does 'The Matrix' not copy and borrow heavily from 'Blade' - which came out a year before the much acclaimed 'Matrix'? I know this is very controversial, but I really do think that 'The Matrix' owes a great deal to 'Blade'. From the costumes, to the use of wires in the fight scenes, the fighting choreography in general and a lot of the cinematography are all original in Blade, but then copied, and admittedly expanded, in the 'Matrix'. Any responses to that? Because I know that there are many die hard 'Matrix' fans out there who will be p*ssed at that, but before you lambaste me, check out both films again and then respond.Oh and Blades tattoo is the coolest on film (along with George Clooney in 'From Dusk Till Dawn').OK, weaknesses, there are a couple. Firstly that annoying N'Bushe Wright, with her bad acting and her annoying glances and frowns, and secondly some of the red blobby explosive globules are not brilliantly well done, but these are minor flaws in an otherwise superb film.And to finish the film, the final action set piece does not disappoint. Again, Snipes is masterful as the arrogant (and a very adept martial artist) and confident Blade, as he strides around the temple kicking the crap out of everything that gets in his path. Once more, this scene is accompanied with a great tune, adding to the brilliant soundtrack.This truly is a cult classic film, and one that everyone should watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"So everyone who loves Twilight, will hate Blade.","In itself a super cool movieBlade is definitely super cool money for the movie as well as for the main character. However, the film has little '90s troops that are quite outdated and take something out of the sails of the wind, the same goes for the' 90s CGI effects, but instead kicked 3 annoying action movie cliches as it should be.I love to watch movies that stand out from the others. I love it when I do not know who in that time a surprisingly big part and I love R rated comic book adaptations (Blabe came first).But there are many things about this movie that bother me, such as the constant shaky cam, is a tripod really that expensive? The back and forth intersect between the normal dialogues, not everything has to be presented excitingly high 10, because that makes the really exciting something bland. The main villain is just as old as muscular and looks as cool as the hero, so it would be better if he stings out more, especially as he is in a wheel full of old men who look like they are having children's souls to fight to the top as he represents the new kind and the new danger. Then do it too dangerously enough: if your rogue is not cool, then make him ... huge and scary, scary, super strong, diabolical, or at least entertaining enough that it does not interest you like boring.Seriously Deacon Frost just does not say it out and behaved like that until the climax, I wonder why we and the ever wasting our time with him, at least if he was super pretty and always well-dressed, you could at least to conclude that he served only as their figurehead and that would explain his motivation but unfortunately no! Nothing like that!Or we just change a few character traits and attributes in this movie because Frost's right hand, his asshole, was so nasty and so annoying that she always wanted to clap her hands when Blade missed one, her jokes were damned funny and his whole character so exhausting that you're just waiting to satisfy the feeling of salvation when he finally dies. (Unfortunately, a fight as well as his death like sex with a tuna can is painful, disappointing and totally anti-climactic.But those are the mistakes in the script that was probably stretched to double length (with over 10 minutes of filler), an amateur music video editing and post credit scene which for some reason was inserted after a blackout but before the credits, there are only a few plot Holes in the bad plan but otherwise there is not much to find worthy in this movie.The fights are exciting, so the characters are super interesting the whole movie has a cool look, only half of the movie is night city and even the scenes that take place at night are neatly photographed and lit up so you can see enough and that Film has enough stuntwork for about 50 trailers.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Classic vampire action,"This original Blade film was awesome. The first 15mins of this film were just fantastic. It had the right music, action, set, just awesome. This film gained at least one star for the sound track which was playing during the blood bath scene, which went on to be copied and named ""operation blade"". The orginal was far better.The story line was fairly simply no twists and turns. It was just a good old fashioned vampire hunter film with lots of action and vampirey goings on. Stephen Dorff played the cocky bad vampire wanting grandeur really well and Snipes was awesome as Blade. Even the lesser characters were played well. The feel of the film was good too. It was dark but not too much, there wasn't really many special effects, apart from the odd jump scene and the vampires disintegrating when killed, it all added up to the right feeling for the film.This is how vampire films are surposed to be made, nowadays their mostly about vampires falling in love with the human girl rather than eating her.I feel for this genre of films this will always be one of the better ones and holds a well deserved 7/10.

A little disappointing,"First of all, I want to say that I saw Blade 2 before seeing this one here, and I expected a little more, while regarding the rule ""Sequels are always(usually) worse"". Blade is kind of the same as Blade 2 in many aspects. I just enjoyed the guys in Blade 2 more...they looked incredibly ferocious.This movie is a modern vampire story, with some nice elements but not really captivating action. Blade is the interesting one, as he is half/half. And then you can look at him out of two points of view: by a vampire, he is considered perfect; by his human part, he does not consider himself so.The story of the movie is unspectacular, with some nice fight scenes, but that's kind of all. Not really much impresses, beside the good special effects. Not the actors, not the plot, nothing. This movie just doesn't seem fresh.The only smarter part is the one about the conflict within the vampires. Pure blood, or not, does it really matter? Same question as in Harry Potter...just had to think of it. Here we see in a brutal way that it does not. But by this we neglect the fact that all pure blood vampires have more experience than the new ones, but still they are too few.This movie showed the vampires in a dark view. The only light is Blade. The vampires are everywhere...I would say that if it really is so, then why doesn't the world know anything about it...the vampires aren't perfect, and some of their victims might have escaped. Like the guy at the beginning...and I believe that there still is a vampire-free TV station...Anyway, the movie is just shallow. Worth a 6.5 maybe...out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Cool movie, but ...","Well I liked Blade - it had action; a fast moving plot; talented actors; and not a bad script, but ...I felt that the ending let it down a little. There was this huge build up (quite predictable, but nicely executed), and then it finished with more of a fizzle than a bang. The action was fast paced and exciting, and yet suddenly it was over, and I have to say I felt a little let down by its conclusion. When I watched the movie the entire audience laughed when the bad-guy/good-guy battle came to its logical conclusion, and I somehow don't think that was quite the reaction the director was looking for.I'd also liked to have seen a little more input from the peripheral characters. There were times when the female sidekicks on both sides could have been used more, and yet they were just ignored. Especially as the film reached its climax the female characters seemed to be there more to fill holes in the dialogue than actually bring anything to the action.A couple of glaring plot holes also caught my eye, but with block buster action movies what can you expect :-).All in all though, despite my reservations it was an exciting film, very much worth seeing. I found myself rooting for the bad guy, but then he did seem to get most of the good lines although Blade did have the coolest wardrobe. I urge anyone who hasn't seen it in the cinema to do so before its run ends. This is a film that requires the big screen to appreciate it in all its glory.

Stylish dark action spectacular,"Certainly one of the better comic adaptations of recent times, Blade was one of the most stylish films I have ever seen. The opening nightclub scene was one of the top action scenes of recent memory, a multitude of weapons and ample blood and guts combined brilliantly. Wesley Snipes was fantastic as the half human half vampire hero, and although the put on guttural voice got a little annoying some times, his performance was flawless. Full marks to Kris Kristofferson for his  great cameo performance as handy man Whistler, and Stephen Dorf was also good as Deacon Frost. The fight choreography was great, very well done, although a slightly longer climax with Frost would have been better. The gore bordered on overly gratuitous for most of the film, but stayed on the good side of gratuitous thankfully.

good action film,"let me make it clear. this is not a horror, this is an action. you don't jump out of your seat, you don't go to bed with nightmares. instead you watch an action which happens to have vampires in. maybe if the vampires didn't look so fake then it would scarier. however, its not for the faint hearted, its gruesome to say the least. the melting of a fat naked he-she vampire librarian, and the killing of the head vampire made me cringe. the action sequences are good, not a patch on other actions films, but still great for a 'horror'. Wesley snipes plays the role well and looks the part. the story is over the top with a 'hip' bad guy played with relish by Stephan Doriff. the fight at the end is great, and Wesley snipes' attitude adds humour to not only that but the whole film. if this film hadn't tried to be a horror but being an action instead id have given it 8 but the attempts at scary moments makes the film seem worse off. but the blood shedding fight scenes and good acting adds depth and ill give 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

High octane vampire action: Highly entertaining popcorn fare.,"Some films just have chemistry. BLADE is by far no masterpiece - it's simply a comic strip come to life. But hey, does it come to life! The ""bloodbath"" scene at the beginning is a real eye fest. Alright, Snipes impersonates rather than acts the semi-human vampire killer. But he's cool as an icicle. Sidekick Kris Kristofferson is the perfect choice. And Stephen Dorff makes a decent villain. Still, logic doesn't apply to the plot (e.g. if the old, pure vampires like Udo Kier are that powerful, why can Dorff kidnap him this easily?). In fact, the whole mythology behind the film is half-cooked, if that. The showdown is loud, but its solution a bit feeble, providing a one-liner that could compete with the worst: ""Some motherf**k**s always try to ice-skate uphill."" Snipes states. Huh?!? Still, if you watch the originally intended ending on DVD, you learn to appreciate the lame finale.

Blade, thankfully does not pull any PG-13 punches.  Come on, if comic's are generally about anything, it's violent conflict.It's also the first American action film I've seen that nearly catches up with the amazing, super-kinetic energy that Honk Kong action directors have mastered over the last couple of decades.  For some reason Woo, Chan and Hark have been utterly stifled by the Hollywood way, and unable to duplicate their own, homespun virtuosity.

No more than a mediocre vampire movie,"""Blade"" can be summed up in two words: vampire movie. It offers nothing to the audience, except a gory display of unnecessary quantities of blood. As intriguing as the plot may seem, it only comes into play in the last ten minutes of the movie's two-hour length, and even then it lacks the simple element of surprise, which even ""Interview With A Vampire"" was able to offer. The acting talents could really have been pushed, especially on part of Snipes, whose 'I-have-feelings-very-deep-down' attitude was undesirable at times. Perhaps the two things, which save this movie from meriting a one on a ten-point scale, are the editing (which added a creepy effect at times) and the twenty seconds of a mildly amusing swordfight towards the end.

"excellent, period.","This movie is a perfect adaptation from a comic to the screen. The analogy between a conscient human being about doing right or wrong, and mostly of all knowing that he is capable of both, with a character half human and half vampire is just excellent.

"Somewhat entertaining, but overall kind of a waste.","I like the overall premise of Blade: the idea that there's an underworld society of vampires living among us has a lot to offer in terms of paranoid horror. I also liked the idea behind the main character: Blade, played by Wesley Snipes, is a renegade vigilante half-vampire who fights against the underworld while having to keep his own vamp urges in check.Sadly, I didn't like much else in this movie: the huge potential for creepiness was discarded in favor of non-stop video game-like action, any hint of atmosphere was destroyed by that annoying camera work (first jerky, then slow-motion) that's characteristic of today's action movies and music videos, and the overall look of the movie is dominated by a pretty obnoxious Cigar-and-Martini/GQ-style fashion sense.I enjoyed the opening action sequences, and a bit of what followed, but Blade became increasingly stupid, and by the half-way point I was pretty much through with it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

A great comic book film for the late 90s.,"I'm surprised how mature and dark this movie was for a comic book movie (mainly for the time that it came out and when comic book movies weren't that overdone yet). The fight choreography, action, violence, etc were all great and kept me entertained. I also liked the villains, one-liners, and the smaller moments of the film that were actually a bit funny! There was only one weird scene where Blade pulled out his gun at someone running away on the streets of the busy city which seemed to scare people at first but then people kept walking like normal and not running away or panicking only a few seconds later which felt odd. However, that's just one measly flaw. Everything else largely worked and felt intense and original for what they were going for. THIS is how you do vampire action!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Spectacular,"Clad in black leather body armour and armed with a variety of high tech and low tech weapons, Blade (a human-vampire hybrid with tattoos, sunglasses and an attitude) spends his nights hunting 'suck-heads' with the help of Whistler, his sidekick and armourer. His exploits are set against the background of the complex political intrigues of the vampire nation, a well organized and intricate society.This movie isn't one to try to be something it's not. I'm not going to say that it doesn't have a plot (it does, and an entirely suitable one at that), but if you want high-brow drama, you're looking on the wrong shelf in the video store, amigo. Its action, gore and big-bangs right from the word go, while not stooping to the knuckle-dragging level.The story in interesting enough, the SFX are seamless and impressive, and the acting doesn't seem to have any great weak points.

The movie bored me so much that it felt a lot longer than it was, and it was overlong at 2 hours as it is! One particularly stupid moment in this movie is when the female lead is placed into a dungeon-like room and she faces some sort of horrible monster thing that used to be a friend of hers, who ""sort of"" hinted at having a crush on her before he was killed. Why he was a horrible monster thing is left unexplained (or if it wasn't, I missed something), and his presence is pointless anyway.

If you like action and getting a rush now and then, then you must see this movie.

coolest vampire film?,"Blade (1998)5 word summaryHalf Vampire battles evil vampires10 years before the vampire craze took over teens and young adults across the country Vampire films were actually cool.Blade is packed full of action. It has some of the coolest fight scenes and is one of the coolest vampire films made. It's not full of drawn out dialog or lame love stories like most vampire films. It does have a bit of a love story in it but it's barely noticeable.As I said the fight scenes are great. The sword fights are well choreographed and when you add in disintegrating vampires with every sword swing and every silver bullet shot it looks even cooler. The effects are usually really good. When the vampires disintegrate and things like that look good but toward the end when a hand is formed from blood and some one explodes it looks terrible, which is a shame. As for the acting Wesley Snipes did great and Stephen Dorff did even better. The supporting cast did fairly well too.Blade does have some problems, besides the occasional bade graphic. Some really cheesy dialog and painful attempts at catch phrases, but it worked out decent in the long run so I guess that's really what matters.I don't think the plot is the most original vampire story, but it is a pretty original way of telling it. Anyone looking for a good action film should check this one out. Anyone who doesn't like the 2008 style of vampire films might also enjoy it just to see some vampires get killed. Overall a very cool film that I think most will like and many will love.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie was awesome.,"OK, as so many entries here have mentioned, it's a comic book movie. The plot is thin, the ""hero's journey"" is present, etc. None of that changes the fact that this is simply a fantastically entertaining movie.

Not It,"First time seein this. I've gone back and watched old Marvel movies lately. Some good, some bad. I don't know about this one, almost terrible. One big commercial. Poorly written and acted. Wesley Snipes looks cool but that comes along with a miserable script. He is the best actor in this movie, but that is like asking what bird swims better, a duck or a loon? Rated R. Why? Some gore, some swearing, not a lot of action. Could've easily been a 14A movie, I was expecting this film to be much more intense. The city backdrop works, the nightlife ambiance is edgy and cool but not original.

This is old news for people who are familiar with action flicks from Hong Kong.  The highlight of this movie is its action scenes. However, a good martial arts choreographer does not make the movie.  How about the rest?  I personally think Blade is a stinker. The storyline is bad, but the editing is the worst.  How many times do we have to watch that computer graphics simulation of the blood god invocation? There are so many unnecessary scenes that drag this movie to its unnecessary 2 hours playing time.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Vampire Flick Ever Made?,"Although it may run just a bit too long, and with some familiarities aside, Blade remains a timeless and purely enjoyable Superhero flick that continues to remind viewers just how inventive a superhero film can be with some creative writing. First off, I love the world this film develops. Its ideas are not only interesting, but also well thought out and fantastically executed. Wesley Snipes absolutely rocks it in the lead role as the titular character Blade, and truly I can't imagine anyone taking on the role but him. As for supporting performances, Kris Kristofferson provides a great performance as Whistler, even for his shorter time on screen. The rest of the cast can vary from decent to average, although truly no one is bad, but Donal Logue's take on his character Quinn seems a bit unfitting. The CGI certainly doesn't age well, but that's usually to be suspected with these kinds of films. The pacing can take a dive once we get about an hour in, but luckily the film pulls together just enough awesome action scenes and phenomenal acting from Snipes to pack one hell of a punch. The style of the film is unmeasurable, truly something missing from many hollywood blockbusters today. In the end, Blade may not be perfect, but it is truly an awesome and underrated delight- and perhaps just might be the best vampire flick ever made.

Lots of Blood and...... Not Much Else,I don't really have much to say. I liked some of the techno music from the late 90s. That brought me back to those days. There was a lot of blood and gore and some of that was portrayed with CGI and it was pretty laughable late 90s CGI. The action was ok in some parts but kinda got boring after it seemed like the same moves just kept repeating. The story was ok but I didn't really feel for the characters. The performances were kinda dull. It is intriguing at times but it's not much else. One of the main characters dies but I didn't really care that much since all of the characters are not that interesting or relatable really.,4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best movie of '98,"I absolutely loved this movie.  The fight scenes are just totally awesome. The special effects, superb.  The sound is great, though the soundtrack im not crazy about (12 rap[not a fan], and 3 techno).  When I saw it, it instantly became my favorite movie, now, it's a tie with Matrix (the best movie of '99 yet, and probably to come).  Snipes is great in this movie. The story is also well done - if you can,  see it on DVD and check out all the extras, 2hrs + of additional information.  Very cool.  If you love action, lycanthropes, & martial arts, you should love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The First in the Superhero Renaissance,"Blade was the first of the modern wave of truly serious superhero movies, and it establishes much of what would follow. Gone are the outrageous vehicles, overly silly enemies, and alternate universe where time seems stuck in one decade. This movie was one of the very first to show what it would be like for an extraordinary person to appear in an ordinary, modern day world.For a character so obscure, Blade is handled very well in the film. Let's face it, before the movie he was more known for being a recurring character on the 90s Spider-Man cartoon. But afterward he skyrocketed almost to the top. Not quite X-Men or Captain America popular, but he became recognizable to non-comic book geeks.The story is good, it isn't just another standard superhero origin movie. It's handled like Tim Burton's Batman, he's already out there and fighting. The origin is just a brief explanation for the newcomer. I really would like more superhero movies to follow that model since it does work and gets the hero into the action sooner. There's the right blend of action, horror, suspense, and humor to keep audiences entertained throughout.Wesley Snipes does a terrific job. He seems to fit the role perfectly. Snipes handles both the fights and exposition well. He also has that Arnold Schwarzenegger/Harrison Ford style ""serious comedy"" delivery where he says funny lines but doesn't come off as a comedian. Now I find myself reading Blade and only thinking of his voice.Stephen Dorff is also amazing as Deacon Frost. He's the only one able to move the spotlight away from Snipes. His delivery makes for one terrific villain, though his character doesn't have the pathos many other villains have. I remember him more for his sadistic acts, but not particularly as to why. Still, sometimes a villain without a specific reason is more frightening.The other actors are also good, though most are overshadowed by Snipes and Dorff. Kristofferson's Whistler has a great relationship with Blade. Their final scene is really great, though makes me wish the series had a stronger sense of continuity with Whistler. N'Bushe Wright is good, though not particularly memorable. Donal Logue is great as the comic foil and I wish he would do more than just be the comedic relief in the occasional superhero movie.The action is the real stand-out. No stuntman in the Batsuit fighting in the shadows ten feet away. Snipes is in there doing the work. It moves fast but is never confusing. There's a real sense that they are going somewhere with it, not just trying to show random cool scenes.The only real problem with the movie is the ending. It's still exciting like the rest of the movie, but a little sloppy. That's because the producers made one ending that no one liked. So they quickly made another using many of the same ideas. The one they have works fine. But if they had known from the beginning, it would have flowed together better.The CGI is also noticeably dated and takes you out of the movie. Luckily they don't use much of it and rely more on superior practical effects.The best part is that the movie revitalized the superhero genre. Before this, there was Superman and Batman. Superman hadn't seen the screen in ten years (longer if you look at an actually good movie) and Batman & Robin had nearly killed the genre off just the year before. But notice how afterwards there has been at least one superhero a year, and now several a year. Marvel used their minor character to open the floodgates for everyone. Sure, subsequent movies have had their ups and downs. But generally speaking the quality of superhero movies has been quit good. No more nipple suits or Richard Pryor built computers.The movie's exciting action sequences and exploration of vampire lore keep this an entertaining flick. Though Blade still may not be the comic book character to read, the movie is still entertaining enough on its own merits to keep it around. And at the very least it will stand as a marker for the following renaissance of comic book movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
neoclassicism?  please..let's not kid ourselves,"Look, it's ok to admit that we all enjoy a little gore sometimes and like winding down with a little mind-numbing action, but there's no need to justify our pleasures by trying to make the case that ""Kubrick snobs"" just aren't going to get the subtle, neoclassicist undertones of this video-game/movie.

"Awesome action, intriguing style","I remember sitting down to Lethal Weapon 4, which by the way is another excellent film, and watching the previews with an impatience beyond comprehension.  Then I saw a preview for Blade.  As a kid, I had been a big Marvel comics fan, and since Blade is neither a popular comic hero like Batman or Spawn, I was wondering how or why anyone would want to make a film about him.  I also admit that the preview was less than convincing.  I convinced myself to see it simply because I am a big Wesley Snipes fan and Blade was a cool character.  Then came August 22. I had just come back from out of town and immediately my friend Mike called me informing me that it was definitely one of the baddest-ass action movies in the history of filmmaking.  So, on August 23, I saw it.  From the previews, one would expect a Seagal-ish cheap-ass action flick with poorly choreographed action sequences, lame as hell moves, and crappy acting on the part of supporting characters.  Of course, one could not hold the plot against the movie.  Why would you go see a movie like Blade, an obvious action extravaganza, for a realistic plot?  The filming style was incredibly unique.  And of course, Wesley Snipes lets himself go, letting loose incredible arrays of fighting sequences involving capoiera, aikido, and several styles of kung fu.  The supporting actors, mainly Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, and Donal Logue, also performed to the peak of their abilities.  All-in-all, Blade is an excellent movie for those who prefer violent, go for the throat action movies with an exceptional badass ring to them.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Great Comic Book Movie,"Based on the Marvel comic book, Blade is a solid action movie. It has great fight scenes, awesome special effects, and a kick butt action hero that the crowd can cheer for. In the movie, it seems that there are constant threats toward humanity from vampires. Blade(Snipes), or the daywalker, is the only one that protects us. A renegade vampire named Deacon Frost(Dorff) is trying to resurrect the blood god, which will destroy the world of course. Leave it to Blade to try to stop him. This is a non-stop action roller-coaster from start to finish. Wesley Snipes is especially good as the human/vampire hero. When he's on the screen, you just know he's going do bust some heads in, you can just feel his presence. Co-star Kris Kristofferson is also good as Blade's close friend and father figure.This movie is not for the squeamish, but if you don't mind that, this is the perfect movie to enjoy with your friends on a Friday night.",,Anonymous,Horror

But, it's sooooooo unapologetic about what it is, you can't help but love it.  It's over-the-top, in-your-face fun that'll keep you on the edge of your seat if you let yourself get lost in the nonsense.  Any attempt at sweetening it would have been a disaster, so they went full-tilt in the other direction and the result is a dang good time.  A true guilty pleasure.  Not appropriate for younger audiences (that R is there for a reason), but lots of scary fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bladexploitation?,"Anyone notice this fine Vampire Action Flick has a heavy slice of Blaxploitation mixed into it? This could be due to the adaptation of a Marvel Comic Character from the 70's, when Afros, Leather, Bell Bottoms and Bad Muthers were everywhere.Of course, in today's PC climate, I am sure the film makers wanted to be true to Bade's roots (no pun intended) or had a dose of Post-Modern irony in the production of the movie. I am talking more about the clothing, cars and attitude than the fine performances from the two lead actors Wesley Snipes and N'Bushe Wright.Blaxploitation films really took black culture and sold (exploited) it to a mainstream audience, but Blade works as a great horror action flick in it's own right, rather than needing to exploit any particular culture. However.. I think it still owes a debt, in tone, to the likes of Shaft, Action Jackson, Coffy, etc. Bad-Ass dude in leather clothing with bitchin' weapons and cool one-liners - all that was missing was the Isaak Hayes Soundtrack (""ain't talking about Blade.."") and a Pimp in Flares that could double as Bay Window Curtains.Anyway. Blaxploitation Cinema has influenced a ton of movies over the years - directly with the likes of Jackie Brown, spoofed by Goldmember and Uncover Brother. It is also recognised as an influential period of film making, now given a higher cultural status than it's low budget grass-roots origins. So, nothing wrong with Blade laying down a slice of this in it's production.",,Anonymous,Horror
The most awful movie i've ever seen,"Blade, i ""saw"" this movie wanting to sleep in my chair. But there was my back aching, so i had to stand the test. Blade is a commercial comic book adaption without the things that make the comic interesting, darkness, ""cynism"" etc. I think, the use of digital fx doesn't mean the viewer can recognise this as digi-fx. This movie was digital, in every aspect. Digital ""blood"", digital death fx, but so amateur-like i thought i sat in a b-movie. But, as a b, there was NO funny trash in it, so there was no fun seeing it. So if i saw the sequel, i would take some good voltaren pills with me, this will reduce the pain, maybe i can sleep then.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent Vampire Action,"Now there are many vampire shows out there with a lot of great action but we have to remember where it all started back in the nineties with movies like John Carpenter's Vampires and the Blade series starring Wesley Snipes.You don't hear much about Wesley Snipes any more but back then he was a very big star in a lot of action movies and this is probably his best work.He plays a half human half vampire who has a lot of the powers vampires do but without the problem of being killed by sunlight, etc. He has a partner (Kris Kristofferson) who helps him hunt and kill evil vampires using a combination of specially designed firearms and Snipes uses swords and martial arts.The result is a lot of great action sequences, some funny one liners and a surprisingly good story. What more could you want in a fun action movie?",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Totally mind-blowing action film,"I am a huge fantasy/Sci-fi and action fan, but Blade absolutely blew me away.  I have seen the flim twice in as many days, and I plan to see it again.  My record is held by JP for 16 viewings at a cinema.  I plan to see Blade at least 20 times.The sound track is awesome, combining gangsta rap, contemporary club music and rousing themes for action scenes.  The martial arts choreography was exceptional and Wesley Snipes does credit to this role as the part man, part vampire.  The array of weapons, gadgets and other useful bits of kit was stunning and a lot are used.  I especially like the Shotgun.If you hate anything this film tries to do, I urge you to see it anyway as it will blow your mind!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Stay away from this movie,"I don't like when movies make me suffer while watching them, specially when:every single line of dialogue makes me feel like vomiting. - the main character is the biggest douche in the history of cinema. - unnecessary twists come up just to make the story feel worse then it already is. - the soundtrack sounds like one from a lame video game. - every actor seems to put as little effort as they can. - fight scenes seem like the actors are emulating Michael Jackson.I feel sorry for the friend I invited to see this with me because I saw it on Quentin Tarantino's list of favorite movies from 1992 to 2009, only to then find out it wasn't this ""Blade"" he was talking about, he was talking about another movie called ""The Blade"" from 1995. I don't expect him to forgive me, nor let me choose another movie to watch ever again after this.After watching ""The Wolverine"" I wanted to see what an R-Rated Marvel movie would be like (apart from ""The Punisher"", which is a guilty pleasure of mine) and I thought this would be a great idea, I was wrong and if you haven't seen it I can only ask you to please stay away from it.I'd probably give it a 1/10 if it wasn't for a scene where a little Asian girl the bad guy, played by Stephen Dorff, is holding as a hostage gets thrown away into what seems to be a hot dog stand and from there to the steet, it was one of those Robert Rodriguez ridiculously funny moments and just because of it I'm giving the movie a star.I recommend you stay away from this...please don't watch it.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
You actually could make decent comic book movies back in the 90s.,"Blade is probably the only interesting production adapted from a comic book of the 90s. It's faithful to its original source material, it's not overdone, nor it tries to overcompensate with awful CGI, the acting is great, the fighting sequences are well done, it's an intriguing story, Deacon Frost may not be the greatest villain, but he is acceptable, Stephen Dorff managed to inject a determined and menacing personality that brought life to the character.Wesley Snipes was born to play this role, well, it certainly feels that way, because he does such a terrific job that you cannot imagine someone else in the role. Sometimes he acts apathetically but he has so much passion for those he protects and you can see that through his actions, not his words. A great vampire film, an even greater comic book adaptation, lots of action, blood, fighting. The film is highly entertaining.Watch and you'll see.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Another fantastic Vampire Movie,I went to see Blade on the first day of release . I only see 3 or 4 movies a year at the cinema and I usually only see Horror or Sci-Fi Movies this way.

He wasn't into Vampire movies and he gave it 4/10). Personally I gave it 10/10. But this is definitely my kind of movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
THE ULTIMATE VAMPIRE KILLER!,"Who could play the role of Marvel's greatest heroes better than Wesley Snipes? NO ONE! He has put the ""A"" in action when it comes to fighting vampires. Blade, the vampyre(half-breed) who hunts the undead, and protects the human race. That's what unusual to anyone who doesn't read Marvel comics. Snipes fighting abilities came in very handy for this role. Very swift,stoic, aloof, silent, and quick. No one crosses this superhero. Kris Kristofferson did a great job playing the role of Whistler. Stoic, wise, and aware of the undead and their weaknesses. As dangerous as it is outside, vampires are the threat to society. But with Blade, everything is safe.

An Average Movie,"Originally, I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. The plot was too predictable, the script was elementary and the special effects were downright laughable. But that was the only thing ""laughable"" as there was absolutely no humor in this film either. Likewise, the acting was slightly below average as well. Wesley Snipes (playing the vampire hunter ""Blade"") appeared to be ""overacting"" while the rest of the cast's performance seemed routine and colorless. So, basically what I saw was a film consisting primarily of gunfire, action and martial arts. Nothing more than that really. Obviously, some people really like an action movie that has these elements. In this case, quite a few people must have liked it because it won the ASCAP Award for ""Top Box Office Film"" in 1999. But that doesn't necessarily ""prove"" it was a ""great"" movie. All that really means is that a lot of people went to see it. And that's fine. Similarly, Wesley Snipes won the 1999 Blockbuster Entertainment Award for ""Best Actor--Horror"" for this film as well. In all honesty though, I didn't see much ""horror"" in this vampire picture to really get excited about. Again, just gunfire, action and martial arts. To be fair though, there is a growing number of vampire movies made these days that place a greater emphasis on action instead of horror. But, the difference between a ""great"" movie and one that is just ""average"" in this regard is the quality of the acting. And like I said previously, the acting wasn't that good. Now, that is not to say that this was a ""bad"" film by any means. People who like action movies will probably love this one. However, if you're looking for a good horror movie then it might be best to look elsewhere. In short, this was an average movie all the way. Nothing more and nothing less.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

A superb movie!!,"Blade is one of the best action-films ever made.  Wesley Snipes plays Blade, who is 1/2 human, 1/2 vampire.  Blade is able to walk outside at daytime(he is therefore called ""Daywalker), and garlic & silver has no effect on him. He has got the strenght of a vampire, but he has also got the thirst for blood from the vampires.  To supress his thirst for blood, Blade uses a special serum. The first thing you`ll see in this movie is a woman, who is giving birth to a boy.  The woman has been bitten by a vampire, she dies, but the doctors are able to save her baby, Blade. Soon there is a party in a vampire-nightclub, Blade enters it and begins killing the vampires.  The action- and fight-scenes in this movie are incredibly well directed and cool to watch, the soundtrack is very suitable for this movie, and Wesley Snipes is perfect in the role as Blade.  Blade is a modern adventure, and takes place in an urban environment, instead of the rural environment that most vampire-movies takes place in.

wow,"Being a fan of both snipes and the comic i was very excited about blade hitting the cinema screens. one thing that particularly encouraged me to watch the film was the eighteen certificate, this meant that the action, violence and general content would not be watered down to fit a pre pubescent audience, unlike spiderman or x men etc. and what a joy it was!! from the opening massacre to the final fight blade is not just an action movie but a film that deals with one man coming too terms with what he is. the action and special effects in the film are eye popping with snipes pulling off some genuine slick and fluid moves. the focal point of this movie is snipes and his skill with the sword, the man is a joy too behold while he decapitates vampires. the style of the film is good, moves at a lightening pace and also quality is bought to the cast by kristofferson, snipes and frost. a must for fans of comics that like something darker and a lot more violent.",,Anonymous,Horror
Very cool and visually appealing movie. It's just not good.,"It reminded me of Venom, which is terrible for 2018 Venom. It's a very dated movie with very little and uninteristing plot, terrible villains and little character development for our hero (closer to the 80's in that sense with 90's aesthetics).It is visually really ""cool"" (we have to give it a pass for the awful special effects) and the cinematography works overall. But it needed more humor (or better humor) and definitely better exposition scenes, a better plot, better villains and worldbuilding.

What acting?,"I beg your pardon, but I do not consider what Wesley Snipes did ""acting"". I have not seen a more drone-like ""acting"" in my entire life.In terms of technical achievements, it is nowhere near The Matrix, although in the extras to Blade: Trinity, the creators put the two movies in one sentence (to the effect: ""we, together with Matrix, the original, started the trend with wire-stunts""). It seems to me that whatever The Matrix started, the Blade movie can be absolutely no part of it.And, did I mention the acting? Wesley Snipes is at his worst here. I have not seen a single actor care less about a movie. I am not aware of any physical problems, but his movements in the movie resemble more those of a robot circa 1930, and less those of Will Smith in bad Boys. A performance so distant from ""smooth"" that it should be embarrassing for an actor from White Men Can't Jump.I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Anaemic,"Half man, half vampire Blade (aka Wesley Snipes) is out to kill off vampires in general, and Stephen Dorff's brat-pack-vampire bad guy in particular. The latter having a nasty scheme where he's intends to take over the world (or something).The film starts off, and continues, in quite a violent fashion. It's definitely not PG-13 stuff either, but surprisingly hardcore action. In a sense, it's more gory and violent than the more ""unreal"" (but in my opinion, better) sequel Blade 2. For the first half or so, things happen at a steady pace with both nice action scenes and cool characters - but then things start to fall apart.Gradually, the plot gets increasingly stupid, and the proceedings come to a screeching halt. Not that there has to be constant fighting and blood flying around, but the way too long and talky conclusion of the film was pretty uninteresting. I just couldn't give a damn about what happened anymore. The bleak gritty look that worked so well in the first half suddenly just feels gray and boring.Some editing to tighten the film and keep up the pace from the opening would have made it so much better. As would a decision to forget about dodgy CG-characters for the end battle in favour of some man to man (or as the case may be - vampire to vampire) battle that doesn't leave one character fighting a blue screen.

An Average Movie,First Of All Happy New Year! Right on with the review. I really wanted to like this film...I really did but overall I didn't enjoy it. The first hour was great but then some really silly CGI and darkness ruined the movie. Wesley Snipes isn't the best actor as we all know but I feel he could have done a lot more in this film. Its a Stereotypical vampire flick which like most vampire movies is set in....wait for it...Russia. The cinematography was OK but I felt the movie overall was a little dark. There was plenty of action but the film doesn't end at all leaving room for Blade 2 to formulate and the special effects were weak. Pearl was also a character that didn't need to be in the movie. I never felt anything for any character as no one was fleshed out at all...not even Blade. However I did like the first hour and Blades character was alright.

"Blood, testosterone, swords and blows.","We are facing a film that was planned and thought for the teen audience, thirsty for pure hard action with fights more choreographed than ballet and litres of blood everywhere. I could be exaggerating, but this film is just that. It's good, if what we're looking for is something to entertain without thinking too much.Its based on a coherent script, although its fantasized, superficial and sometimes illogical. Everything revolves around Blade, a vampire who walks during the day, hunting and killing other vampires, usually the naughtiest. Blade's real motivations are never fully explained, but we understand that they are related to his past and his late family. Here, however, he has to face a powerful vampire, who carries out a palace coup and takes power in vampire society, and who is determined to invoke an ancient blood divinity that will exterminate the entire human race (it seems unproductive to liquidate their food source, but things are what they are). The film has dialogues full of insults and heavy slang, scenes of bloody deaths and violence, but it was made for a young adult audience. The film also explains many things about the rules and the vampire society, as well as the way humans sometimes want to be turned into vampires, but that is all in the background when it comes to action.Wesley Snipes is convincing in his role, which is basically a highly trained and apparently unstoppable tough assassin, ""Terminator"" style. He never laughs, never shows emotions, he imply hit, fight and kill. He is not a friendly guy. Kris Kristofferson gives life to his mentor and greatest ally, an elderly human who, in the past, was a vampire hunter. Basically, he sounds and behaves like a smug cowboy from those old western movies. Stephen Dorff gave life to the main villain and was very effective in his task, giving his character an air of sadistic cruelty that made him threatening and convincing. N'Bushe Wright appears simply for being pretty and as a draw for the male audience.Technically, its a film that bets everything on action and on highly planned and choreographed fight scenes. Of course, some of them are shown in slow motion, a feature that ""Matrix"" helped to popularize the following year but which, for me, becomes tiring and even expendable. There are dozens of deaths, we can't even count them, and there are kills for all tastes. It looks impressive... and it is! You can see how much money was invested in these scenes. The sets and costumes are good, but I would particularly highlight Blade's costume, black with some quilts that seem to work as bulletproof armour, and a raincoat that looks like a black cape. Showy and stylish.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Blade,"Blade is originally a character from the Marvel Comics universe created by Gene Colan and screenwriter Marv Wolfman in 1973. In 1998, a film adaptation featuring the character had some success. Does the film deserve its success?The film's atmosphere is very dark, very cold and very realistic, it's not for kids, especially with the first gory scenes which set the tone of the film. The action scenes aren't bad at all, despite some borderline special effects, but hey, that was in 98. The staging puts our hero in the foreground, the secondary characters are also endearing and highlighted. The actors are very involved in their role, Wesley Snipes embodies Blade perfectly, he signs one of the best performances of his career, literally becoming the character. The antagonist played by Stephen Dorff, is charismatic and very involved in his ambition: to become the most powerful vampire in the world.The film takes a lot of liberties from the comics. In the comics the atmosphere is uninhibited, Blade is a vampire equal to the others and he is a boastful hunter with a very familiar language. In the film it's the opposite, Blade is a half-vampire with the strengths but not the weaknesses of his race and he's not very talkative.So, have we been delivered yet another bad vampire movie? Well no, on the contrary!Blade is just excellent, a very good film unfortunately not well known enough for my taste (I think everyone has forgotten it). Successful bet for Blade, its success will generate even two sequels, one of which is a total success and the other completely messed up. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Just see the first ten minutes, and you'll know what is excitement!!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Movie of '98,"I think this was the best movie of 1998.  The effects were amazing, the action was full of punch and the style was breathtaking.

Just Brilliant,"When i first decided to watch BLADE, i was expecting the same old cheap thrills that you get from almost any other vampire film. The truth about this film is that it is not just the tired old vampire story that so many movies seem to be following these days. BLADE not only goes where no other vampire movie has before but does it with style. This film even dares to change the background of vampires in some ways, making it more believable and gripping.In this film you may expect some guy hunting vampires in ancient tombs or supernatural worlds. Personally, I think that the best thing about this film is that it brings the story closer to home. The story includes night clubs, even outdoor parks and places we visit sometimes regularly. That is probably the best thing that the creators could have done to the story, again, making it more believable.The action in this film also is not anything like what most people would expect. The fight scenes are extremely well done and planned out perfectly while keeping it so that it doesn't go too far.When watching this movie, I can't stress enough watching it with an open mind. While it is a vampire story, it doesn't follow the guidelines of one. So if you are going to watch it and compare it to every other vampire movie that you may like, you won't enjoy it as much.But all in all, its brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
This Halloween movie classic will always be 10 stars for me.,"Most people don't know this about Stan Lee's Marvel Cinematic Universe of comics, movies, TV shows and books; The Blade movie franchise saved the Marvel corporation after bankruptcy back in 1996. The Marvel Cinematic Universe may have never existed without Blade, the half-vampire, half-human black superhero. So it's appropriate that I kick off the Halloween season with Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson and the crew of Blade. The Marvel comic book was never a favorite of mine back in the mid-20th century. However, this Halloween movie classic, adopted by Wesley Snipes' martial arts style, will always be 10 stars for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A fast paced, kinetic romp through modern vampire mythology...","Now the summary above might seem a bit highbrow for a film like Blade and, to be honest, it is. However, that doesn't detract from a movie which, although it doesn't do anything new with the traditional vampire story, does offer a fast and furious couple of hours of well choreographed action.Wesley Snipes is Blade, a half breed human/vampire mix and the only one of his kind. Taken from his mother by Cesearean section, after she was bitten by a vampire, Blade has all the strengths of a vampire with almost none of their weaknesses... garlic, silver, sunlight... all are nothing to the Daywalker. Unfortunately, he still ages like a human and he still has the vampiric thirst for blood.Discovered as a child by vampire hunter Abraham Whistler (a wonderfully gnarly Kris Kristofferson) Blade is subsequently trained into a highly skilled martial artist and fighter who hunts vampires across the US. Naturally the vampires take a dim view of this but are consistently unable to take down their nemesis due to his regenerative abilities and impressive skills, particularly with the sword. Using this and other weapons, created by the partially incapacitated Whistler, Blade is a powerful enemy, albeit one fighting against a seemingly insurmountable adversary which has its claws, figuratively and literally, in much of the modern world.However, all is not well in the vampire society. A schism has developed between true, pure blooded vampires and those who were merely bitten to develop into vampires. As the 'turned' (bitten) individuals grow in power behind their leader Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff in a selection of very cool shirts), they begin to examine ancient vampire relics which suggest that there may be a way of bringing a vampire god, La Magra, to Earth where he will initiate a vampire apocalypse. Blade must stop them.The plot of this film is well paced and interesting, although sometimes has to stretch a bit too far for comfort's sake. Still, despite the occasional lapse or ridiculous moment, sun block protects turned vampires from sunlight apparently, the tension is built up fairly continuously and the various fights and climaxes work effectively.Unlike the CGI heavy sequel and truly diabolical third film with its horrendous products placement (could you really fight someone if you were listening to an iPod!?!), the original Blade comes with few strings attached and no obvious debts to be paid (although devotees of Hong Kong cinema might take umbrage at that). Using wire work before the Matrix made it the done thing, Snipes and, perhaps more importantly, Norrington give us a genuinely super hero whose gravity defying moves seldom appear too excessive. A general (if not total) lack of slow motion and characters who are prepared to be fairly unambiguous means little distracts us from the standard good versus evil fights throughout, while N'Bushe Wright is scorching but useful (not your average screaming damsel in distress) as the doctor caught up in the middle of Blades' fight with Frost and the vampires (and who creates a recombinant viral gene therapy in about five minutes!).Gerenally Blade works very well, the reveals are unexpected and the acting fairly downplayed. However, the secondary bad guys and the Big Bad Fight at the end are less effective, the latter of which seems particularly lame. A look at the DVD deleted scenes suggests that an alternative, perhaps more apt finish was unworkable within the limited budget available. Instead the film leaves a slightly sour taste in the mouth due to its unpalatable finish but that shouldn't take away from the overall achievement of making an excellent, fun if overly serious movie that goes down well after a few jars in the pub.Comparisons with the sequels are, in my opinion, favourable. The less said about Blade Trinity the better but there is a definite suggestion that the second movie was superior. I don't agree with this, thanks mainly to the ham fisted attempts to arouse emotion, the rather ridiculous plot, too much CGI and too much gore for gore's sake. It also gains a character and loses one with almost no explanation as to the how's or why's and has the most unrealistic bunch of kick asses ever committed to film (the blood pack really should've seen an image and accent consultant before filming and what is the point in having Donnie Yen in a martial arts film if he doesn't even get to fight anyone!?!).So stick with the original and best: Wesley Snipe's Blade slicing and dicing the evil vampires with some hardcore moves, kick ass tools and a thumping soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Genuine Comic Book Brought to Life!,"Wesley Snipes stars as Blade. A half human/vampire who is on a quest to get rid of all vampires on the face of the earth.

I hope there is no sequel to `Blade',`Blade' * This is the same exact movie as John Carpenter's `Vampires.'  The vampires are on the verge of completing the puzzle that will give them the ability to become day stalkers.  Humans are just food for the undead.  Blade (Wesley Snipes) is the key to the puzzle.  Much B&G later the good guys win the battle but not the war.  There has to be room for a sequel.  I hope there is no sequel to `Blade' or `John Carpenter's `Vampires.'  I also hope you don't waste your time with this movie.,3.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Double Dragon Factor,"Remember the old Video/Computer-Game Double Dragon? I had to think back to this game when I saw Blade. Super-cool hero walks on screen, two super-evil bad guys do the same, followed by a super-ridiculous Kung-Fu fight. The enemies are knocked out, hero walks two meters and the scene is replayed. Finally, the difference between Double Dragon and Blade is that you could actually PLAY Double Dragon, so it carried with it a remarkable amount of fun. Just LOOKING at it for two hours leaves me unsatisfied.Blade is really one of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure to watch. I am a fan of Vampire stories and the myths that surround them, and I regard this waste of celluloid as an insult for every vampire fan. To the makers: Vampire myths and wannabe-cool-MTV-HipHop-sunglass-commercials DO NOT mix.I still wish I had bought two packs of cigarettes and a cup of coffee instead of the cinema ticket, but hey, what´s done is done. And if I now give the movie a final rating of 2/10, it has two reasons: the atmospheric opening sequence and the fact that Blade finally made me carve out my dusted copy of the good, old Double Dragon again. I forgot how cool the game was...",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Overall an excellent action movie,"Everyone knows that there are many vampire movies out there with all sorts of different looks at how vampires live in the real world. Interview with the vampire, the Lost Boys, their all different perspectives. But Blade takes the angle of a half-vampire, half-human hunting vampires which are all considered the enemy.The action scenes in this movie are some of the best that have ever directed on film excluding a few exceptions. The opening rave scene is one of the top action scenes I have ever scene and definitely the best in the film.Although the story line did seem a bit predictable at times, it never steered away from the main theme and that is Blade getting revenge for his mother's death. But the ending didn't seem too surprising and it didn't offer anything special that make endings so rememberable. Also some things just seemed to come too easy for Blade and his partner, for example the serum. Karen just seemed to know too much on how everything works for vampires.Despite those minor problems, all in all this is a terrific movie and it is worth at least a rental, but for fans of the vampire genre I think its worth owning.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent movie,"I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school. I thought it was awesomely directed and Wesley Snipes did an awesome job portraying the dark character that is Blade.The movie itself has that dark and mystery quality to it that I think the later sequels really lacked.The disappointing fact is that the characters King and Van Helsing were never ultimately introduced into the film in the beginning, rather King is introduced in the third and final installment and Van Helsing is depicted as a male rather than a female with a separate movie instead of Blade as it was in the original comic book.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best vampire movie....EVER!,"Without a doubt this must be the best vampire movie ever, and i have seen my fair share. Exciting, enthralling, gory, fast paced, all rolled into one well scripted, superbly acted movie. Wesley Snipes surely gives his best acting performance to date (depending on Blade 2 out in 2002)as the daywalker with a heart, who executes the vampires who hunt on the innocent. The vampire myth is brought bang up to date and the story/plot is believable and not derivative. An excellent performance is given by Stephen Dorff as the evil Deacon Frost the arch enemy who strives for the upmost prize, to live and feed in daylight. The opening scene at the rave grabs your attention and never relents till the closing credits. The special effects are imaginative and the speed-up/slow mo action scenes work very well. If you only see one vampire movie this year, see BLADE.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very cool and visually appealing movie. It's just not good.,"It remind me of Venom, which is terrible for 2018 Venom. The way it works it is dated with very little and uninteristing plot, with terrible villains and little character development for our hero (closer to the 80's in that sense).But it is visually really cool (taking in consideration that the special effects are dated) and the cinematography just works overall.
Maybe it was the need for more humor (or better humor) and definitely the need for better exposition scenes, a better plot and better villains and worldbuilding. Well, actually all of those things forced me into a low rating, even if I did enjoy the movie alot, right until the last third.
Still, not awful, just maybe dated and too 80's and 90's, when ridiculous unrealistic human behaviour was totally fine, taking away any sense of realism or plausibility and lessening the enjoyment, at least for me.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"amazing film, superb cast, fantastic action...nuff said?","Awesome. Awesome. AWESOME. This film should make Marvel proud that people still want to turn their comic books into movies. It's dark, atmospheric, fast-paced, well scripted and visually brilliant.Blade is based on and adapted from the popular comic books by Marvel. Blade, a half-human, half-vampire hybrid spends his nights hunting down and killing off vampires. Using an array of big guns, big swords and sometimes just plain cool martial arts moves, he dispatches said creatures of the night in huge style, creating CGI orgies of vampire-death-by-disintegration and beating senseless anyone else that gets in his way (look out for Officer Krieger). Helped along by Whistler, his faithful yet badass human partner, Blade's quest is to rid the world of these pesky bloodsuckers altogether. However, a certain power-hungry vampire has other ideas, and he sets about clawing his way to the top of the food chainThis is one of the few movies that are actually better than their accompanying trailer. Rare, I know, but it's true. Everything about this film is astounding. The casting for one, is fantastic. Wesley Snipes was director Stephen Norrington's first and only choice for Blade, and he does a fantastic job. Really the only film I truly like him in. Seeing him as any other character, he just looks strange without his black leather coat, sword, impossibly cool shades and tribal tattoos. This role was made for him. Stephen Dorff is brilliant as Deacon Frost, the maniacal and murderous un-pureblood vampire who wants to take over the world. (Ah, the old take-over-the-world ploy. Never fails.) He even manages to scare Udo Kier's master vampire Dragonetti into submission. Kris Kristofferson's Whistler is great  a decrepit and world-weary creature, almost like a father figure who keeps Blade in good supply of guns, swords and easily wieldable Ultra-Violet light sources. As Blade details their relationship quite astutely ""he makes the weapons. I use them."" Just happens to help that Whistler wants to wipe out the vampires as much as Blade does. N'Bushe Wright is fantastic as Blade's hematologist sidekick, Karen Jensen. She's attacked by Frost's second-in-command, Quinn, (brilliantly played by Donal Logue) and subsequently rescued by Blade. Most female action sidekicks tend to grate on the nerves after about five minutes of screen time, but Wright has a good mixture of sass, brains and she looks good carrying a shotgun. I don't understand why she didn't pop up in the sequels though. Traci Lords is aptly sexy and sinister as Frost's vampire minion Mercury (because of course, you have to have at least one slinky female vampire).The look of this movie is amazing too  everything is dark, moody and ominous. Even the few daytime scenes are overcast and gloomy. The dialogue, cinematography and acting are all first-rate, but the action scenes are probably why this movie is so popular. They're brilliantly choreographed, snappy and just brutal enough to make you giggle. Thankfully, they're also filmed in such a way that allows you to actually see what's going on. Most fight scenes these days are filmed way too close to the actors, and everything just becomes a blurry mess. I want to see that fist connect with that guy's chin, damn it. The soundtrack to this film is outstanding too - a hardcore techno slice of musical menace that fits the film brilliantly. Listening to the soundtrack is almost as good as watching the film. But nothing beats the club scene at the beginning with blood spraying from a demonic version of a sprinkler system, and New Order's 'Confusion' thumping away at your eardrums. Sensory assault.Even though this film is nearly ten years old, it hasn't dated. The dialogue is still wry as hell, ""-There are worse things out tonight than vampires -Like what? -Like Me"" the gore is still gory and the characters are still impossibly cool. This is another movie that'll age well, along with other films like The Lost Boys and Near Dark. And I still feel compelled to watch this quite frequently. Usually late at night when blood and guts and darkness show up so well in a room with no lights on",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blaloney,"""Blade"" is some of the silliest, most forgettable fluff I've seen in a while.  As with 90% of all bad movies, the script is the inescapable problem.  I understand that it's based on a comic book, so I shouldn't expect too much.  Still, the silly, very unscary, unoriginal film just isn't believable for a second.  I never had those moments where I suspended my disbelief and worried about what was going to happen to Wesley Snipes as ""Blade"".  Everything reeked ""FRANCHISE"" and ""SEQUEL"".  I have to come to grips with my old age (I'm 39-years-old) and face the fact that there are movies that I'd have to been 13-years-old to love.  ""Blade"" falls into that category.  But it's also terrible rubbish.  And sadly, this might be the best thing Wesley Snipes has ever done, the thing he's remembered for, his legacy.",,Anonymous,Horror

top action film,In my opinion blade is the best vampire action film ever to enter the market. It changed the view on vampires from being thought of as old white faced cloak wearing individuals and now they are thought of as a criminal underworld with ranks and levels and their own dark world which in my opinion add so many different textures to the bad guys instead of being the one dimensional characters they were in all other previous films.The choreography of the fight scenes is quite amazing and even though they are unrealistic they were done with a bit of humour which added to the all around enjoyment of the film. Wesley Snipes best film to date and i would say a must see film for anyone to watch who wants to enjoy themselves and who doesn't take films too seriously. If you enjoy this film you would also enjoy the rest of the trilogy and i would also recommend van helsing or any of the underworld films.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Another reviewer said to skip this film and go to the sequel, Blade II (2002). I'm currently watching that, and I must agree. It is paced to be slower; but it is suspenseful. The cinematography is way better in Blade II, and it has many big name stars. It again has Wesley Snipes, and Kris Kristofferson. But it also has Norman Reedus, and Ron Perlman!

This film kicked the door back open for two entire genre's.,"After the insult that was ""Batman & Robin"", Comic Book based screenplays were sort of dead in the water. Most film studios shied away from such fare, especially from Marvel Comic licenses. Blade literally showed up barely on the radar before it struck gold, hard. Slick screenplay, surprisingly quality acting by all hands on deck, and a serious lack of cowardice when it came to getting brutal. Blade sort of hit all the action/supernatural/horror genre nails on the head simultaneously. And with the budget it had, I was truly amazed out how good it was. Me and some compatriots went to see it in theatre thinking ""this is gonna' rock or suck, no middle ground."" and we were all truly amazed how much better it was than what we had feared.

A fantastic Vampire/Martial Arts movie with great acting and choreography!,"Blade is remarkable. At first, I honestly thought it was just another vampire slasher movie. Boy, was I ever wrong. Wesley Snipes rocks! He is gorgeous and a talented actor. I saw him recently on an infomercial. It was about exercise equipment. That was when I first learned that Wesley Snipes is a Fifth Degree Black Belt in Martial Arts. It shows in this movie. I'm not exactly sure, but I believe he did some of the Martial Arts choreography for this movie. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. I have always loved Snipes. I think he is a great actor, producer, and just a wonderful man. He carries himself well. The movie is packed with wonderful special effects. I also enjoyed seeing Kris Kristopherson in Blade.

"""""BLADE"" is still the finest vampire film I have ever seen.."" - Tom Millan ""Kindred Gem Films 1998""","Now I have viewed many styles of vampire films. Some of them leaned more towards the horror side, while others leaned towards action and others towards drama. Before ""Blade"" premiered on August 21st of 1998, ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" was the ultimate revolutionary vampire movie of the 1990's. It made ""Interview With The Vampire"" look like a ""church choir sit in""/ ""vampire chick flick""- which, by the way, was a drag to watch. Once I saw ""Blade"", I knew fully well that this film, never mind the sequels, had a strong and solid place on my top ten list of ""Best Movies Of All Time"".Director Stephen Norrington does a stupendous and extra ordinary job of weaving and orchestrating the choreography within this vampire action horror. All of the acting by Snipes, Kristofferson, Dorff and countless others was well done. Wesley Snipes plays a half man/ half vampire who is known as a ""Day Walker"" because he can function not only nocturnally, but during daylight hours unlike the any other vampire. He became this due to the fact that his pregnant mother was bitten by a vampire before giving birth. She died of course but the infant was already infected. Blade was then born into this world and later trained by a cancer ridden smoker Abraham Whistler, played by Kris Kristofferson. Whistler, apparently had battled vampires long before his encounter with Blade. Therefore when he discovers Blade's unique and extra ordinary abilities he mentors him and trains him in martial arts and a vast array of weaponry to create the ultimate vampire slaying machine.Stephen Dorff plays Deacon Frost, a young and over zealous vampire with a huge chip on his shoulder. He is in disarray with an occult society of vampires who exist underground as a board of directors to somehow integrate with human society- as a tolerant perspective. Of course Frost creates a rebellion to overthrow this ""tolerant"" vampire government of dullards in suits. Frost believes that a prophecy of a vampire god will come as expected and cause havoc everywhere thus violently pulverizing whatever he can to make the prophecy. Frost wishes to become this blood god.The original score and music in this feature all fit into the right spot. From beginning to end this film is packed with fancy camera shots and excellent editing. The action is ""in your face"" and ""straight to the point"". It's quick, fast and visceral in some sections. I still maintain that ""Blade"" is the finest and most revolutionary vampire film ever made. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" would be my second choice. Never mind the sequels to ""Blade"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". Even though I gave ""Blade"" a top rating and ""Blade II"" a 9 out of 10 (4 1/2 stars of 5) the third ""Blade"" was a 0 (no stars). Don't even get me started on ""Blade III"" or ""Blade Trinity"". All I'll say is that it should have been called ""Blade Zero"".""Blade"" gets 5 stars of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Wesley Snipes returns to let the world know that Demolition Man was not the last ridiculously awful movie that he planned to make in his career, which seems to be headed precipitously downhill.","There's nothing worse that a well-known film actor or actress can do than star in a film where they deliberately and obviously alter their voice. Wesley Snipes not only does this (terribly) in Blade, but he also wears false teeth and BROWN colored contact lenses. Are his eyes just not the right shade of brown? They had to be changed? And what was the deal with the teeth? There was never a single shot in the film in which he had fangs. Besides that, listening to Wesley Snipes talk like he's trying to scare a six-year-old kid gets real old real fast, and some of his lines were so pseudo-tough guy that they ruined the movie nearly single-handed, for the same reason that the idiotic Pitch Black was ruined (`There are worse things out tonight than vampires.' `Like what?' `Like me.'). Way to go, Wesley. That was so impressive that for a second I was almost fully awake. The kind of awful acting that this movie is full of belongs in cheesy action B-movies.I have barely even begun, and it's bad enough with just what I have mentioned so far, without having to watch the laughable efforts of Blade and his goofy female sidekick to periodically pop each other's shoulders back into their sockets (`It's dislocated!' POP!!! `Ahh, better.' Are you kidding me?). I won't mention the fact that when Blade popped hers back into her socket after having casually tossed her from rooftop to rooftop, he actually YANKED on her arm. Excuse me, Dr. Blade, but don't you think you ought to apply pressure in the other direction? This may seem trivial, and I'll admit that it is, but keep in mind that it is a pure example of sheer stupidity, and I have an extremely low tolerance for stupidity in movies. These kinds of things about Blade make it clear that it is pulled along entirely by the special effects and the star power of Wesley Snipes as an action film hero. Besides, he looked cool, didn't he? I sure as hell wouldn't mess with a man that big dressed like that, but don't you think that if a huge, tattooed black man wearing a trenchcoat, a bullet-proof vest and carrying a sword were to smack a police officer's head against the trunk of his own car on a crowded street in broad daylight, at least one or two passers-by would notice? That would qualify as suspicious behavior, in my opinion.There were so many things thrown into this movie for no apparent reason other than to hold the audience's attention that it really took away from the movie as a whole. For example, what was this globular, vampire version of Jabba the Hutt? Where did he come from? How did he get like that? All other vampires were in human form, and this guy hardly even resembled a human at all. Was there some reason that he was so tremendously fat? It's amazing he was alive at all. Granted, I don't expect his life story. Frankly, I'd rather not hear it. But there was obviously no other reason for him to be in the movie other than to stimulate the gag response from unsuspecting audiences. But that's not all, remember what Blade said to Karen (his goofy female sidekick) as he went to check the nearby vault door? He said, referring to the use of the UV ray gun with which she had been roasting his vampire skin, `If he moves, fry him.' Where the hell is he going to go, Blade?! He can hardly move!! What's he gonna do, run away? If he stood up he'd probably crush himself with his own weight.Am I being too hard on this movie? Good, because this is what it deserves. I'll admit that it had a few redeeming qualities (by `a few,' by the way, I mean more than one but less than four). For example, it was cool how Blade exploded the two martial artists by the elevators by the hallway, and the BLOODBATH sign at the rave in the beginning was also pretty good. Aside from these minute moments of forced entertainment, everything about the film was terrible. The `climactic' fight scene between Blade and Frost was like watching a little white kid in a fight against a huge black bodybuilder, resulting in the utter absence of any excitement whatsoever. How about that Blood God? Was he to convert the whole planet into vampires (`Anyone caught in his path will be instantly turned')? You'd think that if this vampire community had thought ahead at least a little bit, they'd realize that maybe it would be better if they tried to MINIMIZE the number of humans turned into vampires, because the more vampires, the less humans. And the less humans, the less FOOD. Thus, in taking over the world, they would inadvertently and idiotically bring about their own starvation and extinction. That's just another example of the stupidity with which Blade is filled.And of course, they couldn't have left out Blade in some other country (the bitter cold of Russia) speaking in Russian to a vampire in Moscow. How nice. What a tough guy. He killed all the vampires in the U.S. so now he's going global. What a piece of garbage this movie was. Granted, you probably won't be extremely bored throughout the entire movie (even though I was), but keep in mind that this is the type of film that you really have to try hard to enjoy, particularly if you are no longer in junior high school. This is a brainless, pointless movie, with little to no forethought put into it, and the end result is pathetic.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Vampires,I really enjoyed Blade when I heard they're making an mcu Blade movie with Mahershala Ali I figured I'd watch the original trilogy. I loved the style of this movie and overall it was a fun violent vampire movie with a pretty cool premise.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome film..........,"This is just an awesome film. Instead of the big high budget superhero blockbusters of today, Blade was a different film. Diving first to the fact it was R-Rated which rarely happens with superhero films today ( let alone marvel heroes ). It allows Blade to be more violent which is more probable for the character being a vampire hunter. Also the fight scenes are awesome. They flowed nicely and mixed well. The comedy was funny and wasn't in every scene. And the effects while kind of dated was fun in that way, and I actually think it worked in its favor. Overall I thought this film was an awesome film that is highly rewatchable.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nearly original... but not,"I love this movie.A ripping yarn and original twist on the old Bela Lugosi Dracula classic... or is it?Check out ""Grave of the vampire"" from 1972 This movie features a ""day walking"" vampire seeking to kill the the ""master"" vampire who violated his mother. The Blade version is way more slick but then movie tech has moved on from 1972 The 72 version is a tad slower lots of ""plot development"" but still enjoyable.Like I said .... a ripping yarn... no explanation as to why a dead dude arose from the grave to cause chaos but then I haven't reached the end of the movie yet",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Best comic-book adaptation ever!,I already owned the video and yesterday I bought it on DVD. Blade is by far the best movie based on a comic book ever. And yes that includes Spider-man!! Wesley Snipes plays the part of Blade so good you never doubt his character. The action is splendid and fast. I think that is what I liked about this movie so much. Most of the movies based on comic book characters waste a lot of time in explaining the deeper motives of the character. The comic books threw you right in the middle of the action and explained the characters motives along the way. I made a terrible mistake by watching Blade on DVD first and then going to the theater for Spider-Man. There is no comparison. Spider-man sucks and Blade rules!!,10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Highly enjoyable if slightly flawed,"While engaged in a destructive battle with vampires, half-human/half-vampire Blade teams up with a doctor to stop a renegade from unleashing a powerful creature from vampire lore.This one could quite possibly be one of the better additions to the vampire saga to come around in a long time, and definitely has a lot going for it due to that. Much of the positives here is on the continuing focus on action gives this one a rather fun feel with a lot of great confrontations, starting out with the spectacular assault on the nightclub as he wipes out dozens of vampires by gunshot, slashing and other weaponry as it starts the film off with such a bang that the mixture of action into the proceedings makes for some entertaining moments right off the bat. As this leads into the shoot-outs in the hospital attempting to take out the charred vampire left in that initial attack, the pace is set-up here for some really thrilling moments here from the shoot-out in their book-room following his capture and eventual escape into the train-station which has some brutal action with his dealings with them, as well as their hideout in the garage which gets some fine brutality mixed amongst the action. Still, the best parts here is the lead-up to the final showcase battle at the ceremonial chamber, from the collection of the council and their set-up along the statues and undertaking his draining for the start of the actual ceremony where the appearance of demon skeletons from their mouths is where this really picks up considerably. Even the action is fun here with fine brawls amongst the guards and the kung-fu battle in the pit before getting to a stylish sword-fight that finishes with a great final death for the group, all of which means this one has a ton of great action scenes that make for a really fun time. What grants this one so much action-packed fun is the main story here, which is a rather novel idea and is carried across wonderfully here, from the concept of the vampires as a society, complete with a hierarchy, rules and guidelines for living undetected. This makes for a stellar universe here as it gives it a big sense of history that's richly deserved here, while other little things that come up here, like the relationship of their helpers or the underground feeding nightclub, one of the film's action highlights, has a novel ring that provides for a clever way to continue on with their heritage but mixed up with a contemporary feel that is frighteningly sensible as well as logical. These here are the film's most enjoyable aspects, though it does have one main problem. The film's only real misstep is tied to the explanation of how he survived the initial attack and how he's the way he is, handled in a very back-handed way that's just thrown into the proceedings without any real attempt or effort, making his back-story all the more confusing and off-putting. Though some of the kills here end up providing a lot of rather fake-looking CGI gore in the process, this is a minor flaw in an otherwise entertaining effort.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, a mild sexual act and drug use",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Honest Review,"Is this the movie that started it all? I'll go in and say ""no, not Blade,"" though it does certainly need it's share of credit.For starters, it was rated R, and even though it was rater R back in 1998 where R was far from the kiss of death and Hollywood could feel free to make movies that weren't kid friendly and expect a solid return, it was still rated R. R is harder to turn into a franchise.And then there is the character himself, Blade. For those of us that wandered the comic book racks, Blade was awesome...but awesome in the way that us Catholics and probably most Jews view Angels...as in you love and respect them, but never want to meet them in person.You see an angel you know there is about to be blood, a lot of blood, you probably won't live through it sort of blood and the same goes with Blade.And mind, that applies across the board, Tomb of Dracula, The Nightstalkers, and the insanely short lived solo series.So of course the movie is rated R. I mean, the opening with the with the blood sprinkelers told us two things straight up, the first was that the movie was going to be way too much fun. And the second was that it would be far from kid friendly.Seriously though, what a way to open a film. Gets you hooked from the start. In fact, it was so good that we even overlooked the fact that vampires were dusted ala Buffy.Buffy/Blade show down, you'd pay to watch that wouldn't you? I know I would.So, yeah, this does not at all start the Comic Franchise movie trend, but it was important. It really proved that there could be a movie based on a comic that didn't involve Superman or Batman and still be a success, still be good.Sure, The Punisher 1990 proved that, at least in the B-Movie world, but Blade was summer blockbuster sort of good.Sure we wanted to see Frank Drake and Hannibal King, Rachel Harker and Doctor Strange, but for the first installment, Blade was enough...even if Deacon Frost was too young it was still miles and miles of awesome.And now that Snipe is out of jail, Strange is out in theaters, and the MCU has Marvel Edge...we can only hope to see another.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The first marvel comic book movie that worked.,"2 sequels , a TV series and a few video games later, the first Blade movie is still daywalkers best outing .Its a super stylish, exciting and down right cool thriller filled with great action. It also holds the little mentioned distinction of being the first marvel movie to actually work on the big screen (come on, seriously ,do you realise what marvel movies were like before this ? )and predating the matrix by a year with its black leather clad martial arts hero theme.From the kick ass opening rave sequence to the (wisely re-shot) sword fight climax, there's never a dull moment and it keeps a dark, slick, visual style throughout.The best thing about blade though, is that its one of those few comic book movies that has a hero who's every bit as interesting as the villain. As blade, Wesley snipes makes a stoic, powerful , mysterious protagonist and on the other end of the scale, Stephen dorff makes deacon frost one of the coolest vampires ever and it keeps their rivalry highly watchable. Also worth mentioning is blades grisly mentor whistler (""catch you ******* at a bad time?"")played brilliantly by kris kristofferson .Blade is easily one of the best movies to be based on a comic book.

An action masterpiece,"Blade is exactly what any action fan should be looking for. Stephen Norrington is a underrated director who has a eye for quick and effective action.

Kris Kristofferson plays his mentor and father figure, Whistler, very well too, adding background to the story. In the way of villains, Stephen Dorff plays Frost, the vampire with a plan for destruction. Not Academy worthy, but adds depth, being the yin to Snipes' yang.

Wesley Snipes plays the dead amongst the undead.,"Blade may have been born with the stealth and strength of a vampire, but he sure wasn't endowed with personality.

Blade was my least favorite character in the film; and he really shouldn't be, right?The ultra-modern design of the vampires' lair was a nice change from the usual gothic candle-light-and-velvet fare, but that was about all that made this movie a stand-out.

"Darker than the sequels, and all the better for it.","Blade stands as not just one of my favourite films, but also my fav vampire movie. It's gritty, grimy, dark and gives you a very original concept of a world overrun by neck suckers. His character is a no quibbles Hunter Killer. He's cold and un feeling when it comes to vampires and thats the way he should be. He got more cute and cuddly as the other movies were made, i bet he was totally against the direction his character was heading. Blade was an 18. Blade 2 was a 15. Gay-ed TRINITY a God damn 12. - Hollywood AT IT'S WORST. Not your average action flick by any means, it paints a grim picture of blades world and you get the picture Blade is in over his head and that the fight (his fight) will never be over. I would have been quite content with this being a one off - as exited by prospect of sequels as i was - they didn't need to happen, and even though they did they take nothing away from the triumph of this first movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Let's have a talk...,"I know this movie is considered a great superhero movie, a great vampire movie, a great action movie, a great Wesley Snipes movie and a great R-rated movie butI think it needs to be re-examined. On the one hand Wesley Snipes embodies the character of Blade, the action is great, the acting is great, and the film has numerous twists and turns, the thing that real hurts the films is the Vampire angle. For some reason we as a culture are obsessed with Vampires, they were beginning to wear thin when Twilight came out, and that with that mystifying international sensation and the supernova of Vampire fiction that came in its wake I can safely say I am sick to death of Vampires, no pun intended. Again and again and again and again, it's gotten to the point where they're not even intimidating any more, just boring. And here is no exception, if a vampire movie wants to survive it needs to be able to put it's head above the proverbial water and stand out but Blade just doesn't, no surprises, nothing new, nothing interesting, just generic Vampire stuff that manages to kill an otherwise great movie. I know a lot of people like this film a lot but I cannot see why, give it a watch but I am not a fan.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Good Example Of How Superhero Horror Is Done,"Blade is a film based on Marvel Comics' own vampire-hunting superhero, and while it is rated R, it is one of the good examples of how Marvel movies pre-MCU can be done well, as this movie was a commercial success that spawned two sequels and would even begin Marvel's venture into superhero films, which would result in 2002's Spider-Man re-defining the genre and even the creation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Blade (played by Wesly Snipes) is a man who is known as the Day Walker due to being born half-vampire when his mother was attacked by one while pregnant, dying after giving birth to him. In the present day, he is a vampire hunter, hunting down the children of the night where they hide in a secret war, but when hematologist Karen. Jenson (played by N. Bushe Wright) gets bitten, Blade saves her life and takes her to be saved by his mentor, Abraham Whistler (played by. Kirs Kristofferson). Now, Blade has to deal with Deacon Frost (played by Stephen Dorff), who seeks to summon a blood god named La Marga and obtain his powers so he can rule over humanity.This is a great dark superhero movie, and it is not one for kids, due to its horror theme and use of blood, as the special effects show vampires burning away to nothingness and humans getting bitten in the neck and sucked dry, turning them into zombie-like creatures, the special effects are good for a film released late into the 1990's. Also, the story is well written, the actors all do a good job, and the writing is good.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Awesome,"""I recently watched an action/adventure horror sci-fi film called Blade, which is set in Los Angeles, California, two years before Blade II in 1998. The story revolves around Blade, a unique individual who is half-vampire and half-mortal. Despite being a vampire, Blade has dedicated his life to protecting humanity and slaying evil vampires who threaten the safety and well-being of the human race.The movie had well-cast actors who played each role perfectly, and the fight sequences were great, keeping me on the edge of my seat. The lead character, Blade, was cool and brought a lot of charisma to the role. The movie had a good story that kept me engaged, but it didn't explore the relationship between Blade and the female character as much as I would have liked. Additionally, the final boss in the movie wasn't as impressive as I expected, which was disappointing.On the other hand, the movie had an emotional edge that made it more than just another action flick. From the first bloodbath slasher martial arts opening scene, the movie had me hooked. I also appreciated how the movie both abandoned its comic book roots while also completely embracing them.I would highly recommend Blade to individuals 15 years old and above. The movie features intense action scenes and graphic violence, which might not be suitable for younger audiences. However, the film's impressive visual effects, compelling storyline, and outstanding performances make it a must-watch for mature viewers. Overall, if you're a fan of the sci-fi or action genre and enjoy movies with a darker tone, then Blade is worth checking out!""",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
This was a really cool movie.,"Wesley Snipes is Blade, a half mortal, half vampire. His mother was bitten when she was pregnant with him, and when he was born, he inherited all the vampire powers (strength, agility, and regeneration) and none of their weaknesses (sunlight, silver, garlic). But he is human in that his life goes at the same rate as all of us. Vampires tend to live a lot longer. His life is spent killing vampires, and searching for the one that infected his mother. The movie starts with a nasty birth scene, and quickly turns into a bloodbath. Literally. There's a very cool fight scene, and then the rest of the movie is spent following Blade. The major plot (killing vampires) is good, but the inner plot wasn't well developed. Stephen Dorff plays a vampire leader. He isn't a pureblood (meaning he wasn't born a vampire, he became one), and he wants vampires to take over the world. So he translates the ancient vampire Bible, and learns of a way to summon the blood god. Great, but what does that mean? The whole blood god thing isn't explained. Why is that such a good thing? And when the blood god arrives, he isn't all that much better than any other vampire when it comes right down to it. So that was disappointing. Otherwise, I liked the movie. I enjoy these gothic/action-adventure/vampire/thriller type films. They always have an awesome soundtrack, and pretty good fight scenes. And these days, the special effects are a compliment. Blade is no different. Some of the special effects are cool and revolting at the same time. But they get the point across. And Wesley Snipes does a great job playing Blade.Now I haven't read the comic books the movie is based on, so I don't know how faithful the movie is, but he was very cool, and very menacing. And what I really liked was that he didn't display a lot of emotion. Sometimes in these movies, the bad-ass good guy has a heart that comes out way too often. Here, Blade has a heart, but it comes out very, very rarely, and then only for a few seconds. The rest of the cast was adequate, nothing really special about them. The scenery was good looking, and the direction wasn't bad for someone I've never heard of.  Many quick editing and shaky camera movements, that worked well during the fight scenes.What I did like about the story, was how they made vampires seem more human than creature. They discussed how to kill vampires in a way that made it seem like you could actually kill them, and not just like they were invincible. And who would have thought that something that became famous during the O.J. trial, would have played such a big part of the climax? (You'll have to see it to understand what I'm talking about, and if you still don't get it, write me and I'll tell you about it.)Overall, Blade isn't for everyone. The blood effects can get brutal sometimes, and if you don't like the whole vampire thing, you may not like this. But I enjoyed it, and I think it's worth seeing on a big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Frost, played by Stephen Dorff is the main villain in the film who at first appears to be a weak adversary but actually is quite good as far as acting goes. There is plenty of action and killing in the movie. Never is there a dull moment. It isn't so much scary as it is action packed. You'll get your guns your knives, your hand to hand combat, and a nice body count to end the movie. A decent amount of gore as well, so if that is what you are looking for then you won't be let down. The performances are good, the action is great, and the story is great, which leads to a pretty good movie. If you end up liking this one, see the second one as it is ten times better.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hokey, but so what?  A pretty entertaining ride nevertheless.","Okay, sure, this movie is a bit on the hokey side.  It's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, anyone?), but this tries very hard.  I've never read the actual comic book, but that doesn't really matter, I suppose. I judge a film mainly on its merits, not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea.  (Unless its a film based on a true story, that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy.)  So why will I give this movie a fairly high rating?  Because it tries.  It tries very hard.  In my book, that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film.Many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus. It seems everybody has their take on vampire lore, be it the cross, the silver, the garlic, the aversion to sunlight, whatever.  Some of those ideas are included here.  The storyline is familiar... a group of vampires conspire to take over the world, with one person (mainly) standing in their way.  Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses, who have slowly but surely moved into the world, and share it with humankind.  For the most part, the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them.  The vampires have even taken familiars, people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires' dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being ""turned.""Now that I think of it, there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the Roddy Piper film, They Live.  A hidden enemy, hidden group of people plotting against them, the fight to save human-kind... all that is present in Blade as well.The acting isn't the best here.  Snipes is, at best, only slightly better than some of his other roles; N'Bushe Wright, a relative newcomer, isn't too bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgettable as Blade's sidekick (he's to Blade what Chip is to The Punisher).  Stephen Dorff does the best job of the whole cast here, as the ""head"" vampire you just love to hate.I don't know, but I just loved the special effects in this film.  From the blood-soaked vampire-style rave, all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film, the special effects aren't half bad.  There's certainly enough blood and gore to go around, but after all, this is a vampire movie, right?  The various shapes and sorts of weaponry Blade uses are fairly unique, and not generally used in contemporary action films.  Snipes has more flair with a decked-out sword than he does with, say, a machine gun. Plus, there's so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away.  (Unless, of course, you are Indiana Jones.)Overall, this isn't the best action film ever made, but it's not half bad, either.  As a bonus, the musical score & soundtrack are pretty cool, too. Tell me, in what other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek?!My Rating:  8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cool,I was never much of a Blade fan but I must admit that this movie was actually pretty cool. It didn't have much of a plot but it had GREAT action sequences and some unique type of camera movements. It's a nice movie.3(***)out of 4(****)stars,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Vampires, fighting and action like an action film should be!","This is in my opinion the best movie Wesley Snipes have taken  a part of. I just loved the role he was playing, and he played it well. The plot was great and it contained cool effects. I was amazed when I saw that it didn`t get better score in IMDb. I guess that we, who love weird stuff like vampire and unnatural fighting scenes, aren`t the biggest group in the world. I really look forward to ""BLADE 2"". Hope it doesn`t become a lousy sequel, like most sequels do. To close I really must recommend ""Blade"" to all the people out there who haven`t seen it.           Odmund",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
EXCELLENT FILM.,This is one of the best movies of the year.  Highly original.  Snipes delivered a powerhouse performance that I thought was award winning. The action sequences are some of the best that I have ever seen.  I hope they make a sequel. ***,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dark & edgy serial comic book propaganda; & it is cooked off its edge!,"Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, a half human, half vampire known the day walker. He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since he teamed up with Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries, but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans, as food, and he plans to waken the Blood God and take control of the worldDavid Goyer did a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight. He can't take all the credit though and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character. The Blade character is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness. Snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character. Stephen Dorff provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screen villains. While overall bad comic book movies were so bad that they were entertaining, Blade is entertaining because the action is good. There are some typical action cliches but nothing too annoying for the viewer. The overall story is thin but again, nothing too bad.The story is good and renews the vampire genre by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel. By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. A lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible. Including the effects which are pretty good for their time. The vampire ""dustings"" are a very nice touch. In stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously combust which looks great. Vampire movies are usually considered to be low quality. For the most part, that is the case these days. But every now and then a good vampire movie comes up and in the 90's there were 3 vampire films that are considered to be the best.The film maintains it's dark edge with retrospective Gothic production, snappy one liners, & sudden violence. This may sound like cliches, but Stephen Norrington is able to direct the film through a Gothic style of its own. The screening time of 2 hours is not cumbersome. There are fresh surprises in every scene. The production design is tremendously visual & candy, with an intuitive & simplistic comic aspect to the production layering & screening.This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, & the good against evil. Yes sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies, and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the movie was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade is a fantastic action thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would say to be his best performance yet.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing special about it,"I don't really think very much of this movie. It's basically a B-action with 90's computer animation capacity at about 35% of its full potential, the story and characters are just about as deep and exciting as you would expect from a B-action.The only thing I found sorta funny about watching this movie was a ""rave"" party, obviously depicted by someone who has NEVER been to a real rave but rather just watched the covers of ""Rave Mission"" (german techno CD compilations). 4 out of 10 is all I can give this movie, and considered it's almost featureless, I think I've been nice by posting that vote.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Blade, comic to movie","Blade has to be one of the best comic to movie adaptions I've seen.  The action is amazing.  The casting is excellent.  Despite a few cheezy special effects, I found Blade to be an overall enjoying movie to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fast, furious, bloody","Well, I was pleasantly surprised. I don't normally go for horror/ vampire films, so when this film grabbed me by the short  and curlies, I was surprised! And it didn't let go until the end. Wonderful soundtrack, great acting, and above all, it was fairly unpredictable. Snipes is getting better and better, and Dorff plays a superb baddie. Some funny moments too help the film no-end. A ""must see""!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stephen Dorff Can Bite Me ANYTIME!,"For those who haven't seen this movie, ""Blade"" is a very good Horror/Action flick...and there is a little bit of comedy as well.  Wesley Snipes played the hero very well.  He has great martial arts skills.  Plus, I love how he used his sword.  :-)  Stephen Dorff was an excellent vampire and villain. I'm so glad that he won ""Best Villain"" in the 1999 Movie Awards.  You know... this is the first movie that I found him so HOT.  :-)  Anyway, I'm glad that they got the opportunity to be part of this film.  Oh yeah, I thought Kris Kristofferson was good in this film.Anyway, if you like action and you love vampire films, check out ""Blade."" The part when the evil vampires were trying to bring back the vampire God at this Temple was (I thought) the best part in the movie.  There is a great fighting scene between Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) and Blade (Wesley Snipes) in the film.  It was funny when Blade made that vulgar but silent quote during the fighting scene.  Anyway, this is an excellent movie.  Go rent it TODAY!  :-)I give it 10 out of 10 stars!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best vampire movies of all time.,Blade(Snipes)is half vampire and half human. He has all of a vampires strengths and none of its weaknesses. Blade is a vampire slayer. David Frost(Dorff)plans to rule the human race. Blade must stop him. The rest is for you to find out. Blade is a must see for all. It's special effects are out of this world. The acting in this film is flawless. Wesley Snipes is the coolest guy in the world. Stephan Dorff is the coolest bad guy ever. The plot in this film is original. This movie is unlike any other horror flick. This movie has a story behind it. I haven't met anyone who did not enjoy this movie. If you haven't seen this movie watch it now. If you have watch it again.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
confused,"Ok. Maybe this isn't the right place to ask this but I didn't know what other vampire movie I could ask this question. Ok. Over the years I have seen many Vampire movie but most i forget about after seeing them once. But there was one movie, don't know if it was Blade or what, but in the movie I think like 5 or more show up and they are not your every day Vampires. I think they are called the Elders or something like that. If someone knows the answer please let me know. Thanks.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Haim and feldman are wonderful.,"Blade is another vampire movie starring such great American actors as Corey, in both the Haim and Feldman variety, Keefer Sutherland and Alex Winters. Haim plays the brother of this guy who likes to hang out with Keefer Sutherland.  Sutherland is in a gang of outlaws with Lou Diamond Phillips and Christian Slater.  They are also vampires.  Anyway, the brother of Haim never knows what is going on, but Haim does.  Haim teams up with Feldman and Joe Pesci as they try to take down the vampire army led by Sutherland and Stephen Dorff.  There is one great scene where they are all playing volleyball in a pool and Ben Stiller spikes the ball and it hits this girl in the nose and she starts bleeding.  Robert DeNiro gets mad, then he says that he doesn't like ice cream or cookies.  In Blade, Chris Rock, who plays the lead vampire, can go out during the day unlike most vampires who die upon exposure to sunlight.  Rock holds a big umbrella that blocks out the sun, he also wears spf 35 which is a very strong sunblock.  He is also black so he doesn't burn easily.  I really liked this movie.  There is this one scene where Haim's brother thinks he is eating Chinease food, then he looks down and it's worms, but the whole time it's really just lo mein.  Also, there is this scene with Tony Danza and he yells up the stairs for Samantha and jonathan to come down, then he beats up jonathan and vampires come and they eat everyone.  That scene was cool.Overall, I'd say this movie was a 8/10.  A lot of scenes made no sense at all and seemed like they were just cutups of different movies spliced into one non-sensical one.  But I still liked it a lot.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
