Is it possible the makers understand how incredible this film is?,"You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your state of mind carefully.
It is a film about movies and dreams and reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter.
It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing.
It is beautiful and absorbing.
It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen.
I don't see it often, in case it's not as good as I like to remember it.
That is my secret, that I lock away in my safe in the basement.
That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all.
For some, perhaps it is in the cinema watching this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Inception was only less shocking to me than the Matrix,"When you wake up from a good dream, you feel the reality is harsh. When you wake up after a bad dream, you will be sentimentally attached to the beauty of reality.

Answering all the questions with one answer: I feel guilt. ‚≠ê,"When I first watch this movie, I was just shocked with it's twist. I'm not gonna mention details, because can't share any spoilers.Simply this movie makes a complex story, that makes you question so many things. ""Why he is keeping her in his dreams?"" or whatever your question is answering with some well written line. That scene is the key to the whole movie. That line between Cobb and Mal answers all your questions at once.That's why I like this movie so much. Some movies has that potential. Making a complex story that someone could answer with only one sentence. You're waiting for that line for whole content. But most of the contents (I mean movie or TV Series) are not managing that well.Besides the greatness of the storyline this movie has a really great cast. So Acting Performances are also great. Award Winning Cinematography by Wally Pfister was too great. Original Scores by Hans Zimmer was brilliant. Visual Effects are unique. So not only the Screenplay but nearly all the technical details are great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My number one favorite movie,"Inception is my number one favorite movie off my twelve years on earth! It's absolutely impossible to explain the incredible that Inception has. Inception is Sooooooooo dang exciting, edge of seat, mind blower, and I wish there were more movies like it and more Christopher Nolans out there. Congratulations to the well deserved best director, writer, and producer of films (in my opinion). Also the acting is fabulous, everyone did an amazing job, and Leonardo was fabulous at explaining the dream concept. Also the CGI and effects are amazing. Go watch Inception because it is incredibly amazing in every aspect, and is my number one film of my twelve years on earth. Bravo to the Inception crew and wow at this fabulous movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mindcraft...,"There are those who seek to dive into your mind, take your secrets and whatever else they find, espionage, conspiracy, infiltration, skulduggery, through worlds that are all conjured, well designed.

Nolan at his most intelligent best.,"Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Incredible-Nolan keeps improving and Inception is by far the best improvement!,"I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Amazing Directing, Captivating Plot, Overall Great","I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out, and, like most of DiCaprio's films, it blew me away.Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult).The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay.Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nolan's first true masterpiece,"Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus.I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will.I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sci-fi perfection. A truly mesmerizing film.,"I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film ""Paprika"" in the whole ""invading dreams"" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (""G.I. Joe"", ""Transformers"") or the exact opposite (""Doubt"", ""Invictus""). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where ""Inception"" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (""Avatar"" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort ""Shutter Island"". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (""The Dark Knight""). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And ""Inception"" can proudly stand alongside ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Intellectual masterpiece,"Inception is a beautiful piece of film that has impacted a large part of the film industry. With everything from the actors to the cinematography to the music, this movie without any elaboration perfected almost everything there is.Inceptions slow start is the only weak point of this movie. It begins intensely to then slows down for the next 20 - 30 minutes. While then finishing off as an impeccable film. Nevertheless, this is what brings the film down for me.The director Christopher Nolan managed to create a masterpiece with little to no mistakes. At no point during this intensely long movie did I feel bored. Instead, I was always excited and on my toes intrigued.The acting in this movie was phenomenal. A small number of great actors that all had their character arc while also doing incredible performances. It is truly beyond me how Dicaprio didn't win an Oscar for his performance.Meanwhile, also employing the greatest composer in history with Hans Zimmer, the music adds significantly. The music adds an extreme amount of excitement and keeps you constantly interested. Few composers can make you notice the music, but Zimmer succeeds per usual.To finish of the film was astonishingly shot. With beautiful eye-catching scenes. While also containing some incredible action scenes that might be some of the best action I've seen. With a thought-provoking storyline that finishes of with an unbelievable ending.I highly recommend Inception to everyone and I promise you won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perfect for Sci-Fi Fans,"Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" (2010) is a complex science fiction thriller about a group of people with varying specific skills that create a perfect team of dream-sharers. Dom Cobb, the main protagonist, is an extractor who is able to find out people's secrets by intruding into their dreams. His right-hand is Arthur, who researches and plans what they are trying to accomplish in a dream. Bright graduate student Ariadne is the architect for the dreams, meaning she literally constructs the physical aspects of a dreamscape. Eames is a professional at turning into anyone else in a dream, almost like shapeshifting. Lastly, Yusuf is a chemist who creates perfect concoctions of sedatives to achieve ideal conditions for the dreams to take place. This elaborate combination of characters is asked by a rich businessman, Saito, to infiltrate his dying competitor's son, Robert Fischer's, dream and place an idea in his mind so that Saito's business can become more successful. Traveling through the layers of someone's mind and making them think of an idea on their own is what they call ""inception."" Cobb is dedicated to making this happen so that Saito can arrange for Cobb's return to America to see his children. Without Saito, Cobb would not be able to return to America because of his alleged criminal background, but Saito has connections and power to clear his name. Some members of his team think achieving inception is impossible, but Cobb convinces them to be on board and they must come up with a mastermind plan with no room for error to achieve this extremely difficult yet imperative task. They begin a three-layer plan that involves elaborate depths of the dream dimension, taking advantage of Fischer's sensitive and dysfunctional relationship with his father, practiced methods of leaving a dream and entering the next, all while trying to avoid Cobb's wife Mal who lives in his subconscious and often sabotages his plans. The shocking ending leaves viewers at a cliffhanger and fans theorizing.Now that I've gone over the plot, let's talk about the other components of the film. The marketing strategies did an excellent job gathering hype for the film. The movie poster features the famous actors that everyone was excited to see, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Elliot Page, and the rest of the dream crew. It also says ""Inception"" in a large red font and notes that is directed by the same director of ""Dark Knight,"" which was an insanely successful and highly rated movie that was premiered two years prior to Inception. Dark Knight scored a 94% on rotten tomatoes and is #112 on IMBD's most popular movie list. This likely drew in the audience from Christopher Nolan's movies and set a high expectation for the quality of Inception. Another great marketing move was the contents of the teaser trailer. The trailer features a brief voiceover of Leonardo DiCaprio and amazing scenes with impressive cinematography taken out of context that show the viewers the production value and exciting action contents of the film all while confusing them so that they go see the film when it is released. I think the shock factor and science fiction aspect of the trailer is owed to the scene where a city block starts to fold over top of itself.The content of the film stayed true to the marketing because the cinematography, directing, and acting is quite well-done. Starting with the cinematography, the zero gravity scenes and cityscape building from the ground up were very realistic looking and intensified the movie watching experience. There was a lot of attention to detail. The directing of Inception is very montage based. It draws amounts and amounts of suspense. For example, the montage near the end of the film with the van, the fortress, and the hotel was painfully long but created such thick suspense. For the acting, I only have compliments and no complaints. Inception was casted beautifully and everyone fit their roles perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job as Dom Cobb, especially in the emotional scene with his wife and two kids in one of the dreams. My personal favorite performance was Cillian Murphy's role as Robert Fischer. He played as his character really well and he captured his relatively constant sadness surrounding his father situation.Inception is a staple film in the science fiction genre and is similar to a few other sci-fi movies as well. Inception is at #135 on IMBD's most popular movie list and has a rating of 87% on rotten tomatoes, so there is no doubt about its quality. In my opinion, Inception is pretty similar to the well-loved movie ""The Matrix"" (1999) starring Keanu Reeves. They are both iconic science fiction and action films with themes of alternate realities. The second film I think is very similar is a more recent film, Tenet (2020) with Robert Pattinson. Tenet is also about bending the rules of science and is also directed by Christopher Nolan. If you enjoyed either of these movies, I recommend Inception. I also recommend it to general fans of Christopher Nolan's directing, so if you have watched and enjoyed any of his films, you would probably like Inception too.On my rating scale of one to five, with one being the worst possible score and five being perfect, I give Inception a five. It has no weaknesses in my opinion. Every aspect of this movie combines into perfection. The acting and cinematography is what takes it over the top, and I am a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cillian Murphy in all of the roles they play. This is a movie I have voluntarily watched multiple times and it only gets better with each watch. It is very complex and a complete experience to view. My favorite aspect of the film is the ending. Many people say they hate cliffhangers, but I enjoy them because it leaves it up to the audience to imagine. Basically, you can choose your own ending based on what you think makes the most sense with the facts you are given in the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Bu√±uel meets Kubrick in Nolan's most ambitious venture, till date","Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them.The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity.Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Bu√±uel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Come Back Again!,"If one goes to an art gallery to see a provocative piece, one sees something new each time. That's what true art is. That's why a black light Elvis is not art. This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art, it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all, the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing, it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels.

"Inception is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, a work of sheer brilliance that astounds on intelligence, spectacle and heart","""The mind is like an iceberg, it floats with one-seventh of its bulk above water."" -Sigmund FreudChristopher Nolan's ""Inception"" plays very much like its subject matter described so aptly above by Freud. On your first viewing, you will quite possibly only grasp just a fraction of its complexity, but the brilliance of what this reviewer proclaims as Nolan's masterpiece lies in how engaging it is- even though you cannot quite fully comprehend what Nolan is trying to say. Indeed, it may take multiple viewings for one to absorb completely his audacious new creation that dares to tackle as dense and intricate a subject as that of dreams.It isn't easy to understand the nature of dreams, particularly because they seem to defy logic. The same can probably be said of some of the elements in ""Inception"", but in order for one to understand what dreams really are, one has to first accept that they are not part of the conscious mind, and therefore cannot be understood by rationality. Freud proposed that the rational mind is just that one-seventh of the iceberg that we see, and the rest of the mind is made up of the preconscious and the unconscious. Freud also believed that dreams were the road to the unconscious and existed in the preconscious, a state between the conscious and the unconscious mind.It is in this context that Nolan invites his audience to approach ""Inception"". Here, Nolan imagines a world of corporate espionage where a thief enters a person's mind during his dreams to steal ideas. This process he terms ""extraction"", done by a team of people who design the architecture of the dreams, plant several people including the subject into the dream, forge identities within the dream and then proceed to steal the idea from the subject. Leonardo DiCaprio is the master thief of them all, Dom Cobb, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt his long-time right-hand man Arthur.But this latest mission is different- a tycoon Saito (Ken Watanabe) wants him to plant an idea (so termed inception) within a rival's (Cillian Murphy) mind in order that he will break up his ailing father's business empire after he takes over. Cobb agrees to this dangerous mission- a fugitive wanted for the murder of his wife, Saito promises that if Cobb succeeds, he will wipe Cobb's slate clean so he is allowed to return to the United States to see his children. So Cobb begins assembling his team- the architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), the forger Earnes (Tom Hardy) and the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao)- think of it like a heist, only much more complicated.As Cobb explains the rules of the game to his team while preparing for their mission, Nolan is too establishing the rules of his game to his audience- what it means to die in a dream, why one can feel pain even when you're in a dream, the significance of the people you see in your dream, the difference between dream time and real time. Not to spoil the experience to you- but suffice to say that there are many many such rules that Nolan plays by in his movie. Those who have had some experience in the study of dreams will likely grasp this more quickly, but those who have not may take more time to accept the logic and regulations behind Nolan's world- hence the multiple viewings.Regardless, there is no doubt that it is engrossingly intriguing. All this takes place in the first half of the movie, which sets the stage for the inception itself in the latter half, an ingenious conceit set within a world of layered dreams that defies any description. Nolan uses the interconnectedness of these elaborate dream layers to intercut several breathtaking action spectacles - the storming of a vault within the Arctic within a zero-gravity fight along a hotel corridor within a high-speed vehicular freeway chase. Each of these would be thrilling in their own right, but with Nolan's vision, Wally Pfister's expansive photography and Lee Smith's fine editing, the simultaneous unfolding of these set-pieces is utterly riveting.Besides grand action, Nolan also delivers heart-wringing moments courtesy of Cobb's troubled past with his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who threatens to wreak havoc on his missions by surfacing from his unconscious in the most inopportune manner. We're kept in the dark most of the time, believing that Mal is an insidious presence Cobb is unable to eradicate, but Nolan's reveal towards the end of the film that puts into perspective Cobb's unresolved guilt delivers an emotional finish that will leave you floored.As with his previous movies, Nolan displays a knack for choosing actors who can best embody the characters in his films. While DiCaprio's role here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island, there's no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt. The rest of the supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly- Joseph Gordon-Levitt radiates confidence and suavity, Ellen Page displays suitable wit and grit, and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking performance.But ""Inception"" is Nolan's vision through and through- and in fact, a visionary director and a master filmmaker at that. Many years Nolan spent refining his screenplay, and it shows in the great detail and complexity that makes ""Inception"" both an intellectual and visceral enjoyment- just take the names of the various characters, each of which have a special significance. With ""Inception"", Nolan invites you to open your mind to possibilities- possibilities of alternate realities, of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most importantly, of the power of imagination. It is that rare gem of a film that is so multi-layered, so profound and so fascinating that you'll want to experience it again immediately after you've seen it- just so you can fully appreciate its genius.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A complex, hypnotic, incredible thriller.","Inception is a first class, mind blowing, complex action thriller, it boats outstanding special effects, an A list cast, and some insanely clever concepts.It was love at first sight, I adored this film when I first saw it, and over a decade on, it's still as good. For me it's up there with The Matrix, it truly is that good.It's one of those films that improves with subsequent viewings, as there is always something new to pick up, some detail that you may have missed the previous time.This film packs some big punches, it dazzles in every avenue, one of the biggest features, the visuals, those special effects look remarkable still. The scenes of the streets folding over, just an incredible moment, surreal.Another incredible feature, the acting, Cain, Cotillard, Murphy, Hardy all fantastic, as for Leonardo DiCaprio, I still regard it as one of his best ever performances, he's phenomenal, he commands your attention.Have you ever dreamed you're dreaming?? What a thing to contemplate.Personally, this film is in my top 10.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not bad, but definitely not genius","Inception is one of those movies that ""engaged"" film-goers will mistake for genius. Let me explain my theory on people and movies. There are three types of movie-watchers: passive, engaged, and intelligently engaged. Passive people will watch Die Another Day and like it just as much as the Bourne Identity. They don't go to the movies to think, they go to be entertained by cool effects and witty one-liners. Engaged people think they know what they're talking about, and generally love movies that are edgy in plot and execution but conventional enough to understand, like Fight Club and the subject of this review. They believe themselves to be refined in cinema, but, in reality, just don't quite have the intellect, cinematically speaking, to pull it off. Intelligently engaged people will appreciate the complexity of Inception, but also recognize it's a little sloppy, self-serious, over drawn, and empty. They recognize its audacity, but don't pretend like it is Kubrick or Paul Thomas Anderson. Suffice it to say, most people who fall into the engaged category will try and pretend that Inception is a 'masterpiece' and that they know everything about movies. They don't. Inception is clever, but it doesn't rank anything above respectable.The premise is ingenious, and Inception is able to live off its sheer mind-bendiness for the first 45 minutes. Leo is a specialist at entering people's minds through their dreams and extracting, or in this case, planting information. The dream world Nolan creates is so exciting and unpredictable that the audience, me included, couldn't care less about the actual story line. Unfortunately, when the magic wears off and the extravagantly overlong climax starts (almost at the midway point), things fall apart.The first problem is the eventual goal of the whole operation is seriously anti-climactic. As far as I could tell, they're trying to break up some obscure monopolistic multi-national company for a rich CEO, who in turn will give them large sums of money and Leo a way back to his kids. Sound under-developed? It is. Nolan never really fleshes it out. He is too busy creating spectacularly slick effects to get caught up in silly things like crucial plot points.When Inception hits its final profligate culmination (the climax inside the climax), I couldn't help but notice how empty it all was. Nolan makes the mistake of thinking multiple things happening at once equals suspense. In an effort to ratchet up the intensity, Nolan piles on at least 5 simultaneous plot-lines that climax at the same time. All this serves to do is suffocate the little suspense that had been built up. There is literally a fifteen minute stretch where Hans Zimmer's deafening score blares and Nolan annoyingly flips through the parallel actions like an ADD-afflicted friend who can't decide what channel to watch. It's mind- numbing, not to mention confusing as hell. One of these little subplots is particularly ridiculous and consists of a guy running around a snowbound bunker shooting people for the whole 15 minutes. Cutting-edge techno thriller? At this point, I was thinking more along the lines of a Roger Moore Bond flick.For all its structural faults, the single most damning aspect of Inception is its complete lack of heart or emotion. The one remotely human thread in the film deals with Leo and his mysterious dead wife. This thread is drawn out to excess and becomes more and more incomprehensible as the movie progresses. Inception seems to delight in keeping the audience in the dark regarding if Leo's wife is real or just a projection of his subconscious. Inception thinks it's awfully clever, but it's hard to feel emotion towards characters that you're not even sure exist. Near the end, I found the dialog between the unhappy couple completely devoid of meaning, made worse by Nolan attempting to give it resonance through close ups of people crying and a climaxing score.Despite the fact that the majority of this review deals with Inception's shortcomings, I actually like the movie as a whole. For all of its faults, I was grudgingly won over through Inception's pure style and visceral power. Nolan occasionally strikes brilliance, especially in an early scene where a dream explodes around Ellen and Leo in slow-motion virtuosity. This movie is not the genius many will claim, but it's not so bad either. Give it a shot, just don't expect to dream about it afterwards.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Smartest Film of The Year!,"Inception is the Smartest film of the YearINCEPTION (PG-13) Directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins and The Dark Knight) Inception is the smartest film you will see all year. It never plays down to the audience, in fact, it assumes the audience is intelligent. Inception tells the story of Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) as a thief with the rare ability to enter people's dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage but has also cost him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone's mind. If he succeeds, it will be the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb's every move.This movie is challenging, but always in a fun and inventive way that keeps you captivated. It is an updated 40's crime drama with a technological twist that just works.After the fight scene in the hallway, you will agree with me that Christopher Nolan will no doubt take home a few Oscars this year. Sound Design, Cinematography, best Original Screenplay, Director and Film unless something monumental is released between now and then.One scene alone should get Nolan the Oscar, and that being the city folding back on itself.Most films this year are like sitting down to a bowl of potato chips, Inception is like sitting down to the juiciest thickest most filling steak dinner you've had in years.

More than just an aMAZEing movie,"Only a small handful of directors have the ability to make an audience wait on pins and needles for their next NON sequel release. For me, i cannot remember the last time i was this excited for a movie i know virtually nothing about. Now i know i may be speaking on my own here, but director Christopher Nolan very well may be the best director of our generation. Because the guy has not missed so far. ""Memento"", ""The Prestige"", The Batman Series......the guy is a loose cannon who fires nothing but cinematic gold. As time goes on, he only seems to get better and better. Hopefully he can continue the re-occurring trend.Okay, let me get this off my chest, because it feels like an alien ready to burst out of my chest........this is easily one of the 10 best movies i have ever seen in my entire life. And that is not because i built this up in my mind or bought into the hype generated around this film, because everything i thought this movie was going to be, fell short of what it actually was about 20 minutes into it. This movie is cinematic genius at it's best, plain and simple. We have been due for a movie like this for a loooonnngggg time. And i don't mean this year, or the recent string of poor movies that have been released......i mean we are due for a movie that actually changes the way we look at movies. Now i know one would be quick to say ""Well wait a minute, Avatar already did that."". But that is where you would be wrong. James Cameron gave us a feast with ""Avatar"". This movie cooks you an entire Thanksgiving dinner.I could honestly sit here and try as hard as i could to try and describe the movie to you, and it wouldn't make a lick of sense because the movie is beyond in-depth. Case in point.....you remember the first time you saw the first ""Matrix"", and how complex and deep the plot was. Well, in words, this movie makes that idea look like ""Kindergarden Cop"". No disrespect to ""The Matrix"" at all, but this movie is probably the most in-depth, detailed, complex, and entertaining movie ever created by man.And that's all Nolan seems to do. He creates these scripts that almost take a life of their own. You get a glimpse of it in ""Memento"", and you certainly see it in action with ""The Prestige""......how the actual plot outline and story, is the actual trick. In this movie, it deals with mazes, and in turn, the whole movie is like a giant maze that you try and figure out.But that's where Nolan's true genius comes in. Through out the entire picture, he gives you these little clues as to whats going on, like a puzzle, and he shows you how they all get put together, rather than putting it together for you. He leaves it up to the audience to do so. And that's what makes this movie great, because he challenges the audience like no other movie i have ever seen.And speaking of things i have never seen. In order for a movie written this well to work, it must be shot in the same fashion. And Nolan, once again, out does himself. If you are a fan of cinematography, as i am as well, then this movie, literally, is your wet dream. Talking about these elaborate dream sequences is one thing, but seeing them in action is beyond anything you have ever seen on the silver screen. Throughout the entire film, i kept taking a napkin to my face to wipe the clumps of drool that were collecting at the bottom of my jaw.Bottom Line, this is a movie i could write a novel about, and it certainly deserves that attention. To pretty much sum it up, if you want to see the movie that is going to win best picture of the year, go and see this movie. If you want to see one of the best movies in the past 10 years, go and see this movie. If you want to see a movie that will pretty much change your method of thinking, then go and see this movie. God only knows how many movies i have seen in my lifetime, but i can say with complete just, that this is certainly one of the 10 best i have EVER seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Requires Concentration,"An incredibly unique film which deserves its plaudits purely for the intelligent world created. Whilst extremely complex, the 'science' allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part, although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point, for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene. It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.Visually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling. Having said that, it is really one of a kind, at least at this level, and so everyone should see Inception, if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nolan plays with a tense Narrative,"I just saw inception last night and absolutely loved it. Everything is top-notch. Most of all, like in every Nolan movie, the editing is crisp. There is no room for even a smile. Action is unique and highly entertaining; although make a note there is no adrenaline rush during any action scenes. This is where Nolan's problem lies. We would have experienced that missing adrenaline rush if he had taken some time to develop the supporting characters, in order to make us feel for them. The only characters I felt for is Cobb and Mal. Their love for each other is shown beautifully, I personally have never seen a relationship explored in this unique way. The only reason I can think why Nolan didn't spend time on other characters is because of the plot he had to first explain and then execute. The plot is hard to explain let alone execute, Nolan did a very good job given the short amount of time. At the same time he had to make sure he did not loose the audience in confusion. A job well done. Now, what I really like about this movie, is the IDEA. Nolan has this great idea for a movie about dreams. On the surface the movie is loaded with multiple tense narratives, but in the background he's also exploring how powerful the medium of dream can be. Also at the same time he maintains the through-line of the movie. Not letting anyone forget why we are watching this movie, why we should care the protagonist reaches to a conclusion. Without the strong through-line we would be lost like in dreams. I think the best actor in the movie is Marian Cotillard. She plays her part with such a beauty I just can't describe. Leonardo also convinces us to fall for his motivations and makes us want him to accomplish his mission. Joseph Gordon-Lewitt also plays his part brilliantly, he is very straight forward unlike the earlier mentioned actors. The rest of the actors are just fine. Everyone Needs to see this movie if not because it is the best Sci-Fi movie after Matrix, then for the fact that it is the best movie of the year. If only Nolan can make a movie with this tight narrative and make us fall for the characters at the same time; your heart will stop beating. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Inception: A Smart Movie For Ignorant People,"I'm afraid I'm a bit confused. I saw ""Inception"" last night. I had high expectations based on miles of positive ink from reviewers and professional critics, all tripping over themselves to bestow demigod status upon Christopher Nolan. These expectations were dashed to bits within the first thirty minutes of the film, and turned to a kind of dread as I realized what folks these days will accept as ""depth"" in their entertainment. I wish I'd never seen those gushing reviews, I would've enjoyed the film much more.Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan's Batman reboots ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight."" For my money, those were without a doubt the second and third most effective superhero movies to date (sorry, Raimi wins.) The man certainly knows how to keep a story moving along, and he knows how to film action. In the case of The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger provided an emotional lynchpin non-pareil in his Joker portrait, and Nolan milked it for all it was worth. There was real pathos and genuine mortal horror built into the foundation of the film's impressive structure. Also, the fact that it was based on a comic book lowered the bar and allowed the audience to suspend just enough disbelief to allow most of the dorky plot elements to slip through and do their work.Now let's discuss obvious comparisons to an earlier effort in this vein‚Äîthat is, an action movie dolled up to the nines as philosophical treatise. I'll admit that I was never a fan of The Matrix. I thought it was asinine in conception and brutish in execution, even as I admired some of the visual effects and spectacular stunt work. Comparing The Matrix's ridiculous endless ""stream-of-consciousness"" gibberish about free will with, say, Roy Batty's laconic final soliloquy in Blade Runner, is like comparing the Twilight series' moronic teen romantic angst with David Foster Wallace. Unfortunately, Inception had precisely the same effect on me, which is to say very little.Here we find the great and terrible Nolan exploring the tired territory already plundered in countless films of yore, including Hitchcock's Spellbound and 1980's genre pics such as Brain Storm, The Dead Zone, and Dreamscape. The basic premise reads like a dime store sci-fi novel's back cover: ""In the future, we can enter into each other's dreams! Feel the magic of dreams, within dreams, within dreams! Experience the thrill and wonder of miraculous ""Dream Time¬ô."" Oh Boy!"" Within twenty minutes of the film's somewhat intriguing intro, I knew not only how it would end‚ÄîI also pretty much knew how we were getting there. Nolan plays primarily to the back row, and‚Äîno offense, America‚Äîbut we've been slightly dumbed down over the past few decades, and we're much easier as a whole to entertain than we used to be. Look back at a few films of the past with vast, labyrinthine plot structures like Hawk and Faulkner's ""The Big Sleep"", or practically anything by the Coen Brothers. What's defines their deep-impact gravitas, as opposed to the flat and diffuse emotional landscape of Inception? It's character development, pure and simple. In this case, Nolan didn't have a single character ‚Äîespecially the one played with typically earnest gusto by Leo Dicaprio‚Äîwith a plausibly human fatal flaw, foible, or reason for doing¬Ö uh, whatever it was he was doing. We're simply dropped into an alternate universe with rules seemingly invented to favor nerds of any stripe ‚Äîalmost impossibly similar to the one in The Matrix‚Äîand told to hold onto our hats, because here¬Ö we¬Ö go! Except we're not actually GOING anywhere, or at least not anywhere we haven't been a thousand times before.Sorry to rain on the parade of everyone that's ready to lionize C. Nolan as the great white hope of modern blockbuster cinema, but from my vantage, there is no there there. If you want a lesson in basic existential philosophy, take a class at your local community college. You'll get more out of it, and you can keep your textbook as a souvenir. If it's great car chases you're after, rent ""The French Connection,"" or ""Ronin."" In other words, keep your high-octane action movie out of my high-concept art film. These are two tastes that do not go great together. Meanwhile, if Inception somehow does ""become a religion"" in another five years, than I'm reconsidering my continued faith in Hollywood as some kind of egalitarian oracle, where the huddled masses can go to get their myths, and feel the true power of redemption. If this is the kind of movie that will be worshipped from now on, than the god of blockbuster cinema may truly be dead.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What kind of an accomplishment is it to be a born liar ?,"Inception is a lie and like all legitmate hollywoods irregardless of who is doing what to whom there is only the technology that allows this hysterical calculator(that is all this film represents) in this motion picture to perhaps make money.There seems not much more to suggest and that would be if this film made money,? Well did it ? This is what is a most unusual point to all this,and that would be if this particular film did not make money what else is this film doing if in fact it did not make money? What is required to know better or perhaps to truly know well what the viewer is looking at when as a viewer,the viewer as it were watches the motion picture ""Inception"".There is as well another consideration and that is if in fact the very participation in the watching of any motion picture is such an experience as to be a unwholesome experience. I believe it is that(unwholesome) and even more so provides for a disguise so to mislead any who might be drawn for what ever reason to watch such a film or for that matter to watch such are the films of Hollywood,California.There is no degree of involvement in the making of this film that is in fact authentic and as illegitimate that that might sound like it is an illegal search and seizure which allows a thief to be masqueraded as the man with the candy.This film is not new nor is this film what it appears as is as well.The result when viewing such a film is that there is no time that is real nor is there a place as to any particular event is concerned and if that isn't enough there is no definition as to not if there is a capacity to dream but how do we provide the ability to interject another ability that could pass as a dream.This is the handiwork of a masquerade with any here who believe believe not in this motion picture as there is no dreaming there is only the ability to transmit the stimulus with the image that is what masquerades as a ""dream"".It is as well imposed upon the body of the human race so to provide a unmistakable influence.The influence as the film provides such a witness has a goal of influence pure and simple this film is merely more of the same as the same has meant since as it were its inception.It is its invention that is at the source of this worlds ability to influence anything with merely more of the same being all that the viewer will ever be looking at.The inventor as well as the inventors many inventions are all patented and do it is believed remain so.There were some 700 separate inventions with which this unwholesome day in this world occurred when one Nicola Tesla discovered how to bind energy across wide open space many many miles from nowhere including even deepest darkest space.This is the field of regard it is as well the ability to network with many disparaging elements so to influence even say Adolf Hitler(I kid you not).Though 1920 is the year of radio's invention and 1921 the year Berlin radio started to broadcast it was a good time before this point in time that Tesla's inventions and subsequent patents were in place.The better premise would be to know through Tesla's own words as to what capacity does what he invented provide and without to much trouble Tesla's's own misgivings provide for the very problem of being under the influence of a lie.Though this lie was not meant to interfere with the human race that is exactly what has occurred.The money men of Teslas's own day are at the root cause as to the necessity to influence anything outside of an antenna.They remain as perhaps a cog in the wheel that very nearly saw to its conclusion not to long ago.This wasn't Tesla's design this was there influence on his attempt to bind energy that it was not to be unless of course they could extract a measure if you will of revenge upon humanity.This is the masquerade that there is a profit motive in this foreign power as well as an aggression not to be deterred in its inability to be regulated properly.This is an imperfect science which has meted out suffering through this field of regard.(network field)It is this thief in the night and it is as well the exploiter of human flesh that this film is providing the viewer with.This is what this film is up to and it has been such since it inception.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Nutshell Review: Inception,"Action aside, there will be some who will liken this to the Wachowski Brothers' Matrix, given its similarities in combining science fiction with philosophical existentialism issues, with cutting-edge action seemingly beyond its time. Nolan goes one up however, with this attempt as he, like Neo, goes beyond the computerized world of the Matrix, where it's still a construct led by binary ones and zeroes, good and evil battling it out under black and white rules. Rules that one cannot escape from since they are what binds our universe together. Here Nolan goes into that untapped power of the mind, the dream worlds that we create in our subconscious, where the dreamer has everything in his subtle control, where anything goes as far as the imagination dare venture beyond physical limitations and rules.This allowed for such a film to be created from a simple idea with a bank heist premise having its skill-based assembled team break into unsuspecting victims to steal ideas locked away in the mind. Nolan loves to tease and test the audience, not lulling us into complacency, with Inception beginning in the thick of the action with tremendous questions being asked as we try and digest the multitude of information thrown at us, with the whys and the what ifs answered in due course, needing to pay attention to subtle details, ideas and concepts to make the film work.We follow Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his lieutenant Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as information hackers and social engineers of the new age, offering their services as the black and white ops type either to teach corporate honchos how to defend against like-minded and skilled peers, or to be engaged by these same industrialists to steal information from the competition. With the promise of being able to return to the USA without being arrested at immigration, Cobb accepts the challenge posed by the Japanese Saito (Ken Watanabe), to assemble an A-Team to plant a seed of thought and an idea, known as an inception, into his business enemy Robert Fischer Jr (Cillian Murphy). It's an almost impossible task, but the promise to see his kids again makes Cobb recruit the likes of Ariadne the architect (Ellen Page), Yusuf the chemist (Dileep Rao), and Eames (Tom Hardy) the thief.Like the layers that the characters navigate through, the film is equally layered with engaging subplots that expand the depth and breadth of the characters involved, the largest one involving the mystery behind the disappearance of Cobb's wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) who now lives only in Cobb's subconscious, and always find a way to thwart his grand plans, making Cobb more of a liability with this unspoken handicap that gets worse as the challenges facing the team grows. The story unfolds like a planning of that perennial big bank heist job, with conflicts between members, the building of skills and the meticulous planning all coming together with so many external variables, that seeks to test the skills of every member to the extreme. And that's what makes the film so terribly engaging, while dealing with emotions and romance, obsession and selfishness, which if I may jest, seem to reflect a side of modern day relationships where sometimes one can get tired and need to seek an exit from constantly being with someone else, 24 hours a day, with nobody around.DiCaprio with his name sprawled over the poster above the other cast, delivers that pitch perfect flawed lead character that Nolan has a knack to create, and brought to life by DiCaprio's performance, having the actor showcase a wide range of emotions as a man desperate to hold onto what he deems dear, with hidden secrets so jealously guarded, living and repeating his pain through the constant re-visits to his memory, breaking all rules of the game as told to his prot√©g√© Ariadne. Ellen Page holds her own against the seasoned thespian in two scenes which is bound to generate some gasps for the special effects generated as she picks up the necessary skills for the job, in what would be a Neo-like discovery of how seductive a limitless world could be.I can't rave enough of how Nolan got to elicit wonderful performances from his cast of stars, where little nuances can mean so much, without even saying a word. A flick of the eyebrow, a glance at someone, paint that picture to tell a thousand words. Better yet, Nolan's own ability to hold your attention with his storytelling ability and delivering no less than four stunningly created realms all happening simultaneously, each with another as a constraint or a condition to kickstart a chain of events. You're always left guessing whether the team can accomplish their mission, and there's always that constant threat of danger that seeks to derail everything they thought of in their combined state of comatose, What George Lucas does with those simultaneous theatres of war in the finale of each of his Star Wars films, Nolan does it better with just this one, as he puts that grip around you as we flit from one stage to another. There's absolutely nothing quite like the experience of having seen something great, and want to savour it all over again soon.Inception is best experienced on the big screen, and Christopher Nolan has done the ultimate in performing just what the characters of Inception had set out to do, sowing the seed of a premise and concept that holds so much promise, then delivering that promise with aplomb, so much so that you'll want to continue living in that world created by the cognitive senses interpreting what's on screen, then fantasizing on it a lot more with the subconscious. Inception is definitely one of the best this year, if not THE best film of 2010 thus far. Don't miss this film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Brilliant Piece,"There is no way ""Inception"" will be a bad movie because it was directed by Christopher Nolan. There are many words to describe this movie and those are: mind-bending, imaginative, exciting, overwhelming, entertaining, and awesome. ""Inception"" might be the only movie this summer that has an original concept.""Inception"" is very unique and it is fresh to everybody. The visuals were overwhelming. The action scenes are awesome. The CGI effects were realistic and eye candy. The story is interesting and mind-bending.The performances were great. Leonardo DiCaprio is still a great actor. Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe are one of the best parts of the movie. Cillian Murphy is disappointing though.

"The pieces are amazing, but the whole is ""only"" very good","The pieces of the movie are amazing:
1. Hans Zimmer's music is hauntingly beautiful, probably my favorite movie score ever.2. The premise is unique and fascinating
3. The special effects are amazing and don't distract (unlike some Pierce Brosnan Bond movies). They fit into the plot perfectly.4. The acting is very good.But the assemled pieces make the whole only very good, not amazing: The movie is just too big, and they had to edit it to cut it down to essential info and scenes, resulting in a slightly unnatural flow that feels like trying to drink from a fire hose shoved in your mouth. A mild, subtle infodump feeling arises at times. There are no natural lulls or pauses to digest info. The first time watching you will feel absolutely lost for the first 45 minutes or so unless you read spoilers first, due to a combination of that flow and some out of sequence story telling. The 2nd time watching will be much more enjoyable than the first... it is that lesser enjoyment the first time through that keeps it from being amazing, knocking it down to just very good. There are two main storylines, one mostly in the present, the other about the main character's past...found myself wondering if the latter could have been less prominent or even cut to focus more on the former.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Gimmicks For Sale,"Brilliant technical wizardry. Heady, at least apparently so. A ride more than a movie but a movie none the less. Chris Nolan is rapidly becoming the director of his generation and I'm longing to find out what is he trying to say. He has established his technical power again and again but if I think of ""Memento"" for instance I remember the gimmick but not what the story was really about. I suspect the same will be said of ""Inception"". I'm not putting down, I'm just wondering. I left the theater full of questions and nobody could actually give me any answers. I'm not talking about the plot but at the way Christopher Nolan chose to tell the story. Leonardo Di Caprio is acquiring some extra gravitas as an adult presence on the screen.Loved Cillian Murphy, I always do. Riveted by Tom Hardy. Enchanted by Marion Cotillard.

There is virtually no character development, the plot is overly complicated and riddled with holes and contradictions. Frankly you don't need to suspend disbelief so much has have it surgically removed and flushed down the toilet.

Not all the hype suggests but still an enjoyable action thriller built on a good concept and encourages thought afterwards,"The important thing to start out with is to distance yourself from the hype about this film because it will not help you when watching it, nor is any of it totally justified. It seems that any mainstream film (especially at summertime) that manages to at least do something different or clever will be hailed as a masterpiece simply because it is not Transformers 2. So watching it expecting to be amazed is probably the wrong state of mind to be in. Likewise it is probably not great to be expecting something impossible to follow, because again the film is very clearly constructed and even when action is occurring across several ""levels"" at once, I still found it easy to follow.The film is a thriller and, like many great thrillers it is one that is built on an imaginative and clever concept. The world of dream infiltration is well constructed and is also well delivered to the audience; some people near me were muttering and asking confused questions throughout, but personally I found it easy to follow for the most part ‚Äì and not because I'm smart but because the film does a good job of bringing the viewer into the ideas and concept. In terms of being an action movie, the second half of the film does pick this up well and the race against time across all of the dream levels, with the editing bringing it all together well so that you don't lose what is happening and indeed the movement of time and the importance of the relative events are clearly understood to produce tension. Although the dream worlds are a bit too ""ordinary"" at times (most of our dreams are filled with things that don't make any sense or have echoes of things, rather than detailed cityscapes and gun battles) there is creativity in the visual design and in particular a Matrix-esquire battle in a spinning corridor is thrilling to watch.To its credit the stepping up of the action aspect does not mean that the ideas that got us here are abandoned because they are not. The importance of Cobb's subconscious and in particular his own gnawing guilt over the death of his wife initially appears to be just a way of having a repeatable ""baddie"" turning up in various places throughout the film, but actually she is well used to introduce doubt and alternative interpretations to the film. As everywhere else, the ending of the film was met with groans that there would not a confirmation of the ending. Personally I think that ""was the real level actually a dream"" is just an idea planted by the director to keep the audience from simply finishing the film and walking away from it and that the presented reality was actual reality. I can understand why some have disliked this because it could appear like Nolan is going ""or was it?"" without providing much more than the question, but I choose to see this as just another tease, which he is perfectly allowed to do since the whole film is about trying to get others to doubt their reality and change their own minds by themselves (although not really).The cast deliver well. DiCaprio manages to produce an engaging character who emotionally makes sense and it is his performance that helps the deeper material in his subconscious work well and be more accessible to the viewer. Gordon-Levitt is memorable for his action scenes but he is also a good presence generally even if he has a lot less to do. Page provides the viewer with someone to ""come in"" with and she works that angle well. Hardy, Watanabe and Rao round out the team well. Some of the bigger names had the potential to be distractions by virtue of ""oh look its x"" but Caine, Berenger, Haas and Postlethwaite didn't really do that even if their actual screen times were minimal compared to the recognisability of their faces. Cotillard works very well to have her character vary across levels and contexts and I liked her better than I thought I would.I'm not in agreement that Inception is a classic perfect film but it is a very good one. If anything the elevation of this film is more to do with how average and uninspiring the vast majority of films released are, but I suppose that the success of this one is a good thing in some ways to maybe counter that. The concept and ideas are well constructed and presented to the audience and the film itself is not hard to follow but does challenge the viewer to do the one thing that a blockbuster normally doesn't ‚Äì pay attention. Doesn't quite live up to the hype but it is still a very good and engaging film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing!!!!!,"I got the opportunity to see this movie a week in advance :). Let me just say it is no disappointment in every witch way! As most of Leonardo's movies are good this one is even better! it will blow your mind, so yes i recommend everyone should see it even if you like Leo's work you will still enjoy this movie. Moments in the film keep you at the edge of your seat waiting to find out what happens next. I fell in love with this movie because of its originality and the imagination that took in to realizing this movie, Christopher Nolan has yet again made another great movie. All the cast members did an amazing job with Inception. Thank you for making this movie, I'm sure i will see it plenty more times!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's true: Christopher Nolan can do no wrong!,"I am not the first to claim this, I read that on a Prestige or Batman Begins board. But now I am in complete agreement with the one who said it. Inception can arguably be Nolan's best work yet, improving upon the juggernaut which was The Dark Knight. But before I comment on Inception, I want to review Nolan's work first, shedding light on the true genius he is.It all started with a short called Doodlebug. I won't spoil anything, because the film is about three minutes long, but Nolan starts one of his trademarks: the twist. I don't have a link but I know it is online and a few searches should yield a result of the short. If you like Nolan and his work, check it out.The next was Following, an ultra low budget film (around $6000), about a young man who follows people just to see what they do and where they are going. He also meets a character named Cobb... interesting name. It features Nolan's next genius trademark--the use of non-linear storytelling. Overall a nice low budget film worth spending an hour and ten minutes on. I recommend it.Now on to the complete mind f**k that was Memento. It is this film that Nolan perfects his non-linear storytelling. Shown in almost complete reverse, Memento follows a man named Leonard with a rare condition in which he cannot form new memories. We learn early on he only lives for revenge. HIGHLY recommend if you have not seen it yet. It really sets the standard for non-linear storytelling.Insomnia was Nolan's third full length film, and yet manages to add something else: an all-star cast. It features Academy Award winners Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, and finally, one of the best actors of his generation (maybe ever), Al Pacino. Pacino plays Detective Will Dormer sent to Alaska to investigate a murder. Again, plot twists and non-linear structure are used in this film. It is my least favorite of Nolan's films, but that doesn't take away anything from it. It is still very good.Now to the film that put Nolan on the map: Batman Begins. The Batman franchise was all but dead in the water until Nolan got his hands on it. Now it sets the standards for super-hero movies. Non-linear storytelling, a great cast, and plot twists are all perfectly placed in this. I personally view it as the second best super-hero movie ever made, and is, in my opinion, a great movie altogether.To break up the Batman films, Nolan did a little movie called The Prestige. Telling the story of two magicians, they are first friends, then become rivals, then end up as enemies. Starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine, another all-star cast is present. The non-linear structure in this movie is genius, so be prepared to think a little bit. Overall a great film and one of my favorites.Now for the one everyone knows. I cannot say enough about The Dark Knight. One thing I can say is it was the first movie to exceed my expectations when they were that high. Heath Ledger's joker is my favorite character ever portrayed on screen, and will be for some time. His Academy Award is well deserved. His passing is such a shame. And although The Dark Knight did not get the Best Picture nomination, or win, it certainly had effects on the Academy. By public outrage, the 2009 Academy Awards featured ten Best Picture Nominations instead of the usual five. Without The Dark Knight, movies like Inglourious Basterds, District 9, and yes, Avatar would have never come close to being nominated. It was definitely the best film of 2008, the best superhero movie ever made, and my favorite movie ever.Until about forty-five minutes ago. That's when Inception ended and I sat staring at the credits to what I had just witnessed. I am still thinking about how the movie ended and it's safe to say I will be watching it at least two more times on the big screen. It surpasses The Dark Knight in terms of how big it is by a long shot. The acting was stellar by everyone, especially Leonardo DiCaprio. It's a bit early, but I think a Best Actor Nomination should be in order. Also another trademark of Nolan, the casting of Michael Caine. It's the fourth consecutive film to feature him.Now on to the best aspect of this film, the storytelling. Again, the non-linear structure is used, and is as perfect as it gets. Every shot has meaning. All the dialog by the characters is relevant. Some may complain it is lengthy, but if anything was cut, things would start to be confusing. I could write page after page about how good the story was, but you have to see it to truly experience it. The tag line 'Your mind is the scene of the crime' is all you should really know going into this movie. I personally avoided (painfully, i might add) every trailer, synopsis, and review i could of Inception before I saw it.This movie is not for everyone however. It is not a late night, brainless action movie like Crank or 2012. It requires the audience to have smart brain-think. So on a scale of 1-10, Inception is about a 12. This, without question, the best movie of the year. If The Academy snubs Nolan out of this Oscar, I think I might kill someone. He should have the Best Director award in the bag. However, to truly enjoy it, you have to pay attention. It's complex, but never confusing. If you enjoy a great thriller that is anything but straightforward, this is the movie for you. And be prepared to use your mind. =]And that's all I got. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It is best experienced with thrilled expectations -- and you will not be disappointed. The acting by all cast members is terrific, the story line is amazing, and the special effects are breathtaking. I am so honored to have attended a sneak preview of this movie. The theater was packed without one empty seat and the crowd was so into the movie, it was silent until the end. Their reaction at the end was loud and vocal. I will admit that I got a terrible tension headache from the intensity of being a part of this experience. But I will never ever forget the movie. I also must admit there were several times while watching the movie that I wanted someone to explain things to me (I commented to my husband -- WTF?) but rode it out, thinking, comprehending and understanding. I do think that younger people will ""get"" the story better than older people, since they play multi-tiered level games, so the concept won't be so difficult to wrap their brains around it.

Brilliantly creative and well realized.,"Inception is a movie you just have to see before you judge it. Maybe you should even see it twice. There are a lot of complex ideas here, and the movie spends a good chunk of time explaining them in the opening act.
That main idea though, is something very unique and creative that is brought to life by outstanding filmmaking, everything you'd expect from a Christopher Nolan film. Writing and performances are also great across the board. The only problem with Inception is in ones own interpretation. Some may says it's pretentious and the ideas presented acctualy aren't fully understood by the creators and/or don't make sense. But I think that's a terrible angle to approach the film. It's Sci-Fi, you're not supposed to over-anylasie it in that way. It's meant to plant thought provoking ideas in your head, which I beleive it does very well, not be a perfectly logical and plausible idea.

"Not bad, but overrated","Why are people going mental over this Matrix/Paprika wannabe? It's undeservingly credited for way to many things. Maybe I'm being too harsh since it's the best blockbuster in the last two years, but lets be honest. The first half of the movie is drowning in clich√©s and the rule 'show, don't tell' is not being utilized at all. Am I the only one who finds those tedious dialogues when they explain the whole plot (as if we were ten year olds) - really annoying? The real people in those situations would talk and react completely differently. That makes the character interactions and conversations barely believable and just empty.Also, actors who play Saito and Mal are really destroying any credibility of the drama and tension movie has. Saito (besides being a Morpheus wannabe) always talks as if he was simply happy he remembered the lines. And why, oh why do they have such unnatural, bad and forced accents? Ellen Page was a bad choice too (another clich√© - younger student learns everything sensei has to say in 2 min and then teaches HIM a lesson). DiCaprio wasted his talent here, his powerful acting was ruined by the forced tension of the movie and a lousy soundtrack (which apparently never stops).The second half of the movie was better and combined with the end gave a certain satisfaction in terms of mental food. Nolan really is a master of plot and king of moments - unfortunately this is obviously becoming his biggest weakness. The overall impression is: it could have been a LOT better. It's not awful, but giving it a 10 and calling it a benchmark is just ridiculous.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Something is missing...,"Call me ""dumb"", I do not care, because I have my own mind and experience and I know by now that I am not. My only reserve is that maybe I should see it twice, or that this is not the moment for me to have seen it( As is with reading books, today one can't stand it , tomorrow it makes perfect sense). Apart from this, a movie being an experience destined to consume itself at the maximum in one ""kick"", after this Inception experience, I feel that something is really missing here. What is the idea of this movie? What is it trying to express? In what system of beliefs is all this taking place? Because, apart from the famous cast, the good performances, the special effects that are everywhere and the incessant and disturbing gun noises, I do not see what am I supposed to get enriched with through watching this movie? OK, the idea of conscious dreaming is centuries-old, so is the idea of ""staging"" the life or the universe(no need to mention the link to Matrix, etc), but who would be the ""dreamer"" if we extrapolated to our lives? Because the thought of a world meant just for corporations and ""important"" individuals, I do not like. So, in a person's life, any person, how are the Inception ideas fitting in? Are we to look and see who ""dreams"" for us, and the movie couldn't put this idea bluntly? Are we dealing with an explanation for wave function collapse, controlled consciously by some skilled to do so and implementing during our sleep? I feel the need to say, ""please explain yourself"". One cannot mount such a giant of a movie (publicity, effects, cast and so), and in the end leave you with a bigger blur than before such ideas occurred. I would say it is either a case of snobbish commercialism that is not backed up by enough understanding and research, or a case of intricate mind and ideas that have no clarity in expressing themselves. It is an exercise for the brain, I give it that. But in the light of too much gratuitous violence, too less contoured universe of the movie, too crowded action, too soapy emotional effects (the passed away wife, the uncommunicative rich father) and too high praise that it deserves (c'mon, this is the new Matrix? Are we going back as the time goes by?, I feel deeply not pleased.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Christopher Nolan is genius,"Nolan is careful never to let the scope of the film overwhelm the human element and this is a key reason Inception works as well as it does. The acting, from a great ensemble led by DiCaprio, is as good as it gets. In terms of sheer originality, ambition and achievement, Inception is the movie of the summer, the movie of the year and the movie of our dreams. world need directors like Nolan,Spielberg,Cameron, As with his previous movies, Nolan displays a knack for choosing actors who can best embody the characters in his films. While DiCaprio's role here may be reminiscent of that in his earlier Shutter Island, there's no question that he anchors the movie with a perfectly calibrated performance that is equal parts intense and heartfelt. The rest of the supporting characters fill out their roles just as vividly- Joseph Gordon-Levitt radiates confidence and suavity, Ellen Page displays suitable wit and grit, and in particular Marion Cotillard exudes both sultriness and danger in an edgy yet eventually heartbreaking performance.But ""Inception"" is Nolan's vision through and through- and in fact, a visionary director and a master filmmaker at that. Many years Nolan spent refining his screenplay, and it shows in the great detail and complexity that makes ""Inception"" both an intellectual and visceral enjoyment- just take the names of the various characters, each of which have a special significance. With ""Inception"", Nolan invites you to open your mind to possibilities- possibilities of alternate realities, of complexities beyond the conscious mind to grasp and most importantly, of the power of imagination. It is that rare gem of a film that is so multi-layered, so profound and so fascinating that you'll want to experience it again immediately after you've seen it- just so you can fully appreciate its genius.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Amazing,"I've never done a review before so be gentle, but having attended the Irish premiere of Inception last night I felt compelled to write and tell people to ""go and see this movie"". If you only see one picture all year make sure this is it.As people have stated dream movies have been done before however not with this style and 'complicated simplicity' (you'll understand what I mean when you see it).The acting by everyone is first rate, if the emotional story of Cobb and Mal wasn't believable then the film would fall asunder however Di Caprio/Coitillard carry it off to perfection. Everyone else in the ensemble cast is terrific with particular mention to Tom Hardy (get this guy more work).Unlike many reviewers I didn't find the story difficult to follow although rapt attention is essential, and Nolan has delivered a story which doesn't attempt to talk down to you as I felt with the Matrix instead it draws you in and delivers in the last hour probably the finest piece of film making I've ever seen.The end of the movie was met with rapturous applause and I realized my hands were shaking I had tears running down my face and sweat running down my back.

"Didactic, but nonetheless a good movie.","Inception has a problem that I cannot bear: the constant that someone comes to explain the laws and how that world works. The creation of the character of Ellen Page (Ariadne) was for the sole purpose of explaining that to moviegoers. Not that it's bad, but at certain moments it seems like the movie becomes more class at school, to know how that universe works, instead of the characters in this movie live the adventure for themselves. In this aspect the film is didactic. And the space for the imagination is limited. In this aspect everything in this film is chewed, everything explained, where are the possibilities? I do not want someone to explain the universe, I want to see the characters live and react in this universe.Yes the ending leaves open the question whether that is a dream or reality, but it is a cheap gimmick instead of letting them our imaginations fly. If at the end of the movie the experience of the characters was a dream, so it was waste of two and a half hour, at least the Matrix shows the characters in the real world, and that it was not a dream inside a dream. The tension and time invested would not be a waste of timeNot that it spoils the experience of the film, but it disturbs in some parts, mainly in the middle of the film, when the group is preparing for the assault. The concept is good, but it should be presented in a simpler way. Clearly Nolan was very ambitious in the concept of this film. But Nolan is quite integral in the proposal of his films, and he tries to put unknown concepts to the general public in such a cohesive way, even with the problem of trying to explain everything and other problems of pace are easily forgiven. Nolan tries to do his best in each of his films as if his movie was his last, as if his life depends on it. A great honesty on the part of Nolan, and this I can and I want to enjoy. Nolan is such an honest guy and scores points with me. It's the difference between the lousy movie director and an excellent director. The bad elements of Inception are not enough to spoil its qualities. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works.Not that the idea of Inception is innovative, this idea has been copied many times in other works (Paprika, Synecdoche New York and The Matrix are the most practical and common examples). But it's the way Nolan puts these ideas in the big budget blockbuster. Let's be honest here. Smaller or lower budget films are not seen by the general public due to the absence of of large production values (a great soundtrack, great locations for filming or great special effects, etc). See these ideas or concepts in a great Hollywood blockbuster made with such quality and care, it is amazing. And these ideas are embedded in the drama of the film in such a cohesive and exemplary way; it is applauding Nolan's professional integrity. This is why Nolan movies are so well received, he tries to put in these Hollywood blockbusters something more, something common in indie or smaller films, but with the financial aspect of the great studios to provide a better technical quality.Obviously there is quality on this movie; the large parallel sequences are exemplary. The parallel between the Van sequences, the hotel with the Joseph Gordon-Levitt (when character is awake in the elevator), the peak at the military base in the snow and the desolate city of Cobb and Mal is almost perfectly made with an all- encompassing soundtrack. Of course the sequences of action are lousy . And many dialogues are very weak. Two weaknesses in Nolan's movies.Bad things come with the good things. I suspect that the bad action scenes of Inception and Dark Knight were the reason why Nolan turned DKR into an action movie instead of trying to tell a good story, Nolan's ego should have been hurt by the criticism as he directs his action scenes in these two films. Particularly Inception and the action sequence in the snow with Tom Hardy. Too bad, sorry.But the performances are amazing, particularly Marion Cotillard as Mal. There are many layers in the various characters which Nolan conducts with mastery and the way they are inserted into the film is almost perfectly. Particularly in the initial sequence (which I thought would be a scene to showcase special effects, and Nolan proved me wrong). Or in the scene between Ariadne and Cobb, when Cobb tries to explain how his wife dies, and then discovered new layers of the character to reveal that in fact, he did have to do with the death of his wife. Of course this will be important to the outcome of the film. It is this ability to put the scenes and the flashbacks in certain key moments of the plot that Nolan shows much quality, and one of his long lists of virtues.Inception is a movie like any movie; it has its flaws, but also its virtues. But, for me the qualities overlap the defects, and in the end the movie is well worth watching. But is its legendary statute being worthy? If Inception was released in the 1980's would it have the same impact in that decade, as it had in 2010? Currently the commercial movies in Hollywood are in crisis. We live in an era of remakes, superhero movies and franchise fatigue without the studios or directors making an effort to improve with originality or at least with a little more original concepts. Inception's credit could be lower if today's Hollywood was not in such a decadent state. But nonetheless, Inception is still a good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Two Words To Describe ""Inception""","Christopher Nolan, the visionary director behind ""Batman Begins"", ""The Dark Knight"", and ""Memento"", has finally brought to life his project of more than twenty years. Featuring a cast of some of the world's greatest stars, both young and old, and having been filmed in locations in six different countries, ""Inception"", in the words of the L.A. Times, ""blends the best of traditional and modern film-making"".Leonardo DiCaprio headlines as Cobb, a con man who specializes in stealing people's secrets from within their very minds. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""3rd Rock from the Sun"") gives a remarkable performance as his partner in crime. Tom Hardy (""Star Trek: Nemesis""), Dileep Rao (""Avatar""), and Ellen Page (""Juno"") round out a team of highly talented ""intrusion experts"". They are hired by Ken Watanabe (""The Last Samurai"") to do the impossible: rather than steal an idea from their target's (Cillian Murphy, ""28 Days Later ..."") mind, they are to plant an idea through a process called ""inception"".There are many words to describe this movie. ""Crime drama"", ""sci-fi thriller"", ""international intrigue"", and ""mind-bending masterpiece"" all would certainly be on the list. Nolan keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very last second, barely giving you time to breathe as you try to peel the layers and decide what is real and what is illusion. There are many questions to answer as you follow the characters ever deeper into the world of dreams. The greatest questions, however, surround Cobb himself and his motives.Cobb is not your typical thief taking on ""one last job"". While his partner believes Cobb is just hoping to complete the job so he can see his children again, Page's character begins to suspect that he is seeking something more. She soon learns that Cobb is haunted by the memory of his dead wife, played by Marion Cotillard (""Public Enemies""), who does far more than simply distract him from his duties. After all, in the world of the subconscious, even the smallest distraction can take you in directions you never expected to go.Like the layers of the dream worlds the team constructs for their marks, this movie is crafted to convey one story; one single point that comes delivered wrapped in marvelous visual effects, pulse-pounding action sequences, intelligent dialogue, and even a fair amount of humor. That single point, the two words I would use to describe this movie, is ""love story"". The great mystery of ""Inception"" is the story of Cobb and his family, his wife and children, what he has done to them, and how far he will go to recover them. While most reviewers may focus on the spectacular special effects or the unique storytelling elements, I believe the central theme of ""Inception"" is the unraveling of Cobb's character. Everything else is a vehicle for this storyline.As a writer, I think this is one of the finest examples of good storytelling I've seen. As a moviegoer, I can't think of a better way to spend my money. I would recommend ""Inception"" to anyone, be they seeking an action movie, an art film, a mystery thriller, or a science-fiction wonder ride. For me, it is all those things and more; but at its heart, it is a poignant love story.(Read original review here: http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=419359136543)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Inception, 1 inch deep and a mile wide","Inception is right up my alley. I was expecting a thinking person's thriller with a bit of sci fi. C Nolan is well known - I loved the Dark Knight and Batman Begins. He's quality and tells a slow boiling story that pays off a concept. But whew, Inception... wow what a stinker.There's no question that this production staff and the cast took this project and themselves very seriously. It oozes production values. Too bad it lost me in the first 10 minute when I had no idea what was happening. And not in a good way, like other thrillers. I had absolutely no desire to understand the clap-trap these unlikeable characters were spouting. The kid from Third Rock, wow he thinks he's quite the bad boy. Fail.Anyway, instead of something that held my interest, this movie simply frustrated me. Inception is a ponderous, self-important, vacuous movie. It's empty, all presentation, no flavor. It makes no sense and I didn't even want to keep straining to figure it out. It doesn't unfold like ""The Game"" where you're dying to know how it comes out, clue by clue. I even stuck with Shutter Island and didn't really like that one, but it was way, way, way better than this movie. And it's not because I don't have patience for high-concept. It's not ambiguous or thought-provoking it just ends.Still, I would recommend others see this film and judge for themselves. Others seem to find this movie very intense and deep. I just don't get it. Personal preference, but there are quite a few like me where metaphysical pseudo sci-fi speeches, and lots of rules about what you can and can't do are just frustrating and not a nice evening's entertainment. I think I'll go watch The Game or Matrix again. It's been a while and I need to get the sour taste of this movie out of my mouth.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Incredibly made, mind bending and an excellent film to rewatch over and over.","To be fair, the movie may be a bit hard to follow without any prior knowledge or for those who struggle with information overloads. However i found it an excellent film that kept me thinking and engaged. Few movies are this engaging as many feel like you- well, are watching a film. With Inception, you feel immersed in the film.It is definitely a very thought provoking film and was very well shot. One of the best movies ever made, if I must say. It is an extremely clever film with an fairly original plot. The entire idea of dreams within dreams is fascinating and exciting as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Proof That Classics Are Still Being Made Today.,"Once in a while, a film comes along that not only takes the cinematic world by storm, but also rewrites the rules of movie making altogether. Christopher Nolan's latest project, Inception, is one such achievement. Nolan had previously directed the masterpiece, The Dark Knight. That film gave us a whole new look into what a Batman film could be like. But with Inception, he creates something so new; so fresh and original that you wonder if even he fully understood it.Inception is a film about dreams. Dreams are complex, surreal, and full of mystery; all traits that this film also exhibits. In Inception, Leonardo DiCaprio plays an agent who penetrates people's dreams. He is after their secrets, and the dream state is when people have their mental guard down the most. The problem is that anything can happen in a dream. We've all had dreams so we know this. This movie introduces the notion of what it would be like if other people were actually allowed in our dreams. Using the best special effects available, the production team has done their absolute best to portray dreams in a way that makes sense to the viewer, but still comes off as fantastic and incredible.I should warn you: the plot is not easy to follow. One critic who reviewed the movie wondered if it was too smart for general audiences to grasp. Personally, I found that regardless of how complex the storyline got, it pulled off the miracle of not seeming overwrought or unmanageable. This is clearly the trait of a director who has mastered his craft. However, a captain is only as good as his crew. The cast of this film seemed quite committed to the job at hand, and much of the supporting cast (which includes such talented actors and actresses as Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Caine, and Marion Cotillard) did just as great a job as DiCaprio. All this just goes to show how every little detail was treated with equal care and how flawless the whole production is.Some film buffs will argue that classics ceased to to be made years ago. I certainly don't agree with them, and this film is my proof. It also proves that even the biggest summer blockbusters can be intelligent and artistic. If The Dark Knight was the revolution, than Inception is the reign established afterward.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A head spinning, action packed, 2 1/2 hours of mind-bending Awesomeness!","All I could manage to say as I left the theater was, ""That was awesome!"" This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. From the story to the acting to the action, there wasn't anything lacking from this film. There are so many layers, not only in the plot but in the depth of story telling that go on in this film. I don't know how he fit so much story into a couple of hours and still it can make perfect sense. This is a movie you can watch 10 times, and I probably will, and still catch something you didn't see before. It was so easy to get caught up and forget you were in a theater and not actually in the room with the characters. I can't remember the last time I was so immersed in a film. I actually had to remind myself occasionally that it was only a movie. I loved everything about this. The action sequences were just amazing, I don't think these things have ever been done in film before. It was like watching a perfectly done live action video game. The mind twisting story keeps you guessing till the end, and even after. There was even a tragic but heart warming love story in the middle. To fit all of this into a film is just incredible. My advice to anyone, is to find the biggest screen in a theater you can and go see this movie. I don't even think an IMax screen is big enough for this gnarly piece of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Christopher Nolan continues his climb to the top... of the most overrated directors list,"If there was ever a film to label as ""overrated"", it would be The Dark Knight. If there was ever another film to label as ""overrated"", it would be Inception. I just don't understand what it is about Christopher Nolan's films but they have the tendency to receive large amounts of unwarranted and undeserved praise.While they are very well-made films, they are for the most part nothing more than entertaining popcorn flicks (Memento being the one exception). Popcorn flicks of the up-most quality but nothing truly memorable or deep. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, lets get on with the review.Now, basically, Inception is a heist film with a twist. The heists take place inside of a dream, thus allowing for some creative and tricky special effects to be pulled off. These effects are pretty amusing to watch, most notably a scene where the gravity of a hallway is shifting and the two actors are duking it out amidst the gravity shifts, and this makes for some impressive-looking chaos.The story while somewhat original, wasn't pulled off as smoothly as it could have been in my opinion. There were just far too many plot holes that you could drive a tank through. Now with a certain proper ending, these plot holes would diminish, but Nolan has yet to confirm just what the ending means so the plot holes are left intact. If you want a better idea of what I mean by that, PM me.Acting for the most part is good and gets the job done. Just don't expect anything Oscar-caliber here. If there was one stand-out performance in Inception, I would definitely say it's from Leo Dicaprio. The guy proves time and time again that he's one of the better young actors working right now. The rest of the cast gives passable performances, but nothing special. Michael Caine is wasted, and I feel the only reason he was hired was to get his name on the box.Not much needs to be said about the special effects. They're some of the best yet, and at times even creative. Possibly the strongest aspect of the film, next to the effects, is the musical score. Inception has one of the best scores in recent memory. My hat is off to Hans Zimmer. The effects, score, and flawed but intriguing story come together in making Inception a very enjoyable and entertaining film. It's definitely smarter than your average popcorn flick, but at the end of the day it's still just a popcorn flick. Nothing more, nothing less. It lacks the emotional punch and attention to detail that made District 9 so great (now that's a true masterpiece, and one of the greatest sci fi films ever made).I give Inception 7.5/10 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun film that will also make them think a little bit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You Want Something Different You'll Get Different,Well to speak Christopher Nolan's movie memento i saw some what quiet a long time ago i just came into the genre of unfolding events but it was an exceptional movie to watch and i said man i have to check out who is the maker of this film i was hoping for some biggie should be behind its making and then i came to know Christopher Nolan and for years he has done very less films and delivered us all his potential great movies to entertain the audience.And Now He Has done it again with another great movie inception such a remarkable movie you just get to know we have seen movies like the matrix and the talk about mind games movies but it is different from all others because Christopher Nolan has a different mind perception of all others who have tried a different acting is great and how the characters take you into it all you got to do is sit back keep your eyes and ears open and the rest will follow with you.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Give him the kick,"Great ideas grow like a cancer. Sometimes you never really know where they come from.Chris Nolan has never really had a totally original idea. Like Tarantino, he knows other movies so well, their ideas creep into his work, either intentionally or not. While my words on originality may come as inflammatory, my feeling toward his talent, and films is quite the opposite. He's good - real good. But he isn't original. Nobody is. This is the 21st century folks and its all been done. It is the way he's showing us these familiar things, that keeps us coming back.Except for Di Caprio, who never really convinces as a brooding widower/father, the rest of the band is perfect. Not that any of them are actually interesting, the plot is the real character in Inception. Hans Zimmers score is majestic and hugely epic and Wally Pfister's familiar clean visuals make it easy on the eyes.Much like a new roller-coaster at 6 Flags, Inception is a ride we've been on on before. Dreams, reality and all that jazz, but this one has a deeper dose of rabbit hole. We have a heist film set in the frame of corporate psychological espionage - whatever the hell that is.We get Matrix style pseudo reality and weightless gun fights. We get The Game and Total Recall style onion layers. We get the old man in the bedroom of cubist proportions from the Kubrick 2001 finale. Maybe one too many James Bond ski battles. And I'm just getting warmed up. The wife story rings hollow - in fact, it's downright boring. Exposition goes in circles and we never do get enough Watanabe Ken. But it's that layered time of the tiered dreams that makes this one go boom. The elevator that can't drop and that van that just falls forever with the cameras over cranking at 150 frames per second or more. But we don't want it to hit the water. Go deeper Cobb, cause I don't want to get off this one yet.The final joke with the unending spinner? This is Nolan's dream, not Cobb's.It's not visionary, it's not original, but just like the meandering Dark Knight or the wretched nonsense of the Prestige, or the titanic plot holes of Memento, Inception is a rabbit hole that owns you¬†til¬†it's over. This ain't art or philosophy to ride to the top. It's just one great kick all the way down.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
MASTERPIECE! Highly recommend seeing this movie!,"""Inception"" is undoubtedly one of the most iconic science fiction films ever.
It explains the idea of sharing a dream, accessing and changing people s mind.
It tells the story of Kobb,the proffesional thief and the master of his craft. He enters the subconscious and steals the information, that his clients need. The only thing he regrets about is that he can't see his children anymore. But one day he receives a deal that will change his life dramatically. This operation seems to be infeasible, but Kobb accepts to risk everything for his family...The special effects are fantastic,the plot twists are unexpectable and well-thought-out.

It just makes soo much fun watching these Characters do their thing...On top of that the movie has such a great soundtrack. Hans Zimmer has once again topped himself.

Inception,"Inception is a mind-bending sci-fi thriller that keeps you hooked from start to finish. Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is an expert in extracting secrets from people's dreams. But this time, he must do the impossible-plant an idea instead. The movie is full of twists, incredible visuals, and a deep story that makes you think. It's a masterpiece that deserves multiple viewings. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer adds another layer of intensity, making every scene feel even more impactful.

Insane,"It is a film that deeply follows the viewer both mentally and emotionally. What I felt while watching this film is exactly this: Admiration, curiosity and surprise. Inception is a work that shows how deep, thought-provoking and intelligent cinema can be, beyond just a science fiction film.Knowing that the main event of the film is shaped by the intervention of the minds and the shaping of the film through dreams tells us how structural every detail in the film is. The editing of Inception is clever and finely crafted that I notice a different detail when I watch it. The way Nolan describes the transitions between dreams, the lifespan of times, and subconscious worlds is by no means simple or superficial. While watching all this complex structure, you actually change the clue features of his scenes and dialogues.The impressive structure of the film and the transitions between its layers leave the viewer in constant curiosity. While traveling to the depths of the mind, it invites the viewer to get lost in the labyrinths of dreams. Each layer in the dream world is perceived as another reality, impressively showing how it can be manipulated over time. Nolan's directorial genius breaks down here. Visuals, editing, sound design and music... Everything works together in perfect harmony. It reflects the inner conflicts and losses in the dream world so powerfully that as the character delves into his emotional depths, the viewer can lose themselves along with him.In conclusion, Inception goes down in history as one of the most creative and intelligent films of cinema. Nolan, who can do a perfect job in terms of editing, script, acting and directing, invites the viewer to a series that pushes the limits of imagination. If a movie deserves a score of 10 out of 10, Inception is definitely that movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dream invasion is the focus of a strange and ambiguous film...,"I'll be the first one to admit that INCEPTION is the kind of thinking man's thriller that has something going on every second of its two-hour and 28 minute running time. But only director Chris Nolan knows what it's all about and I don't believe I'll find out all the explanations until I get the DVD commentary.It's a heady mixture of sci-fi, comic book stuff and fantasy and all of it is focused on the mastery of dream invasion in order to gather secrets held in the human mind. Foremost among the players is LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, playing his role in a very authoritative manner with no shortage of barking orders and furrowed brow, all highly intense, as he gathers a team around him to investigate the dreamscape.There's plenty of action along the way, interspersed with quieter moments of explanatory dialog so the audience has at least some semblance of what's going on. But the whole concept of the story lacks the kind of credibility that would have made the film more engaging than it really is.Credit the actors with doing their best despite the fact that none of them have roles that are fully fleshed out. And this includes Joseph GORDON-LEVITT, ELLEN PAGE, TOM HARDY, CILLIAN MURPHY, KEN WATANABE and TOM BERENGER.If you're a MATRIX fan, you'll love this one. If not, you may wonder what all the fuss was about.Frankly, I had more fun exploring dream invasion in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, less intellectual but a lot more fun.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Inception got way more credit than it deserved. Here's why...,"First, let me say that the acting was good, and that Leonardo DiCaprio is a good actor. The bad rating I gave this movie has nothing to do with the actors' performances.I gave this a bad rating because the writing was just bad. The CONCEPT of the movie was excellent. When I first saw the trailer, my imagination went wild. The scope of where you could go and what you could do with a concept like inception in people's dreams is almost endless.But, where did they run with it? Guns? Explosions? Grand Theft Auto? Matrix wannabe? These are the words that came to mind when I watched this.And the plot, if that's what you call it, is nothing. It's convoluted minus the imagination, mystery, and intelligence. It's like they made it complicated so it could SEEM intelligent. But trust me, it's not! About 1/2 to 2/3 into the movie, the ending became VERY predictable. Even so, I thought, ""It's about the journey not the ending. Right?"" Except the journey sucked. How come everybody in this movie only dreams about automatic weapons? I know, I know. There are a bunch of explanations in the movie, but the explanations are terrible and not thorough enough to be believable. For example, the characters explain the assault weapons in the dreams by saying the subconscious had been militarized.What kind of stupid explanation is that? Am I supposed to take that seriously? It seems like the movie is just asking for an excuse to become a pseudo-Matrix action flick. Except the Matrix was much better than this.Well... What a waste of a good concept... but mindless action flicks can be fun, even when they continuously, pretentiously claim to be thought-provoking..... But then there's the looooong drawn out mushy ending that breaks up the action and isn't befitting an action flick at all.So, congratulations Hollywood. You managed to take a good concept of a movie with a great cast, remove all imagination and intelligence, while simultaneously turning it into a mediocre action flick with a terrible ending.Hollywood fails again... 4/10 stars",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Impeccably constructed mechanics of hazy blurs,"I wonder how many different ways will Nolan find around making a heist movie. Whereas the average heist film basically makes a statement that hits a mark around ""crime doesn't pay"", a Nolan film at some point feels the need to peel back the heist film as an irrelevancy that no longer serves a purpose to give us catharsis and soaring emotional crescendos. Yet he makes his catharsis the same way he makes his heist movie framing devices, mechanical and calculated and 'movie-like'.For all the hoo hah of philosophical ambition about boxes inside boxes, this is still a movie where a plot is set in motion by characters saying things like ""we had to deliver Saito's expansion plans to Cobol Engineering two hours ago"" and where a team is assembled to work for ""some very very powerful people"". In all this furrore the make juvenile mistakes. The heir to the most powerful energy conglomerate in the world apparently flies to Los Angeles not in his personal jet but on an airline owned by his competitor. The movie hinges its believability in abstract stratagems like ""the subject's mind can always trace the genesis of that idea"".Like Shutter Island, I am bothered by this type of film that purports to speak at profound length about dreams and their mechanics, yet seems to understand nothing at all about dream logic. In Shutter Island dreams are tableaux of carefully constructed symbolism, detail planned in all the right spots to mean something. Inception is even less; dreams are vistas/levels of real world abstracted to a small degree. When a van tumbles over a bridge, the people dreaming inside that van find themselves bumping about in their dream! Where Scorsese's movie allowed for itself the failsafe of being able to claim that it's all a pastiche of 50's detective mysteries, Inception is a Nolan film so it must take itself thoroughly serious at every turn.The Nolans are really masters of film structuralism, I can't take that away from them nor do I want to, they excel in this. They are great architects who make boxes carefully fit within other boxes, an elaborate maze to lose the viewer in, but their idea of trascending box and maze is to the force the viewer into submission by sheer volume of plot detail. I like how we're given fragments of images that pay off later but at the same time can't help but feel that, outside the mechanics of it, when it comes to emotional response, those fragments never really challenge our expectations. For more than two hours, Nolan symbolizes Leo's guilt on leaving a family behind by showing him unable to dream/remember the faces of his children, always seeing their backs. In the end he does, yet, again seemingly through that architectural need to create another narrative box, the film ends on the ambiguous note ""is this another dream?"" that betrays the emotional response of the character seeing his children's faces.What annoys me most about this is two things though. That the movie seems content to give the impression that a villain, like a Minotaur in the far end of a labyrinth, inhabits the lowest level of the dream, closed in a hotel room of broken furniture, or a bleak cityscape of concrete buildings without features, and even characters who should know better refer to it in the third person like it actually exists down there as something more than a figment of Leo's subconscious.And more importantly, that Nolan creates a very elaborate system of dreams within dreams and simultaneous narratives that hinge on the idea that dream time is condensed (I find this fascinating, that entire lives can be played out in the span of time it takes a van to tumble over a bridge), yet he only fills those boxes with the most banal and unimaginative action set pieces. Dream levels are in turns hazy aimless blurs of something that is very gray and very rainy, of characters running around in orangecolored corridors, of characters running around in the snow shooting guns at each other.I'm not sure that Nolan could make a better movie even if he didn't have blockbuster expectations to fulfill or financial investments to protect, even with the ridiculous actions trimmed out, a dream version of Memento would not warrant Kubrick comparisons. For a generation that wasn't old enough to take the red pill ten years ago this should serve as a Matrix for the new decade, but when it comes to meaningfully capturing what it feels like to dream no one has yet to even rival Lynch.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A masterpiece that everyone should watch,"I'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan's work and according to me Inception is the masterpiece of it. Everything in this movie is perfect as per my requirements. There is enough mystery, action, drama, sci-fi and effects. The plot is perfect and Nolan did great in the development of that fantastic idea. I could not want nothing more from the script and the realization of it. As it comes to the cinematography Nolan was exceptional in what he have done in this movie. The final is a bit different and unexpected but perfectly made and all of the people who watch the film will be asking themselves the question: ""What happened?"".The actor's play is great too, I think that Leonardo Di Caprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are awesome in their roles. It's not strange that Nolan is working with some of the supporting actors in more than one of his movies. Despite the most attention went to Di Caprio and Gordon- Levitt the others should not be passed. Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwaite and Michael Caine did great too. I want also to mention Tom Hardy. I didn't know him before Inception, but he is one of the actor who won my attention and I enjoy his acts in other movies too.As it comes to the soundtrack, I think that just mentioning the name of the Hans Zimmer should be enough for the movie fans. According to me Zimmer is the best in the business. Once I checked his biography I was more than impressed with the fact that he made soundtracks for more movies than I could though. The most impressive part is that he did it for great ones, not just for some mediocre films. The soundtrack of Inception is one of the little that I listened after watching the movie.According to me it is quite normal that Inception won Oscars for cinematography, visual effects and sound, but still it is very strange that the academy awards for best movie, best actor and best writing were not given to Nolan's masterpiece. I really think that Inception is far better in every aspect than King's speech and I know that this topic is widely discussed but Di Caprio was great and deserved the award more than Collin Firth.As a conclusion I will definitely suggest to everyone who didn't watched Iception to do it as far as he could, because he missed on the greatest movies ever.I gave 9/10 because 10/10 is waiting for the movie that is still not done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Mutli-Layered Dream World,"What drew me to watch this film on the very first day of theatrical showing was the cast, which was an incredible array of some of the most intense actors in Hollywood today. We have Ken Watanabe, Cilian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Michael Caine, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwait, and in the lead, none other than Leonardo di Caprio. The director and writer Christopher Nolan also comes with a very impressive oeuvre behind him, with ""Memento,"" ""The Prestige,"" and most recently, ""The Dark Knight.""This film is one of the most complicated films I have seen. A fair summary is almost impossible to put into words. It is challenging to follow all the jumping into and out of dreams, in dreams within dreams. I won't be surprised if you do not completely understand everything that was going on by the end. However, the visual experience of being in this multi-layered dream world is unmatchable in any recent films.I thought of ""The Matrix,"" and even Leo's latest (excellent) work ""Shutter Island,"" as this film proceeds to disorient you about what is and is not reality. However, ""Inception"" goes several levels higher in the hierarchy of convolutions in film. There are at least four levels of simultaneous dream upon dream happening at one time at one point. Amazing film editing work!Then there are technical aspects which were mind-boggling indeed, as Nolan's bizarre script required. The audience is brought inside buildings, rooms, elevators, even entire cities where you lose the sense of space, time, gravity and logic. It is a dream world--you need to see it to fully appreciate what I just wrote. The musical score of Hans Zimmer was strong and dramatic. These are definitely contenders by Oscar time.This film is not for everyone. There are those who would dismiss this as impossibly pretentious and pointless. But for me, ""Inception"" was very stimulating and challenging -- a film well-worthy to spend two and a half hours of our valuable time. Be ready to face this challenge when you go watch it. I won't be surprised if you feel you need to watch it all over again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Masterpiece of the Year,"It is the rare film that can completely immerse you in its experience to the point where it is hard to speak afterward. Inception is one of those films - beyond breathtaking, an incredible mind-bending tale full of action and suspense which takes us in to the world of dreams and back.Inception is not only the most intelligent film of the year, it makes the rest look like a finger painting. Christopher Nolan has again manufactured a masterpiece of cinema, the story beyond intricate and full of psychological twists and turns through the mind of dreams which turns the action on its head - sometimes quite literally. The acting is exceptional, with Joseph Gordeon-Levitt standing out and proving again that he has more than enough acting chops to tackle bigger and better roles. What is really incredible is how Nolan manages to carry such an epic film with such a huge scale and yet maintain strong, well-rounded characters. Leonardo DiCaprio's Cobb is at the center of the story and the focus is never taken off of him. Through Leo's performance and through sitting in Cobb's dreams, Inception manages a new way of getting us to feel what the film's characters feel.Hans Zimmer's score perfectly compliments Nolan's actions on screen to create an experience films rarely give us anymore. Both epic and serene, Zimmer adds to the dream-like quality of the film and makes the action set pieces that much larger.The set pieces of Inception are amazing. Not only is it refreshing to see so many special effects without the use of CGI, but the implementation of these special effects are the best I've seen. I only wish I hadn't seen any trailers for this film, as going in to this movie with a blank pallet would have given the movie even more exceptional moments, instead of hoping or waiting for ""that moment"" or smiling when a humorous line from the trailer showed up in the film. I could talk about the one central fight scene of the film for hours, which is nothing short of a benchmark of set design, camera-work and cinematography. I could watch this scene on loop for hours just to be knocked out over and over again by the sheer scale of it.I cannot describe Inception as anything short of a masterpiece. Especially in the dredge of summer cinema, Inception reminds us why we go to films in the first place, giving us an intelligent film which doesn't fly over our heads (not that I'd recommend stepping out of the theater for ever a minute during the movie).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"This movie should be named  "" Exceptional !!!! "" not  "" Inception ""","I watched the first day first show of the movie, it was amazing !!!First of all the story was brilliant and unique. It is actually very difficult to implement such complex story because there are so many characters and so many explanations of how things are going on and so many levels in the movie.The concept of dreams and dreams inside dreams was unique. All the action sequences were very well done.I think such complex stories only great directors can tell because there were so many small pieces in the movie which needed to be connected.I expect this film to be nominated for Oscars because of being unique and very well made movieOnly the directors like Christopher Nolan would dare to implement such unique concepts .VERY GOOD !!!I would give this movie Rating : 10/10 , and it is a MUST SEE !!!

Christopher Nolan has outdone himself yet again...,"I walked into the theater knowing relatively nothing about this film, and I walked out...knowing even less. From the moment it begins to the moment it ends, you will be wondering what is going on. These initial questions are simply because those trailers we've been watching all year have hardly prepared us for what is about to happen. Most of us just buy a ticket on our faith in either Christopher Nolan or Leonardo DiCaprio. (In my case: both.) As the movie progresses, your questions grow deeper, more layered, just as the dreams you are viewing excavate the furthest reaches of the unconscious. It's an absolute ride, and in IMAX, it's astounding.It's easy to see how this is the product of Nolan's work in Memento. It deals with the same issues of our narrator's reliability and questions of reality. Both main characters have a tragic self-awareness that seems like a plus in the beginning of the movie, but by the end, you'll wonder if what they trusted to be true and what you trusted to be true is even true at all. Like the dreams themselves, the plot lines and characters begin to fall apart, but our Architect, Christopher Nolan, is the one pulling the strings. This is a film that moves beyond its medium and pulls you in. I'd almost say it breaks the fourth wall without even trying to.It goes without saying that the special effects are one of the highlights of Inception. This will probably be The Matrix of our time, but in a much subtler way. As Dom says, ""It's only when you wake up that you realize there was something strange."" This strangeness is embraced and pulled throughout the film. However, the mazes, infinite staircases, and alternate realities these special effects create are not limited to just providing an aesthetic wonder, but they serve to symbolically reinforce many of the main issues of the film. The paradox of an infinite staircase will be itching your brain for a few hours after you finish watching.The performances are pitch perfect. I initially thought that the characters were a bit one- dimensional and not incredibly developed. Don't be alarmed though. Nolan hasn't lost the touch that created his Batman and his Joker. I believe there are deliberate reasons for this lack of background, which will surely feed into the theorists that will begin sprouting all over the internet after this weekend. Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard provide the emotional and narrative center of the film. Being the Oscar winning and nominated actors they are, these roles are played beautifully. It's as if they don't even realize they're the ones we're all focused on.I would've given this a 10/10 if it weren't for the excessive use of Hans Zimmer's music. I'm a major fan of Zimmer's work, but I believe music in a film is instrumental when trying to give your audience some sort of cathartic release. At the moment I needed that from the score, it had already been playing non-stop for an hour, so it really made no difference in my emotional response. That's my only complaint, but I'm a film score nerd so don't worry about it.I'll end this now before I start confusing myself even more. It's a privilege, though, to see an auteur like Christopher Nolan working today, using the summer blockbuster as his medium. You'll leave the theater feeling as if you just ""witnessed"" something.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Really good movie just a but overwhelming,Watched it for the the first time. In order to enjoy this movie you need to be prepared. You need to be focused and pay attention or else you will get lost. You also have to be patient. You needs these things to really understand this movie because this film can get overwhelming. There is a lot of going on and can be overwhelming. Normally when I sit down and watch a movie I like to relax on my couch and will probably check me phone in the beginning until it reall catches my attention. With this movie you can't do that. You need to fully pay attention and it lowkey felt like I was forced to watch it because of how much focus you need to watch this film. I feel like a great movie shouldn't be that hard to watch. This is why I take some points off the rating. Other than that the movie is good and I understand why people give it a 10/10.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Inception is movie perfection!,"Super blown away by Inception! I can't get over how Christopher Nolan can keep topping himself with each flick. At first I was so scared to see this fail because of the curse of the stellar cast but i should have had faith in Nolan all along. This is just unbelievably good!!!He takes his time telling such a complicated story without dumbing it down or complicating it too much. All the actors play their parts well that even Leo DiCaprio, in a rare way, fades into the character and you forget his celebrity. Everyone and everything is just amazing; from the ominous soundtrack to the sets to the acting and cinematography...all I could say at the end of the flick was, WOW!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Anything Is Possible,"If there is anything that Inception has taught me, it's that anything is possible with films. There are very few films that I have seen that deliver this message. Star Wars delivered a galaxy full of imaginative creation. The Matrix showed us a world where rules could be broken and people could dodge bullets. Avatar took us to another world the likes of which we have never seen. Now, Inception takes us to places we can only dream of.I will start by saying two things that may contradict each other. The first is that this film has something for everyone. There's plenty of action, drama, noir, suspense, and mind games for those who like to be intrigued. At the same time, this will not be a film for everyone. The nit-picky will find all the little tiny things to question, most notably the logic involved in the whole subconscious sneakery and 'whose dream are we in?' logic. But quite honestly, any possible holes are completely forgiven. Not only is this the best written film of the year, but this is one of the most imaginative films in years.I really have to applaud Nolan for taking a chance. Few filmmakers would dare to go out on such a limb and not only try and create such a complex web of dream logic and rules, but also make sense of so many things going on at once. At one point in the film there are four different realities occurring at the same time. There are only a few filmmakers I can even think of that would dare try and create such feat. Even fewer I can think of that make it work. And Nolan does. At first, all the dream logic had my head buzzing, but it mattered little once we hit the dream world. While dizzying, the exposition fits. It's so fascinating and so far from anything that we have seen that the first hour, which is mainly made up of explanations of how things work, is rather welcome as opposed to frowned upon.Nolan's writing shines here. He does what The Matrix once did and bends rules, even breaking some to shape a wholly different reality where cities topple and even gravity gives way to a change in the rules of reality. It's completely fascinating and suspenseful. I even found myself exhaling out loud. And while it may seem like nothing much more than a whole bunch of pretty images and special effects, this is all supported by a strongly written main character and well acted supporting cast. Although the only really deep relationships here are between DiCaprio's character Cobb and his wife and Page's character, the cast as a whole is enjoyable. Joseph Gordon Levitt is the action heavy, doing a lot of the physical fighting, while Tom Hardy is the comic relief (when comedy presents itself). There are a few a members who could be called one note. Watanabe's character is a fairly one note evil corporate head type and Cillian Murphy plays the gullible victim. But even these characters have moments of humanity which shine through.While the film deals in reality defying moments, there are some very entertaining, more practical elements, like the shootouts and the heist planning. These play out like their subsequent genre staples, and I'm very thankful for that. The shootouts are practical and exciting. The heist elements will be familiar to anyone who is familiar with the heist sub-genre, but in this case it's all about people who deal in cerebral elements and must plan their actions around mental manipulation and subconscious trickery.I don't think I could say enough about my enjoyment of this film, but I will say that it is truly one of the best film events in recent memory that I have enjoyed. While this summer has been filled with disappointment at the theater, Inception was worth it. If this film doesn't grab your imagination by the balls, then I don't know what will.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is one of the most brilliant films ever made.,"I won't describe the plot, I won't describe the characters, I won't describe anything about this movie. You've seen advertisements for this movie. They are freaky, complex, mind-bending, but nothing in these advertisements make sense, and they won't until you actually see the film.Nevermind the visuals of the film. They are not even the most effective thing of this film. Granted though, they are a spectacular sight, and I never thought for one second I was looking at actual CGI. That's SUPER effective. Nevermind the acting in the film. However, I never once thought I was actually watching people act, I actually thought I was looking at something real. The most effective point of the film is an idea, an idea that takes our brains for a wicked little spin. This idea entertains us, intrigues us, and plays fun little games with us. It's a sheer delight.A lot of people are going to ask ""Is this film better than Nolan's The Dark Knight?"" In my personal opinion, yes. This is his best film, and it is better than ""The Dark Knight"", which was a masterpiece itself. I'm proud to say that ""Inception"" is a step up. For those who are looking for something simple, something plain, and something that won't require a grand extent of their brain power, they will get bored with ""Inception"". This is an adult film in the regard that it requires your full attention, and your brain must be plugged into it, or you are going to miss it ALL OF IT.I believe that this film definitely deserves a place for the ""Best Picture"" nomination at the Oscars this year, along with more recognition to Nolan as a director and a writer, for he has made the most original film I have probably seen in a very long time. His writing is impeccable. His direction is brilliant. His movie is the ultimate masterpiece.Inception is the smartest $160 million dollars that a studio has ever spent to make a film. It was also the best $7.50 I have ever spent. Bravo.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Thought provoking unlike any other,"As a long time lurker on IMDb, I've slowly been working my way through the top 250. I can honestly say that this film has surpassed anything I have ever seen before, despite the hype.I was gripped from start to finish. An amazing concept backed up with emotion and even some groundbreaking action scenes. I spent the entirety of last night trying to get my head around what could have actually happened, such is the depth of the story. Never before has a film had such an impact on me - I woke this morning to the realisation that I had several dreams last night which were very uneasy, for the first time in years.This film is the reason I've finally signed up to this website. I'm a massive fan of films such as 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Godfather', but in my opinion, this raises the bar. And that's coming from somebody who is generally not the biggest Sci-Fi fan.If there's ever a film that the masses should rush out to the cinema to see it is this, before it's too late. An absolute must see, and it would be a travesty if it did not make its way to its rightful position in at least the IMDb top 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Intellectual or Unintelligible?,"Christopher Nolan's sci-fi thriller might well have been called 'Deception', or better still, 'Multiple Deception', such is the effect the film has. The concept is original, no question. However, it does borrow from classic American films such as 'Citizen Kane' and 'The Matrix'.Many film geeks ‚Äì and ordinary punters ‚Äì have described this film as 'very complicated'. The truth is it's just tremendously detailed. For his job, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), while in a dream state, steals ideas from people ('Extraction'); however, the film concerns itself with him implanting an idea into a person's mind, i.e. 'Inception'. That's the plot in one crude line.However, to reduce the plot, which took a modern master nearly eight years to flesh out, to one purely about mental thievery would be unfair. It is the minutiae which are meant to dazzle.Business tycoon, Saito (Ken Watanabe) needs Cobb to perform the inchoate process of Inception on another businessman's son, Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), to prevent his father's energy company from becoming a monopoly. After Fischer Snr passes, it is believed that he will betroth the business to his son, so the idea Cobb and his team must implant is for him to repudiate his father's will.The technology used to carry out the subconscious subterfuge is never explained. When we catch glimpses of it, it looks like a child's primitive science-kit thrown into a briefcase. But this is not meant to be the focus.For all its cerebral conceit, at the film's core are two emotional stories. One is of Cobb's wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who spends her time stalking Cobb's subconscious mind and thereby sabotaging his missions. The other is between Fischer and his father, whose relationship is strained.We saw DiCaprio mature in Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed'. Here he permanently loses the schoolboy image and becomes a man. The ensemble acting is good, however, most of the main characters seem far too young to do anything let alone steal and implant ideas, and Michael Caine's turn as yet another sage is fast becoming trite.The computer-generated imagery is, as expected, top-notch, though the action scenes would be clich√©d if they were not embellished by Hans Zimmer's superbly suspenseful music.Ultimately, Nolan asks us to absorb too much gobbledegook too quickly. Perhaps he was being pretentious, perhaps not. Either way, I lost interest somewhere in the second half.Within days of the film's release, thousands of cinema-goers cast their votes on this venerated website, ensuring that the film became, at least in their minds, one of the top five greatest films of all time.

The concept is very interesting, but there are so many loopholes and unanswered questions and illogical contrivances that we both just shook our heads and enjoyed the scenery. I have to wonder where all of the high ratings for this flick are coming from. I am not buying that as many people loved this thing on the same par as Lord of the Rings and Godfather.

Perception,"You have this basic idea and the story, they are very good. And boy did the have money. And the CGI is spectacular, yes.Further on this:Inception is constantly VERBALLY explaining what is happening, why it is happening, how it's relating to things explained earlier and so on. The rules, the plot, the inner conflicts. Even at the 2/3rd of the movie, they are still explaining basic rules. I don't see why this was necessary as most of it is repetition. You get the same stuff over and over again, supposed you didn't get it for the first time. And again: VERBALLY. Exactly like in your average, random Venezuelan soap opera.Inception does almost not have any scenes. As far as I'm concerned, movies are about scenes. Here, you'll only be able to remember certain sequences, because it's all just one big a montage of sequences. It's the montage of the master-plan from Oceans 11 for 150 minutes and it's exaggerating.The score is non-stop blaring, all the darn time, even when people are just talking to each other, music is building up constantly to give you the perception, that there are serious things going on. It's just annoying, painful for the ears and pointless. Generally important scenes are in no contrast to basic scenes. It's one big video clip.Characters. I don't remember a single name, as there is no kind of character development going on here. It's just some well dressed people. All the dialog is used up, for basic explaining like ""for dummies"", rather then building character, relationships, or just being generally cool dialog. Occasional tries sounds like tag-lines or slogans while being just plain unintelligent. Also, this is leaving the actors no space to - well - act... which is a waste of the great cast.Now all these things are very amateur scriptwriting mistakes, or if you prefer: it's a stupid movie. But no one seems to notice as Nolan does everything to convince you that you are watching something meaningful.The blaring music and the hectic editing, the fact that there are permanently 3 scenes of action cut together into one sequence underlined by an incredibly severe score, it's just there to distract. Because in fact the movie has nothing new to show us. Separate the sequences and you have the most basic and outdated action b-movie there is. Car chase. Fire fight. Explosion. Present it confusing enough so it seems complex. Same goes for the plot. The rules of the dream world are not complicated at all, you are absolutely able to sum it up in two sentences, just try. The Matrix set up it's world with a 10 minute sequence and we all got it where the whole theme is about equally, or more complex. Now Nolan is either deliberately confusing people for effect or simply because he doesn't have the skills as a scriptwriter to set up a movie. Neither of the versions seems too noble, but I guess it's a combination of those.Now the fact, that no one really seems to have noticed ALL THIS this is just a total riddle to me. Even famous film critics praise this movie as ground breaking and brilliant and I just can't see, where I am totally stupid, or why I'd construe all these mistakes into the movie, when in reality, they just weren't there.It's just malpractice, as what you have here is basic movie making rules ignored in the most inelegant fashion possible and then compensating for it with - well - money. Don't get me wrong, it's not knowing the rules and then breaking them, it just looks like not knowing the rules. It's what you could expect a first year student at a mediocre film school to do where his teacher then asks him to start all over again, with the first book. And it's just so ""in your face"". For most of the time, there is really nothing more then cutaways, the characters describing what is happening and Hans Zimmer smashing while you see expensive CGI and explosions.But everything just seems so damn serious and exclusive and the music is really dramatic. How could this movie not be good, right? But it's a trick. It's the concept of visceral over-stimulation brought to a new level and I'm shocked that it works to the point where after almost a century of film making THIS is regarded as one of the best movies of all time.IMDb TOT 250 #8.

I'm sorry to say this is not as 'great' a film as they think,"But it's got its heart in the right place. First it's too long by at least a half-hour. Second it relies too much on frenetic activity to cover up its more grievous shortfalls. And third it's not really sci-fi, it's more a psychological thriller. But despite all that it is what it is portraying, an attempt to implant a notion, and that's highly commendable on several levels. Also a few of the scenes are both memorable and essentially flawless.The acting's all there too despite what some critics claim. DiCaprio is capable and fully invested. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is especially engaging, but the casting of Ellen Page was a near fatal mistake if you ask me. I can see why she made sense to the director and producers, but she's a drag on the movie as is Ken Watanabe who I could barely understand half the time. Still I like his acting and I can tolerate his pronunciation here. Page I don't like for some reason. Perhaps it's just too distracting and/or annoying to see her exude an almost pre-adolescent lack of experience again. If they needed an 'innocent', and I don't really agree, I would have preferred Dakota Fanning. Marion Cotillard does the exact opposite, she's worldly and knowing, but her I'd like to protect and get to know personally.I would have liked to see a slower more moody treatment of this topic. Though at least one of the chase scenes is masterful and hair-raising, the real pay dirt would have been imagining trying to enter another person's mind. In fact the separation between our minds is the bedrock on which most of our problems lay. A 'shared dream' as portrayed here would have been several notches more paradigm breaking than depicted here, I think, and that's no small flaw in this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Nolan's best,"I first started watching Nolan movies with Memento like 20 years ago when I was a teenager, then went to the cinema to see all three of his Batman movies, The Prestige, Inception, and Interstellar.I really think that it can be hard to decide which of his movies truly is his definitive best, as he has a few that hit the mark just right. But from re-watching them a bunch over the years, I do feel that Inception hits the hardest, even though Interstellar and The Dark Knight have their own weighty effect different from Inception.I watch movies for the magic and emotion, and even though The Dark Knight is technically excellent and brilliantly acted, the strengths of Inception edge it out slightly I think.I love the cast of Inception; especially the incredible performances of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, and Ellen Page.Those four actors in this movie are pure magic, especially accented with Leo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Ken Watanabe, along with everyone else.The holy trinity of Nolan in my mind at least, are Inception, Interstellar, and The Dark Knight, with The Prestige and Memento not far behind.I can't wait to see Nolan make an even greater magnum opus, one to dethrone Shawshank Redemption from its imdb number 1 spot. I feel that if any living director can do it, it would be Nolan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a complex looking movie with a simple concept underneath,"Inception is a movie that works outside our logic. We feel like our mind had been played all along, it's like the movie contains some puzzling, undeciphered codes scattered all over places. The moment we walk out theater, our mind process the movie, we interpret things, looking for many many possibility of answers over the questions we've just experienced. And this is why Inception works outside our logic; because no matter how hard we think and discuss this movie, we won't go anywhere. It's a decent analogy of a tricky labyrinth.Like a discourse that some elements - I would say some key - had gone missing, or simply were not even there at the first place, Inception is a piece that Christopher Nolan as a director creates and how he wanted it to be: To create questions in our head. While I think these questions aren't supposed to be vital, but this makes Inception special on a very intriguing level.Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief who works with stealing another person's mind. He used a special method by letting himself into a person's dream, hence explored those dreams while in the same time took a very important information that those persons won't share to any one. Once, a billionaire named Saito (Ken Watanabe), whom supposed to be his victim, offered Cobb a very interesting idea about doing his work differently. Instead of stealing thoughts, Saito asked Cobb to plant idea, to incept something in a person's mind. The logic is - according to this movie - if it's possible to stole any thought, it would also be possible to embed a whole new idea into a person's subconscious.To make it all happen, Cobb needs to recruit a bunch of people with their specialty. There're Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt); a guy who always worked with Cobb all the time, Adriane (Ellen Page); a brilliant architecture student whom able to create dream's environment, Yusuf (Dileep Rao); a chemist whose drugs are able to provide a powerful sedative, and Eames (Tom Hardy); a forger who stands like an actor on every person's dream. These experts has one objective: to incept an idea into one mind: Robert Fischer Jr (Cillian Murphy).The film rolls with how these experts trying to deliver this inception. Later on the movie, we would have a perception about how complex and intricate this inception method is, and how dangerous a dream could be. Apparently Cobb is keeping a dark thought on his deepest subconscious, this one includes Cobb's two children and his former beautiful wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard). Mal has been disturbing Cobb's mind, it's almost impossible to get rid of her from his dream. Every time Mal appears, his work and life are in a great danger.Without giving too many spoilers, I would continue my review concentrating on how I perceive Inception holistically. Inception goes in a way that it looks very complicated and confusing, and it'll makes us believe that we have to think hard in order to understand anything this movie delivered. While the truth is, in my opinion, Inception is a complex-looking movie with a very simple concept underneath it. The movie looks very confusing at some point, and then later on it'd become clearer, and then it looked like it's very surprising and mind blowing at the ending scene, it's something that Nolan creates on purpose so the audience would think like they'd been mind-tricked.And that preceding paragraph would come to my early statement: Inception works outside our logic. No matter how 'ambiguous' the ending is, no matter how detail the script looks like, we as an audience simply won't solve this puzzle because Nolan won't let us do so. It's impossible to conclude a research if we miss some data, so to speak. I'm not implying that Inception is a waste of time, or saying that this is a movie that doesn't have a true meaning. On a contrary, Inception is a work of genius. Instead of making a movie that goes over every one head, Christopher Nolan produced something simple that would be taken very seriously with the audience.I believe, on the first 30 minutes of Inception, lots of people are trying too hard not to get lost. While the story is going to automatically solve its puzzles on the next two hours, we as the audience is preparing ourselves hard to understand it. Once the ending came, the movie ended, we felt satisfied and intrigued. We felt smarter. We opened our interpretations, threw some insights and reasons, while the truth is actually been there all the time. I myself don't count the ending as ambiguous, since to be ambiguous the story needs to support its ambiguity. And in my opinion, while there are hints here and there, it's not enough to make it ambiguous.We don't need an extra intelligence to understand this movie. What we need is to relax, throw away our preconceptions, and let the next two and half hours entertaining you on its own tricky way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie blew my mind on so many levels,"Leonardo DiCaprio is on a 'good movie' streak. The Departed 9/10, Blood Diamond 9/10, Body of Lies 8/10, Shutter Island 8/10, Inception 10/10.I went to the midnight showing of Inception at my local theater, and it was jam packed. I had been waiting for this movie ever since I saw the first preview a few months back, and now it was finally time. The lights dimmed and a wave of ""shh!"" swept through the room. I prayed silently that Inception wouldn't disappoint. The movie began to play.The ocean. That's the first shot of this movie, and the last thing you see before Inception literally destroys every other movie that's come out in the past 10 or 15 years.Every actor in this movie is brilliant and no one is miscast. Every shot, every angle, every sequence of this movie is absolutely stellar. Every plot twist, every line of dialog is sheer genius. The pacing is perfect, and the story is destined to become a classic. Honestly, I have never been in this much awe of a film. The characters were engaging and had depth. You feel like you know each and every one of them, the suspense was awful (but in the best way possible). If I had to put the title of 'prefect' on any film, Inception would be it. It is literally flawless.I have never seen a movie that actually made me sit on the edge of my seat sweating and sipping on my Coke like a nervous wreck. I have never seen a movie where I literally wanted to jump into the screen and save one of the characters, I have never seen a movie that could make me want to cry one second, shout out in anger the next, and rejoice the next. That was the power of Inception.To say that this movie was good, or even great is a enormous understatement. This move was without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen in a cinema. Quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. I am going to see it again today. I recommend you do the same.Final Word: Simply Perfect. 10/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best movie I could ever dream of,"Best movie ever made. Period. Not for small-brained people. You need to really think hard to fully understand the concepts and details in this movie. Layers deep, it covers every emotion throughout watching. 10/10 acting and the casting was flawless. Leo portrays a desperate protagonist you never stop rooting for despite his flaws. The concept of planting an idea into anothers sub-conscience that they assume to be their own original idea... 10/10 mind-bending mind-altering, mind-incepting greatness. This is a movie you must pay attention every second of every scene otherwise you'll be confused. Nolan's best work by far, took over a decade alone to write. Not sure a movie of this depth will ever be matched. By the end of the film if your not completely blown away in awe, chances are you're lost. Though it takes place in a near future where dreams can be infiltrated, it remained completely believable throughout.

Dream Team,"Watching Inception with its futuristic emphasis on getting inside people's heads through dreams, especially hearing Leonardo DiCaprio explain the pitfalls to newbie Ellen Page, I couldn't help thinking about Forbidden Planet and that warning about monsters from the Id. Did earth manage to conquer what the Krells could not?Christopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit heavy at times, it still is an unmistakable masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this and he's essentially a cat burglar of the mind. His mission usually is to invade people's dreams and steal ideas which makes him an invaluable espionage agent. But Leo's also a wanted man.Some problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on others to create dream worlds. He was working against Japanese billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught, but then Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the young heir to a communications conglomerate, Cillian Murphy. It's not to steal anything, but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream team. The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride. And its how Leo has to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on others.Very nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in that category. Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer Nolan's dialog with verve and conviction.I truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a frightening thought.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""You Are Not Prepared For This!""","That's what Leonardo DiCaprio was shouting at me for months from all those trailers and previews (there wasn't many of them) and he was right I wasn't prepared for this awesome, mind-blowing experience.Finally I have seen the most anticipated movie of this year (for me) and I know you are all excited for this movie so I try do describe the movie without giving away too much of the plot. The story tells of Cobb who is a extractor, someone who enters human minds through their dreams he and his team create and steals valuable information from the subject's mind. He is a wanted fugitive in the U.S.A, which is a problem for him, because he's got kids there and coming back home to them is what he most desires. During his last assignment he meets a mysterious Japanese businessman, who doesn't ask him of extraction but an inception, planting an idea in someone's mind and that is much more complicated. So Cobb sets out to recruit a team and finish this last job alive.All the actors here do an outstanding job; Leonardo Dicaprio is at his best in this movie, Marion Cottilard does an excellent job as ""The Shade"", Ellen Page, one of the prettiest young actresses of today, is always great. Tom Hardy plays here the character with the right bad-ass attitude, they should offer him more roles like this.The biggest surprise for me was Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur, never seen a movie with him he surprised me how charismatic he is and how great he pulled off the role of Arthur.If you think the soundtrack from Hans Zimmer in The Dark Knight was unbelievable then wait for this one, I have to go and call this The Best Soundtrack of the Year.This movie features one of the best movie fights ever where Arthur is fighting one of the subconscious' defenses and the gravity is always changing. That fight is just so breathtaking and suspensive. It's just a like Ariadne says ""It's pure creation"".The movie is just so brilliant, it works on many levels. It's suspensive, mysterious, filled with action, the visuals are breathtaking, there is the typical blockbuster/Nolan humor in it too. Christopher Nolan is once again playing with the mind of the audience and until the end you don't know what's going to happen and you don't even know after the end. That's the beauty of it Nolan lets the viewer interpret the ending by himself. Nolan made this masterpiece, this modern day classic and it's a one hell of a ride and it's one hell of mind-blower.If you think about it, Nolan has planted an idea in your mind which you will be thinking about for months.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Don't walk - RUN to see this film!,"Many people are saying that Christopher Nolan may be the best film maker of his generation. I thoroughly enjoyed Memento, thought Batman Begins was great, thought The Dark Knight was fantastic, and after watching Inception I think the man is a cinematic genius and can't wait for his next project. But I will have lots of enjoyment watching Inception many times over until then.He supposedly honed this script for 10 years and it definitely shows. The story is quite complex and has not a plot hole in it that I was able to observe. It has everything - loss, redemption, amazing action, great character development, mind-blowing effects that serve the story and not the other way around as many films do nowadays, and at the core is a love story not too unlike Orpheus and Eurydice. But unlike the myth the underworld is a damaged soul. And when it looks like the story is wrapped up, there's a last second twist that will throw you for a loop.What the Matrix did for virtual reality - Inception does for dreams and takes it even deeper. This is a film where spoilers might ruin your sense of wonder and discovery watching this film for the first time so I won't give you any. But what I will say is that if you took What Dreams May Come, crossed it with the Matrix, Mission Impossible, and threw in a good measure of a Phillip K. Dick quality science-fiction story - you would be heading in the right direction.The hype is real. You will not be disappointed. Go see this film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This Movie Deserves 10 and The NO.1 Spot.....,"This is not only the best movie ever made about dreams, it is also one of the best films of 2010, and certainly one of the most entertaining pictures I've seen in a decade.A groundbreaking, intriguing, exhilarating and brilliant sci-fi thriller that's destined to become a timeless classic. Mark my words: It will be remembered for years to come. Inception is elegantly realised.DiCaprio powerfully embodies a tortured soul while Gordon-Levitt has all the fun in the best action sequence. This is a drama built around ideas and images; it is a cinematic maze that Nolan makes his audience traverse in order to follow, understand and appreciate his world.It makes 'The Matrix' look like a Dick & Jane book.

WARNING : Nolan is putting an idea inside your mind !!!,"When I first saw the early 2009 trailer of this movie I was intrigued because I knew this time Nolan will not repeat himself in a brilliant breathtaking action movies like he made before in his new Batman or the deep thriller he represented in ""The Prestige"" or the mind-blowing ""Memento""No, This time Nolan will make his crown jewelry his own masterpiece.This time Nolan will teach us how to make a thriller-action-psycho-mind blowing with intelligent science tricks movie .And when I saw ""INCEPTION"" yesterday I wasn't disappointed. In the first few minutes you will be bolted in your chair trying to get the grasp of what is going on around you. I can only describe it as the same reaction when you first saw ""The Matrix"". There is certain rules going on you can't understand, which will begin to reveal its meanings after a while.Cobb ""Dicaprio"" is a strange character-reminds you of ""Teddy Daniels"" at his last "" Shutter Island""-his job is stealing the ideas from the industries' pioneers by tricking them in their dream state to reveal their secrets.This is the main character the film is all about, around him a clever cast of Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken watanabe, Dileep Rao and Michael caine to support him in his new ""mission impossible-like"" job.The job is instead of stealing an idea is to put a new one in the mind of a rich industry heir ""Cillian Murphy"" by putting him in a deep three level dream in order to reach to the core of his mind to plant this idea.During the film you will discover the danger they put themselves into by doing so, and that Cobb ""Dicaprio"" is hiding a secrets of his own. Also a several shift between different dreams happening in the same time away from what is happening in reality with a time perspective change which was a surreal experience.A twist of brilliant camera,visual,action & science tricks is the main theme of this movie, you can't trust any of your senses, you can't make the difference between dreams and reality, you are caught up in-between all the time. I can't describe it really only by that you don't know if you took the blue pill or the red one as like in ""The Matrix"", and maybe it is much worse because during the movie you won't know whether you are dreaming or watching a movie in a cinema - or maybe its just me - :)The final words that Nolan has answered the question of why the cinema won't die, by showing us that there is still a huge creative space waiting to be discovered.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My life changer,"Dear Christopher Nolan.Like Lenny feels compelled to search for the murderer of his wife in Memento considering even when he realizes the truth, as compelled have I been to write to you about a personal catharsis I've had and still am going through that you indirectly have contributed to help me define and following changing myself after immersivly enjoying Inception on a level I never thought possible.The playful ending with the top in Inception and the following endless discussions is simply reminded me of The Prestige; ""They want to be fooled"" and the mass audience are showing some weird and funny theories of reality and dreams regarding Inception. Incredible how a movie can mess with someones mind. Shame is that people don't discuss the brilliance of the movie as much as its ending. But perhaps thats what you aimed for, I have a radical notion. In some years to come perhaps the mass audience will look past the top and truly recognize the simple, yet powerful truth.Life now feels like a dream, I gotta be asleep to believe it. These past 9 months..so much have transpired. And I've been on and off about sending this letter. I could write a novel about what more has happened, and I think I will end up doing that someday. Its just hard as hell to remember where to begin. Im most happy my sister returned after living abroad for 10 years. And she and my mom have been my Ariadne's in the wake of this awakening.

He has been my superhero through my youth. I just did not understand the value in that he was carrying a mask to protect and shield his dearest ones. And am forever grateful for him, and I cannot delve into his soul like Bane did, because taking his mask off will most likely be catastrophic for everyone around him.

Wow...,"I haven't done a 'movie review' in a while, basically because we've had quite a lot of rubbish recently. Well, either rubbish, or clich√©s. Gone are the day's of the 90's, with great movies that were actually intelligent, like Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, Sixth Sense, and so on. Now all we seem to get is more of the same dumbed down movies, over and over again, and so on for the past decade (sure, there have been a few good movies here and there, but that's all they are, a 'few').This year seems to have made a comeback, though; is this decade going to be a good one for movies? Shutter's Island at the beginning of the year with it's crazy multiple psychological twist, trailers for Salt showing a clever WTF plot line, and just yesterday, Inception.Wow. It's not often I sit and watch a movie in the cinema gripping the edge of my seat, dreadfully anticipating the next few seconds. Not often that a movie ends and everyone in the cinema starts clapping.So what is this Inception business? Well, to actually review the movie without spoilers is kinda tough, and even though it's kind of immune to spoilers (telling you the ending would not take away from the story, as it's the point of 'how they got there', and even if I tell you 'how they got there' it would probably make you more confused) so if you haven't watched it yet, read until the ---Spoilers--- tag below. The movie has a cast that basically drove it to perfection; Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Marion Cotillard, and stars the lovely Leonardo DiCaprio, who got famous from the cheesy ""I'm the King of the World"" scene in Titanic (well, that and getting it on with Kate Winslet in the back of a steamy car). Let's just say back then he was a little, what's the word, soft.But over the years, he's gone from some young and pansy romantic actor into my top 10 list (along with Al Pacino, De Niro, Brad Pitt, etc), and again that's partly through his mind blowing performances in movies that again, blow your mind; from Gangs of New York, to The Departed, to the recent Shutter's Island, and now this? I must say, we're far off from that little kid back in Titanic.Inception is basically about dreams, how you can actually enter someone's dreams (through a physical connection while you both sleep), and from there steal hidden ideas and thoughts from their subconscious. DiCaprio plays an expert thief at that game, and along the way is forced to take a pretty tough mission (details of which I can't discuss, see spoiler part below).The acting was high quality, graphics amazing without making it seem over-done, and the plot-line way above anything you've seen in theatres over the past few years. This being said, it's not a movie most people won't get, but if you are a dumb viewer who can't grasp more than your typical straightforward storyline, don't bother watching this. I counted at least 8 people leaving the cinema half way through the movie. Many others would probably want to watch this a second time due to the complexity and number of levels this movie hits.I've always had a fascination with dreams, and how the dream world works in comparison to the real world; dreams within dreams, the time aspect of it, controlling your own dreams, or even being aware that you're actually in a dream - I wrote about this a while back, read it here (http://www.ammaro.com/2007/08/dreams-reality.html)It does raise multiple questions about your life, dreams, what is real and what isn't. I would go as far as say that it brings about that same feeling you get when you first watched 'The Matrix'. Everything in the real world seems kind of blurry for a while. And this movie makes you think, oh yes it makes you think. I couldn't find much to fault with it, except that even though the whole thing lasts about two and a half hours, I felt a few parts were rushed, and probably needed a little more development, while others dragged on a little. Overall, this didn't deter much from the enjoyment, I give this a 9/10, a definite must watch and so far the best movie of the year!Continued with spoilers at http://www.ammaro.com/2010/07/inception-2010.html",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
How does Christopher Nolan do it???,"I went into this movie with low expectations and once this film started, it took my expectations, strapped it to a rocket and took off. This film was by far one of the most creative, mind-blowing, drama driving, thrillers that I've seen in at least 5 years. The acting was very solid on all parts when it came to fear, solving problems, chemistry, and action. The score was magnificent, dark, deep, suspenseful, and very escalating. You find yourself at points of the film on the edge of your seat hoping that all the characters make it through okay, especially with their own unique talents and the actors made these characters seem so real that you'll have to pinch yourself and make sure that you are not the one that is in the dream world. I will see this movie at least 2 more times and I will not be surprised if it wins one or two Oscars at least.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Dreams are not even %50 human mind control... Seeing the Inception from a more realistic, Tarkovsky perspective","~MY REVIEW CONTAINS SEVERAL REFERENCES TO TARKOVSKY, A QUOTATION FROM ROGER EBERT AND ANOTHER FROM CHRISTOPHER NOLAN'S INCEPTION SCRIPT (for detailed info check below the end of this article)~Ideas need to be enriched while the roots are kept loyal, especially in Sci-Fi. Above everything else, aware of the fact that while the story is taking place in several dimensions of dreams, there is no link to the real-life. My first point is about this huge story development deficiency. The only link to our universal earth dimension is Michael Caine character and the children, and they're frozen, they're playing out there in the garden, we see from behind. This is the first thing why the whole movie is para-psychologically inappropriate.I said para-psychologically inappropriate, 'cos today psychology is in the point that dreams expose supernatural(or meta-physical) skills of human mind. If you are implanting an idea through a dream into someone's mind, it's not that easy, THE BALANCE OF NATURE WOULDN'T EASILY LET YOU DO THAT. As an example I want to compare the Inception with ""The Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind"". There, Jim Carrey was going back time in his dream trying to identify the person who is dating with his fianc√©e; but he ends up with facing a supernatural vitality covering the person's face. The way Nolan explains is this: *(1)* ""Never recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new places.""When the time comes where Saito explains why he hired Cobb for the implantation, this is all we get: *(2)* ""You remind me of someone... a man I met in a half-remembered dream. He was possessed of some radical notions"" So the most important question one ever needs to ask ""How did they all start to dream implantation?"". There is no answer nor explanation to it. Whereas in its ancestor, ""The Minority Report"" was quite brilliant at explaining the technological advance.Compare with Matrix, the dreams are your guides to the reality, you're not a guide to someone's dream. Matrix gives you a clue of understanding how some people's lives may change with their dreams and visions. It had this inspiration that Neo became a hero out of a loser. Dreams are able to do that, as Wachowski Brothers taught us. Another comparison can be done with the good and evil side. Nolan never divides people into good vs. evil as Batman or as Memento or any films he's done. But for someone's favor, Cobb is hired by business man to implant an idea into another business man, which doesn't do any thing with the good. *(3)* ""The only condition of fighting for the right to create is faith in your own vocation, readiness to serve, and refusal to compromise""Sci-Fi loves impossible, but it also denies the practical errors. Inception's plot is theoretically fine but practically slow off the mark.Just like Roger Ebert said at Chicago Sun, Inception's story can either be told in a few sentences or not told at all. Ebert's approach to criticize Nolan's earlier work was even more harsh. *(4)* ""How does a man with short-term memory loss, remember he has short-term memory loss?"" (for Memento). Some injuries can go engraved someone's sub-conscious, so he didn't even need to remember it, he was just living it. Though Ebert was right on one thing, that if Ellen Page hasn't been enrolled in the movie as a new chosen one to this confidential job, the whole movie was almost meaning nonsense.The things that are likable is Marion Cotillard participating as a independent virus in dreams, going in and killing whoever and whenever she likes. Ellen Page is being used to create spaces in dreams, so that the missionaries will be able to create totems that tell a person whether they're dreaming or living the reality. The only totem without Ellen Page was the spinning of the whipping top in the sleep house. Also the last dream which Di Caprio is having on the airplane was cut in the half as if it was meant for to be continued. It was the only dream that made me believe that someone is dreaming, whether it's Cobb or Arthur or any of the missionaries.

So much less intelligent than it seems,"Ten years ago, Christopher Nolan wrote and directed the brilliant 'Momento', a stunning thriller that pushed the boundaries of storytelling convention. It was great, but still, one couldn't help wondering, where would Nolan go from here? How could he trump this achievement? In fact, although his subsequent films have been praised, they've been less distinctive, but with 'Inception', he returns to his adventurous roots, producing a story that is even more audacious than 'Momento'; and unfortunately, the result is dreadful. And worse than the fact that it doesn't really work is the fact that while it is distinctive, it is distinctive in a very conventional way. Since his early success, Nolan has taken work from big studios, and 'Inception' is no exception; and the result is a Hollywood movie straining desperately to stand out, instead of something more truly independent. in spirit.To make the point in more detail, 'Inception' features a starry cast (I'm, afraid for me, the casting of Leonardo diCaprio has become a clear sign of a poor film with pretensions); an implausibly attractive geeky female assistant; loads of expository dialogue (at one point, it is explained that someone is the most powerful media baron in the world ‚Äì i.e. they appear to be so powerful that no-one had heard of them); fast pace and Jason Bourne style camera work; sub-'Matrix' style ideas about the nature of reality, superficially intriguing and certainly confusing, but of little philosophical depth; extraordinary special effects; and above all else, a plot comprising an incoherent sequence of random set-piece scenes that seems constructed to showcase said special effects rather than because it makes sense as a story. It may sound like an intriguing idea to have the cast simultaneously fighting for their lives in seven different nested dream-spaces, but in fact, it isn't; multiplying the threat to the heroes only reduces the dramatic impact of each one.To give Nolan credit, he has made a wholly cinematic film; you certainly couldn't imagine this in book form. Sadly it's very hard to imagine it as a screenplay either, or as any sort of story. And it was story, not special effects, that made 'Momento' great; and while that story was highly unusual, it made internal sense. But less is never more in Hollywood; and sadly, more is often just a mess.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not Your Typical, Brainless Summer Movie","Inception (2010)*** 1/2 (out of 4)The ""kiss"" platform of recent years to keep it simple and stupid has pretty much ruined movies to a point as it's rare when one can walk into a movie and have a real workout on your brain. Sure, our eyes and ears are treated to amazing sites and loud noises each and every week and some would say this causes the brain just to lose any type of reality, which might be the reason certain people (cough Lohan, Hilton and countless others) are able to be hot stories while better, more worthwhile events are simply overlooked. If one doesn't want to use their brain then it's best to stay away from this thing. It's best not to know too much about the story but it deals with a troubled man (Leonardo DiCaprio) who has made it a job to break into people's dreams and steal their ideas. However, due to a personal tragedy, he is forced to take a job doing the opposite, which is breaking into a man's dream to plant an idea. That's pretty much all you need to know, storywise, as director/writer Nolan will deliver the rest and while the end result wasn't a pure masterpiece to me, there's no way you can deny the power it does contain. Dreams have always played an interesting part in movies but no other has taken you this far into them and delivered such incredible ideas. Not only does the screenplay deliver a lot to think about but we also get plenty of action and amazing scenes of destruction. The trailer showed people just a little pinch of a city turning upside down but seeing the full sequence was something truly amazing. Other amazing sequences was the entire final hour when our group of dream breakers must enter a multiple layer of dreams with one damaging effect after another. If you're familiar with Nolan then you already know what he can do and there's no question the man has talent but it is something special that a film like this could be pulled off at all. When you're dealing with multiple characters in multiple spaces and in multiple dream zones it would be easy and common for things to just fall apart under their own weight. It's very difficult to keep you guessing from one moment to another without things either falling apart or getting so complicated that the viewer simply gives up on the film and moves on. The amazing thing is that Nolan never lets up on the gas and instead just delivers one more bit of story on top of the next and I thought it was amazing that he could keep the viewing coming along for the ride and never lose us. I think some people are going to not understand what's going on or be able to figure out the multiple levels but when you kick back and think about what you've seen I think most will see that the maze had an entrance and an exit and nothing came as a cheat. DiCaprio delivers yet another wonderful performance but he's got a terrific cast around him including Ellen Page, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Cilliam Murphy, Pete Postlethwaite and a great return from Tom Berenger. Each actor does fine work in their roles and certainly help the story move along. The nature of the story is a very good one but the visual effects are just as good. Looking at all the action and amazing effects makes one really appreciate the acting, directing and story even more simply because they didn't get lost behind everything else that was going on. I don't think there's any question that one needs more than a single viewing to catch everything happening here but that's certainly not a bad thing since each viewing will deliver bits and pieces that will probably take the film into directions that you didn't think were there.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stunning,"Don't read a single iota of plot about this. Watch it. What I will tell you is that DiCaprio may not have been better and is getting better the older he gets, the rest of the cast are amazing (especially Tom Hardy and Gordon-Levitt), the cinematography is at times breathtaking, Hans Zimmer's score is intoxicating (with Johnny Marr on guitar), and it travels across continents like a Bond movie. Oh yeah, and it's really, really loud in parts. But this is about Christopher Nolan again. He has crafted a serious adult thriller that happens to have exhilarating action sequences that, importantly, don't detract from the emotional content and a plot you will have to sit and think about.

Inception demands your full attention to grasp its intricacies; it requires active engagement and a willingness to navigate its twists and turns. Some may find its complexity overwhelming.Inception is a cinematic marvel that pushes the boundaries of storytelling. Does it qualify as what is known as a ""masterpiece?"" Yes. However, SOMETHING, just something, held me back from a 10/10 rating. I'm not quite sure what, but there's just something small missing to get it to that perfect rating.In conclusion, would I watch it a second time? Yes. Would I recommend you to watch it for the first time? Yes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is not Sci-Fi Movie It's REAL,"This is not Sci-Fi Movie It's REAL and the director of that movie know this very well. Its Dream Walking State. And what is funny that This happened to me before 5 years. The Dreams are not just Dreams. this is My DRAM Short:I dream very interesting dream before around 5 years So what i dream exactly is I was in one place with my Uncle and my Father. And we speak different things, also after a while i quarrel With my Father and after this i just Wake up.So when i wake up drink some coffee and after few minutes i was going on my Uncle Home to see what they do etc.. like normal. When i come at his Home.. he look at me and told me.. ""What you dream Ysterday"" and looking me strange, for few seconds i just was totally shocked and i was sure that he know about my dream. After this he explained me without to know anything before, he told me what i TOLD to him and what i told to my Father every single word.. and also he remember the position of everyone.. like you was here i was there you told me this, he told me that and etc..So its very wired that he was on the same time, on the same place in the Dream and also know what exactly i told to him and remember it.. i remember the whole dream also..was like real i can feel the air the bird everything. And that not all after around 4-5 days later I saw my Father and YES he had absolutely the same DREAM and yes he remember too every word what i told to him what he told me and the position of eveybody...How is possible 3 Peoples to dream exactly the same Dream on the same time and also to have conversation of this dream and everybody to remember the conversation and etc!?Thats it.Is well know as Dream Walker and the therm mean that for example YOU can conect with everybody you want no matter how far is he/she and to do whatever you want with them u can talk with them you can take them with you and create a different world.After the dream one day i watch ""Inception"" and i was shoked because everything inside the movie was like my dream i mean they just show in the movie that they are Dream Walkers and i was sure that the producent of that movie know very well for what about is this movie is not just a Sci Fi movie its a real deal but the people will not understand it only the few who know and have this experience already. And all the people say well super stupid movie we don't understand anything at all how to explain them that this is REAL and the movie is not a Sci Fi and the same happened to me in the real life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It is unfair. No one has the rights to play with the audience's mind like that! Nolan continues to amaze us.,"This movie must quite literally be a DREAM come true for many.First, for Mr.Nolan himself. If he is by any chance watching the screening of the movie amongst general public, he must be delighted with the fact that: 50% of the audience would be simply spellbound, 40% must be scratching their heads till they start balding, 10% would be shouting ""I hate Mr.Nolan"", for he took them into a maze that lasted for 150 minutes and did not tell them the way out of it. Sheer genius! Is he a human being at all? Then, for the cast. If they ever had dreams of acting in roles that are so complete and original in every possible sense, then they can stop acting now and retire, for all they can dream of has been achieved in a single movie. Hats off to the entire cast! Last but never the least, for us - the audience. This is what we secretly hope when we buy a ticket for a movie, that we get our money's worth, for every cent we pay for. I am pretty sure most people wont even hesitate to pay for the second time to watch the masterpiece that is Inception.And oh by the way, Spoilers? Ha-ha! If you have not watched the movie, do not worry a jot. No amount of spoilers can reveal the actual story. This movie is beyond all that. Just make sure you go in with a open mind, because when you come out of the theater, I bet you would have thousands of ideas running around in your head like headless chicken!It is a movie experience unparalleled! We doff our hat in respect Mr.Nolan, for your Idea has been etched onto our mind, probably forever. You Sir, have achieved Inception.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Overrated, over-hyped, over here","Read the films ranked below Inception in the top 250...and weep. Have people lost their critical faculties? Yes, Inception is clever, multi-layered, complex and intellectually challenging. It is also heartless. It struggles to stimulate emotion. Cleverness replaces impact. Di Caprio's one-dimensional acting reinforces this sterility. From the first shot of a grim face we get the whole range of grim faces in a grim performance. He is grim about his kids, grim about the folding graphics, grim about his team, grim about the task in hand. Of the Matrix- plus effect I did like the folding city, but the ending was portentous to the point of tedium. One very good litmus test of the quality of a film is to analyse how many times the main protagonists have to explain the plot and at what length they have to explain it. Several characters explain the rules of the dream within a dream within a dream construct at the heart of the movie, with increasing loquaciousness and qualifications. This isn't plotting and it fails to create a genuine narrative drive. Compare it to so many of the films that come below this one in the rankings, Twelve Angry Men, Seven Samurai, Goodfellas, Casablanca, Once upon a time in America, Citizen Kane for goodness' sake. Don't even mention films like Shawshank and the Godfather which rank above it. This is a good film, possibly one of the better films of the year. It is a very long way from a great one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A fake ""thinking person's movie""","I cannot phrase it better, so I will quote Rex Reed who called Inception's storyline ""prattling drivel."" A friend claimed Inception is a ""thinking person's movie"", but a thinking person will realize that it is only masquerading as a thinking person's movie. At bottom, intellectually, ""there is no there there."" Add to this that someone clearly believed the film needed to be pumped up with overwrought drama to qualify it as a ""summer blockbuster."" I couldn't wait for it to end, and when it did, the intrusiveness of the loud, schlocky music over the closing credits seemed to crystallize all the incipient negative feelings I had been having throughout the movie. I hope that this director will go back to doing smaller films that do not stretch his concepts beyond what they can support.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
**A Mind-Bending Journey Through Dreams**,"Christopher Nolan's *Inception* is an exhilarating sci-fi thriller that challenges the boundaries of reality and perception. Released in 2010, the film has since become a landmark in contemporary cinema due to its intricate plot, breathtaking visuals, and thought-provoking themes.At the center of the story is Dom Cobb (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled thief who specializes in extracting valuable secrets from the subconscious of his targets while they dream. Cobb is offered a chance at redemption when he is tasked with the seemingly impossible mission of ""inception"" - implanting an idea into someone's mind without their awareness. To accomplish this, he assembles a talented team of specialists, each bringing unique skills to navigate the layered and often treacherous landscapes of dreams.The film's structure is both innovative and complex, as it unfolds across various dream levels, each with its own rules and physics. Nolan expertly balances action and exposition, ensuring that audiences remain engaged without feeling overwhelmed. The pacing is meticulously crafted, leading to a crescendo of tension and excitement as the stakes heighten.Visually, *Inception* is a feast for the eyes, featuring stunning special effects that reimagine reality in inventive and surreal ways, from bending cityscapes to zero-gravity fight sequences. Hans Zimmer's powerful score complements the visuals perfectly, enhancing the emotional weight and urgency of the narrative.Beyond its technical achievements, *Inception* raises profound questions about dreams, memory, and the nature of reality. The film invites viewers to contemplate the complexities of the mind and how our perceptions shape our experiences. Each viewing offers new insights, encouraging deep reflection long after the credits roll.Overall, *Inception* is a groundbreaking cinematic experience that combines intellectual depth with gripping entertainment. It engages audiences on multiple levels, making it a film that rewards those willing to dive into its labyrinthine plot. For anyone who enjoys a thought-provoking thrill ride, this film is a must-watch that redefines the possibilities of storytelling in cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just like a dream... this is pure creativity on display!,"This movie never gets old! Of Christopher Nolan's movies, it is the one i have watched the most outside of The Dark Knight! This really feels like a movie that only he could make! A mind bogling mix of ideas and creativity, as the concept of dreams are told to the viewer in a way, so that it never becomes too much! This is one of those movies that hooks you from beginning to end!The plot is engaging and you never know what to expect as the movie builds up and becomes more and more intense and thrilling! This is also a journey of guilt, confronting yourselves and learning to move on! Directing is amazing with some truelly iconic scenes such as the hallway fight which is expertly made and filmed! Soundtrack is equally great and iconic!Great actors who all does a great job! Lots of talent! The ending still remains one of my favorite movie endings of all time! This is a once in a lifetime experience that you dont wanna miss!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I thought it was overdone.,"It went too big. Personally there was just something wrong with Nolan's interpretation of the whole dream thing. I got uber bored and i thought most of the stuff was too predictable. People were freaking out saying this was the best film ever and it was mind-blowing and all that jazz. i FELT THERE WERE TO MANY PLOT HOLES AND GOT SICK OF THE FILM ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH. It was truly not even remotely as good as it was made out to be. 1. It wasn't as good as it was supposed to be. 2. I didn't end up liking any of the characters that much. 3. Nolan's fan-boys get on my nerves. 4. I have a friend who obnoxiously is obsessed with Nolan, and that makes me biased. 5. I had higher expectations based on Nolan's previous films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A film that is, in and of itself, a puzzle","From Memento, to The Prestige, to The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan is quickly becoming one of the premiere directors of intellectual, yet crowd-pleasing entertainment. Now, just to jump right in, Inception continues this trend, while demonstrating more creativity than perhaps any of his other films.If there's one complaint that I can imagine people having over this film, it's that the plot can be particularly difficult to follow. And while I feel that this is true to some extent, that's because Inception is, in and of itself, a puzzle. All of the pieces are presented to you, and solving it depends not so much on intelligence, but on whether or not you find that sort of element appealing in a movie. It's a film in which much of the dialogue is spent simply explaining the rules of this complex dream world, and therefore demands that you be wide awake.Even so, there had still better be an endearing cast of characters to follow, especially with this being a two-and-a-half hour experience, and thankfully, Inception delivers. While none of them, outside of DiCaprio's character, have much back story to speak of, they all feature exceptionally likable personalities, so by the time that the stirring climax hit, I was concerned about the fate of each and every one of them. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance as DiCaprio's right-hand man, Arthur, blew me away in particular. The guy doesn't have a ton of screen time, but damn, does he leave an impression!Ultimately, however, Inception is the story of DiCaprio's character, Cobb. Now, I won't say much, as giving any plot details outside of the synopsis would be a crime, but suffice it to say, it's some pretty engrossing stuff, and DiCaprio definitely brings his A-game here.Also, as expected, Hans Zimmer proves once again that he is the boss when it comes to musical scores, as each scene is enhanced tremendously by his material. He's the sort of musician who can make even the simplest of actions seem more important than anything else that's happened in human history. If only you, sir, could score my life.With its challenging narrative structure, likable characters (if somewhat lacking in depth), and sheer visual splendor, Inception is easily among my favorite movies of the year, second only to Pixar's latest classic. It's been a rough summer movie season, and while we've still got quite a few weeks left before it's officially over, Inception succeeded in reminding me why I dig this medium so much.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"If you dream inside a dream and wake up, you'r still dreaming !","The movie is about manipulation of dreams and how it can impact a person's psyche. Caprio, in this movie is a kind of dream terrorist, who as a profession extracts information from people's mind. This is espionage of new times and he has become notoriously popular for this. However, for the last time when he undertakes a job of planting an idea into the mind of an heir to a giant business empire (Cillian Murphy ); things go wrong.I am disappointed by the script. The movie is conceptually flawed. First of all, how can you dream inside a dream, I mean how one transitions into next level of 'sleepiness'. Even if one could, why the machine used to coordinate the dreams also appears the same in the dream and works also. Why one would age in a dream; I thought in a dream the appearance of oneself is the mental projection of the memory of oneself.Same genre has been portrayed by ""Paprika"" beautifully and is much more consistent and meaningful than this version of a dream-control fantasy.First act was a bit interesting, but the plot goes haywire towards the end; lost in an attempt to incorporate useless actions scenes. Ending was as terrible as one would expect after watching the trifling second act. Trying to give an inconclusive end was a bit pathetic after what has been done to original 'idea'. There was no 'original inspiration' in this movie. By the end of it, I was in level 5.Certainly a bad one from Nolan. This not nearly as good as ""Following"" or ""Prestige"". No surreal element; twisting the city was a fleeting attempt though.Watchable once and that too would be worthwhile only on a big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Thick and Unnecessarily ""Complicated""","Style over Substance might be a Knee-Jerk Negative Reaction to this Messy Film. But that would be Kind. There is no Style or Substance to Waste many Brain-Cells Considering. The Movie's Conceit is to make You want to Think. Think Not.It tries so Very Hard with its Explanations about Dreams (don't do a drinking game taking a shot every time the word dream is mentioned, you will be dead by intermission). Also Wordy, Incomprehensible Insertions about the Teams ""Method"" used here to Infiltrate and Control the Minds of Corporate Clients (now there is a group we can morally support).This is so Unnecessarily Complicated that it causes Viewer Fatigue, and by Proximation Sleepiness, early on and Waking Up or Recovering from that is not a Given. The Result is just not Caring about Anyone or Anything that is happening on the Screen. What is happening is kind of Drab and Dull for a Dreamscape.If you buy the Premise and go along for the Ride, better fasten your Seat-Belts because it is anything but Smooth. It Bumps and Jumps from Dream to Dream and Layer upon Layer of Intellectual Gobbledygook that is so Very Uninteresting and Without much Pathos. The Music is forever in Swelling Mode and Ripples throughout and is Pretentious and Intrusive.In the End, some have trouble making it that far, there is a ""you decide"" Twist that is not really a Twist because, after all, You Decide.

the most complete grand-scale entertainment movie ever.............,"Without exaggeration,i can say I had never waited for anything in my life like i waited for Inception.I was keeping update of every single development and news about the movie,i can say i was getting hysterical ,and the reasons are quite clear as both my favorite actor and director of my generation ,Leonardo Di Caprio and Christopher Nolan come together ,my favorite newcomer actors Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Lewitt they are all together in one movie,it is like a dream come true and the movie itself explores the world of Dreams,the boundless world of dreams where you are free from any limitation of real world to imagine and create anything you want.It is action,sci-fi,romance,you find everything here,every grand scale entertainment that we experience from watching different movies brought in a single movie(as Chris Nolan said),a movie we all dreamt about and Christopher Nolan made it real.When the movie released and after reading dozens of reviews,i came to decision that i will not see this movie till the hypes get over so that i could make own point-of-view on the movie.But i was unable to control myself.Now,the movie has released in my city,the dubbed version actually,in Hindi and they also renamed it in Hindi as ""Chakravyuha"" which means ""Labyrinth"" which also seemed quite sensible to me.The dubbing was perfect,with brilliant translation and synchronization, and the selection of voices for actors were also fantastic.In short,they didn't spoiled the movie like they did to Harry Potter and Avatar .We watched the movie in empty cinema hall(there were only 40-50 peoples present in the capacity of 300) which was not surprising for me,as no one care much about Christopher Nolan movies here,except few movie aficionados like me.Watching Inception was the experience like seeing a miracle from you own eyes ,a entertainment for your mind, body and soul.This movie satisfied me completely from every point of view,like i said before this movie is a complete package,this movie makes us think deeply and explores subconscious of human mind and make us realize the power of it.The completely original and personal work of Christopher Nolan with some inevitable influences of other movies like Matrix but this doesn't make this movie unoriginal ,the idea of traveling into the subconscious of human's mind and steal his idea or even seeding an idea in his subconscious is completely new,mind-blowing and ground-breaking concept,the brilliant action and chasing sequences maintained adrenalin rush in your body,and also a very heart-touching love story that doesn't seemed out-of-place but the vital part of the movie.This brilliant concept get the full support from Warner Bros. who can take such a high risk and give full freedom to their director,grand scale production which made the sets and special effects looks so real. Brilliant performances from every single cast as they were portraying the beautifully created characters with such depth that made their work very challenging.The soundtrack of the movie is mesmerizing and added great feel to the movie.Inception may not be the best,may not be the most perfect and flawless movie ever made but certainly it is the most complete grand scale entertainment movie,so far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I loved Memento..Prestige, I had to watch it twice to understand it.I have seen dreams inside dreams inside dreams, so I got the movie from the moment it started.

He is hiding his subconscious guilt and still playing the game of inception with his team members. This is the most difficult job he has to do and all the time he is haunted by his wife. The movie is understandable. Leonardo Dicaprio's one of the best performance after The Blood Diamond. Ellen Page is absolutely the character Nolan wanted from her. She is a brilliant architect and also curious about all the mysteries that goes around Cobb's life. This is the first movie I have seen of Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

"Dream On, Dream Until Yore Dream Comes True!","Inception is the most innovative and creative film I've ever seen. THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE! In fact, telling anyone a thing not known from a trailer ... well I'd feel like a jerk. Inception is about technology that can invade peoples mind for numerous reasons. Christopher Nolan ( Writer and Director ) goes above and beyond exploring the process, exploring the mind, and exploring the concepts, possibilities, and well... dreams.Everyone praises James Cameron as the master of visual effects and whatnot. After seeing Inception I'm inclined to believe that from everything but a technical standpoint, James Cameron can only dream of making visual effects that come even close to evoking the type and magnitude of emotions that Inception can. Inception is absolutely awe-inspiring in scope. it's not a summer blockbuster thrill-ride, or an emotional roller-coaster, it's the absolute best aspects of both.The script and acting are all phenomenal. Dicaprio gives not an only an Oscar worthy performance but his best performance ever. it's not all about Dicaprio though as he is surrounded by an ensemble cast with names such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, and many more. More importantly, their performances too are incredible. The original score by Hans Zimmer is as usual outstanding and amplifies the intensity and emotion within every scene.With and outstanding creative and innovative plot that's massive in scope with substance and a number of eye popping visual effects that will be forever planted in your mind, amazing direction and acting, and an amazing score, there is no reason not to watch Inception. Yes the story is very complex but at the same time everything that's important is easy to grasp. 2 views isn't necessary but it's worth it. hell, 10 views are worth it.Chris Nolan is no longer chasing directors like Kubrick, Tarantino, or Scorcese. Chris Nolan is now #1. Between Memento, The Dark Knight, and Inception, Chris Nolan is the greatest director of our time, one of the best ever, and one of the most important directors ever.Inception is simply one of the best films ever made and one of about 5-10 movies i'd ever give an absolute perfect10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not A Dream,"I went into this movie expecting one of the best movies of all time. However, that is not what I saw. The runtime is extremely long and I found myself checking the time several times throughout the film. It was an interesting film to see, but it definitely does not belong on a list with the likes of ""Shawshank"" or ""Godfather"". The story was very confusing.There seemed to be plot holes and loose story lines that were never really tied up. The concept of the film is very intriguing and you will leave the theater wondering what it was all about. However, the atmosphere of some of the scenes felt very similar to Shutter Island for me. I almost felt like Leonardo DiCaprio did not really have to act much as he was basically playing a character similar to that of Teddy Daniels. Hope he isn't going to spend the rest of his career playing that same character. It was also nice to see Ellen Page in something besides Juno. She can be more than a snarky, pregnant teenager. Also, The visual effects are extremely well-done.I am not a fan of Nolan's work. The Dark Knight was a film that I could never understand why there was so much hype. It was average to me, at best. Inception, however, is much better than Memento.It is a film that you must see just because the concept is very interesting, but it is not something that you can watch over and over again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overlong and Overrated,"I don't get all the positive reviews for this movie. I found it overlong and I could not find a reason to care about any of the characters. Technically speaking, there was no true heroic character, as it was a bunch of technologically-advanced criminals and their victims. At several points during the movie I was pleading ""Go home! Go home!"" It had a decent idea but I have to think that Rod Serling (RIP) probably could have done a much better job with this and he would have done it in a shorter time. I really think the writers and producers could have made a tighter film with better and more interesting characters.

This is a'Maze'ing movie,"The moving is a'Maze'ing and you will come out of the maze (read cinema) in just a tad less than 2 and half hours, fully refreshed and satisfied. Watched the first show of the day at 12 noon (India Time) which I guess means it is yet to be released in US while I am writing the review.Another DiCaprio thriller after Shutter Island and that too in the same year. DiCaprio has done just 11 movies since Titanic came out in 1997 and probably you can name them all, he is that selective). Too good to be true. Actually it is too good as although you cant and shouldn't compare, Christopher Nolan has matched Martin Scorsese and has probably outdone himself compared to TDK. Forget the complexity about the plot of a dream within a dream within a dream, what will linger are the amazing visuals caught in slo-mo. Everything seems to fall in place like a Swiss watch that by the end of the movie all your questions and 'how did that' gets answered.There is a lot of similarity between Inception and Shutter Island and the similarity is that they are like North and South Poles. That different yet nonetheless they are poles, right.I do not want to give the story one bit because that is the beauty of this movie's concept, the story unfolds with almost every scene and there is always the suspense that the story just might take a dramatic turn in each frame and does it take the turn or turns? Well, go watch for yourself and you will feel like writing a review yourself.All the actors are good and plays to the character, but the thing is the movie is so damn brilliant, I guess Nolan could have just about cast anybody and it would still have turned out a'Maze'ing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good idea but crushed ms by poor acting,"Saw it in cinemas a week after opening night or so. I couldn't keep off the 8 vote though i feel its a bit high.Short about the movie before i review it. Cobb - the main character, played by Leonardo Di Caprio, is a former architect and accused for throwing his wife out the window - literally, is trying to clean his record with the police by doing a job for a powerful acquaintance(Ken Watanabe - Saito) that involves dreamexorcism and the like. While struggling with the mystic relationship with his former wife he puts together a team of specialists to handle the job. Ellen Page plays Ariadne, the gifted young architect. Tom Hardy plays Eames, the 'impersonator' if you will. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Arthur, in charge of the technical aspects. They are all there to trick Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) big time. By taking him through three levels of dreaming they hope to alter the very core of his motivation and change his future plans as a result. You will have the rest explained to you, don't worry about that.I've heard people saying they have to watch the movie 3-4 times before understanding the story in full. In my opinion you have almost everything explained to you just as it happens. This comes through in discussions among the characters or with the camera itself. To clarify, if you have to think about something for a moment because you didn't understand it fully the characters in the movie interrupts your thought process by explaining exactly what just happened. I don't mean to sound arrogant at all but I have this problem with movies that tries to reach out to everyone at once. If the aim is to include every watcher they obviously have to explain things over and over in different ways. I totally get that but it doesn't fit well with a movie like this one, it takes all the thought provocation and mysticism out.I don't know if it was the overall Hollywood-humorous-mood of the movie that made it difficult for me to take the characters seriously or if it was just poor portraiting from the actors. It seemed more of a kindergarten with Leonardo, the grownup, running around trying to calm down the kids - Ellen and Joseph. More of a Harry Potter cast feeling to it Im afraid. Im also disappointed to say that Leo had his worst performance in a long time, if not ever. I'd think the manuscript was aiming for a very emotionally moving struggle for the main character. However Cobbs little misadventures wasn't moving me one inch. Leos acting felt empty and almost fake.Nolan tries to feed the watcher with a bit of everything, romance, humour, action, sci-fi and psychology all at the same time but falls short in every area. The actionscenes and animations are great though, in line with almost all new movies from Hollywood these days. This to me unfortunately makes Inception more of a hardcore actionmovie than the thought provoking masterpiece I was hoping for.Now if you are one not particularly annoyed by areas discussed above you wont be disappointed with Inception, you wont be anyway. The ideas behind it are new, very interesting and thought provoking. I think people will start investigating and experimenting with their dreams just a bit more after seeing Inception.I know I do, and I like it :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
inception-holic,"After watching the midnight premiere, my friends and I came up with a theory behind Christopher Nolan and his Inception movie. While he was making Inception Christopher Nolan needed more funding therefore he decided to make the Dark Knight. Sadly Heath Ledger passed away but his death brought more fame and fortune than Nolan expected. He was planning on reusing ALL actors in the Dark Knight but Christian Baile went on a drama-queen rampage on set against the lighting director causing Nolan to lean towards DiCaprio as his lead. (This came about because Nolan happened to be sipping tea with Scorsese one lovely evening, discussing Shutter Island and how fantastically adorable DiCaprio was in thrillers.) The Dark Knight was at best a side project because what Director Christopher Nolan REALLY had in mind was to F*** with our sense of reality through HIS thriller, Inception.No movie has ever caused me physical pain except this one. i was cringing from suspense. Every muscle in my body ached. my lungs were collapsed and when i tried to stand up after the credits i just couldn't. i just could not BREATHE. my eyes still sting. why? because the entire movie, my eyes were GLUED to the screen and i probably blinked, oh lets say, ZERO times. driving back from the theater, i lost my voice raving about the movie with my friends. and Hans Zimmer? i made my own Hollywood Star for him in the backyard. the grass spell out his name. i loved this movie. Pick and pull at it all you want, it was fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
""" An Epic Called INCEPTION ""","After experiencing NOLAN's earlier works(The Prestige, Memento & Dark Knight) i actually have a faith on INCEPTION. And guess what..... i was absolutely right. INCEPTION is by most NOLAN's finest combination of storytelling & action at the same time with same pace. The amazing concept of dreams and thieves mixed up in a very cinematic way that take your breath away. The very first frame of the movie itself told the audiences that they are watching something extraordinary. HANZ ZIMMER awesome BG score keeps the movie alive and fantastic Visual Fx makes it more real and terrific in every sense......so DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR... go and watch INCEPTION.........",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dreamy !!,"In this movie, Nolan picks up the Freudian Theory of dream and pens an intelligent and surreal script from it although he seems to borrow some of this ideas from a Japanese anime movie Paprika. However, to condemn this movie as a Hollywood CGI polished ripoff of Paprika is preposterous. Inception stands on his own because it has an entirely different plot and characters.The best thing about this movie are the settings, with a ton of dream within a dream within a dream worlds, for me at least Nolan successfully presents us with a fairly coherent state of one's dream (coherent enough to be filmed with CGI at least) without losing the glorious incomprehensibleness of dream itself. However, sadly all of the best CGIs and dream worlds stuffs here on this movie has been spoiled in the trailer, the folding city, the zero gravity hotel room and the icy fortresses.The acting quality of what could be considered the best all-star casts in any 2010 movie complements the set and plot nicely without any particular character chewing the scenery. However, somewhat annoyingly in my opinion DiCaprio's acting falls short and feels a little bit dull compared to the sheer awesomeness of the environment. His character seems distracted and somewhat bored throughout the movie. His inner struggle projected in the dream settings throughout the movie in my opinion totally distracts the flow of the plot and completely unnecessary since we have already seen DiCaprio struggles against his own mental projection and questioning reality in another movie. Shutter ** cough.. cough..Now that I've written three paragraphs about this movie, I felt that I'm somehow being to harsh. This is a really good movie, for me it holds a respectable second best movie in 2010 after Toy Story 3 and definitely a top 10 movie in this decade. The action is really intense and the dream worlds presented by Nolan are really top notch. Although the sub-plot DiCaprio's mental stuff kinda drags a little bit, it doesn't decrease the sheer volatile awesomeness of this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nolan is a master now.,"Upon reviewing the ""Dark knight"" I had said that a director such as Nolan was being wasted in Batman sequels, regardless of their quality. And that was because Nolan is one the few directors in Hollywood able to create something truly original and as such should not be adding branches to fully grown trees.""Inception"" proves the validity of my claim, but it does so in ways that surprised me.Perhaps the most immediate distinction between ""Inception"" and the ""Dark Knight"" is an improved sense of pacing. It doesn't feel like narrative put in a blender like the batman movie did: despite its scope, each scene is warranted plenty of time and the use of more traditional associative cuts allow it to flow better.The movie itself is difficult to describe,which is a non-issue because it requires itself to be experienced to be understood.Another area Nolan seems to be grasping is in directing actors: I always liked Leonardo DiCaprio, but his mannerisms at times can be the thing obstructing a good actor from becoming great. In ""Inception"", all his mannerisms are gone and this is finest performance ever.The special effects are incredibly well done, which means they don't look like CGI, even when they are. However, one of its greatest technical achievements is the sound editing, perfectly balancing the several momentums of the scenes.Wishing to provide no spoilers at all, I'll just say it isn't nearly as complicated as some have named it, but it is a complex concept.I cannot compliment this movie enough. It is the most engaging film experience I have had in a long, long, long time. My advice is don't miss it in the theaters. Don't miss it when it come to DVD. Don't miss it any chance you get.You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One Of The Best Films I've Ever Seen!,"Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' is amongst the Best Films Ever Made! Usually, films have their share of minuses and flaws... surprise, surprise, surprise, 'Inception' is the first film since 'The Shawshank Redemption' that stabs words like ""Flaw"" and ""Minus""!Nolan's lucid dream is brought to life with 'Inception'. What happens when you enter the World of Dreams and it's motives, is so unusual, so interesting, so gripping and so amazing... that your left asking for more. By now, you know what this Masterstorke is about, but believe me... you have no idea what's in store for you! 'Inception' grabs your attention from the very start, and as mentioned before, leaves you awe-struck. And yes, 'Inception' packs in THE Best Climax Ever! It's simply astounding!!Nolan makes his careers best film in 'Inception'. His screenplay is EPIC, and his direction should land him an Academy-Award for Best Director! Wally Pfister's cinematography is sure to compliment him with numerous awards in the coming time. Music by Hans Zimmer, as always, is perfect.Each and Every Actor excels over-here: Leonardo DiCaprio takes the lead and steals the show. The star-actor becomes Dom Cobb, and delivers a memorable performance. Ellen Page is fantastic. Marion Cotillard is magnificent. Michael Caine, in a brief role, is flawless. Tom Hardy is very good, this is his best performance to date. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gets a role of a lifetime, and he sinks his teeth into it. Ken Watanabe is stylish, while Cillian Murphy is highly efficient. Tom Berenger is perfect. Dileep Rao is good.On the whole, Nolan's 'Inception' is worth your time and money. Let me put it this way: ""If your a Cinema-Fan, than watching 'Inception' is a must""! Two Big Thumbs Up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brain burn.,"I like Christopher Nolan. He a good director. His little movie here, Inception, is one of those movies that give you brain burn. Allow me to explain!A rag tag team of handsome thieves invade people's dreams and extract memories. But for some reason implanting ideas in someone's head is super hard? No it's not! Hypnotist do it all the time. Then this Arthur character says ""The dreamer can always remember the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake."" Also, not true. People get source amnesia all the time. I'm sure you've met someone who claims to have invented a joke or a phrase that they actually heard from someone else.And these thieves are trying to get some wealthy hot-shot to shut down his bidnass? There's an easier way to do that that doesn't involve dream invasion. Wallstreet does it all the time. If some butt-wipe is getting too powerful, just bust him for any number of egregious crimes in which super wealthy billionaires inevitably get themselves involved. Or frame him and arrange some kind of take-over. 10000000000 times easier.Additionally, there are plenty of cheesy Hollywood shootouts where the bad guys can't aim, and cars function perfectly fine after being filled with bullet holes. You could say the cars still work cuz it's a dream, but then why do shot up people get totally screwed? I can overlook these ridiculous elements in a Jean Claude Van Damme movie by simply turning off my brain, but that's exactly where everything goes wrong in this movie.Ya see, if this was a comedy, everything in the story would work. But it isn't a comedy, is it, homies? heck no, son, it's a psychological thriller! So it's meant to stimulate your brain, but all the absurdities mentioned above ask you turn your brain off in order to enjoy it. So the constant turning on and off chafes your brain.

Perception of inception,"It has taken me 9 years to get round to watching this and during that time I looked forward more and more to seeing it.
Was it worth the wait....NO.I find it difficult to find anything positive to say, but the premise and idea of the film is interesting.
That sadly is all, its an overblown mess of a movie with no place for a connection to the films characters.
A collection of choreographed fight scenes connected by dream science mumbo jumbo and accompanied by a bombastic score does not make an interesting movie.
Mr Nolan should have spent his time focusing on a coherent story and some character development, less time on trying to shoehorn in pointless action.A bitter dissapointment of a movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Did not like Inception,"I thought the movie was absolutely horrible. It was truly a waste of money. I tried to get my money back, but didn't leave within 30 minutes of the movie, so I had to sit through the retarded bizarre movie. Who ever gave this four stars should be shot. If Leonardo could've read my dreams while I fell asleep during the movie, he would not have been flattered. Maybe I didn't ""get"" the concept of the movie, but it was annoying how they kept going from one dream to another dream, to skiing and snow mobiles, then a van driving off a bridge, then to a guy floating down a hallway, then to his wife and kids. All for corporate espionage? Who cares about the company? I wish there was something redeeming about the movie, but I couldn't think of anything. We did have a good laugh about how bad it was, so that should account for something. If anyone reading this wants to pay me back the money I wasted on the movie, I will gladly accept it! After the movie we went to see Salt which I thought was excellent and very entertaining.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Watch it for his story and the wonderful concept of an idea being a crime scene. this is heck of a good thriller... good.. this is the best of the best.

Desperately loved by stupid people who want to appear smart...,"There is no doubt that Nolan is a very talented director, and I like a lot of his films, but sadly I think like a number of other hugely successful directors before him (Peter Jackson springs to mind) his success has led to a detrimental degree of freedom for him to churn out his own poorly-written scripts unchecked, and make films that are about an hour longer than they need to be.I know I'm swimming against the tide of public opinion here, but while I was hugely excited about seeing Inception back when it came out, I was absolutely crushed on first viewing. I found it terribly written (the film begins with enough exposition scenes to fill a normal film's running time!), incomprehensible (editing was all over the place, action dull and repetitive), visually disappointing (all the best bits were revealed in the trailer and were all contained in the exposition scenes rather than having anything to do with the story) and with a concept that just didn't hold water (the dream sequences seemed to always resemble Matrix out-takes and were held together by a logic that just wasn't very dream-like)!Perhaps if Nolan had a studio breathing down his neck and someone to revise his shaky script this could have turned out well, but after the success of TDK he can effectively write his own ticket and is (sadly) free to churn out this kind of lazy and self-indulgent snooze-fest. The same thing happened with Peter Jackson after LOTR with King Kong (an hour too long, too much freedom etc.)Hans Zimmer's incredible score was about the only positive I took out of Inception (Zimmer's brilliant scores are increasingly the glue that holds Nolan's films together and makes them seem better than they are). Despite his obvious talents and love of film (I love him for shooting Batman stuff in IMAX 70mm!) Nolan has some very bad habits (mainly relying on his and his brother's writing) which I think really hamper his films these days. I loved TDK, but it frustrates me in almost equal measure, and though I haven't seen The Dark Knight Rises yet, I will go in with very low expectations based on his apparently dwindling form.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
There are much better films...,"There are much better films than this with a similar concept or just better writing. It's not that anything necessarily went wrong here... the concept is OK, the story is OK, the script is OK, the acting might be even better than OK. I guess that leaves the production and direction. And of course a majority of its reviewers disagree with me, so whatever. This just isn't a great movie. It certainly isn't worthy of it's rating and status here and a lot of other places. I think maybe it was over produced and designed. If it had been simplified into something more Donnie Darko and less Matrix, at least it would have been worthy of it's better than average performances.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cinema hasn't died yet,"My mind is aching(!!!) I have just seen the movie and I really liked it. I went to cinema with 8 other people and all of them were satisfied. After Avatar I was very disappointed about cinema. But Inception showed that brilliant ideas still exist and it shows that how can you apply visual effects to tell a story not just to show off! It has something new to offer. I'm not a fan of science fiction movies, specially ones with strange creatures. What makes me to like Inception this much is the fact that it picks one real thing, something we encounter every day, our dreams, and takes us to the unknown world of dreaming.I loved Matrix at it's time and I'm loving Inception. It feels more real than every other Sci-Fiction movie I have ever seen. Worth watching, absolutely recommendable!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"its different, and yes, thrilling too, but.......","In Chris Nolan's films, the narrative (and not anything else) is the main character, the center around which all else assembles. In terms of narrative complexity, this film doesn't really hold a candle to what 'Memento' and 'The Prestige' (or even 'Following') gave the viewer. The narration is linear, and the story ultimately harbors no mysteries. None at all. My guess is that all potential complexities were ironed out in order to secure finance and avoid risk. Even the human drama is totally unengaging and non-complex. This film doesn't give the viewer anything non-filmic to think about. Its a decent thrill ride, albeit with a new concept.The ""money idea"" here is the notion of nesting dreams within dreams in a potentially infinite sequence, like a Russian doll. This part of the film is really done well, and I'm sure everyone must hold their breath at the moment when all four (five?) levels ""synchronize"" and the ""kick"" is transmitted top to bottom.I suppose Nolan and his group must get credit simply for attempting something like this. Unfortunately there are problems here. The biggest one is how the dreams are constructed. They are mere action set-pieces. This is certainly not how we dream, not at all. Even allowing that, the dull and careless way in which the film is shot and edited is jarring. Worse, all the different levels are shot in the same visual style; there is no way to distinguish a dream state from reality, even when the viewer knows its a dream. Compare this with Martin Scorsese's use of two distinct visual palettes in 'Shutter Island' : one was surreal, and one prosaic; to denote two different states of mind. 'Fight Club' and 'Matrix' come to mind too.Nolan prefers an extremely wordy exposition over showing things visually. He expects viewers to understand concepts like the ""unconscious"", when truly speaking, few understand it well. Everyone has heard the word; how many people have studied it as a psychoanalytic concept proper ?? Even the particular interpretation that the unconscious and lucid dreaming are given, it is all just way too literal.With all due respect, someone needs to tell Chris Nolan to allow the use of second units. I'm sorry, but it seems he just cant shoot a decent action sequence to save his life. I'm surprised how no one has pointed this out.'Inception' was financed for one reason, and one reason only. Think of the amount of money that Batman 3 will make, if only they can get Nolan on board. It will obliterate any losses that 'Inception' may make.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Inception - Movie making just cant get any better than this,"Just when u think that Chris. Nolan cant come up with a movie of the same league as the dark knight, he comes up with inception. 148 mins of pure genius. an instant classic. it is well on its way to be the movie of the decade or maybe even more.From start to finish this movie just holds your attention and you witness something that u cant even dream of.Every single thing in the movie seems to be picture perfect, each and every character has been well portrayed and justified in its own way.The only problem i had was that i didn't want the movie to get over, i just wanted to be a part of his dream world. to conclude i would just say that Chris Nolan is on his way to be recognized as one of the very best the world has ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Summer BLOCKBUSTER!!!,"Christopher Nolan is one director who has never failed to deliver & his latest film, Inception is no different. With this he has created a monumental & thoroughly original piece of cinema that not only entertains but makes you think, something that modern blockbusters have failed to do time & time again (e.g. Avatar, Transformers, Clash Of The Titans).Leonardo DiCaprio leads a sublime ensemble cast that includes some of today's biggest & brightest stars and a true legend in Michael Caine, while Leo himself delivers arguably his greatest performance yet.The film looks & feels stunning!! The visuals are top-notch, the film sounds suitably tense while Hanz Zimmer's score only adds to the atmosphere. The script is (as you would expect) brilliant, remaining complex but relatively easy to follow & Nolan has once again stayed clear of conventional narrative to heighten the film's complexities.This is a true original & just goes to show everyone that blockbusters can be intellectually challenging whilst remaining hugely enjoyable. As a result, one can't help but want more from a standout film in a year that surely has more to offer than it has produced thus far. A new dimension of boundary-breaking has just been created by the new Kubrick / Hitchcock of film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing movie that left me wanting for just a bit more,"I know that my review will be lost between the hundreds and hundreds, but i couldn't stop myself from writing this. Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed this movie from start to end, and there were some things that i didn't quite understand, some were about the plot, but most of them were about the movie itself. I mean that i have a different perception to what dreams are and watched parts of the film with just a little bit of anxiety (something i had never felt), wishing for something else to happen. But i'm getting ahead of myself.First of all let me say that i made a mistake when i decided to watch this movie with some of my friends. Apparently, they didn't take it as seriously as i did, because i kept hearing some giggles here and there, they would find things that they considered highly funny and go off about it, and they weren't the only ones there, some other people were doing the same. I didn't care to shut them up because i didn't want to distract myself, not even for one second. This is a movie you have to watch with lots of attention, because there are parts where so much information is shared or so much things are revealed, that you might miss some. That's why it's recommended that you pay attention to it and, if you need it, watch it again.One of the points that made me like this movie so much was its tremendous cast. Everybody played their part perfectly, flawless. I have to admit that i'm not a big fan of Leonardo, i've never really felt him in any movie, but i have got to say that i respect his work, and after watching this movie, i'm sure he will be remembered as one of the best. Not just for this film, but for the rest of them.The plot is original, fresh, well in other words, Nolan at his best. He has achieved the kind of story that i'm attracted to: a story with so much to see, so much to experience, so much to feel, that it's actually hard to understand. And at the end, it left me thinking about it over and over. But i just expected a bit more about the dreams. At least for me, they weren't dreams exactly, they were just an approach. I won't go deep into this because i don't want to spoil anything, i'll just say that i needed just a bit more.This is a movie to be remembered, i think it's to high on the top 250, but still, it really deserves to be there. You won't regret watching this film, it is wonderful. And, by the way, i've only watched it once, so all the little questions that i had by the end of the movie will be solved (i hope so) when i see it for the second time. And i expect some Oscars for this movie. Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Colossal and mind boggling execution of Christopher Nolan's perception of Dreams,"A movie is not only about ideas, but the way in which it is delivered and this piece is living proof. Christopher Nolan personifies the idea that every one of us has experienced at some level in the form of dreams and creates an unprecedented and mind-numbing story. The human mind is so dynamic and creative that when uninhibited can create powerful alternate realities in the form of dreams.This dream draws its details from memories, logic and most importantly ideas that can shape every perceivable outcome. The story hinges on the perception that ideas are resilient parasites which when implanted in the brain, grows indiscriminately like a tumor and can supplant commonly held beliefs and force the dreamer into revealing personal details to the supplanter/extractor called ""Inception"". Leonardo DiCaprio (Cobb) plays the part of a world's best extractor who gets a contract from a powerful executive to perform inception. This is insignificant, as the real story is about Cobb (DiCaprio) and his personal journey into becoming the thief he is now. Everything else that is shown portends the complexity of his past that has been a melting pot of love, hate, loss, regret and anger. In fact at the end of the movie I completely forgot the cast of characters other than DiCaprio and rightly so because of the significance placed on the life of Cobb. Christopher Nolan uses the most compelling images in the form of special effects and a layered, interconnected plot that challenges your mind to think unconventionally. I realized that most of the negative reviews results from a poor understanding of the underlying theme and the inability to make out the fast paced changes that occur in the movie. But it's not that complicated and as described in this review, has very few underlying thematic points. Just sit back and enjoy the mind shattering experience of understanding what dreams are all about.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Movie Hater strikes again,"Inception is the first movie nominated for Best Picture that I hated on. It's not all that.My biggest problem was that they couldn't get me to care about the relationship between Leonardo DiCaprio, his wife and his child, which was suppose to be Dom Cobb(DiCaprio character) biggest motivation. I could care less for any of the characters, I wasn't emotionally invested at all.This isn't the first time Christopher Nolan tried to take Film Art concepts and commercialize it. This is an attempt at making a surrealism commercial. The problem with trying to make a surreal movie for the general public is that you have to make it understandable to the masses. The dreams in the movie was too orderly. Surrealist films like, Un Chien Andalou, are chaotic like dreams.Big visuals and action sequences aren't enough anymore, if you can't get me care about what drives the story, you're going to lose me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A beautiful surface,hollow content. Gifted cast wasted and Nolan gets stuck between reinvention and  desperate pretensions.","Inception makes the average moviegoer feel smart and I would have zero problem with that,unless fans weren't so extremely elitist and condescending. I DO get it...and neither love or hate it. Limited vocabulary but maybe a good read?DiCaprio has reached such super-stardom that can only be compared with Stallone,Schwarzenegger and Will Smith. Meaning:No matter who stars alongside him,he's the only one who sells the film.Just like in Shutter Island,Inceptions trailer only mentions LEONARDO.DICAPRIO.If Watanabe,Cotilliard,Murphy and the rest(Oscarwinners and Oscarnominees,come on) co-star,I might want to know. Studios,respect actors...and ON PAPER,the mix of actors intrigues.Plotwise though,it's all about Mal.Nolan had all the time he wanted to create a caper that was provocative or involved fates of main characters,danger! Morally ambiguous maybe! Yet,planting the seed in a business-mans head that selling his fathers company is his own idea is the result. HOW PG and unpersonal can we get? No room for both a new concept,a bold plot and developed characters...? Nope.Understand it could've been to get a mail-man to call in sick the next day,heist irrelevant. 80% of Inception evolves around the caper,still it merely becomes window dressing,a distraction from the core,the human heart that occasionally beats,being the relationship between Dom and his bad conscience in the shape of Cotilliards Mal.All scenes involving her are superb,it's a nuanced performance worthy of an Oscarnomination. Mal is dangerous,sad,disturbed, beautiful and Very dead. One scene especially involving a ledge is great,heartbreaking cinema. That the person who's most alive and complex is deceased..Paradox...but a good hint at the misuse of actors.Several actors could just've switched names,their characters don't have personalities. What did you do here,Christopher? They describe rules for the dreamworld,dream-extraction,describe what's happening at the moment, that's it.When Swick casted Watanabe in The last samurai,he knew the screenplay matched the mans potential. Nolan has with Batman begins and Inception twice wasted his talent...Murphy? Think I rather see him type-casted as sophisticated sociopaths al√° Red Eye then see him as a blank page.Inception's the star and while a detailed construction, intentionally confusing and complex,you DO have to pay attention,complex does not equal intelligent. As you take the ride,things move fast and you're not allowed to break and examine. It's only when it's over you realize you were standing still all along.You are cleverly manipulated into believing the story makes you think(Cause you understand what you saw.Not the same..)or that your mind discovers philosophical metaphors. That you are witnessing something deep is shoved down your throat but depth is mostly absent.Sure,the film deserves the Oscars. Things sound great,look great. Buildings become bridges. An orgasm for the eyes. Pfisters camera-work here is great,very colorful,crisp,clean. Imaginative art direction. I dig Zimmers less-is-more score. In general the whole film's eye candy,perfect surface. The inside...?1.Alright,WAY too much shooting and ""violence"" going on here, considering everyone's sound asleep on a plane and thoughts are murdered. Would've been more intriguing with psychological tension instead of train-crashes and explosions but lack of a REAL physical threat only manages to turn suspense into a dream as well.Sleeping boy vs. thought in zero gravity is so pointless,the impressive CGI just confirms Nolans smug self-awareness of his competent,VISUAL execution and just cements the surface statement.2. Limbo. Wouldn't a dream-extractors worst nightmare be LIMBO,wouldn't it come up in a conversation between professionals at some point probably? No...not even mentioned until drama occurs.3.For the 5th time,a womans accidental death consumes a wealthy,white man between 30 and 35 with guilt that will define him and her role is again pivotal. It's getting old and predictable,I hope the issues are worked out by now.4.Last scene. It defines and sums up Inceptions feeling of surface reaching for depth and jaw breaking response,artistic pretensions,strained complexity for the sake of complexity rather then genuinely clever.Nolan in desperation wants to wrap it up so it leaves us scratching our heads... I was banging my head against the seat in front of me when the end credits rolled.He leaves you with two options,no scenarios or reasons that make or should make you come up with an own conclusion. Far from a thinking mans thriller. One of the two is a joke used when referring to funny,lousy twists in B-thrillers. So...No why or how,just IF...IF films were people,Nolans own Memento,The usual suspects or Fight Club would blush,look at 8.8 and put a pistol in their mouth when the words""Smart,thought-provoking thriller"" puts Inception next door to them.The ending insults us,a cop out. Definition of a writer not knowing neither how to quit while ahead or how a journey is gonna reach a classic destination worthy of the plots seemingly intricate layers and ambitions. Sooo...he passes the ball to you and washes his hands with 15 seconds to go,smart lad.A picture this celebrated for being smart should hold up under a magnifying glass. It burns up without you even turning it towards the sun,man. This is an experiment and Nolans monster looks good,but at times,it comes close to the IQ of Dr.Frankensteins creation.DiCaprio gives a solid and mature performance,Hardy makes the most of what little the script offers and gives Eames mannerisms,charisma and a sense of humor. Cotilliard is amazing like stated.The rest could've been portrayed by Gary Busey,Eric Roberts and Lindsay Lohan...Nolans 1st failure is a mix of beauty,superficial intelligence and posturing. Caught between a flawed,pretty entertaining film and a bad one. Mediocre becomes bad when it comes to this director....so shallow.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
About an hour too long.,This movie is high energy but the problem with that is that it never stops. There is no contrast to it. High tension the entire time. No release and it wears out quickly to the point you don't even want to finish watching it. Too much repetition was included in this movie. Action sequences were too long and added nothing to the story. It needed a film editor to cut about an hour of it just to make it watchable.Then there is the plot. A plot which was thinning wrapped around all the action and special effects. You got the feeling that you were watching a computer video game and not an actual story. Far too much distraction and time spent on the lead character's personal life problem and he trying to deal with it.,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest ideas of all time.,"To describe Inception in a single adjective will never be enough. The sheer magnitude at which this movie happens is simply exceptional. It could've only been pulled off by someone as good as Chris Nolan. I can go on and on about praising this movie was hours, that's months in dream level one and years in dream level two. :)Put it simply, this is the best movie I've watched in my life because of it's idea, it's execution and it's emotional depth. People always moan about Nolan's movies not being emotional, but this one is definitely not one of them. You will feel for Cobb and Mal. Di Caprio has done a terrific job showing the vulnerabilities and guilt of Cobb. Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt have given neat performances. Tom Hardy was simply brilliant in the way he handled Eames. Cilian, as usual has done job well. The rest of the cast have done a good job as well. The cinematography by Wally Pfister is one of the best in recent times. Hans Zimmer's music is haunting. Editing by Lee Smith is top notch. But this film truly belongs to Nolan. From the storyline to it's execution, Nolan oozes confidence in every department. Be it narration, bringing awe-striking visuals or keeping us on the edge of our seats, he has truly demonstrated that he's not only one of the most entertaining, but one of the most intelligent directors in world cinema today. For that, take a bow Nolan!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Interesting concept,"It seems like Leonardo DiCaprio is really going for these Psychological thrillers lately, which is good, as he seems to pull it off quite nicely.As usual, Christofer Nolan has created another great movie which is well shot, superbly acted and grips your attention from scene 1 - although at that point you really have no idea what is going on! My one point of criticism on an otherwise amazing movie is that he takes the concept one step too far. Towards the end keeping up with what's happening where becomes a full time task and although I don't want to come over as stupid, one less would have made the film flow much smoother.Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Masterpiece.,"Movies of this calibre come seldom to never.This could be a once-in-a-lifetime motion picture to behold.If you could only watch 1 film in your life, it should be this.'nuf said.A truly remarkable achievement Nolan hasn't yet eclipsed, even though Interstellar and Tenet came pretty close, I feel like this one is still the best.It's an absolute grandiose spectacle on all fronts, music/score, editing, visual effects, acting, cinematography, writing, direction, and most imporantly THE VERY CEREBRAL CORE of the movie, the urge to engage with it, to grasp it fully by watching it more than once, the sheer scale of the movie... 10/10

the entire film is Cobb's dream,"An amazing thing happened to me with this film. Never before have my views on a film shifted so dramatically as with Inception. In fact it is my second review of it, I edited the first which was very unflattering. What happened? Well, by chance I read an eye-opening analysis at chud.com, and then I went to see it again, this time in IMAX and with better sound. Chud's piece on this is quite brilliant and profound. I also shows that sometimes it is not enough to see a film, especially such an ambitious one, it is important to read about it, for example what the director says about it. Chud explains that in an interview Nolan reveals this is kind of autobiographical film for him, in a metaphysical sense. It is about... making films, about creative process! Yes yes, not about Matrix so much. DiCaprio confirms it, he says it is much more like ""8 and a 1/2"" was for Fellini than it is another Matrix. Cobb's team is like a film crew: a director (Cobb), producer (Saito), screenwriter (Ariadne), actor/ actors (Eammes, Fisher). And then there's Mal: a director's or artist's fetish or obsession, something that an original artist usually tends to bring into his work, for better or worse. That is why some good directors should not write scripts, like Cobb, you see? Chud then explains that seen this way, the ENTIRE film is a dream, Cobb's dream. We cannot be even sure that his wife is dead in his ""real life"", maybe she has just left him? The purpose of such a film for Nolan: analysis of why films work for us or not, why we identify with characters and feel for them or hate them, even if we know that what we r watching is unreal (a dream?). Chud brilliantly writes that some people can shed a tear or two during sad moments of the animated ""Up"" (or Toy Story), which does not diminish their emotions and does not make them untrue, even though they r reacting to pure fantasy. I for one was deeply moved when the young Fisher discovers what's in the safe and has a catharsis. I was moved with him, and I think Nolan tried to show us that such is the worth of good art and performance. Plus he included in this film elements from melodrama, heist movies, Bond movies etc., all in one. He could not include much of a comedy because it is supposed to be a dream of a sad character, someone who has apparently lost his wife. And when we know the entire film is a dream, many of its apparent inconsistencies or unlikely events do not trouble anymore, because it is Cobb's subconscious we are watching. And if Nolan says Cobb is like him we can guess Cobb is a film director in ""real life"", dreaming like a film making and about his wife that left him. Details start to make sense: bad goons cannot hit good characters - like in a dream or a bad action film, Cobb attaches the rope onto a chair in which Mal is seating though he has said he could not trust her, Mal is seating on a ledge opposite their hotel room and that room is like a copy of their room, the children look exactly the same and are dressed the same during the ending as before, the narrow alley moment in Mombasa, the explicit names like Ariadne (Greek mythology, the maze) or Mal (evil in French and Spanish), Ariadne asking Cobb what's in the snow castle FOR HIM when it was allegedly Fisher's dream... So I upgraded this film from weak 4 to a very strong 9 after that, for originality, ambition and high production values. Thanks to Chud, the film critic. I do not give it a perfect 10 because I still think the first hour is a bit flat and they talk too much in it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nolans Masterpiece! A Multi Layered Film,"It is very rarely that I would feel strongly enough to write a movie review but after I saw inception I felt so captivated by the movie that I decided to write one.In this film Nolan has delivered a truly spectacular film which deals with the concept of dreams and the possibility that our dreams could somehow be invaded and secrets could be extracted from them. The film is centered on the possibility of instead of something being extracted from a dream could an idea be planted in our dream to change our perception on an aspect of our life.It is through this brief story outline that Nolan delivers a multi layered masterpiece which sees a group of extractors led by Leonardo Di Caprio try to plant an idea into a dream which leads to some of the most surreal environments seen in a film since the Matrix. Even Nolan's excellent use of architecture serves to immerse viewers further into this dreamworld.Nolan's casting once again is flawless in this film just like it was in the Batman films and Memento. Leonardo Di Caprio delivers a very strong and emotional performance as a man who is struggling with his past and there are also stellar performances from Joseph Gordan Levitt, Ellen Page and Tom Hardy.I will admit that this film is for the thinkers among us as it requires a lot of concentration throughout the film to keep up with the films layered storyline and I am sure there will be more than a few people who will not get it. However those of us that like films that push our imagination to the next level will definitely not be disappointed.This is Nolan's masterpiece and I hope that it gets the iconic recognition it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Exercise in futility,"There are movies that I love initially. Then, over a period of time, it dawns on me that I have been manipulated royally.

Inception comes a close second. Christ, what was all that about? Dreams within dreams within dreams, come on! Tops spinning/not spinning? People getting into each others' dreams? Visually breathtaking it may have been, but a great story it certainly wasn't. I think the true test of a classic movie is in its repeat viewing. I realized Inception was nothing when I sat down to watch it again. I couldn't go past the first 10 minutes. It was that boring.

That is not how imagination works,"Good points. Well, the visuals were great that's for sure. The way they bent reality and had rooms spin and cities shift and stuff blow up, sure, great action. The soundtrack is good as well but it doesn't have any memorable tunes.Bad points. What the hell was that action all about? Projections of someone's mind were typical people attacking the incerptors. Am I to believe that the ultimate defense a person's mind has is... faceless mooks? Where are the dragons, the supermen, the giant robots? Something that is NOT faceless mooks? If this is the realm of dreams then it should be filled with such stuff, there is no holding back. Not even the most pragmatic mind would be without such stuff. So here I am watching an hour long action scene that is better fit for a James Bond film (minus the rotating rooms) than an adventure in the subconscious mind of troubled men. Makes little sense.Then the dialogues. Although the explanations around how the inception works were great and I did understand the concept, I found that it took a huge chunk of the duration. Half of the dialogues feel like the characters are indirectly explaining the theory to us. Something that they wouldn't since they are supposed to know such stuff and have no need to mention them.Good point. The story is indeed interesting and offers a concept around the blurring of reality that has never been offered exactly like this before.Bad point. The actual plot outside the interesting concept is mostly thrown away at shoot outs and explosions with random mooks that have nothing to do with a person's mind. If I dream something, I am the dream. Everyone is me, everyone acts like me, everything reacts like me. Yet the movie wants us to think our dream is like reality. I was not convinced that a dreamworld is so stiff. It was changing all right but the moment someone knows he is dreaming and doesn't wake up, he doesn't need to run or hide. He can mold everything where he stands and play it God. Thus the movie doesn't literally show how dreams work. It just gives you some nice ideas and wastes the rest in action scenes you can find even in a normal action movie.Acting... no good or bad points here. There are no prevailing characters for all I care. The idea and the action overshadow the actors. Di Caprio and the gang did their parts well but I still find it hard to believe that such an unstable personality that has his murderous wife chasing him in dreams would be allowed to go on in such delicate missions. It's like inviting Freddy Krugger to chop you to pieces while the world hangs at the edge of the cliff. Bad plot element.So is this movie good? In theory, yes. Action lovers and eggheads will love it. Scriptwritters may get some nice ideas from. But as far as I care it is NOT a masterpiece. It has too many convenient events, too much holding back, too much infodump, too much out-of place action.Things that I would change to make this movie better: -No shootings with faceless mooks and blowing stuff just for the heck of it. -More dream morphing scenes in places of fore-mentioned pointless action. -Less infodump. -Less corny dead wife drama. We have Solaris for that.The Cage is a movie doing a rather better portrait of a man's dreamworld. Not so much mambo jumbo around how it works but shows it better. And of course there is Solaris (dead wife thing) and Matrix (cool action) and James Bond (shooting and blowing stuff) to take out most other good parts of the movie. By the end of it, only the idea of inception is what stands out. And it wasn't exploited that much really.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not original, not brilliant, not worthy","Some reviewers have given this movie a single star where's other have rewarded it 10. There's very few in-between. I think 4 stars is apt. It's really not that bad but certainly not a ""movie of the decade"". Such a disparity is probably due to the overrated expectations the Hollywood movie industry and IMDb hype has created. I've heard it being compared to the Kubrick's ""Space Odyssey 2001"". Not surprising some film-lovers overreacted. As much as I liked ""Memento"", I must say Mr. Nolan ain't no Stanley Kubrick. As for the people who rated the movie as the best thing that has happened to the American cinema since ""The Sixth sense"", I can only enviably wish their bliss.The biggest disappointment was probably the plot. Somewhere 45 minutes in the movie I figured the second twist was for the main character to discover it was actually him locked in the ""limbo of his own dreams"" (a.k.a. Hades in the world of Plato a few thousand years before the idea of our lives being mere reflections of grand ""pure forms"" landed on Mr. Nolan's forehead) and the rest of the gang was trying to drag him out to the light under a masterful orchestration of his beloved wife. Unfortunately this second twist never happened. The director rather awkwardly tried to pull a Lynch-style finale of letting the viewers to decide whether this entire movie was real or not. This is a hard trick to pull, since all fictional films are not real and we (the audience) are quite well aware of it. Although Mr. Lynch sometimes gets to pull it but he's, well, an actual artist. Anyways, it was about as entertaining for the next 115 minutes as watching a barrel of brandy mature.I can't resist just one more barb to the lavish display of plot holes - many reviewers have mentioned the utter failure of the storyline to construct anything resembling a solid structure but I really hope to point out a previously overlooked nonsense (my apologies for anyone who has already done so). How is it that one of the most feared ""brain hackers"" who can mastermind a ""cerebral heist"" of all times, can't arrange for his kids to move some place safe where he can quietly meet up (or even live) with them? Or forge the documents needed to enter the country? I mean there are literally thousands of people illegally crossing the borders into the land of the free every single day and some of them can barely read English! And somehow this is a major roadblock for the man who has the power to peek into other people's brains and even plant his ideas in there. For Pete's sake! What a nonsense.P.S.""Once Zhuangzi dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn't know he was Zhuangzi. Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Zhuangzi. But he didn't know if he was Zhuangzi who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi.

Nolan is back and better than ever.,"Let's say you go to a movie theater, and see a movie that you ended up loving. How would you describe it? ""Awesome?"" ""Spectacular?"" ""Magnificent?"" Christopher Nolan's latest effort, Inception, is the first time I honestly don't think such words can do justice. Starting smaller with sleeper hits such as Memento and Insomnia, the British filmmaker worked his way up to bigger budget films such as the critically praised Batman Begins, and its even more acclaimed sequel, The Dark Knight. Seeing that The Dark Knight was the mega-blockbuster Warner Brothers was hoping for, Nolan was given free reign for his next movie. As it turns out, Inception is the man's Holy Grail.If you are familiar with Christopher Nolan's directing style, it may be no surprise to find out that Inception is a twisted and unpredictable film, albeit, twisted in the right way. The plot centers on Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a skilled master in the art of extraction. Extraction is the stealing of a person's idea straight from within their subconscious. This is done when a person is most vulnerable, during their sleep. Through years of practice and experience of infiltrating dreams, Cobb has reached a high level that has also transformed him into a fugitive. He has been stripped away from his family, but is offered a last job that could bring him back home. His new task is not to steal another idea, but instead to do the opposite. The new job is to implant an idea into a specific person's mind. The heist is underway after he assembles with the team of characters in the movie.The ensemble cast of the team consists of wonderful performances from Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Joseph-Gordon Levitt, and Tom Hardy. I will not explore the plot more than I already have mainly because part of the movie's charm is the mystery surrounding the way the story progresses. Inception's plot is complex, but not impossible to figure out and follow, as Nolan takes notice of certain limits when telling the story. For example, the story mainly linear, as opposed to the reversed storytelling style of Memento. The audience is also introduced to the world of the dream through Ellen Page's character. These aspects of the plot make it accessible to every audience, without thinning out the deeper layers of Nolan's vision.Every performance was well-handled, with Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as the lead being the strongest. There is a certain level of emotional pull in his character's back-story, one that I will not reveal here. What can be said about the acting in this movie is that it is one of the many assets to this film that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The amount of realism injected into each character makes for a rather interesting conflict as the film picks up its pace. Coupled with the beautiful cinematography and performances, the film's action scenes do not disappoint one bit. In fact, there is a certain sequence in the film's climax that is easily one of the most jaw-dropping action sequences in all of action film history. I have not been so thrilled since I first saw Neo dodge bullets in The Matrix. A master like Christopher Nolan has the awesome ability to blend high-octane action into a complex and layered premise so flawlessly.On a technical and artistic level, Inception delivers greatly. Every shot in the movie seems so carefully placed, and at times the cinematography, combined with clever use of slow-motion, greatly enhances the experience during the more intense scenes. Composer Hans Zimmer has created an immense score for this movie. The music is really loud, yet fits with the tone being presented in the movie. As if the music leapt right out of a giant monster movie, the booming brass cues and somber piano fillers definitely help amplify every moment, from the slower, more emotional moments to the absolutely epic action scenes. The action that takes place in the dream world was made visually possible thanks to really clever special effects. For a special effects buff like me, this movie was a bit more of a treat. It seems that Nolan tries to go out of his way to use as little computer generated imagery as possible, and restricts it to when it's needed. The film's highlight action moments are almost entirely achieved by practical special effects, and that fact alone makes Inception stand out from the crowd in today's movie generation. As per Nolan tradition, the movie is tightly edited; do expect some awesome hard cuts and seamless transitions between the dream world and real world right before your eyes. The really chaotic editing style gives the entire movie a very surreal feel, almost as if you don't know whether the characters are dreaming or not.I can sit here for hours and hours, writing about the complexities and curve-ball dialogue scattered within the plot, but I don't want to be a poor sport and ruin the film's genius story for those who haven't seen it yet. Simply put, Inception is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time. With a climax that is sure to become iconic, a deep and moving emotional side, and powerful performances from realistically written characters, Inception has it all. I tip my hat to Christopher Nolan for envisioning such a fresh and engaging story, and his wonderful team for making the perfect movie experience. Yes, I said perfect. Go ahead and call me crazy, but this movie is absolutely flawless. It needs to be seen by everybody on the face of this planet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Hollywood owes us more than an ""Inception"", and a few philosophical thoughts","With all the big budgets and technology Hollywood can get, what did we the audience get? Many sequels (And I dislike Dark Knight, being just a little better sequel).Since the Matrix was released more than 10 years ago, what did we the Sci-Fi film fans get compared with a decade or two before that? Chris Nolan delivered on these two accounts, and fewer and fewer directors in Hollywood can really master in commanding a complicated project and a good story telling, at the same time. I want more films like ""Inception"" coming to theaters here, which spent a lot of money making one as well as taking us to experience something other media, such as TV, games, can't offer. That is what we trade for paying the ticket to get in a theater.There is also a philosophical angle for the audience, I think. When we moviegoers are used to be overpowered by technology hard to distinguish among themselves, like computer graphics, animation, special effects, ..., unavoidably we find ourselves attracted to those with a ""FORM"" standing out among all, on top of such as acting of any particular roles, words of power of any particular scenes. ""FORM"" of this film will be something many to follow. If the derivatives of ""FORM"" to this film lead to a new spectrum for film makings, then that will be something interesting for us movie lovers to know first.The only thing I don't get it though - why did Saito and Fischer not recognize each other when they both waked up in the airplane?

Probably in my Top 10,"As a fiction writer, I very much enjoy creating stories, worlds, and trying to keep everything tied together. IT's a great challenge. Christopher Nolan is a genius at creation. His movies are groundbreaking, and Inception is just another one of his phenomenal creations.The first 15 minutes were tough to figure out, but later you understand how those scenes were relevant to the story, and the rest of it really wasn't that hard for me - it made sense. The score was fantastic - I noticed that Nolan loves to infuse music into the film almost the whole time, rather than in key moments. It adds to the drama - I like it.The acting was very strong. Leo is a talented actor and did his thing in this movie. The rest of the cast was strong also, but I don't know if any of them will win major awards - except maybe the ex-wife. She was great. Nolan used a couple of actors from the Batman movies in there - that was interesting.One flaw I could pick on was that it wasn't clear what anyone else's motivation was to finish the Inception job. Clearly Leo's character had a goal, but I couldn't really tell why the others were so loyal and accommodating. Maybe I missed the monetary reward offered? The reality bend in Inception was done to perfection. Rang very similar to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in that regard.The movie was gorgeous to look at. The style was similar to his other recent films - and that's a very good thing.And the ending. What can I say, it was one of the most satisfying endings I've ever seen. I walked out and just nodded my head. Yep. Very nice. Extraordinarily well done film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It is rare that I attend midnight screenings, it is more rare still that I come out of the theatre more awake than I was when I walked in.","I had been following Christopher Nolan's Inception from the moment it was announced that he was working on his next film following The Dark Knight. The initial teaser, debuted some time ago with it's powerful, moving score set in motion what I would call borderline fanboy-ism. The actual theatrical trailer only supplemented it. When opening week hit I began reading some initial reviews coming out of rotten tomatoes and had some notion of what I should be expecting out of the film. I tried to limit my expectations even though some extremely positive reviews were coming in.Inception is one of those films that makes you think during it's entire plot. The setup is simple enough: Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, has a very unique job. He is an extractor, a man who delves into the layers of people's minds, deep into their subconscious, to extract information; thoughts and ideas that the dreamer isn't even aware of knowing. The world Dom is a part of is not built as complete as say, Gotham City, but it also doesn't need to be, as the majority of the time the film is taking place in a dreamworld. Dom, suspected of killing his own wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), is unable to return home to his children. In order to pass immigration back to America he is forced to do one final job, one that is the opposite of extracting, rather, he is to plant an idea, an inception point, into a man's subconscious.To do so would require more help than his usual point man Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). He enlists the aid of Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy), Saito (Ken Watanabe) and Yusuf (Dileep Rao) to help him create the dream. Each team member has their own jobs pertaining to the dream that they will eventually share with the dreamer Robert Fischer, played by the ever scrupulous Cillian Murphy. The supporting cast is just astounding and anything I say, if I could say anything, would be mere nitpicking. Leo himself plays his role as well as ever.The level of cinematic brilliance that Nolan has brought forth here is so astounding that I have absolutely no negative comments to talk about. Each moment of this film as brilliant as the next. The set pieces are large in scale and are beautiful. It is no simple feat to create a world such as this but Nolan seemingly does it with relative ease. The mind is a complex thing, and this film merely supplements that idea. Bear in mind that this is no low budget film, some 200 million was put forth to form what we see as the delicate architecture of the human mind. The CGI that almost always accompanies such a budget is impeccable and is near photo realistic as it does not cast you out of the film but simply reels you in further. The pacing too is strong and I can't say it even has a dipping point after the first thirty minutes. The action sequences remind me of the Bond series, and for the better. Nolan even stated that it had a part of his inspiration and it shows. There are even some comedic bits for good measure, however discrete they are. No film that I have seen in a very long time encapsulates a perfect balance of everything that you see here.Plainly stated, Inception is a masterpiece of this decade and only continues to firmly root Nolan among the worlds most renowned director's. I urge you to go in with your mind open, you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"This Film Is Great, But Only In Some People's Dreams","Well, I didn't think it lived up to all the hype, but nonetheless it was still a pretty good film. I don't think the story came out quite the way Nolan had hoped, after working on it for over a decade. In my view the story is basically a combination of Vanilla Sky meets The Matrix, but really it ends up being less meaningful than both (A combination of the mystical waking dream and the matrix of consciousness). This is Nolan's version of Edgar Allan Poe's A Dream Within A Dream, or the like. However I don't think the film really comes across this way as well as it should, or especially, the way it was meant to.Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem that my days have been a dream; Yet if hope has flown away in a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it therefore the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! Can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! Can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?The film overall feels forced and clunky, it lacks any kind of good rhythm. For me to see this film ranked in the top 15 films ever made according to the IMDb voters only goes to prove one thing; The IMDb top 250 list is good for nothing at all but a laugh.I thought Inception was pretty good. However pretty good is stretching it as far as I would ever go. This film is a long long way from great.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

And finally, for a little fun, 23 July: Blah.Rather than rehash the insights of those helpful reviews, I'll try to add something useful...Inside of 30 minutes I was squirming in my seat, tapping my fingers, and checking my watch. Why? No character development. No sense that a good story had been started. And thus no engagement. As time wore on I found I really didn't care about any of the characters, or their plights, or what they were trying to accomplish, other than thinking Ellen Page was kind of cute.In an EW interview, Nolan says about his film, Memento, that he was ""trying to transcend the tyranny of linear narrative."" Really? A tyranny? We live in a linear narrative, Chris, but now that I know you feel that way about life, I'll remember not to pay to see your films. In the same interview, Nolan says that he was worried that his audience wouldn't be able to follow his brain-bending movie because of the complex dream-within-a-dream plot... until he lit upon (drum roll) the ""heist-flick model,"" in which the hero-thieves explain their scheme. Yes, Chris, but that's not a very good model. And what's more, it only works if the ""explaining is minimal"" and the director is skilled enough to show and reveal more. It's a moving picture, remember?Yes, the action here is pretty cool, better than the Dark Knight. The camera and stunt work are very good. The music is the same gloomy heavy-handed kind used in Dark Knight (same composer, Hans Zimmer). But the characters are essentially two-dimensional because everything is secondary to the plot, which in spite of its complexity you can understand well enough because it's all explained to you, endlessly. Even Dicaprio wasn't happy with his character and worked with Nolan for two months ""adding layers"" for more emotional depth (see the Rolling Stone interview). But apparently the complexity and ridiculousness of the plot buried that, or Nolan just didn't know how to deliver it (come to think of it, this may be a problem with all of his films). Plot over character. Cool factor over emotion.You think of the great work DiCaprio did in The Aviator. And the brilliant work by Gordon-Levitt in The 500 Days of Summer. I wasn't much of a fan of Juno, but Ellen Page ""made"" that movie. And of course Michael Caine has made many great movies, including the recent Harry Brown. Also, Ken Watanabe in The Last Samurai. And finally, let's not forget Marion Cotillard's stunning Oscar-winning performance in La Vie En Rose. But they're all struggling mightily here with Nolan's tedious script, and their immense talent is wasted.But of course, I'm all wrong. The movie is a huge hit. It's sure to rack up $500 million or more in worldwide box office sales. Whew! That's good news. Because then Nolan can go on ""transcending the tyranny.""",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Horrible,"I didn't expect too much from this, given Leonardo DiCaprio's presence, but was surprised how weak and unwatchable it ultimately was. This film was nothing but special effects -- it was impossible to care about any of the characters, and there was nothing truly interesting or thoughtful about it. No twists, no surprises, nothing. I was one of the few times I really felt like I'd wasted 2 hours of my life, and got nothing out of it.Nolan's earlier ""Memento"" was far more original, thoughtful, and fascinating, both throughout, and in the ultimate plot reveals. The 13th Floor is a far better execution of a similar theme, more straightforward and interesting.Save your money, and don't waste your time or money on this vastly overrated collection of silly, pointless special effects to no apparent purpose.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Complex, Entrancing, Classic.","Let me begin by addressing the criticisms of this film: that it's either too slow, too complicated, or superficially emotional. All of these claims are completely and utterly misguided and wrong.Inception is a movie unlike any other. It combines heart-stopping action, mind bending psychological concepts, and deep emotional conflicts, wraps them in a tight, perfectly edited package, and drop kicks you with them in the face. The cool part is that you won't be surprised at how little you understand, but rather how much you understand. The scripting and pacing is so well planned and pieced together and everything is explained in the perfect amount of detail, which serves to make the end of the movie a mind-blowing climax of epic proportions.Scoring by Hans Zimmer is to die for. It's a mysterious combination of elements of Batman, Bourne, and Quantum of Solace, which are all revolutionary scores, and it completes the movie. But let's be serious, everything completes this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, DiCaprio, and Ellen Paige all turn in rock star performances. The only character that feels underdeveloped is ""Fischer,"" who comes off as cold, but whose emotional transformation isn't entirely convincing. Luckily, the rest of the movie is so engrossing at every moment that this does not detract from the overall experience. Nolan doesn't need to fall back on high-buck CGI either. The sets, locales, and visuals are stunning without being overbearing.These gorgeous visuals, ludicrous editing, brilliant scoring, a synergistic cast, and a plot that makes you think and rewards you for your mental effort combine to transform this from a movie into an amazing mental journey.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
In a word: brilliant.,"'Inception' is a work of bold ambition. It is Nolan's true masterpiece and one of the most original pieces of fiction ever put on film.The story, although multi-layered and complex, is incredibly engrossing and a wonder to behold on screen. The movie follows Dom Cobb(DiCaprio) as he leads a specialized team, tasked with putting an idea inside the mind of Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). This task is called Inception. Cobb specializes in the Extraction of ideas from people's minds in their dreams, but Inception is an entirely different story. Removing an idea from a person's mind proves easier because the person has already thought it, but adding an idea is something that can't be done without carefully manipulating the mind to create the idea on it's own.This is the premise of 'Inception', and that's only the surface. There are so many layers to the plot that it's almost impossible to divulge even a fraction of the story in any less than a few pages. The script, which took ten years to write, is pure brilliance. As the film progresses it only becomes more intriguing, even up to the very end.The acting is superb across the board. The standout being DiCaprio, but the entire cast delivers amazing performances.'Inception' is visually dazzling and unlike anything i've ever seen on film. But even the amazing visuals don't detract from the depth and complexities of the plot. With amazing cinematography and a remarkably well-crafted and fitting original score from Hans Zimmer, there isn't an area where the film doesn't shine.This is truly Nolan's best, and that is definitely saying something.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nolan's magnum opus ;the fulfillment of a decade's vision,"Inception, Christopher Nolan's seventh-feature film is in many ways a summation, of sorts of everything his cinema has strived to achieve for in the past decade or more. The detailed intricacies of human mind and the sheer complexity of all the layers that lie beneath it ‚Äìsuch themes have often played a frequent role in his movies. A magnum opus of epic proportions, Inception is the kind of a movie that is a sign of director reaching his artistic peak. It's like Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" or Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" in many ways where the meaning the director has been trying to strive for reaches it's complete realization.In the follow-up to the much-adored Dark Knight, Inception is a rare big-budget cerebral blockbuster built on strong foundations of it's original, mindbending concept in today's age of sequels and ""inspired"" remakes. Leonardo DiCaprio plays as Dom Cobb, an ""extractor"" who is paid to invade the dreams of the minds of various corporate giants and steal their ideas in a fictional setting of the future. When he is challenged by Saito (Ken Watanabe; understated for most parts) to attempt an inception ‚Äìwhich is the planting an idea into someone's mind, he accepts the challenge. Backed by a powerful ensemble cast including the likes of Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao and the ever- dependable Michael Caines, Inception drives forward often with the speed and intensity that can only be helmed by Nolan. Using mind-bending visuals and top-class special effects to create unforgettable dream scenarios, Inception is the movie that involves the viewer, challenges them throughout its entirety and rewards them with believable logic and dazzling imagination throughout its entirety.Inception never loses its emotional core despite all the twisted logic and mindbending space between dream and reality. A special mention should go to Marion Cotillard whose haunting portrayal as Mal sent shivers down my spine with dread every time she appeared on-screen. I would also applaud Nolan for keeping the ""craziness"" factor low for this movie (something which many critics complained about). I preferred the believable factor and how nothing ever seemed over-the-top mostly which further distorted the difference between reality and dreams further more. I preferred this rather than the movie taking a crazy Kubrick turn somewhere in the middle.In the end despite few rough edges and leap of faiths, Inception is a dazzling achievement in every right. It challenges the viewer with every sequence to suspend their belief on what is dream and reality. It is an achievement in the fact that original ideas when supplied with big- budgets can turn into incredibly powerful movies such as this one. But lastly and most importantly, it is an achievement of the fulfillment of the vision a man set to fulfill a decade back with an idea. The idea which has synthesized with the kind of cinema he has gained mastery over to form this single movie. And what a movie it really was.10/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Take a leap of faith"" - not hard to do here","I'm sure I'll revisit Inception, sooner rather than later. Christopher Nolan's film has its ambitions, oh sure to be sure. But when one looks at what he is really trying to accomplish here, it's to tell a story and with verve, originality (or at least taking solid cinematic forms and archetypes and using them originally), and a point of view that is astonishing. I still have scenes and images, performances and moments, shots and details of the plot (and a kick-ass final shot especially) rolling around in my head, and I don't want them to go away. Even things about the film that I should find flawed, such as a little clunky exposition and some edits that go by lightning fast work because of what does count: we care about what happens to these characters, or at least Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), and whether or not they'll achieve this ""mission"" of putting an idea in someone's head.To explain all of the finer mechanics of the plot... just go to wikipedia, or IMDb's plot synopsis. I'll just say for here that the film takes its own creation of science-fiction variety seriously. And seriously enough to take jaded moviegoers of the cineplex variety along for the ride. It's kind of like a heist plot, though not really, in that ""idea"" thieves- people who use dreams, shared via inter-connecting tubes (like the Matrix only more complex)- are recruited by Saito (Ken Watanabe), a big businessman of some sort to plant an idea in someone's head, or 'inception', which has not been done except for once when Cobb did it to a certain someone (he won't mention why, for a big reveal in the last act, though not a twist). That's really what you need to know - that and Ariadne (Ellen Page) will act as the audience in a sense to keep exposition going... sometimes too much on a first viewing.And yet, for all of the characters standing around explaining things, which should be (and is) a big no-no in movies (SHOW don't TELL, remember), it can work here because a) it is such a complex concept, considering all of the calculations of time, as well as the 'rules' of sort, which are laid out so well that nothing can be too confusing for anyone, even if one wanted to, and b) the acting is so good in doing it. There is genuine emotion as well, which is something that some of the so-so or negative reviews find is lacking here (there are a handful out there if you'd believe it Nolan-heads). I say simply that if you don't find emotion during those scenes between DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard, who used such a one-dimensional character to her total advantage here and steals all of her scenes with a beautiful face and haunting delivery- then, well, maybe you got the wrong movie.Sure, there's lots of pyrotechnics and big gun battles, but they work for the sake of this story and the circumstances too. I was worried they wouldn't, that things might be too rigid in the sense of it being dreams, why are there all of these guns and violence and whatnot. But, for me, it ended up making much more sense, in a non-sensible ""Hollywood Movie"" way, watching it unfold within the rules. It is much more sci- fi-thriller than a David Lynch surrealist trip anyhow, and on Nolan's terms he bases his own sense of lucid dream logic. I also really liked how the stakes were so high for the characters in dreams: if you die in a dream, for example, what if you don't wake up, but end up in a kind of dream limbo, or something bizarre like that? How do these levels affect you if you're injured or dying? This is not as simplified as in the Matrix, albeit with less 'tells' than showing it happen.Aw hell, who cares? This is creative summer entertainment on one hand, and a brainy-emotionally-psychologically engaging story with a melancholy core. When it gets thrilling, it thrills (hallway fight, anyone), and when it needs to move, it does so, or when it needs to provide little ""ooh"" visual wonders like Joseph Gordon Levitt floating along and doing his part in the time-frame, Nolan comes up with wonders there too. It shouldn't require a repeat viewing, yet I do want to go back again, not to have things re-explained to me, which is unnecessary, but to revisit the characters, the multi-layered (literally) story structure, and the intensity of the direction. It's a helluva trip through the ""architecture of the mind"", and a very fine return to form to the 'early' sort of mind-f***er movies Nolan's made in the past.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Movie... Ever....,"Inception is an amazing movie that must be seen to enjoy the Summer blockbusters. The fact is that this movie is probably the if not tied for the best movie that I have ever seen. The movie is amazing and should be seen regardless of the liking of which forte, for Inception covers them all and covers them so well that you can't help but have chills from the awesomeness of the movie, even well after the movie was over. The acting was fantastic (Leo's best performance), and the writing and directing from the master Christopher Nolan was amazing. Inception is a must see to, and deserves at LEAST 11 Academy Awards (but, this might be the film that can get to 12 with Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Original Screenplay, Best Makeup, Best Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound Editing, and Best Editing).

Inception is NOT Paprika!,"Many people may think: why to write the 1254th review of the same film? Well, because something is needed to be pointed out: Inception is NOT Paprika.

Yes, they share the aspect that one person can enter someone else's dream (Paprika's spoiler: and even shared dreams to an extent) but the development, the goals of the characters, the scenarios (not just the look, but its use) and the plot are completely different. We're facing two films with their respective strengths and weaknesses. I think there's so few left to speak about Inception, but to say that everything on it was carefully designed and filmed.

All of its plot is based on very simple idea, yet this simple idea fails to convince me that it's somehow possible in real world or necessary for heroes to accomplish or this movie is supposed to teach me something or relay the message. Come on, I was on the edge of my seat when I was watching The Matrix going WOW several times and I was never disappointed and what a simple yet powerful message this was! With Inception I felt like watching The Prison Break series episode 10050. The movie provides absolutely no answers why I should bother to worry if they deliver the thought to the poor sob's head which they drugged on the plane. I simply don't care if they succeed or not.

I kept thinking the movie would have intriguing thought provoking idea, but it was so predictable. It turned into a real snooze. The premise of the movie is not enough to carry the entire movie.

"DiCaprio & Co. manipulate dreams in a visionary, futuristic crime thriller!","""Inception"" is just brilliant. An unusual premise combined with intelligent story-telling and original writing, resulted in a fantastic science-fiction thriller with both a dramatic love story and an action-packed heist. Dreams have never been explored, defined and created in such an original way before in a film, and in a summer full of sequels and remakes, it's great to finally see a movie with brand-new and thought provoking material that is without a doubt one of the best pictures of the year so far.Cobb is an extractor and when somebody is dreaming, he and his team will be able to access the subject's mind, find their way around it and then retrieve a specific piece of information. Together with his assistant Arthur and his architect Nash, he is working to retrieve something from the dream of Saito at the beginning of the film, but their mission fails when Saito discovers a flaw in the design of the dream and realizes that he is asleep. Cobb and Arthur are trying to escape from Japan, but Saito catches them and offers them a job, requiring them to perform the act of inception, planting an idea in somebody's mind instead of merely retrieving it. Although Arthur is strictly against it, Cobb reluctantly agrees, mainly because Saito offers him an opportunity to see his children again, who are cut off from their father in the United States. Cobb makes his way to Paris to assemble a new team for this mission, but as it turns out it maybe more difficult than anticipated to make it out alive of this mission.No synopsis could ever do justice to the complex plot of this film, and the story depends on so many little factors that you simply have to see the film to completely understand it. ""Inception"" is complicated, yes, but if you can keep your brain sharp for the entire 2 1/2 hours, you are almost guaranteed to leave the movie theatre immensely satisfied with what you have just witnessed. The film may be complex, but at no point in this movie I was confused, and that says a lot about the way this film tries to explain its premise to the audience. You can try to compare this film with others, such as ""The Matrix"", but ultimately it's in a category all by itself, and could best be defined as a futuristic crime-thriller. Of course, the entire concept of accessing and manipulating dreams has to be explained to the baffled audience at first, before the big coup of planting an idea can take place, a part mostly filled out by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He has to fill in Ellen Paige's character Ariadne, and his explanations sounded so scientific, that I had no trouble believing that such a deed could be possible.The film also succeeds, because it cleverly balances an emotional love story, with numerous scenes of action, but still hardly ever slows down. Not a single moment seems to be wasted in this film, and I was captivated by the slowly untangling history between DiCaprio's character and his wife that was very reminiscent of a big puzzle, with small pieces being added throughout the film, but the complete picture only offered itself to the viewers at the end. Christopher Nolan truly shows his ability as a director through the perfectly choreographed action scenes, and the film already opens in high gears, with a great shooting scene. Once again, there is a lot happening in the first 15 minutes, and for a while you won't realize what is going on, but the art of this film is that everything seems to make sense sooner or later. There are several more chase scenes and even more shootings, but without a doubt the best action scene in this film, quite possibly one of the best ones ever shot for a film, involves Joseph Gordon-Levitt fighting off two thugs in the corridor of a hotel room with shifting and eventually no gravity at all.I still can't believe that the young guy from ""Titanic"", turned out to be such a great actor, and even makes a convincing hero in an action film. Leonardo DiCaprio, against all odds, became a real badass in his film projects, and ""Inception"" is bound to give him his fourth Oscar nomination, and possibly his first win. He is fantastic, both as the leader of the team trying to plant the idea, and the tortured husband, who is haunted by the demons of his wife's death. There will definitely be several discussions about which actors with gather an Oscar nomination, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is certainly a good candidate, if only for the beautiful action sequence without gravity. There is not much revealed about his character, but he has great charisma, and is really the only one who brings a few humorous moments into this film. Marion Cotillard, who is in high demand since ""La Vie en Rose"" three years ago, is at her very best as Cobb's deceased wife, who still haunts him in his dreams. The rest of Cobb's team consists of Ellen Page as Adriane, who does a great job, especially in her interactions with DiCaprio, Tom Hardy as the cynical Forgerer Eames, and Dileep Rao as the Chemist Yusuf. Ken Watanabe, who has a great authoritative presence, plays Saito, who seems to be a villain, but eventually turns out to be an honorable businessman, and Cillian Murphy plays the man who is supposed to have the idea planted in his head, who will inherit his father's entire business, despite him being disappointed with his son.Inception is a movie highlight of the year 2010, and through its fresh concept will certainly be a candidate for the big trophy at next year's Oscars. Now, I just hope that nobody will attempt to make a sequel of this film and that Christopher Nolan will put just as much creativity into his next film, the third ""Batman"" movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
mind games and mazes making this movie amazing!,"The actors were exceptional, playing their roles with 100% adamant skill creating a killer cast which helped propel the movies momentum as it was hyped and psyched up prior to release.Upon watching the movie, each minute was a blast as much as a puzzle itself! thinking was imminent and necessary, hardly giving you time to lean back and take a bite of your popcorn. This movie isn't for you and your girlfriend to be all touchy in, but take her along if she's interested into movies which get your mind going like a maths test! Come to think about it, you can sort of see matrix through the backbone of the movie but it is clearly magical none the less! The action scenes were perfectly timed, making it adequate rather than over-done and time consuming. The dialog, which i believe is a VERY important factor to movie success, surpassed me, blowing my mind away at every moment. Leonardo DiCaprio has been on a true roll with a back to back spree with ""shutter island"" and now this, living up to audience expectations with his acting.Mind blowing action scenes, intellectually battering dialog, talented actors and a plot with a very imaginative basis and you get THE TOP MOVIE this year, INCEPTION.

Does for dreams what Back to the Future did for time,"To begin, I want to make it absolutely clear no matter what you read in the following article, go and see Inception.Christopher Nolan has been polluting the airwaves for over 10 years now with fantastic movies such as 'The Dark Knight' for action fans, 'Insomnia' for fans of psychological thrillers, and 'Memento' for those who like to think about a movie, a lot. But then steps forward Inception, Nolan's true masterpiece. It's nothing less than perfect. Like a combination of all his life's work, like everything up to this point have been mere obstacles he had to manoeuvre in order to make this fantastic piece of work.The plot is so difficult to explain that it would take an entire page just to make a dent, so lets say there's a man called Cobb (Leo DiCaprio) who steals things, he's a thief. Now lets say he can some how go into people's dreams and there thoughts. But in order to make a more engrossing and action packed story, lets say this time, he has to plant an idea. That's the very basics of what can only be described as, the most complicated, but monumentally brilliant story every created. The entire mythology Nolan has created around the dreamscape can only be compared to what other film makers did with the rules of time and space. The amazing amounts of thought and creativity that has gone into every little detail is incredible on it's own, but when you plan to make a movie based AROUND this idea, not ABOUT it, then you cross the border into pure Godliness.The only flaw that you can possibly spot within this labyrinth of a movie is however, the characters and their complete lack of story and depth. All apart from the main character, Cobb, they share equal amounts of restricted screen time as Nolan rightfully realised that in order to harness the story's true power, you need to focus on the story itself, rather than split it off into tangents every 5 seconds. Characters such as Ellen Page's curious architecture student Ariadne and Tom Hardy's truly magnificent Eames are used merely as pawns by Nolan to tell this epic and infatuating tale of sub-conscious dreaming, and so, they receive very little to no back story what so ever, leaving us the audience to work this out for ourselves. A very ballsy but spot on move from Nolan as we do start to generate feelings for these bare-bones projections and any back stories apart from Cobb's (which is the key to the entire plot) would have crippled the excitingly fast pace of the movie.There's barely a moment in the entire 148 minutes when something wasn't being explained or dreams weren't being explored meaning Incepion is a movie you have to keep both eyes on at all times. Miss one thing, even a little tiny explanation of a very small section of the dreamscape, and you could end up completely lost. It is because of this (the incredibly engaging plot) that when the credits roll and you are now forced the peel your eyes from the screen, the previous 148 minutes seems so real and so engaging, that the movie in itself felt like a dream. And an outstanding one at that.Inception manages to make Nolan's previous work look like a children's cartoon as far as complexity is concerned and acting-wise, it's pretty much on the same level. DiCaprio's leading performance is a very emotionally aware and painfully focused one and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy all put in fantastic performances also, but the fact is, they didn't have to. Their believable acting is just another satisfying tick on the clipboard, not a requirement as the story takes over the entire audience's attention. Sure if they had been really bad it would be noticeable, but they could have portrayed their roles in a more Hollywood-style fashion and nobody would have realised. It is for this reason that I believe the actors are the hidden gem of this complicated maze of a picture.To conclude, Inception may be the most complex and engaging films you see all year, and if you focus purely on the movie itself and don't get distracted, it should be the best too. To me, Inception is Nolan's masterpiece and serves as a much needed kick-up-the-arse to the likes of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich.

"Be prepared, to be completely blown away...","Like many other out there who have been reading about all the hype Inception has been bringing the World Wide Web, and possible your friends, I got to the movie theater as soon as I could to watch it. And let me tell you, this movie has a whole new twist. It is not a ""cookie cutter"" plot, it doesn't have a theme you have found in another movie, it is just flat out unique and amazing. (No wonder it took Nolan 8 years to release it!) The acting in this film is just flat out outstanding. After watching Cillian Murphy in ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Batman Begins"", it was hard to picture him acting in any other type of role. But this film just pushed the bar up a few more levels! He does an exceptional job with this film! Don't even get me started with DiCaprio's performance. You can just expect that to be great, and let me tell you, IT IS.Nolan choice to pick actors from the Batman Series (Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy) was a risky one. Its hard to picture these actors in another type of role after watching the Batman Series, especially the number of times I have re-watched them. But nonetheless, High Risk = High Reward, and without a doubt is this one a high reward.This movie will literally Blow you away. Its worth every penny. I watched the movie in 2D, and it was great.

Nolan's worst film.  A great caper movie morphs into a terrible action flick.,"As Christopher Nolan's budgets get bigger, his movies get worse. He is an excellent director when he is given a project that isn't overly ambitious. With his more ""epic"", ""blockbuster"" films though, he shows a lot more weaknesses. Nothing illustrates those weaknesses more than Inception. It is a movie that starts off at the same level as Memento, but declines and hits rock bottom on the same level as the recent Transformers movies. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the last 45 minutes or so of the movie is that bad. It is nothing but the same loud, poorly shot, poorly choreographed, and boring action that has spread throughout movies nowadays like a disease.For at least the first hour, I could see why this movie got such great reviews. It presents itself initially as a dark and surreal Ocean's Eleven. The first act is spent acquainting us with the rules of dream thievery while the main character, Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), assembles his ""safecracking"" team. In typical caper movie fashion, he finds the specialists that he needs, all of whom have their own talents and personalities. There is the chemist who will whip up the special cocktail needed to sedate everyone for this special job. There the dream actor who can impersonate anyone. There is the financier who hired Cobb and wants to come along to monitor his investment. There is the architect responsible for building the dreamscapes in which the ""safecrackers"" will pull off their caper. The target of this scheme is Robert Fischer (Cilian Murphy), the sole heir to a huge corporate empire. The purpose of this scheme is not to steal anything, but to implant the idea into Fischer's head that he should break up his father's empire. To do that, Cobb and his buddies concoct an incredibly complex scheme that involves a dream within a dream within a dream.For a while, I thought that I was in heaven. But then, in Act II when the caper officially starts, I began to feel doubts. Within minutes, there is a massive car chase and the bullets are flying from all directions. When the dreaming starts, you get a taste of what the rest of the movie is going to be like. Tons and tons of shooting, chases, and action that drags on and on despite having almost no relevance to the plot. It's bad in the dream, it's pretty bad in the dream within a dream, and Holy Jesus, is it ever awful in the dream within a dream within a dream.As the movie progresses, the action becomes more pointless and the action scenes become progressively harder to follow. Dozens of guys who dress like Secret Service agents are gunned down or karate chopped to death. Approximately a half hour is one gigantic non-stop action scene that takes place across all of the dream levels. While the idea of a half hour of non-stop action might sound nice, it drags horribly. Almost no plot development takes place this entire time. There is a shot of a van slowly falling towards the water. Across the long action scene, that van is shown about five or six times. By the time that you are done with this movie, you will be sick to death of seeing that stupid van falling towards the water.Why is it that this movie can't make gunfire and car chases exciting? For starters, the action is very poorly choreographed. You get no sense of location. The challenges that the good guys are facing aren't clearly laid out. Who is where? How many bad guys are there? What you do get is good old shaky-cam, loads of CGI, Matrix-inspired floating, and close-ups of dudes shooting guns. In other words, you get the crap that has virtually destroyed action movies nowadays. Today's directors could learn a lot from action classics like Commando and Die Hard.Speaking of CGI, this movie also has tons of that, and it is technologically impressive, but mostly pointless. The one scene that everybody seems to rave about is the Paris scene where half of the city gets folded in over itself. Eh ‚Äì whatever. It looks cool, but ‚Äì who cares? When did this become part of having a great movie? And why is it that the Road Warrior and the original Star Wars still look cooler to me than modern movies with five times the budget?While I enjoyed most of the non-action parts, this also is probably Nolan's most pretentious movie. The movie starts with the line ""What is the most resilient parasite?"" The answer: ""an idea"". What is this twaddle? Ideas aren't like parasites. I'm constantly seeing ideas brought up, shot down, and forgotten about. And why do you need to tell me this ‚Äì to look smart? Inception is constantly throwing new dream rules at you, and by the end they are a confusing mess. It is these kinds of problems that inspire people to criticize Inception as being a dumb movie that tries to position itself as a smart one.To sum it all up, I think that Inception, in 20 years, will not be viewed by Christopher Nolan fans as one of his best. In fact, I believe that it is his worst film. This guy cannot do good action, and when he has a budget to spend, it seems to just make the movie longer and prettier, but not better. From these criticisms, you might get the impression that I hated the movie. I didn't. Even during the most boring scenes, I wanted the whole scheme to work, and I cared about Dom Cobb enough to be hoping that he would triumph in the end. I did enjoy it enough to watch the movie a second time, just to see if I would like it better. I had the same feelings again ‚Äì falling in love at first, only to be disappointed in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Finally a big budget movie you have to think your way through.,"Having seen the trailers for the past several weeks I was planning to see it but I was certainly not excited about it. The next 2 1/2 hours flew by with a movie that entertained like a big budget movie and challenged the mind like a small ""indie"" flick. As I tried to figure out exactly what happened (which of course will be my opinion since this is the kind of movie that will be open to hundreds of interpretations) I realized I needed to give it another look so I went back the next day and watched it again. I noticed a few slight ""flaws"" the second time through but these were small details that can be rationalized depending on your point of view as to what the movie really was about. Is this a all a dream? Is it real and everything went as planned? Are portions real and the end a dream? There will be countless debate on this and we know Mr. Nolan will never tell. What I do know after this and the sensational ""Dark Knight"" I am now in the ""Christopher Nolan is far and away the most creative person in the film industry"" camp. I strongly recommend to everyone - go see this and form your own conclusions - this movie does not preach, but just entertains and challenges.

I didn't talk about anything else for days.,"Wow. Its not often that I walk out of a cinema after seeing a movie and feel the need to pinch myself. This film is so clever that I truly thought that it was out of human capability to come up with a story line so complex but yet fits so perfectly together.When reading a description of this film in the cinema magazine that you pick up before you go in, I'm not going to lie I was terrified. Having already ordered my tickets and being unable to change my mind, the words ""Hold on to your heads for a real brain bender"" put me off instantly. This description of the film made me expect something along the lines of 'The butterfly effect' or 'Donnie Darko', neither of which I fully got my head around and mainly watched for the hunky male leads.However I couldn't be more wrong about this masterpiece of a film, I cannot really summarise in words how much it will make your jaw drop continuously throughout and highly recommend that you see this.In conclusion - Phenomenal performances from everyone on screen - Fantastic music - Fantastic settings - Pure genius of a story line - FlawlessDo not miss out on this, fasten your seat-belts to be truly blown away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"In the dictionary under the word 'Flawless' is a poster of Inception. Yes, it's really that good.","There are many movie mysteries in life: What did Bob say to Charlotte in Lost in Translation? What will the second Kill Bill sequel called? Will Toy Story 3 make or break my childhood dreams? But out of all of these obscurities, the knowledge that Inception will, in all likelihood be as overlooked at the upcoming Academy Awards as Nolan's last film: The Dark Knight, is the most frustrating.Unlike his iconic mish-mash chronology of his prior filmography, the narrative (though not for once without it's thought provoking logic) generally remains undemanding and plausible.Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) understands the infectious power of an idea or otherwise known as: 'The greatest parasite'. Notwithstanding his highly perilous job, which is usually to remove an idea from a set target, he now has to, in order to save his family, triumph the widely considered impossibility of an inception: The ability to plant an idea within the mind of a victim rather than remove it.Less than a year fresh from his first class Shutter Island performance, DiCaprio firmly remains a beacon of admiration to aspiring young actors yet again. Undeniably a riveting performance. Juno's Ellen Page helps clarify sense of the psychotic dream state as a newly recruited member of the group, making the triumphant tale and importance of Inception less confusing than expected. Support also comes from talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard and Michael Caine ‚Äì who to Nolan refers to as his lucky charm; not that he needs one.Nolan, having now just finished his 7th film, with four of his previous works among the IMDb top 250, all with certified freshness and a scarcely small amount of Oscar nominations, at the very least deserves a Best Director Nomination for the Memento movie making maestro.

Nolan's Genius - A Dream for most of the directors,"Well, the trailers, the reviews had my anticipation going before I watched the movie. However, the expectations were tower high as Chris Nolan is one of my favorite directors and Leo is my favorite star. I prefer never to miss his movies.Merits First : Story , Screenplay and Direction : 10/10 ,Direction was consistent in all the places, didn't feel continuity errors, Story and Screenplay were so engaging that involved the viewers at every point in the movie, challenges them and leaves them enthralled, confused , wanting for more.CGI / Special Effects : 8/10 , Got patchy in a couple of places,specially the Paris Cafe Scene.Acting : 10/10 Totally Blown away by the performances of Leo, Ellen Page , Joseph Gorden Lewitt , Tom Hardy are exceptionally good .Technicals , Cinematography , Casting : 10/10 Nolan just paints the canvas with beautiful dreams and subconsciousness of people.Background Score needs a special mention as it adds to the mood of the film.Inception is the story of Dom Cobb(Leo) and his team of ""Extractors"" , who deal with a special kind of security called subconscious security. They enter the dreams of subjects, extract their secrets from the dreams. Cobb is a fugitive of American government and corporates. He stays in Japan and want to get back to his family. A Powerful Japanese client offers him a deal to give his life back in return for his life and lift all the bans on him in return for planting an idea in his competitor's mind. Cobb decides to take a ""Leap of Faith"" and starts collecting his team for this. He meets Ariadne, a young and bright architect from his father's university , and Eames who leads him to Yusuf, a chemist with deep sleep sedatives. Together, they start working on the mission to plant the dream in Fischer Jrs Idea.No spoiler's here I will not reveal anything from suspense but on a whole the movie deserves a standing ovation as execution of such a script is a very difficult task, Nolan has handled it quite efficiently. The anti-gravity scenes were too good. The cinematography , the creation of dream worlds , the concept of architects were so good that you can believe that the time required to build the script and its depth took 10 years and the movie was pitched to the producers just after memento.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Sorry guys, but that is the hangover u take with u after watching the movie.OK !¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö Let's start the review.Why did I went to watch this movie ‚Äì1. It's written by C.

New (fresh new) special effect scenes.Highlighting point of the movie ‚Äì1.It is a story about dream invasion, where the characters goes into the dream of Jr. Fischer and wants to implant a new IDEA , which is not easy ,as the new IDEA will not be accepted by Jr. Fischer (or any person) because its somebody Else's thought or an IDEA.2. So, to make it possible, they have a plan. And it is the execution of this plan which is shown in the movie.3. To be very honest, it's not a fairy tale story or a fantasy kind of movie/story.4. The technical aspects of this movie are immaculate, because every action had its true reaction. The use of Science (Physics) used in this movie is awesome.5. The story is very real in its hypothesis, For e.g. ‚Äì a) If the Van is falling from a bridge into the water in 1 min (in the 1st dream), then it will wake up the guys in 10 mins in the 2nd layer of their dream and 30 mins for the guys in the 3nd layer of the dream ¬Ö and many more examples which is kept very realistic.About the director ‚ÄìStanding ovation for Mr. Christopher Nolan.1.

A fun idea for a flight of fantasy,"This is a breathtaking science fiction film to watch and its 2 hours 20 minutes sped by for me. Even if it borrowed a lot from Matrix, Orphee, even Kane at the climax, and others, it was so confident and assured in the depiction and dissection of its nonsense world I couldn't help but be very impressed. So what if the plot apparently bulges with Real World non sequiteurs and Dream World paradoxes ‚Äì as recommended to a character in the film (and by Cocteau in Belle Et La Bete) we have to take a leap of faith. It's why so many people believe in a God.A team of mind altering thieves (Extractors) are recruited and hired by a billionaire capitalist to plant an idea via dreams (Inception) in a rival billionaire capitalist's mind to break up his empire and thus preserve profit margins. As you might or might not imagine it's not so straightforward, leading to a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream and limbo ¬Ö at least. The acting was good, however the characters were basically 2D and although DeCaprio's was fleshed out a little more I didn't empathise with any of them, but the plot was the thing after all! There's no compromise: it's tortuous to follow at times and relentlessly fast paced throughout ‚Äì the first 10 minutes were incomprehensible to me but gradually it became as clear as mud, until even I saw the ending coming. My modern-film-savvy daughter was on hand to act as interpreter but we had to lean on each other and promise a re-view next year sometime. I would add that the actual process of putting people under was thankfully skipped over and Michael Caine's usual death-touches were blissfully brief.On first and second thoughts I recommend this as a film made in 2010 that has absolutely no swearing, no sex, not much violence, a ""realistic"" amount of cgi cartoonery, but a well made engrossing storyline instead.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Absolute masterpiece,"When I thought Nolan could not outshine himself, I watch ""Inception"". This is not only a masterpiece of filmmaking, but a journey to a place you don't want to leave. One hour after watching it I am not able to fully describe what I've seen, heard and felt. It's absolutely essential for your life to watch this movie. Once you watch it, you will experience pure genius from an author when trying perfection, and joy when you feel he made it. The cast, action, music, effects, plot and subtext are combined in a way most directors only can dream of. Nolan has proved, once again, that quality, intelligence and talent can also work in mainstream industry. From this moment on, most films will be boring, simple and not worth watching. That only happens when you reach pure happiness. Thank you, Mr. Nolan, culture and cinema are richer because of you, and so are our lives. If this man does not get an Oscar award, the world is definitely doomed to ignorance and therefore to an end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Inception? More Like Insipid,"""Inception"" might have been a better movie -- and would certainly have been more entertaining -- had writer/director Christopher Nolan not made his premise so complicated that the film had to spend its entire 2:25 running time explaining itself to its audience.Seriously, the exposition Never. Stops. There were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause and explain what was going on to another character, which of course was a ham-fisted way of explaining it to us. But even with all of that aggressive exposition, the movie never does make a lot of sense. The result is a lot of busyness -- oh, there's always plenty of stuff going on -- that's nevertheless pretty boring because it's never clear what all of the busyness is for.Nolan has done this to us before. Who the hell came out of ""The Prestige"" with any clue what that movie was about? And even his more narratively coherent films (like ""The Dark Knight"") suffer from a lack of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises can't support. ""Inception"" is no exception (ha!). The movie is junk trying to disguise itself as something important and significant. How much more fun it would have been if it had just been content to be junk.Grade: C-",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Not only was the acting brilliant, the story superb, and just the overall concept and execution flawless, but I left the theatre completely mind blown. I left in a state of wonder, a state that I have yet to come out of even though it has been 8 hours since seeing it.""Inception"" has caused me to ponder the nature of dreams and reality, made me just sit down and think, something so many films nowadays do not do. I am 16, and I am disappointed at how so many films do not strive to be anything special now. The main aim is to pull in as much money in the box office as possible. James Cameron is even re-releasing ""Titanic"" in 3-D and I am dying to know why? What is the need? More money?! However Nolan's ""Inception"" was simply exquisite in every possible way. It contained romance, comedy, suspense, fantasy, reality, and anything else you could ask for.There are going to be the reviewers that say this movie was too confusing, or that it was nowhere near as good as everyone is making it out to be, but I implore each and every one of you to go see this movie and make the decision for yourself. This is a film that more films need to strive to be like. Far too many of the films that have come out in the past ten years are lacking in one aspect or another, but ""Inception"" is truly a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Maybe this is better than Dark Knight.,"I just came out of a movie theater. I am very shocked by this movie. Dark Knight was super incredible but it is amazing how a guy can produce another equally amazing master piece.Story, acting, directing are all rock solid. Carrying such a complicated story can turn out to be a disaster but Christoper Nolan has a perfect control over the progress of story.He plays the audiences' mind in a high level and never fails to lose the composure and intensity of the story through the entire running time. To that such an intense and emotional story, he also inserted appropriate amt of humor to provide some relaxations.All the CG is wisely used and provides jaw dropping experiences.Acting wise, Leonardo Diccaprio does what he does basically providing his overall great acting. All the others are also superbly casted. Especially the guy from 500 Summer is better than I expected. He looks serious enough and does provide some funny moments.Again, I am very impressed with what Christoper Nolan pulled off. In my opinion, he is actually becoming one of those legendary directors such as Hitchcock. Nolan got famous for stories dealing Human's psychology. This is another those stories but in a gigantic scale.Usually many directors fail to produce good movies with a lot of money but this Christopher Nolan has no limitations. he did that in Dark Knight and also in this movie, 'Inception'.I look forward to seeing his next possibly masterpiece film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Riveting and Most Original Nolan Masterpiece,"If Avatar raised the bar high with its stupendous technical accomplishment, then Inception has set the bar even higher with its technical brilliance intertwined with a story that keeps you riveted to your seats till the end. Where Avatar missed out with its otherwise bland storyline, Inception has delivered and how! ''An idea can transform the world'' - the perfectionist Christopher Nolan's unique idea about dreams materialized into Inception and has transformed the very notion of a 'movie'. Nolan, who leaves no stone unturned in hunting out the perfect actors in his films does not make an exception here. Known for bringing out the most engrossing performances from his cast, the vintage Nolan has once again succeeded in making his actors give such effortless executions of their roles thus orchestrating into one of the most intriguing movies ever made.True to Nolan style, Inception keeps you guessing with its thrills and spins, the delicate intricacies that make perfect use of your mind and the engaging visuals that never leave even a single minute boring. One of the most original scripts written by Nolan with fantastic dialogues, the mind-boggling multi-layered film simply entices you with its breathtaking cinematography and superb special effects.You can feel yourself sharing the dreams of the extractors as Dom Cobb, the master extractor goes on stealing ideas from the human mind by sharing dreams. You can feel his emotions as his belief torments his soul and Ariadne's anxiety that his personal pain might actually bring about the downfall of their entire mission. If the movie's first half enchants you with its charm then the second half simply blows your mind. For the first half is the basic lead-up to the actual process of inception shown in the second half, which Dom Cobb takes up as a challenge which would aid him to return to his children.And there lies the multi-layered dream fantasy, a dream within a dream - something you have never seen before. And each layer is executed with such impeccability and intelligence that you cannot help taking your eye off the screen for even a single second.And to top it all Hans Zimmer's association with the movie brings out the best in every scene with his brilliant score.Over the years Leonardo Di Caprio has grown even better as an actor and his latest offering of Cobb, the corporate spy with a tortured mind might finally be enough for an Oscar breakthrough. Ellen Page as the prodigious architect, Ariadne and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cobb's team member, Arthur deliver impressive performances. Ken Watanabe's portrayal of a cunning businessman was absolutely just what the movie required. Tom Hardy as the witty forger, Eames and Cilian Murphy as the heir, Fischer Jr with hidden emotions do a commendable job. Last but not the least, Marion Cotillard was haunting and bewitching in her small role as Cobb's deceased wife, Mal who appears in his subconscious.This is by far Nolan's best offering till date. While a single viewing might not be enough to grasp the film entirely, its grandeur will simply mesmerize the audience and cover up any flaw, if it really has any. If Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight raised the bar of expectations, then Nolan has simply exceeded those expectations with Inception and makes himself an absolutely compelling candidate for the Academy Awards!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Inception marks a new era in film-making. Intellectually engaging and terrifically entertaining.,"Inception is the new sci-fi movie that has taken America and Britain by storm. In the US alone on it's first weekend of release, it engrossed a staggering $60.4 million dollars and is currently top of the box office around the world. This movie has been hyped up beyond anything I have ever known in magnitude. Plenty of friends I know in America informed me of the same adjectives used to describe this movie ""incredible"" ""unbelivable"" ""terrfic"" and common phrases associated with it like ""Christopher Nolan is a god film-maker"" and with the film in general ""the best film ever"" etc. Usually I typically associate these adjectives and ""the best film ever"" phrase with a lot of movies I have had the pleasure of viewing over the years. But to describe it with the adjectives listed above is an understatement. There are no words that can reiterate how this film is. Just using all the adjectives to describe something you like will have to do. Usually when a film like Inception is hyped, I get swarmed along with it. You just cannot help it, it's like the institution of cinema has an overwhelming attraction to you that you give in to see films like Inception. I would certainly rate Inception in terms of how amazing it is up there with Titanic, Avatar and The Lord of the Rings trilogies.Christopher Nolan, I knew nothing of his work before he reinvigorated the Batman franchise. With Batman Begins he did this very well but the Dark Knight as those who will know have looked at my review on it, I found it bitterly disappointing to say the least though I was the minority in arguing this. But most directors have their successes and failures and after Inception Nolan truly deserves to join the other Hollywood King of directors like James Cameron, Steven Spielburg, Clint Eastwood and Peter Jackson. This is Nolan's masterpiece.To start the basic story is that Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCapario) a highly skilled thief at extracting ideas from an individual's subconscious whilst they are dreaming is a fugitive after he lost everything he loved and is given the chance to go back to his children if he pulls off one last heist of implanting an idea in Robert Fischer's mind (Cillian Murphy) to bring down an empire run originally by his dad. Cobb ensembles a team of experts, which includes an architect that designs the world of the dream, Ariadne (Ellen Juno) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt). The idea to bring the empire down is to pull off Inception, a supposed impossible dream system, which involves creating a dream within a dream within a dream, basically three dream layers, which is impossible to maintain before the dreamer wakes up in real state. Meanwhile a back story that does though come into conjunction with the main plot later on is Cobb's visions of seeing his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) where his memories of her interrupt the dream state.Watch as events unfold before you as from the first scene, this is truly a movie you need both your eyes, ears and mind to see. It is stunning visually as the idea of controlling one dreams with different layout's and shapes takes effect. Never has architecture seem so fascinating. Watching it is like art, creative, textured and multi-layered exactly like a dream. Trying to make your brain function at trying to understand the complexity of the multi-layered dreams in the story is simplified, but you have to pay attention. This film is literally perfect. The acting from DiCaprio is brilliant and just like the excellent Shutter Island, he deserves an Oscar nomination. Terrific support comes from Murphy, Juno, Levitt and Cotillard who flex out their roles and make the most of it. Sir Micheal Caine gives a superb tiny cameo of only being on the screen for a few minutes.Nolan appreciates that story and character and plot development is as important as visual style and action, with the action being plenty of and choreographed incredibly making it terrifically exciting. Each character has depth particularly Cobb and there are extremely inventive camera shots and angles that Nolan uses with a gorgeous cinematography, a stunning music score and a cracking ending that leaves you to draw your own conclusions. It reminds me of Mulholland Drive with dreams and reality.Nolan has created a movie that will have impact on every film maker to come and Inception will become a classic. Film enthusiasts and critics will be analysing this for years. Truly a remarkable and stupendous achievement for Nolan who has come up with an original and refreshing story idea. All film departments perform immaculately like a well oiled machine and I wouldn't bet for me on this being the best film of the year for me. The 9.3 of the IMDb rating is well justified. It's two and half hours this film, but they fly by. One of the greatest and surely iconic and influential film's of our time in over a hundred years of cinema. I can't give it more praise than that except to say I loved Inception!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ironically... a Dream Come True!,"I always type my reviews in Notepad, but no ‚Äì Inception deserves better. After a run of the most amazing films ever ‚Äì Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, and of course, The Dark Knight (my all time favourite!), Nolan is finally ready with his next experiment: Inception, a dream-come-true movie (which is kind of ironic!) that makes us question the existence of the very world around us. One assumed that The Dark Knight was the ultimate peak that any film maker could ever reach ‚Äì Nolan included ‚Äì but this young director refuses to accept that there is a Cloud 9 ‚Äì and simply questions, ""What next?"" And BANG answers it himself: Inception. My new all-time favourite.The English Dictionary defines ""inception"" as ""origin"" ‚Äì basically, that is what the film is about. It's about planting an idea in someone's mind, hence, ""originating"" an idea in that person. It's the most amazing experiment anyone has ever performed: an impossible world where you enter dreams, and dreams within dreams, and dreams within those, until you realize that such a movie is only ever found in dreams, except that Nolan doesn't think so.Nolan uses his incredible direction skills in this movie to make it the wonder it is. His direction is what makes this film tick. His timing is just amazing. Caprio does full justice to his character, Cobb. Zimmer's music keeps us with Nolan's pace, which is why it all turns out to be so incredible. The cinematography, superb, the special effects, superb, the editing, perfect, the script, brilliant. This movie has everything!But then the only question that people are asking now is ‚Äì which one is it ‚Äì The Dark Knight, or Inception? I'll be blunt honest. The reason Memento didn't work as well as TDK, despite being an amazing film, is that it wasn't a film for everyone. Only those people who're willing to take the weight, the tension, and those who have a high presence of mind, and an understanding of the complexity of a highly complex film will be able to fully enjoy the film. Inception pushes TDK aside with ease, but not for the entire world. If one has noticed, then you can see that Nolan is following an alternative pattern in all his films that have made it to the Top IMDb 250: Memento, highly complex, Batman Begins, not so, Prestige, complex again, The Dark Knight, not so, and now Inception, his most incredible project.I immediately called up people after the movie, telling them to go watch it, and I was shocked beyond anything when one of the friends said, ""I'm going for Eclipse. Can't."" Learn your lesson, people, do NOT miss this wonder. Like Toy Story, this too comes once in a decade. Though in Nolan's case, that's not true. Trust Nolan.

Interesting but overrated,"I was keen to see this film given the high IMDb rating, as I agree with nearly all ratings I've seen on the site, but I appear to be one of the minority who think it is overrated. I couldn't emotionally engage with the characters for some reason, and so was not too concerned on the outcome for them.Whilst there were some complexities to the plot, it is reasonably easy to understand. I agree with some other comments I've seen that many characters accepted the quite fantastical premise very readily, and were prepared to place themselves at considerable risk for no real reason. So some reactions were not what you would expect for the situation.Having had time to reflect I would watch the film again, but do not think I will keep coming back to this unlike the Matrix which has a similar feel but is a much better film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overrated Tripe,"Very, very overrated film. Worth seeing in the cinema for the visual effects but would never buy the DVD. The acting is good but the content lacks a truly engaging story line.

It seems to me as though the film could've been pulled off with a less talented supporting cast. Also it is slightly confusing in some parts. Other parts are way too predictable.

Inception : Easily makes top 10 of best movies ever,"Its been a couple of hours since I watched this new movie by Christopher Nolan. After watching Memento,Batman Begins and Dark Knight, I was quite confident that this would be a memorable experience. Also the expectations were rising high and I knew that it got good reviews, still I was able to shut myself from all of them and see the movie fresh.I would rather say that I was blown away with the plot. Its something one has never imagined of. The whole movie was so exciting and blink-and-you-will-miss type that you will have to see it again or rethink it again and again to grasp the total plot, just like 'Memento'. I was always fond of Nolan's movie background sounds as it keeps you at the edge of your seat.Now comes the acting part. Caprio was excellent, well accompanied by Joseph Gordon Levitt and Ellen Page and others. But I would rather say that the actors didn't got much chance to do anything. They did exactly what the script demanded.The direction was top notch along with the breathtaking visuals and locations. Especially the dream scenes. As for the academy awards, I expect this film to grab the prize in direction,screenplay,sound mixing,sound editing and visual effects and may also the best picture(not quite sure after watching Toy Story 3 few weeks back).Anyway, for the people who are reading this review before going to see it, I would advise that, this would blow your mind.

The sensation of the film is there, you feel like youre also in a dream. Let's not forget Hans Zimmer who is in my opinion the best film composer there is, the music is epic and works perfectly with the movie! Absolutely incredible!

Have seen quite a bit of movies over the last 2 years, but none of them ever incited me to discuss it with my friends, or even if they did, not the way inception is doing now.People rave about avatar, but other than the fancy graphics the storyline was very bland. None of that's going to happen with inception. From the start right till the end, it will keep you wondering as to what might come next. Makes you think as well. You don't have to be super smart to understand the movie. An average person will surely absorb it pretty decently.Leo has been amazing as always. He's a brilliant actor, probably the best currently. Nolan and leo both deserve Oscars for what they have achieved here. Levitt has been damn good. The last I saw of him was in 500 days of summer. Was pleasantly surprised to see him in a mature role. Not sure about Ellen Page. Nothing in her role made me say ""wow, she's damn good"". She was okay. Ken Watanabe was decent. Tom Hardy was good. I liked the way he portrayed being a more serious/jovial kind of person as opposed to how Levitt is, especially all.I am damn happy for watching the first-day-first-show for this movie.

The ending credits are the same for every movie. He put in a fortress in the snow like the fortress in the beginning of Batman Returns. And what about that snow? It's like he just wanted to say let's film in the snow! He is actually stealing a lot of this from other movies and getting the credit for this being an original movie.

Are you people watching the same film as me!!????,"OK here goes. I'll prepare myself for an ass kicking.I finish watching this film thinking are you guys really watching the same film as me!!?? Does this film really deserve 9.1 out of 10??? (1st sept 2010).I found this film incredibly frustrating. So I guess at the start you learn what a cool concept the film is based on. Nice idea. Very interesting. So why take over 2hrs to get to the point!!?? I fell asleep twice whilst watching it and still managed to catch the end - not feeling that i'd missed anything important.I didn't really like the characters. In these films you tend to connect with as least ONE character but I didn't feel it here at all.So some of you like the FX?? Yeah that ONE scene they used in the trailer. The one they sold the film on.Oh yeah. The last rant....i cant stand films where they introduce rules and details that only apply in the next few scenes. It so annoying and predictable. They do that a lot in this film.So anyway. I left asking myself and the other people I saw this with why this film is so overrated and there are a lack of bad reviews about it. We concluded its one of these trendy films that are meant to be clever and intelligent. I think people will be afraid of saying bad points about this just in case it suggests that they don't understand the concept. I for one did understand it, I just didn't like it. I certainly don't think it deserves 9.1 out of 10.My suggestion....just go and rent Matrix or Minority Report or something like that.

"Confusing, but a Great Film. TEN STARS!","I just recently saw this film, and to say the least I am impressed. Christopher Nolan has done what many people can't seem to do these days, which is to come up with an original idea and make it a great film. If you can make it through a movie while being slightly confused, this is a movie for you. It is full of action, science fiction, and mind boggling storyline. It is a great film and a must see! Leonardo De Caprio rocked his performance, along with Jason Gordon Levitt and Ellen page. This movie also has humor in it, which is unexpected, but put in very good timing. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself, and makes The Dark Knight look amateurish. So get in line, buy the ticket, and watch this movie as many times as you can.

"Good film, not the best","I found this film to be neither the greatest (sci-fi or not) film ever, nor did it suck the way some recent commentators seem to think. I did think it was quite good. Leonardo DiCaprio has finally grown up and is an outstanding actor. Ellen Page was very good as well. (I had never heard of her until she was recently in some TV commercials in the U.S., which told me that lots of other people know who she is) For a pretty young actress, her role was 99% asexual. In only one very brief scene would it have mattered if the role was played by a man.But the best thing about Inception was its originality. It was not a sequel, remake, re-made TV show, or re-made comic book, which is all that Hollywood seems to churn out these days.As for its complexity, I was able to follow quite well, certainly well enough to enjoy it. The few points I'd missed, I read in the FAQ section here, and frankly, I'm not sure I would have gotten them on a second viewing alone.I understand why many folks are miffed by its high all-time ranking. Y'all just have to understand that so many voters are young people who have not seen, or do not like, classic cinema, so recent films will always be overstated. It will be interesting to see what Inception's rating will be twenty years from now.I recommend checking it out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unbelievable in every way,"This movie came out on my birthday July 16, 2010, so I went to see as a present from my parents. I had high expectations seeing as how Chris Nolan is one of my favorite Directors and Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors. I was blown away by the acting, directing, plot, and special effects of this film. This movie easily replaced The Departed as my favorite film of all time. This movie is just so perfect. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time in the Theater. I was thinking about this movie the whole night after I got home from the theater, so I just decided to write a review about it to tell everyone to go see it.

What Dreams May Come...,"For all its flaws (and there are some), ""Inception"" succeeds as a star-studded blockbuster with a brain. Christopher Nolan has, yet again, crafted a work that manages to inspire both thought and awe: a rare feat, to be sure. As the film opens, the audience is thrown mercilessly into a scene of cascading schemes and chaotic confrontations. We, as audience members, feel uneasy; we don't know exactly where we stand on the characters or the situation at hand, and that's the way Nolan wants it (talk about 'in medias res'). By the time the first wave of tension subsides, another approaches in its wake. This new wave proves to be a tsunami; as the plot unfolds, revelations spring free, character motives come into question, and the film's dream world expands exponentially.The plot of ""Inception,"" without giving anything away, goes something like this. Leonardo DiCaprio's Cobb, a sort of ""dream thief,"" takes on one final assignment, courtesy of Ken Wantanabe's corporate kingpin. Cobb assembles a team, ranging from Joseph Gordon- Levitt's crafty pretty-boy to Ellen Page's boyish architect. Things get a little crazy as the mission proceeds (certain characters just might be holding back some important information), and a nail-biting spectacle takes the stage.I don't know how much Christopher Nolan was paid for this screenplay, but I can guarantee that it wasn't enough. The story examines the very nature of dreams; it explores their nuances, their limitations, and their possibilities, while at the same time exploring some of the science behind them. When characters have to choose between their dream worlds and reality, we have to consider which option we would embrace. When characters leap from layer to layer, we consider our own dream complexes. At the same time, a serpentine heist film unfolds on screen. While the plot does require the occasional suspension of disbelief, it plays by its own rules for the greater part of its running time.In fact, most of ""Inception's"" shortcomings have nothing to do with the plot. Apart from a few over-explained monologues at inappropriate times, the script succeeds ferociously. However, some problems arise with the characters and their actor counterparts. While Leonardo DiCaprio's performance doesn't hit the wrong notes, it doesn't always hit the right ones either. DiCaprio has a compelling voice and look, especially early in the film, but trouble brews when the emotional turmoil strikes his character. Rather than reach for new dramatic heights, he settles for simply adequate deliveries. As such, it becomes difficult to invest in his character as anything more than ""Man 1."" Some other talents in the cast, while solid, are given too little to do. Ellen Page is reduced to the classic ""angel on my shoulder"" stereotype, and Tom Berenger and Cillian Murphy are just asked to look concerned for most of the film's duration. Still, Joseph Gordon Levitt looks spiffy, Tom Hardy makes great comic relief, and no one does all too poorly.All in all, ""Inception"" makes for a great time at the theater. It sparks conversation, it moves briskly, and it looks brilliant on the big screen. If Hamlet were to see the dreams put on display here, he might just have shuffled off that mortal coil.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overrated,"Visually interesting and innovative, yet pretentious. It has an excellent cast with great performances. The complexity of its story works perfectly in the way of confusing us.

There are plenty of alleged subtleties and symbols which the fans are so eager to comment. Everyone can write a script that is complex.

This is harder to do.Far from being a masterpiece, extremely overrated.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not Impressed,"This is not my kind of movie. If I want to speculate on what is really happening, I'll read a mystery novel (something I almost never do anymore). I don't enjoy a movie that forces me to try and figure out the plot. Not that it should be totally obvious from the beginning, but this was just too much head work for me and I could tell that it was a puzzler, early on.I go to the movies for entertainment -- not to solve puzzles. After 10 minutes I walked out. I was not entertained and I knew I wouldn't be. After seeing thousands of movies I can usually tell quickly if I'm going to like it.But that's just me. I can see how others thought this movie was great but you must remember that it's not for everyone. I'm not a fan of Matrix or Tron either, so you can see why I'm not interested. Sci-Fi and puzzles are fun for some... not for me anymore.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Plot over content,"I went into Inception with considerable expectation, in regards to the talent and concept involved. I was expecting something truly groundbreaking: a blockbuster that didn't rely on Hollywood's conventions to wow audiences. Ultimately, all that Inception is, is a complex plot disguising a relatively shallow film, supplemented with your standard chase sequences and mindless gun battles where the heroes gun down scores of thugs, who in turn are conveniently inflicted with James Bond syndrome, where they can fire endless rounds and hit nothing. Nolan disguises this by having the one (and only) bullet connect early in the film.Let's talk about plot. I think Nolan has driven himself into a hole. He is universally lauded for his complex, original plots, which make people think, while simultaneously entertaining them. The only problem is, as his projects stack up, Nolan seeks to outdo himself in terms of plot and structure, and not in terms of emotional content. Inception is by far his most structurally complex plot, but unfortunately, the plot is so intricate that he spends the entire film explaining what is going on, rather than building any sort of emotional core for the audience. Watch people come out of a Pixar film, then watch people come out of a Nolan film. As people come out of Inception, they will be talking about the mind-bending plot and the cool fight scenes. You'll be hard pressed to find a conversation about the tragedy between Cobb and Mal. Compare Inception to The Fountain, which faced a similar dilemma. Unlike Nolan, Aronofsky sacrificed explaining his complex plot, and instead, focused on fleshing out emotional resonance in the characters and themes. Financially, it was a terrible decision, but Aronofsky's vision was much more respectable artistically. And don't get me started on Inception's ending 'twist,' which was an insulting cheap trick that will be probably be disregarded by most audiences.The music of Inception was also troublesome. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was formidable, but did not fit with the atmosphere of the film. Instead of supplementing the film, the music made Inception seem pretentious. Just listening to it, you would have thought that the entire world was at stake. Instead, you were just facing a bunch of people that would have been dreaming for a long time, had they failed. Was being 'in limbo' really that big of a threat? I know that Nolan gave the reasons that their brains would rot and all, but I just didn't buy the danger.The film still had its merits. It's easily more intelligent than your average blockbuster, and will have you thinking to keep up with it (a friend compared it to playing a game of minesweeper). It has a great action scene or two, and some innovative visuals. But in the end, Inception doesn't have much to say, and unless you count sorting out plot as thinking, it won't leave you with substance to ponder.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Roller-coaster of the Mind,"Going into see Inception, I have to admit, my expectations were just about as high as they've ever been. I try not to anticipate films too much, so as to avoid disappointment, but with this one, I couldn't avoid it. My expectations were even higher than those I had for The Dark Knight.I just finished watching not thirty minutes ago, and here's how it breaks down. I was instantly drawn into the world that Nolan has so brilliantly created. Each time a new concept was introduced, I found myself captivated by it. I've heard people recently compare this film to Avatar. I have never heard such and erroneous comparison. The thing that separates that two is that Avatar is based solely on its visual effects. Things like that don't amaze me. I am well aware of the capabilities of today's technology. What did amaze me about Inception was not the visuals, it was the ideas. As the movie suggests, and idea is the most powerful thing on earth. It is the greatest weapon mankind possesses. Ideas have built and destroyed the greatest of nation thousands of times over. The ideas in Inception are truly amazing. A group of the 100 smartest people on earth could lock themselves in a room for a year, together, and they still may not imagine so many wonderful things.The first thirty minutes had only a few minor flaws. The next hour was totally spectacular. The final hour dragged somewhat. Everything that was happening was interesting, but it still dragged quite a lot. The beauty of the film, though, is that even when it drags, the ideas behind it never cease to amaze from start to finish.I believe a second viewing may be in order, just to nail down exactly what I didn't like. However, what I did love about it is and will always be very clear. This is the most creative, imaginative, deeply though out film I have ever witnessed. The ideas deserve more than a 10. It is a shame that a lack of knowledge of how to really use them plagued the last hour. But, for all its flaws, its concepts are still truly mind blowing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Get the tickets, big tub of popcorn and ""Have A Ball""","Whenever someone asks me to recommend movies, my simple approach is to ask the movies that they enjoyed most in the past and based on that I recommend. On that ground ‚Äì if you enjoyed Matrix, you are likely to enjoy Inception. (While the movies are very different¬Ö ).In the day and age when approx 90 % of screenplays are adapted (on books, short stories, old movies), here is a concept that is gut wrenchingly original. This is where I have deepest admiration for Nolan as an artist and this is where he stands out from his contemporaries.This Original, Visionary, Fast Paced, Gripping, Complex, Multi Layered Cant-miss-a-second movie is pure genius. Apart from being almost perfect on all technical counts (Direction, screenplay¬Ö.) it is highly entertaining cinema that is full of surrealism (which I am a big fan of). I hate writing something which is fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find any thing I did not like, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time. Dom Cobb (Di Caprio) leads a highly skilled team, specializing in stealing secrets from people's minds by entering their dreams. When they are hired by a mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea. The plot was very pleasingly intricate with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel.I would be lying if I say that I understood 100 % of it, but then you don't expect that from Nolans, Scorseses, Lynchs or Kubrics¬Ö and tell you what..

A must watch sci-fi masterpiece.,"I'm embarrassed to say that I only just watched inception for the first time last week seeing as I have watched so many movies of all genres In my 17 years but I'm glad I waited until seventeen to watch it because if I was younger I don't think I would have appreciated how amazing this film is. Since I watched it a week ago not because I didn't get it the first time but because I could not believe how much I enjoyed it. But I have seen a lot of people rate this film low because they didn't get it which is unfair because it doesn't mean it's bad it just means it isn't pandering to everyone like most films do which results in them having dull plots.
Some of the reasons this film is great include the acting, the acting in this film is on point that includes all characters from cobb to Fischer there were no let downs. Next the music, Hans zimmer had once again created the perfect score which really captures the tone and the feel of the movie. The music makes the action more exciting and brings a lot more passion to the more emotional scenes.
Lastly the plot and script are intricately written giving us enough time with all characters will moving along the story.

"Cerebral actioner, demands repeat viewing","Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite modern filmmakers, so I've been looking forward to this movie ever since I first heard about it.Even though I've seen almost every one of Nolan's previous films, and even though I've been reading about Inception for months, it still managed to completely surprise me in so many ways. The audience is transported to a world where shared dreaming is possible, and thieves have (quite illegally) taken to using this technology to enter people's subconscious minds and steal their secrets. Sounds like a simple setup, right? But the way it's executed, it quickly becomes very, very complex.Watching this film was unlike any experience I've ever had before. I thought it would feel similar to The Matrix, but I was very, very wrong. In The Matrix, the rules of the virtual world are clear, and the heroes and villains have superpowers. Here, there are no superpowers, and the rules of the dream-world are very, very intricate, and loaded with implications that even the experienced dream thieves don't completely understand. In The Matrix, the stakes of each action sequence are very clear -- either the hero will win, or he'll be killed. But Inception is much, much more complex. During the action sequences, I kept thinking to myself, ""Wait, so what does this mean? What happens if they get killed in this dream? What are they trying to do?"" Overall, it's a very cerebral experience that's unlike any other action film I've seen before. But there were also times when it verged on being too complicated, and I thought that maybe I would've enjoyed the action scenes more if they were more straightforward. It was tough for me to be completely invested in the on-screen action when I had to juggle so many other things in my mind at the same time.I'm not saying that's a bad thing, though. Actually, it's quite an accomplishment that Nolan has made a mainstream film that's this original and this cerebral. But ultimately, I feel like I absolutely need to watch it again in order to try and unravel its many layers, to get closer to really figuring it out, and to really pass judgment on it.Also, Inception looks gorgeous. The cinematography is excellent throughout. But watching it in IMAX isn't necessary. I didn't feel like it added anything to the experience, and in some places I thought the special effects might've been less obviously CGI if I were watching them on a regular screen instead of IMAX.And the cast is great. So much of the supporting cast is just spectacular. Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt really stand out here.If you like movies that require you to really think from beginning to end, and demand repeat viewings in order to be fully appreciated, then go watch Inception as soon as possible. If that's not your cup of tea, then don't say I didn't warn you.4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Ellen Page deserves a supporting Oscar nom. On negative notes, some critics complain of too much exposition and several implausible scenarios. Since 'Inception' is all a dream within a dream within¬Ö the implausible scenarios become plausible because they're happening within dreams. My complaint is that there is way too much studio-mandated explosions, gunfire, and car chases. Nolan may never be able to make another 'Insomnia' or 'Memento' in his career. He's the official Warner Brothers, if not industry, stalwart director. The man with the Midas touch, and the cost/price of that money-making achievement is all the unnecessary studio-mandated explosions, gunfire, and car chases that bloat 'Inception.'One last note, 'Inception' employs a cliffhanger (possibly to ensure material for Warner Brothers sequel films) that lacks resolution creating an anticlimax to a story in which the audience has invested 2 hours and twenty minutes.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A simple masterpiece ...,"Words cannot describe how wonderful this film is. I knew from the trailers that Inception was going to be good, but I had no idea it was going to be THIS good. It deserves more than a mere 10/10 stars. A round of applause is what Christopher Nolan needs, he never fails to impress me. Nothing but greatness is expected from the producer of The Dark Knight.All the actors did a fantastic job portraying their characters. I felt like Inception was real, and that dreams could be manipulated. Leonardo DiCaprio, I must say, put his all into this movie. His acting abilities shine in Inception (as in movies like Shutter Island and The Aviator). The emotions were raw, and all the twists were perfect. The plot had a deep meaning that made it complex; but it wasn't so complex as to make someone lost throughout the whole movie. The action scenes were wonderful, and the graphics/special effects were breathtaking, possibly the best special effects to date. There were multiple times during the movie where I held my hands to my mouth and paused my breathing because of the movie's tension. I felt that the movie was never boring. The dialogue and themes made it so that each scene was interesting. This movie does have it's fair share of dialogue, but it never made me want to fall asleep. There is a perfect balance of action and speaking in this movie.In total time, the movie comes to about 2 hours and 30 minutes. However, while sitting in the theater seat, it felt shorter than that. I had such a thrill while watching the film that when it was over I mentally said to myself ""Whattt? It's over? /sad face"". A movie this long to feel like an hour long movie = great. When time flies, you know you're watching an epic movie.The ending really got to me, it made me walk out of the theater and think ... a lot. And there are few movies that can do that these days. You can really tell that the director and actors spent a lot of time producing this film. The philosophy went into levels that were obviously well researched. I must say that Nolan has quite the imagination, because how he produced a film with such a unique plot is beyond me ... it's just so perfect.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone.

I still think his best was in Following and Memento! This film is brilliant but somehow you have a feeling that he is holding back not pulling all punches. It seems almost tailored for the Iron Man and Transformers audience. I can understand it not being too vague but I do feel that Inception has been over simplified thus losing a bit of its shine in the process. But trust me it is still going to be the most engrossing big movie of the year and it is an awesome watch. Its just that it does not challenge the viewer as much as some of Nolan's previous movies did and that is something I missed during watching this film. But then i guess its understandable with a budget of $160 mil.On the acting front brilliant performances from everyone and its a delight to see Michael Kane in a two bit role. Leo DiCaprio reprises a role similar to his role in the recent Shutter Island and is just as good. Marion Cotillard is shimmering and sensuous as Leo's wife.Overall a great intriguing movie to watch but still does not overwhelm Nolan's best films which continue to be his initial movies!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but overrated","Like all Nolan's films, it's mind-bending and original, and incredibly entertaining. But, sorry, they're not as brilliant as people think. There's always so many holes in the writing, as mentioned by others, like how Matthew McConaughey went inside a black hole to communicate with his daughter on Earth in Interstellar. Is it creative? Sure. But for those of us who like our writing to be tidy, it's more than a little annoying. Furthermore, it has no real twists or intrigue.For a person who is deeply interested and well read in psychology, I enjoyed the journey into the psyche through dreams. It's accurate in many ways that a dreamer does not control their subconscious, and theoretically, one could hijack it. In fact, people do this all the time, but one does not need to be asleep and dreaming. It's called brainwashing. No dream within dreams within dreams necessary.I liked the levels of action - it is a fun watch. And all the actors are adept in their roles. I really don't even mind when writing is not based in reality, as long as people realize that it's not. There's really nothing particularly bad about Inception - it just doesn't live up to the hype.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as great as all the hype but an entertaining film to say the least,"I tried not to let the preposterous build up and hype for this movie influence me before I watched it. I'm glad that I did that because my expectations really weren't that high. As a result, I enjoyed this film quite a bit. I'm not sure about its ""rewatchability"" but it certainly keeps you interested throughout. It's captivating on two fronts. One, the story itself and two, the fear that there's something else going on and that the ""other shoe"" could drop at any minute. Nolan plays it masterfully. There were shortcomings for me, however. Minor inconsistencies (falling ""kicks"" were happening every five seconds) and shifting between dream world and movie world time frames made it awkward at times. Also, the action sequences featured that poor shaky cam quality that I've really come to loathe. There was even some poor use of the steady cam on regular shots. Minor quibbles aside; I loved the theme they tackled and the trippy nature of the film itself. Anyone that has lost someone close to them knows the frustration of trying to keep a firm memory and those little nuances of them alive. For me, the bizarre concept and why they can even do what they do is secondary. What carries the film are great performances mixed with an emotional impact mixed with its unique plot angle. While not THE greatest thing ever put to film as some may suggest, it certain was an entertaining film to say the least.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Beginning of Dreams come True,"Christopher Nolan is back again, this time with Leonardo DiCaprio. It always spark when two talented stars meet. The astonishing director who presented some masterpieces such as Memento, The Prestige, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight etc. has astonished us again with this new age sci-fiction thriller Inception. Nolan always commit himself on a different kind of film-making technique, from his own views and angles, ultimately gets successful to attract all type of audiences.Inception has been promoted with tag-lines of ""James Bond meets The Matrix"", or Nolan himself termed it as ""Ocean's Eleven meets The Matrix"". Definitely the movie has both the touches of James Bond series, and somewhat with Ocean's series, mostly in the introduction part. Which is why some scenes deeply remind of the Ocean's series. Nolan used this perfect idea for marketing the movie. But actually, as the story moves forward it stats to gain it's originality and unique concepts.What make Inception so unique is it's storytelling techniques, though sometime confusing, with many twists and turns, mix of several special effects and it's thrilling background score. Background score keeps the viewers constantly stare at the screen, and to the edge of the seat. Many disasters and action scenes were represented perfectly with rich graphical interfaces. Locations and aesthetic environments in several parts of the story with twists also need appreciation.Not everybody will understand the main concept of Inception unless they curiously focus and concentrate on the happenings. What you can never miss in Inception are it's rich graphical effects and serious roles of all the actors. They all deserve adequate attention.Nolan is perfect in his casting as always, and Caprio fits the bill as the protagonist of Inception. Caprio understands well which role suits him, and selects the movie accordingly. His facial expressions and body languages with the character and the story are simply amazing, and always to the peak. He has returned to the audiences who can remember him forever. Joseph Gordon-Levitt too has a meaty role which justifies the main story and cannot be ignored. He is nonetheless than Caprio in terms of performance. But unlike in Nolan's Batman series, Michael Caine is limited to offer here for very short duration, but still in prominence. No idea why his role was not expanded so that we could watch more of his versatile performance.With Inception, Nolan proved that he has his own ways of creating a story, then forming it into a smooth directorial venture. Finally bringing out the finished movie product to the audiences. He can also enter inside their psychological state and win their applause and rewards. After Memento, Inception would certainly remain as a landmark in Hollywood as an all time psychological and sci-fiction thriller.NEVER MISS IT...!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Masterful filmmaking,"To me one of the marks of a great film is that I can watch it again and again and always find something new, something that I missed the last time or something that I had forgotten, but which I now saw again and learned to appreciate it even more. I have that here, with Inception. People also often use the word tight to describe a great film. Tight as in everything seems to fit together, the details support one another and the film feels like a lot of thought has been put into it. I have that with Inception.Is the movie perfect, though? No, because no movie really is. There are some minor plot points that don't really add up and there are some really vocal people out there that complain about the rules of the dreaming. Some claim that there shouldn't be any rules, some claim that the rules make no sense. I especially despise the former ones. I liked that Christopher Nolan tried to establish clearly set rules into the dreaming. These rules give us purpose, they allow us to form expectations, they allow us to speculate, to discuss the details of what we have just seen. So I don't really understand what these people are trying to accomplish when they claim that there shouldn't be any rules. Perhaps they think that randomness equals art and were expecting this film to be one big explosion of crazy imagery and drug-induced madness. I don't know, I just like forming theories, for which I require rules.Nevertheless, whether you agree with the form of dreaming that this film has, it's a great film. And not just because of the complex and rather unique story, but also because it has an ensemble cast, rich and detailed characters, imaginative imagery and an ending that's still the only one that has earned a standing ovation from the crowd. Well, the only one that I've ever seen.To whom I might recommend this film? To everyone, frankly speaking. The film is so multilayered, so complex in design and execution, that I can't really think of a person that wouldn't enjoy at least some part of it. One of the greatest scifi movies there is and one of my personal favourites of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nolan at his best,"It is one of the best movies. Oh yeah, then I remind myself of The Dark Knight. I chose to give Inception 9/ 10 because giving it 10/10 will be equating it with The Dark Knight.Nolan's movies aren't for those with low concentration power. You need to be in the movie in order to keep pace with story. It is almost like studying for an exam. And this one is the toughest of them all.The best thing apart from good acting from all those involved is great script. It does not give you any chance to sit back and relax. You are pulled inside the movie. The pace at which the movie goes is enjoyable to watch.The important fact about this movie is that there is no stand out character like the Joker. Each character has been given equal importance and as a whole have done a splendid job.Christopher Nolan has taken great risk in making this movie. He is banking upon the audiences to be intelligent enough to enjoy the movie. You might hear reviews from friends saying that the movie is crap, I heard it myself, but let me tell you that it is a must watch. If you are the kind of movie buff who likes to see movie as an art and not just for actors and actions and other secondary things.If you are going to watch this movie make sure you go when you have nothing on your mind because you will need to focus on the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing!,"Incredible movie -- We've seen it 3 times now and are still learning new things. Does anyone think that all of Cobb's team infiltrated HIS dreams and that all of this (like Michael Douglas in the Game) is only for Cobb's sake, that the Ken W is only a player in the dream and that his desire to take over the power company was planted the same way they were planting things in Killian Murphy's dream -- and that even the Killian Murphy subplot was also a plant in Cobb's head? Can't wait till this comes out on DVD so that we can study it further. Thought the snow mountain scene went on too long, but was still way cool.

A Question of Balance,"""Inception"" is a terrific mix of think and thought.Christopher Nolan has made story paramount and beefed up as many action scenes as possible. Somewhat neglected in that mix is the role of character.If you loved ""The Matrix"" than this is for you, in spades.By using dream within a dream story lines, we see the same people doing different things at the same time. It's not all that challenging to keep track of four or five levels at a time, especially if you accept the premise that time flows more rapidly the deeper you get.Five minutes in real time is an hour on level one and the bottom level can consume a lifetime.For me, the fabulous sets and the intricacies of the dream structure had me riveted to the action. But I did long for some character development, a nuance that wasn't related to that person's dream story.The choice of Ellen Page is particularly questionable. She doesn't seem to have the depth of expression of even an ordinary actor and as one of only two women featured, should be better.But there are some fabulous effects. Roped bodies moved as a weightless pile through corridors and elevators. A falling bus on the second level that takes forever to hit the water into which it eventually plunges.The planting of seeds isn't some new concept. The next time you thirst for a drink you've never tasted, think advertising and you've come up with your own seed.If you ask why such a good rating, with so many detractions, well, it's really an 8-and-a-half and it is damn good at what it does.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Inception: A Brilliantly Executed Movie,"It all begins with an idea; an eagre of emotions, a sudden jolt, and a bold new inception that gives a whole new meaning to the word ""you."" In Inception, Christopher Nolan has created a masterpiece, an audacious and invigorating saga that links the conscious and subconscious, the real and the dream in such a fascinating way that at the end of the movie you wonder if what we see around us are real or just a ""shade,"" a passing fancy. Inception hits the movie scale somewhere between the greatness of Ben-Hur and the incredibleness of Gladiator. Ultimately, Nolan has successfully created a movie, and in the process has totally surpassed himself. Inception sets a right pitch with his previous monumental creations, like Memento and The Dark Knight, and shows the audience, once again, the master strokes of Nolan's brilliant auteurism.Inception, which is part action thriller part science fiction, and part psychological drama, deals with the nebulous world of human brain. A forever mystical organ the brain has been, and Nolan has successfully hacked into this mythical organ and done the impossible. This nail biting motion picture is definitely worth a ride for all those who are fascinated by dreams.The movie, which boasts of the complicated plot of the century, comes in a handle-with-care package. It is highly intricate in details, and details are what matters most to the plot. As for the story, it almost doesn't have one, and even if it has it, it is too complicated to explain. In a nutshell it deals with the life of Dom Cobb (Leonardo Dicaprio), a master thief with a vague past, who is absolutely unparalleled in the field of extracting secret information from the subconscious levels of the mind. He is an international fugitive, a leader in corporate espionage. Dom meets a mysterious business tycoon, Saito (Ken Watanabe), who gives him a task of the Titans. He is entrusted with one last act that will give him his long awaited redemption and unite him with his family provided he succeeded. But it is a mission impossible, an unreliably tricky job that not only requires skill, a great amount of careful planning and expertise as well. Cobb unleashes a group of highly skilled personages to unravel the puzzle, but no planning is enough when one is fighting with his mightiest adversary -- his own self.Although the movie might seem pretty straightforward in approach, it deliberately obfuscates the incidents, and ends up confusing the audience. The series of incidents it portrays, from the stages of the dream- invading to the coming to life and waking up, it often contradicts itself. Nolan transmogrifies contemporary dream theories, and creates a new world of imagination where the possibilities of tomorrow are a staple of today. The indefatigable story takes you to the deepest depths of the subconscious; the unknown world of mingled memories,unreal projections together with conscious reality create a brilliant screenplay. However, one has to follow, that is, if one wishes to continue with it at all, the minuscule details, the meaningless bits and pieces here and there, and start creating her own solution in her mind as she watches the movie unravel. The movie has a fascinating ending that re-mystifies the final thoughts you get and leaves you with a deep after feeling of satisfaction. After an epic two and half hours of cinematic experience, the watcher wins a Pyrrhic victory by somewhat getting the plot, and leaving the theater with an I-knew-it-would- brilliant-all-the-while smile.From the very beginning, an ardent moviegoer knows Inception to be another classic Nolan creation. All the characteristic Nolan stuff is here: the darkness, the creepy and intense plot, the apparently impossible problem that ultimately finds a solution and Michael Caine. The majuscule drama adumbrates great refreshment for bogged down 3D- tired moviegoers looking for a real deal.As far as depth and acting goes, Inception fails at certain levels. The plot is skinny-deep, and fails to show the profundity of human emotion; it just awes at it, but doesn't dare define it. It is more of a step- by-step mathematical problem than a real-life dramatic execution of a crisis situation. I felt that the character of Dicaprio has been well expressed. He seems repressed and schizophrenic, but that is what Nolan intended for him. As for the others, they all look like they are stuck in Leo's dream and come as mere shadows with exceptional ability, yet carefully restrained performances. Ellen page delivers a good performance as a bright architect; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur and Marion Cotillard as Mal are brilliant, too.Overall, Inception is a fabulously executed, artistically seamless, and creatively exceptional movie. It is breathtaking, exhilarating and mind- boggling; a definite no-no for chick-flick enthusiasts, flibbertigibbets and pococurante movie-hoppers, however.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Merges style with substance,"""Inception"" is what you get when a filmmaker knows how to merge style with substance. Christopher Nolan has crafted a story (not an original one, but that's OK) that takes slightly abstract ideas and places it in a reality you can almost grasp, and then tells it with little complexity. It's a movie for all the masses - and that's where Nolan's genius comes in.He gives us characters, many of them in fact, and all performed expertly by the stellar cast. The dreams all have their own architecture which is visually stunning. And no it's not redundant to say again that he managed to merge style with substance.""Inception"" is filled with special effects, action running all over the place and loud dramatic scores. Remember this is Nolan with a big budget. But it's also just a straight-forward story with characters and romance - it does star Leonardo DiCaprio after all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!,"Inception Pinch yourself after you're done watching Inception, you'll feel like it was all a dream! Christopher Nolan has done it again. After giving us films like Memento, The Prestige, The Dark Knight; Inception is yet another masterstroke by the maverick director. This time he has delved into the world of dreams. A world within a dream. He goes deeper and deeper into the world of dreams and subconscious. And he does it brilliantly.Cobb(Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief who steals ideas. But his ability has made him a fugitive and that keeps him away from his family. Saito(Ken Watanabe) is a businessman who hires Cobb to do the impossible, Inception. He wants Cobb to plant an idea in the mind of a rival businessman Robert Fischer, Jr.(Cillian Murphy), so that he dissolves his father's business. And in return Saito guarantees Cobb that he'll get his life back. And all Cobb wants right now is to get back to his kids! So will he be able to do the impossible? Inception? If you think Inception is as simple as what is written above, you're badly mistaken. Its much more than that, its much more than just a story about a man wanting to get back to his normal life. Its not just a film that you will watch, its an experience. It makes you think. It makes you question what's real and what's not. You wont come out watching this all happy and satisfied, you'll want more. You'll want more clarity, you'll want to discuss this over and over again. You'll wonder 'What if?'.After a long time a movie has come out which is completely original. We see movies these days, based on a book, out of a franchise, sequels, etc. etc. But this one is totally original and refreshing.And this, in my honest opinion, is its biggest strength. After 'The Matrix', this is probably the one which will force you to question yourself about this world. Its a benchmark on its own. It hasn't created a whole new world, but what it does is, it gives you an 'idea' that you can create your own world. A world in your dreams. And who knows, maybe its possible.Leonardo DiCaprio has come a long way since Titanic. Someone once told me that he'd read a Leonardo DiCaprio interview somewhere and he'd said ""Titanic was the biggest mistake of my life"". In all probability this is a false statement, but that's not the point. The fact is that it took him a lot of movies and a lot of courage and brains to get out of that chocolate boy image he had created unknowingly. I'm sure you remember how the whole world went crazy about that blue eyed blonde cute boy from Titanic. But after movies like 'Catch Me If You Can', 'The Aviator', 'The Departed', 'Shutter Island' and now 'Inception', you can definitely say that he's grown immensely as an actor and probably none compare to him today. You give him whatever role and he'll carry it off with panache! And he's done a brilliant job in this film as well. Ellen Page as Ariadne has done a pretty decent job I must admit. She plays a young prodigy of sorts, and she does it highly convincingly. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur plays a calm and collected character, which is kind of a polar opposite of Cobb, which in turn provides a nice contrast between them. Although Michael Caine has a tiny role in the film, we clearly see his impact on the film as whole. Kudos to the rest of the cast as well.Technically this film could've been better I feel. There are certain scenes which very clearly look shot on a miniature set. I mean, comparing the best 'effects' these days, of 'Avatar', this kinds of fades in comparison. But it makes up with a great storyline, intense action sequences and some great storytelling. But mind you, some of the special effects will just leave you gaping at the screen in pure amazement, not because of their technical brilliance, that is there, but because of the pure imagination put into what's shown to us. When you watch it, you'll know what I am talking about.There is not a single moment in the film when you can take a break, go to the loo, even chewing on your pop corn will disturb you. Even with proper concentration, you are bound to come out a little confused and with a few questions in your mind at the very least. You'll understand the basic story and the concept but to know the details and the preciseness of the story, this film needs another viewing. And that is the genius of Christopher Nolan. He creates such mind boggling stuff that it leaves the audience wanting more and more and more. This film is bound to create a madness online with people giving out different concepts and theories on what exactly happened in the film. And that's the least it deserves.If I had to describe this film in one word it would be 'crazy'. Not crazy in a disturbing sense but the fact that even thinking of something as complicated as this can confuse a normal human, that guy creates a whole story around that concept. Hats off to you Mr. Nolan. You have outdone yourself, yet again. Thanks for making movies! Looking forward to your next venture! Great stuff!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Brilliant concept with a playing it safe execution.,"Overrated! That's what I thought it was.A Brilliant concept with a playing it safe execution. Not taking anything away from Christopher Nolan who has done a great job directing it but the movie didn't seem to push the envelope for me. It could have been so much more but it chose to be a simpler version to make it more profitable (I assume) in the sense that by making the movie less complicated, they ensured that the movie goers were enthralled by the ride they were taken on while it almost managed to stay logical to most of them.Making someone else believe the idea in their head is theirs is something you can do without getting into the persons dream. But in Inception, dreams are used as the doorway to manipulate the mind, to plant thoughts or reveal secrets. The concept of a dream in a dream in a dream was like pealing an onion, one layer at a time. Watching that was magical in its own mental way.With such a head scratching, mind boggling concept; the cast seems to have taken somewhat of a back seat. There was no stand out performance; all of them played their parts to mechanical precision. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb, the almost know it all with a haunted past that revolves around his dead wife, Mal (played by Marion Cotillard). He seemed to have sleep walked through most of the movie, it almost felt like a controlled performance with few sparks of brilliance here and there. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy and the rest of the supporting actors rallied well around him with over shadowing each other.Christopher Nolan is now being called a genius behind the camera which I somewhat agree with. This might not be a brilliant movie I was expecting it to be but whatever that was created was well executed and spectacularly delivered. He has managed to make a complicated concept look interesting without making it boring which is a tough thing to do.The visual effects were smartly and creatively done while the action sequences were unique and the process by which they intertwined with each other was refreshing to see. The cinematography was stunningly done complimenting the action flawlessly and the music score was just outstanding. All of this together makes the movie an exhilarating experience that tops anything I've seen this year by a long shot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What can I say,Christopher Nolan you never disappoint me. With the dark knight and now this!! How does this guy do this. Well first off inception takes you where no other film ever has. One of the most original screenplays today. The plot is simple the movie itself is so complex. It is filled with action suspense and takes you a huge variety of places. Usually in a movie there's a Climax or final showdown. Where there is one thing or job left to do. Those sequences usually last 30-40 minutes but here it take a good hour and a half. This is a movie that will leave you thinking and talking. Describing this movie is truly difficult because words cannot describe this masterpiece.

In your dreams,"Not the very beginning, but about 10 minutes or so into the movie, I didn't know what to think. I felt like a lot was left out and I was going to be pretty confused. But it picked up very fast and got to the main part making the rest of the movie pretty much perfect in my eyes. The excitement was just too intense at parts. The suspense had me at the edge of my seat at times wondering what I was going to see next. The ending was one of the best parts. Watch and you will see. The writers really had something going here. The ability to control yours and others dreams. To bring a team into someones mind and help control their dream. The ability to make a dream, within a dream. This really was written by great minds and Nolan really directed it well. The movie is just shy of 2 and a half hours, but it doesn't really seem like it, because you will enjoy this film. The cast was excellent. Leonardo DiCaprio was great. Ellen Page was also a great second. Cillian Murphy stayed more quiet, but still could act. My medal of great acting has to go to Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Never thought I would see him in such a fighting type role, but it really fit for him. Unfortunately, Tom Berenger gets the award for not acting as well. I think he is just getting too old maybe. This movie has some great action shots and the CG is pretty good too.

Time will tear this movie apart,"This movie starts off really interesting, but fails to go any deeper than lots of standard Hollywood crap like a really forced back story for the main character. Characters lack depth, and the most interesting part of the movie is its visual effects, which are nowhere short of amazing, Avatar level production. However, in a few couple of years, these CGI effects will not be that impressive anymore, and then people will (hopefully) see how lacking this movie is for a good story and characters. The average moviegoer will love this movie, but if you like good movies in the sci-fi genre, you kind of expect at least some plot twists. Still, the movie is good, and well made, but not great, It will most probably be forgotten in a couple of yearsIf you enjoy movies with action and CGI and want a movie to watch with friends, go see this movie.

Christopher Nolan's Newest Dream is Far From a Nightmare,"How could Christopher Nolan possibly follow up The Dark Knight, one of the most important movies of the past decade? The answer to that would be Inception. It was an ambitious task to take on and Nolan proves that the only man for this task was himself. In one of the most unusual and complicated movies ever made, Nolan succeeds in thrilling the viewer while holding the viewer in a vise, never once letting a person's eyes leave the beautiful, dreamy images displayed on the screen. Though Nolan proved himself a master of cinema three times with Memento, The Dark Knight, and The Prestige, he has once again provided regular movie-goers and film buffs alike with a movie that will be remembered for decades to come as a classic.Summarizing Inception is not quite as easy as it seems. From the very beginning, the viewer is dropped into Nolan's imaginative dream world in which Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, the Extractor. The Extractor's job is to perform inception, that is, plant information in someone's mind via his dreams. And this is exactly the job that Cobb is trying to perform in the beginning when he is double crossed by Saito (Ken Watanabe). Saito then asks Cobb to aide him in getting a business rival named Fischer (Cillian Murphy) to disband Fischer's father's empire. Cobb takes the job and assembles a team to help him perform the inception including Ariadne(Ellen Page), who takes a job as an Architect, the person who designs the dream worlds. Cobb's job is made difficult by Mal (Marion Cotillard), his dead wife who is now reappearing in dreams and wreaking havoc for Cobb. Other cast includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Caine.As one can see from my ""brief"" summary, the film is extremely complicated. But this is far from accidental on Nolan's part. Dreams are commonly blurred with reality, making it hard for the viewer to distinguish what is real and what is dreamed. After all, Cobb does say that ""Dreams feel real when we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize that something was actually strange."" As the characters delve further into the visually stimulating dream world, the plot becomes even harder to follow, but not necessarily in a bad way. The film culminates in five plots occurring simultaneously for about an hour of the film. Yet the viewer stays interested in the film. Nolan had me thoroughly engrossed for the entire two and a half hours that the movie lasted.But the film's beauty lies not in its impressive cast or original plot, but rather in its rich technical work. The special effects in this film are very realistic and certainly fun to watch. When Ariadne is first introduced to the dream world, Cobb proves that the world she is currently in is a dream by letting Paris explode. The scene is useless to the plot, but it does not matter for the sole reason that it is gorgeous. In another scene, two characters fight in a hallway that has no gravity. The scene is thrilling, but what is most interesting is that it looks so real. The film's cinematography is equally arresting. Nolan uses slow motion multiple times throughout the movie, each of which involves water. The slow motion is completely unnecessary, but it is unbelievably beautiful, so it really does not matter that it is presented to us for no apparent reason.Forget the acting. Forget the special effects. Forget the plot. Inception boils down to Christopher Nolan. Nolan is the reason why the film works, why it is so visually arresting, why it succeeds in making a viewer think hours after watch it. For a year in which very few great movies have come out, Nolan's Inception sticks out because it is original--it is an idea that is entirely new, and for that reason alone, it should be highly commended. But Nolan has superseded this. Inception rises to a new level because it has great acting, a twisted web of a plot, and ornate special effects. It may not be better than some of Nolan's previous work, but it sure is great. This is the stuff dreams are made of.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
INCEPTION is the kind of movie most directors DREAM of making!,"'Inception' is an amazing, imaginative, innovative, clever, exhilarating, and (there are way too many positive adjectives to describe the film) bad-ass film. I think Christopher Nolan has finally found, no, created, his magnum opus - an amazing feat, considering how early Nolan really is in his directorial career.In 'Inception', director Christopher Nolan takes us into a world where entering peoples' dreams is a reality. In this world, there are people called 'Extractors' whom are able to enter peoples' dreams and steal any type of information from practically anyone. Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Dom Cobb, is the most skilled Extractor, and he has a very important job to do - a job that the basic plot revolves around. Dom Cobb is hired by a very powerful Japanese businessman, Saito (Ken Watanabe) to do the impossible - implant a brand new idea into another person's mind; this task is called inception. The target is another businessman, a rival of Saito's, named Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy). The task of inception requires in-depth planning, and requires experts in a variety of fields. Thus Cobb must assemble a team of top- notch professionals in those certain important fields.The remarkable Joseph Gordon-Levitt portrays Arthur, Cobb's right-hand man, and has the important task of researching and learning about his targets. The lovely Ellen Page portrays Ariadne, an architect whose sole responsibility is to create the complex world of the dream. Tom Hardy portrays Eames, a wise-cracking shape-shifter, of sorts. And Dileep Rao portrays the chemist, Yusuf, who provided the special drugs that enabled everyone to enter dreams - he's also important for driving that van; you'll know what I'm talking about.Cobb's team is amazing, and each and every one of them is unique and likable in their own ways. These characters' unique-ness and likability is helped by the fact that they're portrayed by a bunch of strong actors and actresses. The ensemble cast in 'Inception' truly is remarkably strong and superb. So many characters in 'Inception' are portrayed by well-known actors and actresses that I'm glad none of them were wasted. From the trailers, I figured the characters of Saito (Watanabe) and Fisher, Jr. (Murphy) would have minimal screen-time, because I figured their characters (the former the client, the latter the target) just wouldn't be focused on as much. However, I'm glad I was wrong. Watanabe's character stuck around for the entire film, and is actually important, though you won't know it till the end of the film. And Murphy's character was also featured a lot and important to the overall movement of the plan. Gordon-Levitt's Arthur is very charming and goofy, and the funny scenes that were actually included in 'Inception' were all funny because he was in it.I loved Ellen Page's character. Christopher Nolan was actually very smart for putting a character like Ariadne in the film - her character helps us understand the film better. Since Ariadne is new to the concept of entering other people's dreams (as are we) and all of the complex rules that apply to them, it's extremely helpful when she asks questions since she's as confused about certain things as we, the audience, are. Page's Ariadne is like our senator or representative for the film, since she practically does represent us, and raises the same question as we do.The complexity of 'Inception' is purposely frustrating and confusing. The film works because of that. And I love movies that make the audience frustrated and make them have to work with the movie in order to enjoy it (if they're done right, which 'Inception' definitely did). Films like 'Inception' are more enthralling when they're challenging, because you become even more satisfied when you actually succeed in understanding them.The only major problem I had with 'Inception' was the fact that many times I couldn't understand what Saito was saying, and most of the time he was saying something important. It's important to pay attention to every single line spoken in the film, so when I couldn't understand Saito in his many important scenes, it left me clueless and confused. Also, I couldn't get over the fact that Saito promised Cobb that he would be able to fix all of Cobb's problems with just one phone call. How is he able to do that? Although I'm disappointed that the film never really explains this, I think it's actually better that it didn't.'Inception' is a near-perfect film, and requires multiple viewings to truly understand its complexity. Christopher Nolan is an amazing director who hasn't made one bad film yet! I trust his ability to continue this streak. Freaking-A! I cannot get over the very final scene of 'Inception.' That final moment, I think, was the perfect way to end off the film. It's the kind of ending that will frustrate people, but it's also the kind of ending that's debatable, and is either praised or hated. I, personally, loved the ending. However, I did, along with almost everyone else in the theater, go ""Awww"" and ""Omg"" after that last, important scene. I just love how that ending teases everyone. 'Inception' definitely lives up to, or even surpasses, the hype surrounding it! The film is amazing on multiple levels, and in multiple ways, for multiple reasons. It's the movie of the summer. It's the movie of the year. And, quite frankly, it's one of the best movies of the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Let me plant an idea in your head: INCEPTION is Breathtaking,"I cannot say enough good about this movie. There are so many excellent forces that made this movie that superb piece of art that it is.First, of course, is Nolan's direction. There is some seriously enlightened direction going on here. It starts off a bit slow (as most of his movies do), but he shortly throws it into overdrive. Before long, the movie is roaring past you. It's exhilarating, simply put.Nolan's writing is also top notch. The dialogue is refreshingly real, sharp, and coherent. In the beginning, viewers might find themselves a bit lost (don't worry, it's intentional), but Nolan slowly exposes INCEPTION's secrets. The plot direction carries this movie from being a simple heist movie (in the same vein as, say, OCEAN'S 11) to an emotional, thoughtful, intelligent, and utterly astounding thriller. If Nolan doesn't receive a directing or writing Oscar for this movie, then there is something seriously wrong the Academy.Also worth mentioning are the visual effects and stunts. The VFX are seamless. Even in the film's most visually intense moments, it's not entirely evident that Nolan is using CGI. Of particular mention is a fight scene that takes place in a unstable-gravity hotel hallway. As the actors twist and writhe all over a room where gravity is in flux, the viewer is left dumbfounded by the surprising realism of the scene. There's no other way to say this: INCEPTION looks great.Finally, we come to the acting. If anything could steal the spotlight from Nolan's directing and writing, it would certainly be the efforts put forth by the cast. Overall, the cast has impeccable chemistry. Everyone plays together so well. - Of course, Leonardo Dicaprio was solid. The role isn't much of a deviation for him, but he plays it well. His most emotionally intense moments hit hard and his character is developed very well. He deftly leads a relatively-unknown, but unbelievably-talented cast. There isn't that much ""star power"" in this movie, but the caliber of the acting is superb. - Marillon Cotillard was unbelievable. Her role is arguably the film's most versatile and she expertly glides through each aspect of her character. She's a very talented actress who works so well with Dicaprio. Their relationship is one of the emotional high-points of the movie and that is thanks entirely to each actors' powerful contributions to the heartbreaking reality of the relationship. - Ellen Page did a great job in her supporting role, bringing some of her signature wit into it. She has a very big on screen presence and she fits in surprisingly well with the mostly-male main cast. - Joseph Gordon Levitt and Tom Hardy stole the show, in my opinion. They each play two very well-crafted characters extremely well. Levitt plays a resourceful, no-nonsense point man that wonderfully counters Dicaprio's somewhat-unstable character. Hardy plays a charismatic thief that goes from devious trickster to full-blown action hero. These guys have some seriously impressive acting chops and it was truly a delight to watch their performances. - Cillian Murphy, like Dicaprio, is mostly sticking to a role that he knows, which is not a bad thing. Murphy is a talented actor, which is readily apparent in his last big scene in the movie (one of the movie's most emotional moments). - Ken Watanabe and Dileep Rao also add a lot to the overall chemistry of the ensemble. Their presence, though not as major as some of the other characters, definitely help solidify the ensemble's power.INCEPTION will stand the test of time as one of the great American films. Nolan is a superb director and cunning writer who has assembled an elite group of actors to create a visually stunning, thrilling adventure.

First film I've written a review for...,"...its THAT good, i actually bothered to review a film for the first time. The concept is just fantastic, so original. The actors are brilliant, the special effects are spectacularly mind bending. The whole thing is a perfectly balanced roller coaster ride; twisting and turning but not confusing, action packed but not a gore show, fast paced and yet containing enough philosophical themes to keep you talking and thinking for a long time. I can safely say this is the best film I've seen all year.Go and see it while it's in the cinema, I'm pretty sure 90-95% of people who watch it will love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Christopher Nolan , your mind is the scene of the art .","First of all CN is without doubt the best director of our time because he is unmatched by any director in his style,atmosphere , tone and ending , he directs because that what he want , he don't want some Blockbuster that everybody will forget after they leave the cinema , he wants to put his signature and to be remembered for his art.Inception is a movie that only smart people will know what is going on , from the beginning to the end the whole movie for some reason felt like one big scene maybe because there was no holes in the plot, perfect logic and mastermind director ,148 min was like dream , really Nolan manged to make a movie that will make you live in dream-like feeling (for me at least) . the acting , soundtrack , locations , atmosphere and the special effects are all PERFECT.A masterpiece work of art , this is what you got when the writer direct the movie , and for those who feel a little bit lost it is like The Matrix but in the eyes of Christopher Nolan.if something happened to C.Nolan say goodbye Hollywood .",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A good film, but not as good as the hype","I heard a number of great things about Inception, including from my sister who came out saying it was one of the cleverest and best movies she'd seen. After seeing it for myself, I thought it was a good film, but not as good as I was led to believe. Out of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen, Inception didn't wow me as much as Memento and The Prestige, and it is one of my least favourites of his so far. Does that mean the film is bad? No, I am just saying I do not think it is Nolan's best as I have heard people say.My main problem with Inception was the lack of emotional attachment, I do understand completely anybody who says it is emotionally cold. Particularly in the characters, they are written and acted well, but not much is done to make us empathise with them and their predicaments. I loved the idea of the story, it was clever and somewhat original and it did start very compelling and intriguing, but as the film progresses it does become rather convoluted and I found myself losing a little interest. Also, the pace is uneven, as the characters became more cold and the story more convoluted, the film really does start to drag until the conclusion where the film does thankfully pick up.Inception despite these faults does have a number of strengths, especially the beautifully crafted production values, dream sequences and effects and Nolan's superb direction. Hans Zimmer's score is incredibly good too, while powerful and haunting it rarely becomes overbearing, while the dialogue is on the whole clever and thought-provoking. The acting is generally very good, both Leonardo DiCaprio, with a more hardened persona which has grown even more, and Ellen Page give strong performances and while Marion Cotillard is underused she is pretty good as well and Cillian Murphy I think gives the best supporting performance as he is superb.Overall, Inception is a generally good film but not as good as it is lauded to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Blah,I tried to watch this in a theater when it came out and fell asleep. I finally got thru it many years later. Idk I loved Interstellar thought it was fantastic but this was super boring.

"Imaginative and visually stunning, one of the best movies I have seen in a long time","This movie was awesome. It even made me forget that Leonardo DiCaprio was in it. I was a little suspect when I saw a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the 2 top billed stars. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a decent actor but his career up until this movie was somewhat relegated to small budget B movies. As for DiCaprio, It is my opinion that he is a highly overrated, overacting actor at best. Some how director Christopher Nolan was able to harness these 2 back enough to make for an outstanding movie that has become one of my new favorites.The story is about Cobb (DiCaprio) and his team. They are assembled to enter peoples dream's in order to steal important information from high profile corporate targets. After running into a problem, Di Caprio has to get himself and his team out of trouble by performing a task thought impossible, actually implant an idea within a dream in someones head, that will cause the person to act out that complex task in the real conscience world, inception.Can they do it, or will personal past demons trap them in a nightmare of their own doing.The strength of this movie is that so much of it takes place within the dream world that it doesn't really have to follow any real rules. A set can be anything in which the filmmakers wants it to be. To pull that off though everything has to be visually stunning, and it is. ""The Cell"" came close, and the old Dennis Quaid, ""Dreamscape"" was great in its day, but this one blows them out of the water.The acting was great, and as I said before, I am not a Dicaprio fan. Ellen Paige plays ""The Architect,"" Ariadne, which if you have ever read Greek Mythology you will understand the nod given there, and she is good as tool to open up the movie to Cobbs past demons.Everything in this movie is absolutely on point and is a rare case where it all comes together in every facet. This is one of those movies that leaves you sitting in the theater after the credits not wanting to believe its over and that you now have to go on with your drab, boring life. That is a rarity these days.Like my reviews, Hate em? Comments, Hate mail, or do you have a specific DVD you want me to review?

It's a dream within a dream within a dream =),"I have waited so long for a movie like this to come out. For the past few years, it has been movies dedicated to ONLY special effects and senseless action scenes. The world has been polluted by movies with poor writing, and lazy over-used ideas. Some films which were called the best were actually very boring, stupid and clich√© (EXAMPLES: Avatar, Happy Feet, Transformers, etc.) Could it be that Hollywood is slowly making a transition from lazy recycled remakes to original and exciting motion pictures? Inception definitely gave me hope.I've heard many reviews on the Internet saying that this movie was too complicated to understand. Well, I'm here to tell you that the people who wrote those reviews are probably not very smart, or they didn't even try to understand it. There have been too many movies out lately that shut down people's brains, other than challenging them and making them think. Inception is the first SMART movie I have seen in a long while. Yes, it is a bit confusing at first, but the answers to our questions are answered in the movie, and if your questions aren't answered by the time you walk out of the theater, you figure it out later on your own. This movie makes you THINK. More movies coming from Hollywood should do research on the writing and production of this film, and take a few notes about how they could improve the quality of movies in general.What also makes this movie so spectacular is that it is a movie about journeying into three layers of a dream, and while you are watching it, you feel like you are really in a dream in a dream in a dream. This movie makes it feel like you don't know if you are awake watching a movie, or going deeper and deeper into a very epic and bizarre dream.I've always said that special effects aren't necessarily important, but they do add an awesome dimension to the film, making it feel real and unreal at the same time. The action scenes are adrenaline-pumping, and edge-of-the-seat exciting. Though there are a lot of talking scenes, they are not boring. They answer our questions and once again, make us puzzle out in our brains what is going on and where in the layers of dreams are we and the characters in the movie.All this epicness and awesomeness is backed up by probably the best acting I have seen in a non-animated movie in a while. Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page, I think, were the jewels in Inception's crown. They both did a spectacular job. I say Ellen Page should replace Kristen Stewart's spot in the Star Meter. She deserves it more.Brilliant writing, exciting action, puzzling, awesome, incredible, suspenseful, and groundbreaking movie. Avatar has been called groundbreaking, but is it really worthy of the title, ""Greatest Movie Ever Made""? Well, I and obviously Christopher Nolan say, ""NO FLIPPIN' WAY!!!"" Inception owns, and don't anyone who read this review forget it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
a modern day Orpheus and Eurydice,"I've seen it twice so far: Inception is a fabulous high quality heist movie in which nothing is taken: instead an idea is implanted: in the mind of a mark(Murphy) but also the audience... Its also a journey into the underworld...and calls to mind the story of Orpheus and Eurydice...and his journey to rescue his wife from death. Cobb may not be able to rescue his dead wife, but his obsession with her leads him in the end to making a journey deep into an Underworld, where she has become a more vindictive character. Like Orpheus: Cobb cant return Mal to the world of the living: he can only let her go... Also another nice twist is to have an Ariadne who makes mazes. But She is also the thread that guides the audience thru the story...she asks our questions..she goes all the way to Limbo with Cobb, and her last words to him are words of advice: to rescue Saito....as if she is implanting an idea in his mind..What a great cast of characters playing off one another: who lighten the tense story Loved the scenes in the dreams when the van is in freefall or rolling down the slope....as if in a dream! Quirks like: after Yusuf has righted the van, he turns to share the experience with the passengers...only then remembering they are asleep, and Arthus playful kiss with Ariadne..

Blow your mind,"The relationship between movies and dreams has always been one of the cinema world key. The dream has always been there, in different forms and shapes. Lots of movies around image-making power of the mind, since decades before, lots of material released to unleash fantasies of millions of people. But this one will be a corner stone of this kind of movie and further. I'm not a Di Caprio fan at all, but this time, he did amazingly well. The idea is not totally original. Just to mention a title, The Cell is another movie, around the using of the mind, to discover something. But Inception has a different purpose, most centered on the use of dreams to obtain the goal. The pace of the movie is a continuous innuendo till the last second.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Inception is the Defining Movie of the Decade,"This movie is so hard to describe because the idea of this movie is something you have to see for yourself. I just got done watching this film 15 minutes ago and was I ever so shocked. The most I can share with whoever reads this review is that the majority of the audience shared a twist that was beyond Shutter Island. Christopher Nolan delivers a grand scale complicated but satisfying film with such emotional drive that it even had the attention of women who just want a quick fix film that will satiate. And again I cannot stress enough how AWESOME this movie is. This is a movie you'll want to see as a midnight screening in IMAX. What's even better is that it doesn't need the technology of 3D to deliver, like Avatar (No offense James Cameron).

A truly amazing film - but not a religion,"I went to see this film on first night of general release in the UK and I can't remember a time when I walked out of a cinema at the end of a movie and there was such a palpable thrum of excitement.Judging by this film's current score on IMDb, it's going to be a landslide of a success and deservedly so. Here's why:1. The special effects are quite simply beautiful - the perfect mix of elegance and awe.2. It's pretty much perfectly cast. Leonardo DiCaprio is the draw to get you through the door, and while he's never been the greatest actor (I always think he's two heart beats away from a full blown Jack Nicholson impersonation), his screen presence certainly holds your attention, and keeps you grounded. He's just getting better with age. Playing around DiCaprio is probably the dictionary definition of an ensemble cast. A host of familiar faces flesh out the story, some more famous than others, and with the exceptions of Michael Caine and Pete Postlethwaite (who both incidentally execute their brief roles with perfect competence), they share a common thread in that their stars all seem to be in the ascendant (and starring in this film will certainly helped their causes). It reminded me of the ""Beat Brynner"" mindset of the other six in The Magnificent Seven. Tom Hardy comes off very well, and nice to see Drag Me To Hell's Dileep Rao getting more roles - He's a class act.3. The plot (and I hope this isn't a spoiler) is absolutely bonkers, but brilliantly paced and conveyed to the audience. The film contains some pretty lofty conceptual abstractions, but Christopher Nolan seems to have the perfect touch for keeping an audience up to speed, and firmly grounded in the story. Both of the new Batman reboots have been quite complicated and are certainly more cerebral than your average super hero flick - but Inception is on a whole different level. Nolan bravely trusts in the intelligence of his audience and resists the temptation to dumb it down avoiding so many of the familiar clich√©s that would simplify what is such a fiendishly complicated, but infinitely rewarding story.4. You've seen this type of film attempted so many times before (What Dreams May Come, Matrix etc), you sort of go in prepared for the fact that there'll be a trade off, that the realisation of the story will be compromised - either plausibility will go out of the window, sacrificed to maintain the plot's integrity, thinly held together by sexy action scenes or the concepts will be so incompletely expressed, that as your understanding and interest wanes, you get dragged down into the mire and you probably fall asleep well before the credits roll - NOT so with Inception - It is a white knuckle ride of a story, pretty challenging - but do not be put off by what people say - Think of it as a fairly difficult lesson but taught by a supremely talented tutor.5. The action scenes are well paced with real urgency, and are as satisfying as watching Indiana Jones breaking a Nazi's jaw. Unusually, for a film of it's kind. I always felt that The Matrix suffered from too much slo-mo but Inception keeps that to a tolerable minimum (and when it does to it's relevant to the plot)In short, I agree that this film does live up to the hype and then some. But I have to confess, that I'm a little taken aback by some of the fervour for this movie - it's a brilliant film for sure, but are we really so used to being disappointed by the blockbusters that when a great one comes along, it's greeted with messianic rapture? This film might be regarded as a religion in ten years time, but only by the same sort of dreadful boring imbeciles who are campaigning to have ""Jedi"" instituted as a recognised faith, or who think the Matrix ""might actually be happening now - ooooooooooh""Great film - go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just an action movie,"All that stuff about sharing dreams makes zero scientific or philosophical sense. And no-one can have dreams with that amount of detail, that many actors, that much lightning fast action, etc, etc. Read Daniel Dennett.There were plenty of stunning special effects and stunts certainly, but I had the feeling throughout that the plot was just a peg to hang these on. If you want to see how to do dreams in cinema, look elsewhere, for example the dream sequence in Wild Strawberries, the Soldier's dreams in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, the whole of Un Chien Andalou.

An emotionally cold film that is presented in a convoluted manner - I'm more impressed with Nolan's ambition than his execution.,"I had the worst headache after watching this and I was left disappointed as while an ambitious film, it left me wanting. Fair enough to those that understood it completely initially, but to me, it left me perplexed, particularly the 'levels' subplot.The acting is pretty solid all round(DiCaprio's really grown as an actor), but the plot never really seems to reach it's full potential. Part of the problem is the film is quite talky, therefore spending time establishing the rules so it's like you're cramming for test as you are forced to remember many of them to make sense of it all, which for me, is easier said than done, especially when the plot gets more intricate. It's as if Nolan has given you a dreaded 1000 pieces jigsaw puzzle but not all the pieces are there.The plot hinges on emotional involvement with DiCaprio's character and Murphy's one, but I really don't care about either. This film ostensibly a tale of a man trying to be at peace with himself in his mind, but when that fails to move me, I'm left with a mostly empty film with good set-pieces but somewhat baffling plotting.Cinematography was nice, the cast were usually smartly dressed and it had an aptly used slow-mo shot and that zero-gravity fight scene. Nolan seems to have an old Hollywood glamour aesthetic, which is pleasing enough.The score with loud horns used intermittently was fitting and memorable - Dream is Collapsing is particularly good.Overall: A good-looking, well acted and well scored film that is let down by a cold feel, relating to the main character's conflict and at times, mechanical, confusing plotting. The whole 'entering other people's dreams' plot isn't original, but I was hoping Nolan would bring something interesting to the table.This is compelling but for me once the layers are shown, it got confusing to keep track. I admire Nolan's ambitions for trying to make an intelligent film, but this felt as if Nolan was running a marathon and I was walking as fast as I could to keep up.The audience in my screening agreed as well, with variations of 'what on earth?!' chorused around the cinema. Befuddled is an understatement. Re-watches may help me decipher parts of it better, but I still think it's no masterpiece some claim it to be.This summer's blockbusters have been pretty bad so any film that at least tries can look better than it probably is. Toy Story 3 isn't perfect, but handles mature themes better and has far more emotional involvement - 6/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nolan...bridging the gap between Substance and Spectacle.,"Inception Every once in a while you catch a film so incredibly intense that it blows you right back into your seat. This could be through a well crafted idea perfectly told through a potent medium of clever narrative, or through the sheer awe of mind-blowing visual effects. It is true that in terms of ratio, the latter is by far a more heavily relied on tool these days. You can attribute this to lazy directing or to the fickle nature of the modern ""cinema crowd"". But why can we not have both? Who says that the balance between spectacle and substance must be measured with all of the even handedness of a North Korean general election? Indeed this was a question that troubled me for some time and with the putrid presence of teeny trash fad ""Twilight"" ever looming it seemed as though all was lost. But alas I forgot one man, the ever brilliant Christopher Nolan. In 2008 he had more than a vision of a deep, yet thoroughly entertaining summer blockbuster. He was on a mission, a mission to bridge the gap between intellectual indie cinema and the elaborate glamour of Hollywood. With the success of the Dark Knight he proved such a feat achievable and set himself a stage to deliver something a little more personal.Thus we arrived at ""Inception"" an intricate and complex journey into our very dreams. From the offset we are thrown into the world of ""Dominic Cobb"" (DiCaprio) a agent or ""extractor"" who through complicated futuristic technology is able to delve into our dreams and extract our secrets. estranged from general society and hiding from the law, Cobb is given the opportunity to clear his name and return to his life if he performs a very specific type of dream infiltration, ""Inception"". Despite objections from his associates that the concept of inception, or inputting ideas into another's dreams is impossible, Cobb takes up the task and the plot inevitable thickens. Some may say the plot was already thick enough, it is not Nolan's style to explain all of the in and out workings of the idea, he only asks that the audience embraces it long enough to deduce it for themselves.There are those who will find this too much effort and will walk out confused and frightened in the first half an hour, there are those who will wrestle tirelessly with the plot in a vein effort to understand it and there are of course those smartarses who will effortlessly understand every word as it is said and will be filled with a arrogant sense of superiority because of it. (These people are second only on the list of irritable muppets to those who pretend to understand it on first input). The category which you fall into is irrelevant, as long as you open yourself up to the idea and absorb what you can you are pretty likely to walk away from this film enlightened in some respect. as I said, this is Nolan's bridge between substance and spectacle and when given the chance can dramatically transform your expectations. The energy put into this film by both the on screen cast (particularly DiCaprio and Murphy) and the production crew are simply breathtaking and show that when combined, a visionary director, a clever story, surreal special effects and a A-list cast can really piece together a modern masterpiece.9.1/10 Sam Lockett",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

But will advise you that it is not a film where you go with friends or girlfriend to have a party. You have to watch very closely to get the flavor.

Christopher Nolan Scores Again,"Going into a movie with high expectations can set the viewer up for disappointment (I know because I've been let down many times.) Christopher Nolan‚Äîthe master responsible for such greats as Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight‚Äîhas been the most reliably excellent filmmaker of the past decade; he has never failed to deliver. He continues his winning streak with the remarkable Inception. The movie is so packed with detail and has so many layers that upon the audience's first viewing, they just go along for the ride and try to keep up with it. The story follows Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), an extractor who tries to steal information from other people's dreams. There to assist him in his escapades is Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt.) They are hired by an influential businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe) to infiltrate a rival's (Cillian Murphy) dreams not to steal an idea, but rather to plant one. This is called inception. Stealing information from dreams is difficult; planting an idea is even more so. Cobb and Arthur are hesitant to accept the job. However, Cobb wants to do it so that he can quit the business for good and get back home and see his kids, whom he hasn't seen for a long time. He assembles a team to help him. They include an architect (Ellen Page), who creates the dreamscapes; a forger (Tom Hardy), who can imitate other people within the dreams; and a chemist (Dileep Rao), who concocts the complex chemical cocktails used to induce the necessary states of dreaming. To fool the dreamer, sometimes Cobb and his team construct dreams within dreams. To accomplish inception, they need to create a dream within a dream within a dream. If that sounds complicated, there is one more layer still: limbo. This is a dangerous world of raw subconsciousness from which it is very difficult to return. There are other difficulties to overcome besides navigating dreamers' minds. If projections of the dreamer's subconscious start to detect an intrusion, they attack like white blood cells. The probability of this goes up if the dreamer has been trained to guard themselves by an extractor. In addition, Dom's efforts are sometimes foiled by projections of his wife (Marion Cotillard.) He and his team also have to use ""kicks,"" which are prompts to wake them up at just the right moment. In the waking world, he and his team are on the run from both the law and former marks and clients. As expected, much of the movie takes place in dreams. Inception's visual style matches its lofty creative ambitions. The marriage of art direction and special effects is seamless; it's hard to tell where one begins and the other ends. This sometimes makes it difficult to discern dreams from reality, and this is almost certainly done by design. In the dream sequences, there are some extraordinary images, such as entire cities folding over on themselves, zero-gravity scenes in a hotel hallway, and paradoxical shapes, like infinite staircases. In a season of light-hearted popcorn flicks that are forgotten shortly after one has left the theater, Inception is a rare treat indeed‚Äîa brain-teaser that demands the audience rise to its level, rather than insulting the viewer's intelligence by stooping too low. The dreams Christopher Nolan creates and puts up on screen are worlds of pure imagination where anything seems possible, yet they have their own sense of order; they have limits and laws of existence. This film sets viewers' minds in motion like spinning tops, sending them out of the theater reeling and ready to come back again for a repeat viewing.http://raisedonvideo.wordpress.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Forget the hype - go see NOW!,"I saw the trailer and thought ""looks quite interesting"". Then the hype started and I read all the glowing reviews from critics (but what the hell do they know?). Popped to see the film with high expectations cause Chris Nolan has always been on the money. Well, I could try to explain but wouldn't do it justice. Even if I tried to give away the ending, there are another 145+ minutes of brilliance to see. I can't recall a film had me so transfixed for every second....thrilling, clever, grand, entertaining, intelligent, thought-provoking and utterly mind-blowing.

A Film That Will Cause You To Question....Everything.,"The mind-bending qualities of this film remind the viewer that your perception is everything. Christopher Nolan has let this concept mature in his mind for nearly ten years. Something so carefully crafted and matured deserves to be commended. The film's plots, subplots and back stories may confuse the viewer at first, but Nolan does everything he can to make this world as clear as the dreams within it. The ensemble cast is the most solid I have seen since The Lord of the Ring Trilogy. They are so convincing and so into their roles. I felt so connected to the main characters portrayed by Leo DiCaprio and Ellen Page. After the film was over, the audience got up and left. We (all strangers) began discussing the film and figuring out what it all meant. My words to a potential viewer: do not think you are intellectually below this movie. You will get it and what you don't is impossible to understand. Even Christopher Nolan could not tell you what it all means.My final thought... I am reluctant to pay to see movies, especially at non-matin√©e price. I jumped right on this film and it was entirely worth it. Favorite Film of the Summer.10/10 Stars. Two Thumbs Up. Hey Mikey, He Likes It!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's like The Matrix, only for smart people.","Christopher Nolan is one of the few filmmakers in the world today with the ability to make a big budget blockbuster that is truly original. Inception is like nothing you have ever seen before. The plot involves a world where the technology exists to allow people to invade the dreams of others. This technology has a practical use if you make your living stealing ideas, like Leonardo DiCaprio's character does.Beyond that, I won't say anything about the plot because the less you know going in, the better. I will say that the story is nothing short of incredible. I can't imagine the amount of work it took to write such a complex script and still have it all come together neatly with zero plot holes. I have this image in my head of Nolan drawing these massive flow charts with a thousand bubbles on a giant dry-erase board.This film will please every kind of moviegoer, from the average-joe who likes action and special effects to the hard core film nerd that likes to analyze every second of screen time, this movie works on enough levels to please them all.Nolan does require of his audience the ability to pay very close attention for the entire 2.5 hours, but if you give him that, he'll take you on an incredible journey. Inception is truly one of the best films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Where do I begin?,"Every other year, we are treated to a Christopher Nolan film and anticipation is always high as we are yet to see this man make a bad film yet. I first saw his majestic work with the tricky Memento along with his re-imagination of super heroes with the Batman films. This review however is not about the great man that is Christopher Nolan but rather, his latest (and possibly best) masterpiece, Inception.As with all highly anticipated films, I could not contain my excitement on the way to the cinema and as I sat down to watch the film kick into action, I realised that the audience, like me were not distracted by anything like eating popcorn, talking to their partners or even looking at the time. They were trying their utmost to catch every line and event taking place in the movie and with all the pre-Inception reviews; they knew they were in for a treat as long as they paid attention.The film itself throws you straight into the deep end with thought provoking occurrences but you know that in the mould of all great films, the story will come together. The cast in this movie are exceptional but from the very start, you always expect them to take second stage to the story and execution. I will talk about the cast however as they are all very respected actors in their own right and their professionalism ultimately help the movie realise its true potential.The plot of the film is probably known around the world over due to the sheer fascination with this movie so I will not go into that with this review. A great critical debate was always inevitable however given the feat being undertaken here. The movie itself is like a labyrinth that demands exceptional concentration, with multiple potential ways it could go but at no time in the movie do you feel the director has lost control.Everyone must know by now that the concept of the movie is the world of dreams and just how important dreams are for the protagonists to achieve their goals. The film does do more than that however, it shows the necessity of dreams in maintaining our way of life when all hope is lost, it portrays the desperation of people trying to escape to a world quite unlike theirs where they can be whoever they want to be. This kind of message creeps out of the film and just makes you appreciate the general message Mr Nolan is trying to send to all of us.For those of us thinking the film will be too complicated when trying to comprehend the multiple layers of dreaming being spoken about on most internet blogs out there, I urge you to go there with an open mind and observe how it all comes together. I remember having to keep reminding myself just which layer of dreaming I was watching sometimes but that is just testament to the great story and fabulous execution.The action set pieces are fantastic without being overdone; the crumbling buildings seen on the trailers are just a tip of the iceberg. Everything about this film will be nothing as you might expect as it is one of those rare films that simply have to be experienced. Regardless of whether we see a sequel or not, Inception will always be hailed as one of those great films that dared to be an exception to the norm. Once again, I thank Mr Nolan for challenging our thought process whilst giving us great cinema. Roll on Batman 3",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
over-rated,"This film has been seriously hyped - like many other viewers, I expected much more than it delivered. Almost everyone has had that experience of being disappointed by a film that you have been really looking forward to - this was a prime example. First of all the acting - Keanu Reeves and Joseph Gordon-Levitt - separated at birth, and neither can act at all. I liked Ellen Page very much in Juno, but she was sadly miscast in this role. Not that any actress could have made sense out of her character - she was at random times a newbie, who needed the basics explained, and/or an authority on how the whole thing worked. The plot was filled with these messy holes, but it wasn't entirely negative - some of the effects were fun, and DiCaprio is always good, as was most of his supporting cast. On the whole, worth seeing, just don't expect it to be the best film you ever saw.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant,"In the time of remakes, Nolan brings frontward something so original that it's hard to evade.Let me put this straight; ""Inception"" is a kind of mind buster if appropriate attention is given, viewers will be suitably rewarded. It's not the typical popcorn flick which we have got used to so often.By this time I guess everyone got little bit of idea on the plot; In shortDom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a kind of specialist who has the skill to get inside people's dream and steal their ideas for various reasons. During one such assignment the subject (dreamer) being aware of Cobb's real intension jeopardizes the mission. However impressed by Cobb's skill he is offered a new task for self redemption. Instead of stealing a dream he needs to implant one in a key business tycoon's mind which will lead to known repercussion in real world.That being said lets talk about the casting.The cast assembled for this movie is more than perfect; DiCaprio's role was well balanced by Ellen Page, Marion Cotillard and Joseph Levitt. In various reviews I came across people tetchy about less character development other than Leo; well I guess that is how Nolan wanted to tell his story. Ultimately it all depends on how we interpret.Action sequence infused within the movie was simply ""amazing"" and the pace was very much accelerated by Hans Zimmer's pulsating score.The essence of the movie can be felt with its beautiful cinematography for which credit should definitely be given to Walter Pfister.In short this is a masterpiece and should never be missed in the theaters.Time has come for us to leave behind memoirs of ""The Dark Knight"" and move ahead to accept Christopher Nolan's new great work ""Inception""This movie will beyond doubt be the theme to lots of movie enthusiast caf√© talk for the months to come. Remember Memento... :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nolan: a Master in the Craft of Screen writing,"If you choose to watch this film, let me warn you: it is NOT for the average movie-goer. It is complex, urging the audience to remember what scene just passed. It uses psychological terms, hoping that the audience is intelligent enough to understand where it is going.If you can pass all of those tests, then you will immensely enjoy this film. I don't know where to begin describing it. If you want me to start with the score, I'll simply say it is flawless. Although music may have been overplayed (downplaying the ambiguity of particular scenes) Hanz Zimmer should enter the ranks of Mozart and Beethoven with it. The action is smoothly directed, and Nolan proves to be improving exponentially.The acting couldn't have been better. I didn't scoff at any poorly made comment because they didn't occur. Every word spoken was for a purpose and not one second of screen time was wasted. Brilliant performances of Leo DiCaprio for demonstrating his deep dedication to the role; Joseph Gordon-Levitt is an up and coming actor with much promise; same goes with Ellen Page, Tom Hardy (the amazing Bronson); Ken Watanabe; Cilian Murphy; Marion Cotillard; and all others. Especially with DiCaprio's character, Cobb. Just mesmerizing.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) But the component I am eager to boast is the drama. Whoever says this movie has no emotion has clearly not contemplated the delicacy of familial bonds. What drives the main character, Cobb, is his love for his family. Nolan makes this movie a love story intertwined into the vastly complex universe of the mind and subconscious. How did he do it? Simple: spend 10 years composing the script, and you might, too, come up with a geniusly crafted work.""Inception"" and the famous quote about the ""idea as parasite"" play at the backbone of the plot, and its final result is not only a warning of an idea's power, but an example that an original idea can change the world. I believe that this film will change people's minds about their own dreams, and thus the global population have made one step closer to being more attuned to themselves- thanks to Christopher Nolan.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
simply a masterpiece,"When i first heard about this movie i believed it was just another hyped up big budget movie, i was completely wrong. This movie is easily Nolan's greatest work of art. The acting and script for Inception is stunning. For him to make this movie very complex yet easily understandable is simply brilliant. From start to finish i was on the edge of my seat along with everyone else in the theater and was extremely pleased with the ending. This was the first movie to leave me utterly speechless after leaving the theater. This is definitely one movie you should see in theaters.

Visually stunning,"I'm a huge Nolan fan, and I always get those goosebumps moments in his films where it just HITS me like a ton of bricks: I get this movie. I get the deeper meaning behind it. I get the reason for it. And Nolan sent that message in the most genius way. Wow. It's probably different for different people, but some examples, it was when black merged into white in Memento, it was when Joker was upside down opposite of Batman and talking about human nature, their duality, gravity, etc, it was when the audience discovered the Prestige had been done on us, etc.However, that doesn't happen for me in Inception. I loved the movie. So unique, so entertaining, but I'm not sure if I truly GET IT. I've seen it like 13 times, and I'll come up with a explanation and an underlying theme, then second-guess it the next time I watch it.I've read many ""explanations,"" or better yet, interpretations of Inception online, but none made an air-tight case for me. Perhaps that's the reason, obviously he intended ambiguity, but I need more.At best it's one film where you can have conversations with different groups and all come up with something totally different each time.Thought provoking at it's finest.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"How can I perform a kick, when there's no gravity?","Visually mesmerising and narratively enthralling, Christopher Nolan's stop-gap project before he commits to the third film in his Batman saga is a non-stop thrill ride which delivers on all levels; consciously and sub-consciously. Like everybody else in the real world, Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) has a full-time job except, unlike the rest of society, his job transcends realities. His work involves extracting confidential and sensitive information from client's minds as they wander in an artificial dream-like state. To attempt this intricate process, they require an 'architect' who will construct the dream world in which the client's subconscious is drawn into, before extracting the information from them. As Cobb mentions however, this process can essentially degenerate into 'theft' as clients may subconsciously place their secrets inside a bank or safe, which the team will have to crack to explore and exploit.After a job goes askew, Cobb is hired by the shady businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe) to perform an almost impossible, and incredibly complex act; Inception. Instead of extracting an idea or information, inception requires the planting of an idea into the subconscious mind of the client, thereby influencing any potential future decisions they may make, e.g. implanting into the mind of a client the suggestion that they should release an inferior product in the future to allow a rival competitor to prosper. Cobb assembles together a well-respected and able team of experts willing to commit to the act of inception, including the forger Eames (Tom Hardy), who has the ability to assume any identity in the dream world, the architect Adriadne (Ellen Page) who is young student constructing the world in which they will tread, the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao) who is providing the substances that will allow them to stay under in the dream world for an extended period of time, and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who is the team's 'point man' and Cobb's highly regarded second in command.Despite its hundred and sixty million dollar budget which is most prominent in the film's stunning visuals, the real endearing aspect of 'Inception' is the brilliant story which Nolan allows to slowly unravel throughout the two hours and twenty minutes of run time. Constantly keeping the tension at appropriate heights, while also allowing the story to develop showcasing various twists and tales, Nolan's screenplay is the intricate competent which truly makes the film work on various inter-connecting levels. From mystery-thriller, to science fiction and a hefty dose of drama, as the story unfolds, the visuals dazzle, and the characters themselves continue to grow, develop and prosper in this artificial environment.On the surface 'Inception' is a heist movie in really simple, generic terms, but under the surface it contains underlying themes of love, loss, grief and the inability to forget those we used to, and still do love. Despite constantly being surrounded by dangerous situations in both realities, Cobb's real danger comes in the form of his memories and in particular those of his wife (Marion Cotillard). While the other members of his team seem to perform their actions for the thrill of the event and the payment on delivery, Cobb is instead restricted by outside factors which keep him constrained within his transcending prison of never-ending certainty, and this (in?)sanity is projected to the audience in a typically emotional and brilliant Leonardo DiCaprio performance. Aside from DiCaprio, the always radiant Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives yet another proficient acting performance he can be proud of. Yet, despite the array of talent on show including DiCaprio and Sir Michael Caine, no doubt for the next few months the name trickling out of the Casting Department's on both sides of the Atlantic will be that of the gentlemanly Tom Hardy. From obscurity to the A-List in a matter of years, not bad for the London man who only got his leading role a mere eighteen months ago.But the real question here is; Can Christopher Nolan do no wrong? With 'Inception' comes the directors seventh feature film, and with this his sixth film to open to startling critical acclaim, and as many will agree, rightly so. Nolan has created a fantastically imaginative world where nobody is even safe, even when their bodies shut down and decide to roam the depths of the human subconscious. His story draws you in, while the gravity-defying action and unstable personalities of the characters keep you deeply rooted in your seat for a well-spent two hours and twenty minutes of pure, leisurely cinematic enjoyment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Movie Review:,"Christopher Nolan might just end up as the most alluring and enigmatic film maker of contemporary cinema. Memento, The Prestige, Dark Knight and now Inception: Nolan's oeuvre is definitely one of the most creative outpourings in commerce and cliche-ridden Hollywood. If you thought Memento teased your mind, try savouring Inception. It will leave you tortured, tormented, ticklish and tantalised with its mindplay. And if you think you can actually unravel this mind-boggler in one go, you're asking for the moon. It will leave you longing for one more dekko to get the picture straight....Too many levels of reality, too many things happening and too innovative an idea.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What About It?,"This film is overrated. Besides being accompanied by a score determined to set you to sleep there's really no filmmaking here that sets it above the rest.The plot is very interesting and, for the most part, well conceived. However, the characters do too much talking simply explaining to the audience what the meaning of their actions are. Why assume the audience is inept?The basis of the plot itself is where film most earns its grade. This is truly a unique idea for the screen. Unfortunately, it was denigrated by the unnecessary dumbing down of the story and the unimpressive acting of the cast.No matter what the subject of a movie, to end it with the question of whether it was all a dream or not is not clever.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Emperors New Clothes,"Contrary to the opinions of the deluded army of comic reading Nolan fanboy geeks who have descended on IMDb, Christopher Nolan has entirely and irrevocably disappeared up his own self inflated backside with this movie. I say The Emperors New Clothes because the director will sneer at anyone who doesn't understand the film and he has thus created a perfect defence mechanism. I'm sure Di Caprio et al had in depth briefings about the narrative and can explain it verbatim but us viewers are left to work it out for ourselves. And it's so full of holes, so full of irrelevant tripe and so full of itself that it isn't easy. It's incredible that its been voted the 3rd best film of all time by IMDb users. I mean seriously, that's a joke. The fanboys all want to laud Nolan as the new Kubrick (another joke) but in doing so they have voted this tosh above ALL of Kubricks work. It's such a smug self congratulatory film from the get go and it just gets smugger as time drags on.Now of course I appreciate that you can go too far in explaining every detail to the viewer with unnecessary script mechanics that insult the viewers intelligence. However, although you can go too far in explaining, you can also go too far in NOT explaining and expect the viewer to grasp in a single viewing what is a massively complex concept film - and one that's so badly flawed in so many areas for it to undermine the whole 'intellectual' nature of it. The idea of the film is OK and the film does have its moments but there are so many scenes that don't make sense that it spoils it entirely. I appreciate that 'heist' movies are usually procedural and that Nolan wanted to avoid that but in doing so he's created the most self-indulgent picture ever.I could go on about the snow scene, the thoroughly implausible way these people not only do what they do but 'assemble' as a team, the oh-I'm-Christoper-so-considerably-cleverer-than-you-are-Nolan backstory with Di Caprio's wife but I'm not going to pick apart the scenes because I'd be here for hours and I haven't got the energy left after enduring this nonsense. Besides; everything could be spun that he meant this or that (he isn't as deep as he likes you to think). Inception is all fur coat and no knickers. It explains so little of what is going on that I left feeling angry. And I generally get these films so it's not a case of me being some moronic fool who struggles to follow the weather.And billed as a completely original idea? Nah. There's obvious similarities with The Matrix, Dreamscape, Total Recall, Flatliners, Vanilla Sky, Pan's Labyrinth, Dream Demon and even one of the Star Trek Next Generation Episodes centred around the holodeck, all of which I've 'gotten' - the good ones, the bad ones, the ones you ponder for days afterwards. The fact is with this abomination I simply can't be bothered to think about it because I really don't care. I don't care about the characters, I don't care about the ending (which was excruciatingly predictable) and I don't care about how clever Nolan thinks he is. You're not mate. You've pulled a massive con with this film by creating a movie where you can call people stupid if they don't get it / like it. You get to sneer and snigger at the stupid little people. You've taken your previous successes to the movie execs and they've foolishly allowed themselves to fund your rampant self indulgence. That's what irritates me the most about this utter piffle. I understood what was understandable about this film and there are of course films where the intention is to purposely let the viewer fill in the gaps with their own imagination (generally a nice touch) but that simply isn't the case here. The story script and indeed most of the awful acting (outside of Di Caprio, Juno girl and Cillian Murphy) neither holds it together nor papers over the cracks of a weak script that's trying to be oh so deep... and badly failing.This is over 120 minutes of my life that I will never ever get back and I simply couldn't wait for the film to end. I had lost all interest in any of the characters, their backstorys or indeed the 'mission' after an hour once I woke up to the fact that he was clearly unable to pull the film together into something coherent and genuinely contemplative. And judging by the rest of the audience and the people I was with, I wasn't the only person who left feeling bitterly cheated. I congratulate Nolan on creating hysteria, mass hypnosis and hype because he's clearly managed to brainwash a lot of the audience into making them think they've seen a clever film. That's the only inception.Go and see this insidious fluff for a visual experience perhaps (even then; visually it's pretty overrated). But don't be surprised if you feel a strange peer group pressure to tell whoever you go to see it with that you understood it all when you probably didn't (or if you did; that you actually care and did so in spite of a dumb script).Nolan is not nor ever will be Kubrick. Kubrick would have done this film justice - after he had rewritten the script, changed half the cast, removed 45 minutes of length and replaced it with sensible content that made the film engaging and cohesive. I fear the next set of people to be duped will be those who vote for this trite idiocy come the Oscars.BTW I wager that Nolan watched Guy Ritchies Revolver and liked it. Congratulations Christopher, you have just descended to his level of filmmaking.Meh.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Here comes Nolan....again!!!,"Well...have been sitting on reviewing a film since became a member of this site...never was quite inspired to type away a few words for a movie (I joined only in 2009, so don't go, what about ""The Dark Knight already"", I love my movies alright..). But who to break that melancholic joblessness for me but Chris Nolan. I wonder if there has been a contemporary director more consistent than him at catering out breathtaking cinematic experience, time and again. Well he is back after two long years postponing the third batman movie for this one, and we here thought ""It better be good."" Well, we were wrong. Whats the word, ah!!! ""Ruddy brilliant it is!!"" Nolan has once again got it all right...the screenplay, the editing, the cinematography, phew! breathtaking. His grip on the movie is so overpowering, that an actor of DiCaprio's talent, who by the way turns in an exquisite performance as the troubled ""extractor"" Dom Cobb, still looks just another character driven in a frenzy in a world only Nolan could make so complex and yet so coherent with all its multi-""layered"" texture. Ellen Page and Gordon-Hewitt turn in good performances, while Michael Caine is charming as ever in his short cameo, Because I am quite the Cotillard fan, I would not comment on her performance, lest it be biased. In short, if you have bought a ticket for this one, and I am not counting on that being easy at least this weekend, even here in Pune, you are in for a couple of hours of a hell of a ride.

"From ""Inception"" to Deception : a Review within a review within a rev....","Regardless of my definitive opinion, this is a 'sensational' film and a mind-bending one like I've never seen before. And guess what ? I think I was victim of its own concept since I went through four stages of reviews with ""Inception"", one within another (naturally) :REVIEW 1 : Ecstasy in Perception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""This is not a film, This is an experience ... a cinematic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" ... This is why I love movies ... why imagination is the greatest human gift ... why I dream to write such creative and intelligent stories ... And still ... I don't know how to feel ... Movies like this should be praised and loved ... I loved it, but I feel something messy now in my mind, and that I can't get out ... I need to watch it again ... this is not a movie to watch once ... definitely ... it's so disturbing it's great, so great it's disturbing ..."" 10/10This is the raw feeling, authentic? sincere? naive? well it was the immediate one, one that couldn't be altered by other viewer's opinions, praises or criticisms. This is how I felt when the movie ended. A second watching transported me from ecstasy in perception to ...REVIEW 2 : Originality in Conception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""It's a dazzling intelligence-challenging puzzle, but only on an intellectual level, not emotional. Why not? Should all the movies have a 'heart' beating inside ... as long as it makes yours do. Now I understand the film and love it because I decided not to care for the emotion and just try to understand the story. And with this mindset, believe me, ""Inception"" is an incredible experience. The movie is a fantasy and remains realistic in the same time, it's real because we know it's fake, but the fake world feels so real because we can technically live in. It doesn't say anything about dreams and subconsciousness, because it's all about actual and virtual reality, perceptions and intentions. As a script, it's a very impressive work from Christopher Nolan, not to mention the brilliant editing. Yes, I know I'm watching a film, but this one I value as an intricate puzzle that challenges my intelligence. ""Inception"" is like a cinematic Rubik's cube."" 9,5/10I was still loving the film, but in the meantime, starting to concede that the enjoyment was more on a technical level, on the construction of the plot and the intricacy of the script ... I admitted that the whole Mal-Cobb subplot was just plot devices to insert a melodrama, necessary to plunge us in Cobb's subconscious and inject it into Fisher's dreams, combining this way two parallel worlds, two narrative structures. In such action-driven films, 'forced' is 'flat' and melodrama must be handled carefully. The movie was perceived as excellent by my humble mind, but more in a cinematographic, geometric, almost pragmatic way ... which brings me to ...REVIEW 3 : Enthusiasm in Reception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""It's a great film that should grab the Oscars for Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Visual Effects, Sound Effects, Best Cinematography. If it didn't, there would be no justice!"" 8/10I knew I enjoyed the movie because as I mentioned before, it featured great thrills, action, script, music, editing, visuals ... hence the word 'sensational' I used in the beginning of this review. But as I titled in another review : ""many elements of greatness don't necessarily make a great film"". I started to question myself. It's a film about dreams, about subconscious, right? but did I sense a real escapism in those supposedly dreamy settings? didn't those dreams look a little bit like micro-episodes from formulaic action films? could the fights (or anything for that matter) be more imaginative? did the Mal-Cobb subplot make me feel sympathy for any of them? did I really care for Cobb? or did Leo make me care for his character? did I care for the whole mission? did any of the characters appeal to me? So many interrogation marks leading me to the ""Limbo"" review ...REVIEW 4 : Realism in Deception ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""Wow ... this movie has a really strange power, it leaves me ecstatic when it finishes, and then the more I think about it, the more I realize that the very aspect that made me love the film could've been handled in a better way and with a deeper characterization: less chase scenes and shootings, more imagination and by that, I mean more beautiful settings and creative plot devices ... This movie is a cinematic experience that makes you scratch your head and hold your breath, but does it deserve all the praise? I wonder how I fell for this one, but I think it's time to retract myself and admit my judgment mistake. Yes, the movie is a cinematic Rubik's cube, but I guess I forgot how I used to get quickly bored by this game. How did I change my mind ? ... I don't know ... thinking, reading, realizing, sharing views, using this mind ""Inception"" tried to twist ... A very creative film, I wish it will win all the Oscars previously mentioned, but beyond the creativity of the concept ... what did I enjoy? I guess only the concept, the rest was just ... all flash and no substance"" 6/10Yep, the rating also fell through 4 ""layers"" ... what a painful awakening, this movie amazed me so much, I couldn't feel anything negative about it ... and one thing for sure, ""Inception"" has the weirdest power of attraction when you watch it for the first time, that's why I understand its popularity. It's like my mind had already accepted the idea that the movie would be a masterpiece just because it relied on a particularly innovative concept. Or was I just victim of an ""Inception"" called Marketing?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Vision by a Visionary,"As time has passed, it may or may not be true that Christopher Nolan's status in the movie industry has come under scrutiny. Clearly, The Dark Knight Rises and Interstellar weren't the same caliber as his previous films, and I myself have wondered if Nolan's legacy will endure as much as originally expected.It is tempting, to question the true talents of Nolan, but not when it comes to his 2010 science fiction thriller Inception.The 2010 passion project is a must-see, for any movie fan. It is the ultimate state of subtext bursting at the fore, yet the fore still perfectly able to operate like a great film. Nolan's years of developing the script absolutely paid off, the end result being an epic exploration of the human consciousness, and its battle against reality.Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard, Cillian Murphy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ken Watanabe make the best cast ensemble of all time: the two standouts are Page and DiCaprio, because of their own screen time together, but Inception has lots of great screen chemistry elsewhere.
And that's why Inception, in my opinion, is a life-determining movie for Nolan: the character interactions are great, yet the story works anyway. Inception makes you fear for the well-being of its characters, and a pivotal reason for this is the sheer quality of acting and script enhancement.
Cobb, the mentor of Ariadne, could just as well be her lover, yet that is never the case. The film excels at making you wonder about possibilities yet not disappointing you when those possibilities don't come true.Maybe that's Inception's greatest possession: it lacks subversion, the essence of storytelling and art, but in no way suffers for this. Like but better than The Dark Knight, Inception isn't about plot twists, but about the deep execution of ideas. The film's structure, though technically attached to the literal events, is attached to this execution. The dream states don't change, which is fine because the intelligence of the art is the recognition that story builds from no change (just like how the Haddonfield of Halloween doesn't change, or how the shots of Paranormal Activity don't). The inclusion of Cobb's backstory isn't a clich√©, because the structure and momentum surrounding its use is so emotional, and thoughtful.I may have spoken of this in other reviews, but a specific attribute of great movie-making should be the ability of harmonious difference: an audience should be able to watch the same movie, have different experiences, and all those experiences are in their own way satisfying.
In this respect, Inception isn't just a masterpiece, of all history of cinema, but it is an essential, timeless contribution to culture.
(I would here include the theatrical H6, as another example of this)At heart, Inception is the idea of reality's infinity as both humanity's tormentor and objective. Life fears death, but the immortality afforded by dreams has its own consequence.
The deception done to Fischer isn't cruel, but it isn't all that inspiring either. The mission of Cobb, Ariadne and Arthur is about another idea, central to life:
value through perspective.
Inception is about the value of why, if not what.Christopher Nolan will continue to make films, and each year those films will either be applauded or not, but all of that future is non-consequential to me: Inception is to Nolan what The Shawshank Redemption is to Frank Darabont, or H6 to Joe Chappelle, or Alien to Ridley Scott.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Music and dialogue were excellent, though many times dialogue was hard to make out due to loud music drowning it out. :( Acting was also great, though I am no big fan of DiCaprio, who did as expected, (with that silly smirk on his face, almost like Cloonie's), but the rest of the actors were great.Overall a well-made movie with a plot full of fresh ideas.

Unique but not good,"Look I am a fan of Chris Nolan or at least I used to be. His movies are always different and I liked them. Prestige was the first movie that I watched of him and I loved it. The Dark Knight was the movie that I had the highest expectations and it did not let me down. I know there are 10 things not to like The Dark Knight but for me there were 1000 things to like. But this time I AM disappointed. Inception is like the cutest car that can't run very fast. It has its good looking but no good plot and a million questions about the concept.There are a few simple rules about a science fiction movie or story. When you watch one there are things you feel right or not. You can use your wildest imaginations but at some point they have to make sense. This film certainly did not feel right. This was like a low budget science fiction which starts well but loses it after a while except for this was a big budget movie!Well there ARE a few things to like about this movie.

"Good news, bad news","Good news is I got to see it for free on an HBO free weekend and did not have to pay to see it.Bad news, I got to see the movie.I was really looking forward to this movie. The trailers were great and the concept was intriguing. The problem was the execution. Once again, chase scenes, fights, explosions, special effects etc took the place of good writing. What could have been a cerebral movie just turned out to be another action movie. I do not want to take anything away from the special effects, they were very good and some were outstanding. My problem was that maybe there was only 30 minutes of actual plot and dialog in the entire movie. After a while, you quit wondering if it is real or a dream and just start dreaming that the movie will end soon. There are really no good twists and turns in the movie and little that is so thought provoking that you want to talk about the movie afterwords.My advice would be to take the special effects budget and spend it on some great writers.As the old commercial asked ""Is it real or is it Memorex?""

CLASSIC,"""Inception"" is a mind-bending rollercoaster ride that takes viewers on a journey through the labyrinthine depths of the human mind. From the first frame to the last, the film is a masterpiece of visual storytelling, with stunning set pieces and jaw-dropping special effects that push the boundaries of what is possible on screen.At its core, ""Inception"" is a film about the power of ideas and the limitless potential of the human imagination. The concept of entering and manipulating dreams opens up a vast playground of possibilities, and the film explores these possibilities in thrilling and unexpected ways.The cast is phenomenal, with standout performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy. Each actor brings a unique perspective and energy to their role, adding layers of depth and complexity to the already intricate story.What truly sets ""Inception"" apart, however, is its ability to blur the line between reality and fantasy, leaving the audience questioning what is real and what is a dream. This ambiguity creates a sense of unease and tension that permeates the entire film, making it a truly unforgettable viewing experience.Overall, ""Inception"" is a tour-de-force of filmmaking that combines mind-bending concepts, stunning visuals, and top-notch performances to create a truly unforgettable movie-going experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest movies ever made,"When I saw it for the first time 10 years ago, I had to sit for a while and think, 'what did I just see there'.

My favorite film of the 2010s decade,"This will forever be one of my favorite movies. The first time I watched this, I couldn't believe what I'd just seen, and thought about it for days after. I hadn't seen many movies when I watched this, but it still remains one of the best ones I've seen (3rd favorite atm).This may be one of the best ideas/concepts for a film I've ever seen. I mean wtf, a dream heist? That's sick. Idc what anybody says abt this film and its massive filmbro status, its absolutely amazing. I mean fr tho, I'm a 16 year old boy, OF COURSE this is one of my favorite movies. I'm probably the target audience lmao. But seriously, how can a film so perfectly executed and acclaimed get such a massive filmbro status? Because it's mainstream? Go figure. There's a reason so many ""casuals"" have this in their top 10. Then again, those people haven't explored some of the greater directors and films. But for those people, I would consider this one of the main gateway films. It's got just enough technical brilliance to be considered at least a GOOD movie by almost all. That being said, here's why it's my current 3rd favorite film:This is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. It tests your mind and bends it back and forth, while still having your full attention. The acting is amazing, but you'd expect that from big Leo. The special effects, cinematography, and editing are all top notch. The story makes sense, even if it may take some thinking. The music is some of the best in any movie, maybe my favorite from Hans Zimmer. It has incredible action and an amazing cast. It's literally one of the coolest mf things ever ong. This is 100% the best movie of 2010 for me, I mean what else is better? The Social Network? I hope my children love this movie as much as I do, because my god was this a MOVIE.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nolan's second masterpiece - Simple yet brilliant!,"Finally, I got a chance to see Inception today. I went in with high expectations knowing how much I was impressed by The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan's first true masterpiece. After watching the movie, was I impressed? Yes. Completely blown away? Yes!! This movie indeed is Nolan's second masterpiece.The movie involves some awesome CGI works, powerful acting by the whole cast and an intricate yet engaging story line. Films with equally good CGI have released in the past, so there is nothing new about it. We have also seen similarly themed movies so it is not really the theme which distinguishes the movie. So what actually makes the movie so good?One reason is the director's ability to make you connect with every dream scene in the movie. When you watch the movie, during many of the dream scenes you'll feel ""Hey, something like this has happened to me before!"" or ""Yes! This is exactly how it's supposed to happen in dreams!"".Second is the plot. Nolan invites you to a world of his own, presents you the possibilities and the dangers of the world and then builds a plot based on that world, a plot so brilliant that in the end you are left dumbstruck in awe. Similar attempts have been made before (Steven Spielberg for example, with his Minority Report) and I must say this is the best such attempt ever.Overall, a heavily engaging movie, possibly the best movie of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Strikingly original masterpiece?  No, but it is intriguing.","Now I will start by saying that for all the many flaws and silly plot holes, which seem more glaring the more you think about them after viewing the film, I did enjoy the ride. It didn't really stick closely to it's own rules and some of the characters got lost in the shuffle - well, most of them, I suppose - but at least Nolan was trying to create something more than the same old flicks Hollywood churns out like the hot-buttered popcorn you can buy at every cinema. It's not terribly original and nor should anyone buy into the hype that it is, but that doesn't mean it is without merit.To dispel the myth that this is original, I have to say it draws fairly obvious comparisons to the following works, which isn't to say it lacks originality, more that it treads the same sort of path with a different flavour.* The Matrix (1999) - Anyone who doesn't see this must be blind; they seem to come from the same seam. It's one of the few similar films that can stand up next to it though. * Dark City (1998) - The buildings, the gravity. I can't say more than that. * Blade Runner (1982) - Chris loves this film. It's more in visual styles than story but it's there. And when I think of the title I can't help but think of the term ""incept date"". * Star Trek TNG - For the holodeck reference/style mostly. * Heat (1995) - The action scenes, despite the fantasy settings, seem remarkably tight and often quite realistic. * Synecdoche, New York (2008) - The more I think about it, the more similar it seems to this film, and the more this film seems similar to Dark City. Which is why I like them, I guess. * Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (2004) - Love is a big theme and how the mind deals with it an even bigger one. It would spoil Leo's story arc to say more. * eXistenZ (1999) - Can't believe I nearly missed this one. In that film it is virtual reality, as with The Matrix, but there are still a lot of parallels. * Ocean's Eleven (2001) - The whole thing about it being a concerted team effort to pull of such an ambitious caper.There are a lot of tiers at work here, and it's probably going to be the case that it's good first time around, and perhaps more intelligible after another viewing or three. Of course, the folks who fund Nolan films are aware of this and are hoping to double their revenue streams, actually adding this observation to some of the marketing bumph in the hope of getting people to go and see it twice a la Fight Club which makes me more than a little cynical, but I can wait for the home release anyway and would recommend everyone else do the same. This looks like a fun one to learn, certainly something worth studying if you happen to have more than a passing interest in film-making and convoluted slight-of-hand storytelling, and you really need to be able to pause, rewind and freeze-frame advance certain sections in order to do that.It mines the seam of ""what is reality, really?"" a favourite topic of Andrew Niccols and Charlie Kaufman, too. Those are among my favourite types of works because they beg endless discussion and if handled correctly can be a great source of inspiration. As I have a soft spot for those kinds of plots I suppose I'm naturally more willing to grant a bit more leeway, because credit where it is due I did find myself mulling over my perceptions of reality and re-evaluating the value of lucid dreams. Most films leave no discernible traces in the minds of anyone which makes this at least above average.The special effects aren't overused and/or intrusive, merely adding to the story I feel. And the mixture of CGI with real photographed elements is deftly handled. There is the odd moment of ""oh, too much"" or ""not layer blended so well there"" but trust me, it's far superior to a lot of the junk that gets through and at times I actually think they were deliberately making it a little weird and obvious to show it's still not a real world.To tie this review up: as one of the seemingly few people who thought The Dark Knight was a hopeless mess with very little to enjoy outside of a fiery Heath Ledger performance it's a welcome return to the twisting story lines that are usually a Nolan trademark. Despite the length there is enough going on that it doesn't feel like a moment of filler is present. Also, I would like to briefly point out that this is the first film DiCaprio has starred in where I actually enjoyed his performance completely.This film is not his best but nor is it his worst. It is well worth a watch, no doubt about that, but it shouldn't be heralded as a masterpiece and as of the time of writing this review is far, far too high in the IMDb Top 250. I'll grant that it is better than most of the cookie-cutter remake product that Hollywood is very fond of dishing up as of the past decade or so, therefore it looks better by comparison, but it isn't quite coherent enough to be brilliant. Hopefully it will inspire other writer/director auteurs to come up with similar, perhaps more lucid works. As it is, Memento (2000) and The Prestige (2006) are still the high watermarks against which few others can measure up, even the man himself. But it's still one hell of a ride.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Masterpiece,"The film is a classical thriller and, like many great thrillers it is one that is built on an imaginative and damn-good clever concept. To its credit the stepping up of the action aspect does not mean that the ideas that got us here are abandoned because they are not. The cast deliver well. DiCaprio manages to produce an engaging character who emotionally makes sense and it is his performance that helps the deeper material in his subconscious work well and be more accessible to the viewer. Gordon-Levitt is memorable for his action scenes but he is also a good presence generally even if he has a lot less to do. I'm not in agreement that Inception is a classic perfect film but it is a very good one. If anything the elevation of this film is more to do with how average and uninspiring the vast majority of films released are, but I suppose that the success of this one is a good thing in some ways to maybe counter that. The concept and ideas are well constructed and presented to the audience and the film itself is not hard to follow but does challenge the viewer to do the one thing that a blockbuster normally doesn't ‚Äì pay attention.

Inception rating,"Hiii,i just finished watching the movie 'inception' and i need to share my emotions with you after watching it. Best film ever that i watched. It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. Before seeing the film I read that the director was Christopher Nolan and the protagonist Leonardo Di caprio, so I already knew it was wonderful. Without spoilers I want to make you understand a bit of what it's about; is an action and thriller film, lasting 2 hours and 28 minutes. Talks about Dominic Cobb is a professional who takes care of extracting secrets from people's minds while they sleep, infiltrating their dreams through a special device that allows a group to participate in a ""shared dream"". Cobb and his team normally use tricks and deceptions to steal information from the victim, who he believes to be in reality and suspects nothing. Together with his partner Arthur tries to enter the mind of Mr. Saito, a powerful Japanese businessman, to perform an extraction, but fails when the dream projection of Mal, dead wife of Cobb, appears in the dream interfering with the operation. I advise you to look at it very carefully, otherwise, you will not understand the ending well. I think it is one of the best films of 2013, because it differs from the others, it is not monotonous in the plot and you can see that the director has perfected every detail in order to make it fascinating and moving.

Nolan has once again done a dream job!,"With the film ""INCEPTION"" (2010), Christopher Nolan (director) has once again shown what is possible in the film world.
The film was awarded 4 Oscars and 4 Golden Globe Awards.
The film is an action film, a thriller and a sci-fi film all at the same time, which really pushes up the film experience. At the same time, the production is impeccably cast. In addition to Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, the cast also includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Cillian Murphy.
Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a master thief and is supposed to do a very special job with the help of an extraction. He is to perform an inception on the corporate heir Fisher (Cillian Murphy) and implant false thoughts in him with the help of a dream. But he only does this risky job to be allowed back into the USA, where his children are waiting for him. Together with his gang of thieves (Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Elliot Page, . . .) they go from one to another even more dangerous dream world.
The whole film is about dreaming (""The dream is real""). You can change dreams, enter dreams and escape from there into the next dream. In this work they change dreams three times. A dream within a dream within a dream, so to say.
I personally love this film because it has really good cinematic effects and the soundtrack is also first-class by Hans Zimmer (German film music producer). In addition, the story is thrilling and emotional.
The only disadvantages are that you have to think all the time, otherwise you lose the connection, so the film is not for viewers who just want to enjoy the film, but for viewers who want to experience a real thrilling film experience.
So think twice before missing out on this miracle of a film. Personally, I have already watched this film three times and it is always thrilling. That's why ""INCEPTION"" gets all stars from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Film of A Generation and One For The Ages,"For my 100th review on IMDb I knew I had to make is special, there have always been a few films that I said I would never review on the site and Inception is one of them mainly because it's my favourite movie of all time so it's hard for me to truly get across just how much this film has inspired me. I am however going to give it a try, for one Christopher Nolan gives some of the best direction ever given to a film because it's dine in such an ambitious way, he's always trying something new to really sell us to this world of the dream that all look absolutely stunning, they feel genuine as they would come across as in this situation, I don't care if I'm kicking a dead horse but Nolan deserved an academy award for his masterful directing of this film. This film completely respects the intelligence of its audience, Nolan doesn't try to sugarcoat any of the tough to understand dialogue but gives full complicated speeches on this complex process, I can tell you that I had a very hard time understanding this film when I first saw it but that didn't make me feel less intelligent it measly made me want to go back and watch it again and again. The performances in this film are all perfect, none of the actors or actresses try to overact but give subtle performances that feel real and less movie like. Leonardo DiCaprio is so fantastic in this movie he's so perfect at selling his characters pain, his character is also impeccably written, he's given a clear reason for why he is trying to perform this last job and it gives the audience a better reason to get behind him as a person. I loved Ellen Page in this film she had amazing chemistry with DiCaprio and was out conduit into this world. Tom Hardy could not have been better cast in this film he was hilarious and stopped this film from having all similar characters. The way this film is structured is done to perfection, its built like a heist film so in the first half we get an ingenious look into this technology and its workings and in the second half we get a mind blowing sequence that has incredible action scenes, impeccable set design and we get a true conclusion to DiCaprios character. Everything in this second half is built up perfectly and has your heart beating and your 100% invested in the characters. This is mainly due to the script that ensures that this isn't just an action film with a good premise and some cool explosions but instead a thought provoking piece of film making. The ending of Inception is one of the most effective ever put to film, it gives e dry viewer a different perspective and allows them to always explore it in a different way with every repeat viewing.Inception is beyond masterful, it's a thought provoking, incredibly entertaining, emotional investing piece of cinematic brilliance, I can not begin to tell you just how much Inception has gone on too inspire me to explore film it self. This will forever be my favourite film and will always hold a special place in my heart.100%/A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the greatest movie going experiences,"From the very starting of Inception one will be engrossed by the sheer intensity of the film. The beauty lies in the aspect that it deals with such a common psychological state but still creates an awe. Another aspect of Inception is that it binds the viewer with the journey.Inception is a movie where we see the magnitude of a director. Christopher Nolan can handle psychology better than any contemporary director, but the way he handles the architecture of mind and the juxtaposition of scenes is somewhat,mind boggling. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his most nuanced performances till date. The rest of the cast is brilliant. Comic moments created by Tom Hardy is refreshing.Inception is not a movie it is an experience...watch it to just experience it. After that watch it for a second time to bow to the genius of Christopher Nolan",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not living up to the hype...,"I went into the cinema to see this film with sky high expectations given the domestic and international reviews of it. Phrases like ""modern classic"" and ""landmark film"" made me think that I was in for something truly special in terms of film history along the lines of Citizen Kane and The Godfather.Turns out I wasn't, well not all the way anyway. I won't bother with the whole plot line, since it's very sprawling and complicated, but suffice it to say that my main disappointment with the film stems from the fact that the thematics of the story simply are too limited and ordinary compared to the potential impact of the film's gimmick: the fact that you can enter somebody's dream to steal information or plant ideas.The plot revolves mainly around industrial espionage, a theme which simply does nothing for me emotionally. Who cares if one industrial tycoon wants to stop another? The dream concept of the film is truly magical and innovative and is a very compelling feature of the film itself. But why in heaven's name marry it to something as pointless as industrial espionage? What happened to something like the fight for world domination? It would have given the film infinitely more punch if the plot had centered around some political intrigue in stead. Especially given the unstable nature of the world today with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, huge climate issues, and so forth.The subplot involving Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard's characters to me comes off very flat, their on screen chemistry not being very strong. This is a shame, for the premise of the subplot has great emotional potential.All in all, somewhat of a disappointment, despite the wallop one inevitably receives from the film's take on the concept of entering someone else's dreams.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Nolan Flick Yet? Doubt it,"The only way to describe this movie in one paragraph is it was like the first time a person has sex, it's hyped for about 2 or three years of your life till finally it's prom and you got the parents station wagon and you got a hotel in the country all set up for your first big night of love. Then you go to pick your date up and she's gotten braces over the weekend. OK, not the worst thing in the world. Then you slip and fall while shaking the dads hand and karate chop his balls and grab her mothers blouse and rip it off on the way down. Then on the way to the prom you get a flat and you go and change it and you get oil all over your tux. Then you go to the prom and you think it'll be so cool now that more people are being added to the mix. But it's not, and it sucks because there's now so much sexual tension built at this time the dudes don't wanna dance for fear of boners and the girls don't want to for the same reason... Then you finally leave and get out to the hotel and you think ah well, this whole night was crap but this will redeem it. This will make it all better... Then you realize she's got braces... And her hymen's still intact... And what ensues is 20 minutes of nothing but blood, pain, and screams of agony coming from both parties till eventually you can't even look at her anymore and you wont be able to jerk it for a month now because your scabbed penis needs time to heal....

A smart man's movie repackaged for the commoner,"Writer and director Christopher Nolan pulls together an all-star cast for Inception, a mind- altering thriller. The film stars Leonard DiCaprio as Cobb, the leader of a team of thieves who understand the inner workings of dreams. Given the puzzling nature of the film, it's best just to say that the plot involves Cobb and his men implanting an idea into the mind of a businessman's rival in exchange for freedom to see his children.The rules of dreams in Inception are staggeringly complicated. There is talk about kicks and drops that early on fall of deaf ears but in practice become very cool. The visuals are outstanding. Seeing a Paris street fold over itself is about as realistic as one could expect. The signature scene may be a zero gravity fight in a hotel that would make astronauts jealous.It's almost painful how little the actors in Inception have to do. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Arthur gets to have the most fun handed to him since he partakes in the aforementioned gravity defying sequence. Other than that I can't describe his character. The same goes for Ellen Page's Ariadne who logically has no business being in this film. Her casting is something of an exercise in testing the audience. Is it acceptable to have Velma from Scooby-Doo accompany the Oceans' Eleven crew? These are talents in search of characters. If anything their casting will have you disappointed that they don't make heel turns and betray Cobb over some cash, as that in the least would make Arthur and Ariadne dynamic.Although Inception offers up heaps of originality, I have to say that it was better the first time I saw it‚Äîwhen it was called The Matrix. The two are very different plot wise and the obvious analogy is in visual effects, but for me it has to do with how the elements of the Matrix or dreams come to be revealed. In The Matrix much of the early end of the movie is jarring. Neo, the protagonist, is then led into believing that the world he knows is a lie. This approach attacks two problems with one stone; it aligns the audience with Neo, and it gives the characters in the know a reason to explain their world. The Neo of Inception is Ariadne. Unfortunately her involvement with the movie is trite, especially when you consider that Cobb's team starts the film with an architect. She is far from being the lead and her only contribution is as a figure to ask questions on behalf of the audience. The result is a bombardment of confusion. Characters are trying to pull off a heist, but they constantly have to explain what's happening to Ariadne (the audience). A good heist film shouldn't rely on spoken word to communicate actions.Much can be said about the ending; it's obviously left open for interpretation. An earlier Nolan film by the title of Memento had an ending that didn't quite resolve every inquiry, but it was done in a way tasteful enough that the audience knew what happened during the movie. In Inception the audience is left with too many questions but has to make an assumption about what happened just after the film cuts to black. Maybe this is a new way to avoid criticism‚Äîif you can't write a good ending, just end the movie and let the audience do your work for you. That's why they call this approach cheap.Inception is a smart man's movie repackaged for the commoner. The concept and craftsmanship of filming techniques are strong enough to award it favorably, but a cheapening ending and confusing approach toward exposition dim the lights.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Obviously a masterpiece,"I watched this for the fourth or fifth time tonight. This is the first time I remembered the details of the plot from the previous watches, and that I had no difficulty in understanding all the fast and complicated explanations the characters give. I'm sure there are a couple of holes, but all in all it makes sense, and it doesn't matter anyway.Inception is a freak, absurd movie, of course in a positive way. How they did imagine such a story and got it into production is just unbelievable. Even some years later, it stands out for its originality.The personal story of Cobb is very interesting, and every time (from the second time on) I can't but cry when there's that particular shot at the end.Inception explores the perception of reality, but while Matrix did it from some kind of rebellion/resurgence standpoint, and The Truman Show did from an emotional/human point of view, Inception's take is deeply existential, and that's a huge plus. Reality, desire and their conflictual relationship is the true subject of this story.There are, unfortunately, a couple of minor flaws. Nolan could have taken the chance of using a language that would be a bit more oniric, I mean letting weird things happen as they actually do in dreams. Instead, the actions and flow are just too realistic, as they would happen in the real world, and the movie puts a great effort into making things play out in a realistic way. This is surely a missed opportunity.
Secondly, it is apparent here the tendency of the Nolan brothers to explain, explain, explain. Every action needs an explanation. While here it's a minor shortcoming, it became annoying later in Interstellar.Apart from this, Inception is surely one of the masterpieces of this era, for its originality, execution, and powerful imagery.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

We're told that here's Leonardo, and here's an Asian guy who wants him to go into a dream, and that's it. Boom, now start the action. I will say that the concept was very good.

Christopher Nolan's Defining Film.,"Inception is the smartest science fiction film, and overall blockbuster, in the last couple of decades that makes you wonder why Hollywood can't find similar genius as ambitious and passionate as Christopher Nolan, whose vision is comparable to that of the great Stanley Kubrick.Inception is a new genre of film, and can go absolutely anywhere it wants to. There are few refreshing experiences at the movies like watching an original screenplay come to life in such a manner as Chris Nolan does. He mixes the film noir and science fiction genres seamlessly, and the result is absolutely gorgeous.Inception is a breed of film which deserves every bit of praise earned thus far; it knows that its viewers want to see a film that shows unforeseen aspects of the human psyche, which Leonardo DiCaprio shows through his character Dom Cobb exceptionally well. The film is an experience, and so much more than the typical 'tent-pole' blockbuster coming out these days.Inception is a fine piece of science fiction cinema that feels like a classic yet new film.

Not impressed,"This movie was (and is) beloved by everyone so I don't expect to make any friends with my honest opinion - I was not impressed by Inception. Before I first watched this film, I was told that it would be complex and mind-blowing so I expected something like Nolan's earlier The Prestige (2006) which was masterful and one of my favourite films. Instead, we get a shallow imitation of that style. Inception is complex just for the sake of being complex - it doesn't add much value to the film, and the complexity is just overloading the audience's working memory which is not a clever technique at all. The characters were the worst part of the film. Apart from the main characters, they basically have no existence outside their role in the mission. We don't have any other reason to care about them. After a point, I just completely stopped caring whether they succeeded. Nothing felt compelling or of much consequence. I actually cared more about Cilian Murphy's character than the protagonists, to be honest. Because I lost my investment in the film, it just dragged out and became boring, especially some of the generic action scenes like the one in the snow. The ending is just cheap ambiguity rather than anything meaningful. That said, there were some good things about the film that I enjoyed. The visuals and effects were great, such as the transforming cities and the zero gravity. The best part was Hans Zimmer's score which remains one of my favourite soundtracks. Those aspects almost made up for the flaws - almost.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What are you drinking??,"Inception rated 12 of all films,above for instance of ALL OF HITCHCOCK'S FILMS.The problem and it isn't about rating movies only ,but let's say ,discussing who is the best footballer of all time ,or which is the best musician etc,IS that young people ,who are the majority of those who are familiar to the internet and go and write reviews ,haven't seen great people in their lifetime and can't comprehend what their real value was.It's different to listen from other people about Pele or Maradona than actually watch them ,when they were in their prime.It's different to listen from other people about the Beatles ,than actually understand what was going on, when they performed in the 60's.So OK,i won't be surprised if Justin Bieber on an online survey is higher than the Beatles ,because the teenagers are 70-90% of all internet users.So that leads to unbelievable PERVERSED results,like this above.In 10 years time the DVD version of this ""masterpiece"" might be selling 20-30 copies all over the world(not thousands).I think it's the only film ,that IMDb shouldn't care about spoilers,because you can't spoil a storyline that doesn't exist. Ridiculous ,shockingly bad,laughable but clever(clever in that they succeeded, in taking money from my pocket, for watching it).When i have watched over maybe 5000 films ,i used to gloat that i can smell from kilometers away the ""potatoes""(a phrase that means really really bad films).Not any more.Maybe when i reach 10000 films, i will have the power to save my self from the next Inception.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""Inception"" Review","GO WATCH INCEPTION NOW!!!
From director Christopher Nolan who has made some of the best films ever made such as Memento,The Dark Knight Trilogy,The Prestige and Interstellar,comes Inception.This movie left me speechless and took my breath away the first time I saw it,The action in Inception is awesome because most of it takes place in the Dreamworld which leads to some of the most creative action scenes iv'e ever seen in a movie,Movie is not really the appropriate term for Inception ,It feels more like an experience,Some people will not like the film because it will make you think about the movie,even after its over.But if fine with that then you'll love this movie.
The casting in Inception is...let me put it this way
one of the best things Christopher Nolan can do for a movie is direct a cast of actors and he does just that with Inception,Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing in this movie,definitely his best performance since The Departed,and everybody else like Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Ken Watanabe,Marion Cotillard,Ellen Page,Tom Hardy,Cillian Murphy,Tom Berenger and Micheal Caine give performances just as good as Leo's.Hans Zimmer's score is amazing like it always is,and the cinematography,I would go as far as to say that this is one of the best looking films I have ever seen,so good job to Wally Pfister and basically anybody else who worked on this movie.Its still bedazzles me that Christopher Nolan hasn't won an Oscar for any of his movies yet,hopefully Tenet is amazing and he will get at least one Oscar from that.

A magnificent dream that falls short on its execution,"Christopher Nolan has undoubtedly become one of the most important names in the business of contemporary filmed entertainment.He has taken us to places we did not know existed.He singlehandedly revived a languishing cartoon franchise and placed it in the pantheon of unforgettable classics. In his new adventure he takes on the uncharted universe of the subconscious. The premise in its scope is intriguing and unconceivable ambitious.he relies on the best movie making talent only a major movie studio can buy to achieve his goal.The special effects are terrific, the acting is pretty good, and the dialogue is also good, but the journey that started as an unrestrained adventure into the realms of the human thought generating universe turned half way thru into a tale of semi confusing scenes. The story never comes anywhere near of seducing its audience. The emotional factor is completely absent.The movie is worth watching and it does stand out mostly due to lack of quality competition, but it should not be an Oscar nominee. Christopher Nolan has done better work.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Wow,Before I saw this movie I wasn't sure if I was ever going to see something that I would consider perfect. This is absolutely my favourite film of all time it has absolutely everything going for it. The premise is incredibly smart and unique and is executed in a way that allows the viewer to discover things for themselves. The cast is top notch in this movie with Leonardo Dicaprio the stand showing that he has true knowledge of this subject. The rest of the cast does everything right and all have perfect chemistry with each other. The heist itself was so well done and mad me fell as if I was in a dream and anything could go wrong at any time. The heist gets more and more intense with every passing moment and the ending literally turned my mind against itself as I do this day am still trying to figure it out. This made Christopher Nolan one of the greatest directors of all time and made a movie that I consider to be perfect.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A brilliant, thoughtful and dynamic film.","Inception is a movie that blew the majority of us away when it was released into cinemas worldwide. But, it left many wondering about the character 'Cob' which I won't mention.Anyway, Inception is about a group of very skilled people whose job it is to enter other people's dreams to alter their real life ideas and decisions. The main character 'Cob'(Leonardo DiCaprio) and his friend and colleague 'Arther' (Joseph Gordon Levitt) are tasked to perform something called 'Inception' from 'Saito' (Ken Watanabe)who is the owner of a powerful corporation. And his goal is to bring down another company to make his the leading company in the world of energy.Director, Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, 2008) does a very sterling job as he delivers a fantastic film with lots to enjoy from chase scenes, beautiful scenery and a twisting story lines. Nolan's choice of cast couldn't get any better as they all impressed me with their super sonic performances. Nolan also adds a layer of complexity about the dream world to deepen the concept. You won't all understand it straight away, but a little thought, and you should get there.Furthermore, there are scenes which blow me away with suspense and thrill. Especially when learning about dreams and who 'Cob' was recruiting for his team. Their strategy to complete the job from 'Saito' is very interesting.Overall, This film is an amazing experience to watch and will not keep you bored for any second. Top performances from DiCaprio, Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page and great cinematography to lose yourself in. Nolan has produced an mind blowing piece of film which is still talked about today.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Disappointed,"I couldn't wait to watch this film but boy was it disappointing. It was a fantastic idea and yes it looked great. However, the main problem for me was that the characters were drawn so poorly in conjunction with the visuals that I did not really care what happened to them. I loved Momento and The Dark Knight but the crucial difference is that I cared about Guy Pearce and Christian Bale. It may be perhaps that I do not rate De Caprio but I could care less about what his predicament was. I even tried watching it 3 times to see if I was missing anything but ended up getting annoyed. Visually stunning there is no doubt and an amazing concept but emotionally shallow.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Bwaaaaah,"I am sorry, putting the horn in the title just amuses me.""Inception"" is not only incredibly ambitious and a bit of a gamble but it is also one of the most intelligent movies ever created. But you know what the gambling gave us? One of the most intelligent, visually striking and coolest movies ever made. I love this movie in every way that you could love it. The story is intriguing and well-crafted, the performances are great, the score by Hans Zimmer is unforgettable and the visual effects are tremendous. The ending also leaves A LOT to interpretation, which I adore. The action in this movie is also really well done, especially in the parts where they utilize the different rules and physics of the dream.""Inception"" is a well-crafted masterpiece and is definitely one of my favorite movies. It definitely gets the seal of approval.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic Trip To The Unconscious,"The year 2010 was marked by the film ""The Inception"", which opened July 8 in London. The genre of the movie is science fiction, with adventure, suspense and drama; within a amazing script; arresting the viewer's attention from beginning to end.With a budget of 160 million dollars and Box Office of 828 million, in addition to the four Oscars, the film was nominated for another four, including best picture.
The plot is based on the story of Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), two invaders of minds, who use the technique of industrial espionage through dreams. After an unsuccessful job, they end up being sought by a powerful Japanese businessman who orders an insertion of ideas in the mind of the son of the president of a multinational company competitor. In order to perform the service, Dom needs to form a new team and face international persecution and the sabotages provoked by the mental projection of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard).Throughout the unfolding of the film, psychoanalytic aspects of the main character are revealed and overcome, in parallel with fantastic situations linked to the invasion of minds and dreams within dreams. This feature was as significant at the beginning of the 21st century as the Matrix was at the end of the 20th century. The two films, by the way, have much in common, especially the fact that they create a fantastic universe through visual effects. In this sense, Inception surpasses said film, since, although the complexity is similar, it leaves less loose ends. Matrix foreseeing continuations, left a series of things to complete that ended up badly solved, which does not occur in Inception, where everything it needed, was well explained. It's a great movie, to be seen and reviewed. Absolutely recommended to all lovers of cinema art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great,"The logical relationship has always been clear, and while looking at it, I'm impressed that this is not generally the ability to build. Layer upon layer, grand and complex and clear regulations. So much so that when you walk out of the theater and look around, there is a sense of film shooting in your eyes. The doubt about whether it is a dream or a real one seems to be brought to your mind along with the film. If one's ability to build can be as strong as this, really, how can one accept the bondage of reality?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mr. Nolan is like a cold mathematician,"Where should I start? It would be better to get straight to the point. Firstly, despite the idea is brilliant, in other words, generally the story of the movie is brilliant, ideas don't make a movie great as just complicatedness doesn't make a movie good. By this movie, personally, I have understood that Nolan is not ""my director"". The Dark Knight was also a serious disappointment for me and Batman Begins was just a summer blockbuster (Following and Prestige were very very good) As for Inception, the biggest flaw of the movie is the movie is lack of heart and soul, in other words, it is cold. The characters are cold, the atmosphere is cold, the reactions are cold, because they are in dream? Well, I don't think so. It causes what then? I didn't much care about the intrigue, couldn't identify with the characters, so the most important problem of the movie is its dramatic structure. The second is the ""dreams"" itself. You know, the agent of dreams in cinema is David Lynch. Why? Because he shoots creative, intriguing, sometimes meaningless as it should be and surreal dream sequences. The dream sequences in Inception can only impress the architects, mathematicians and some businessmen (because there are a lot of men in black suit) It is because like his approach towards Batman, he sticks to reality. Despite the visual effects are jaw dropping, ""the street bending"" scene is my favorite, it doesn't help much. By the way, honestly, I couldn't understand the trick of Ariadne, for example, is it planned or impromptu? If the point is impressiveness, well I was much more impressed by Sucker Punch for example which has been exposed to harsh reviews. The movie also has not any dramatic twist, epic scene (except for a few moments) or real mystery which had been all necessary in my opinion. Can we say that the movie was low key? Thirdly, some, may be many action scenes seem pointless and ineffective. Especially the ""snow"" sequence. It was too long without real entertainment or excitement. There is not any problem with the cast (except the fact that in contrast with the majority, I think that Leonardo Di Caprio's performance in this movie was just good, not his best performance so far, it is nothing, for example in comparison with What's eating Gilbert Grape!), but it is a bit disappointing that Nolan often uses the same actors in his movies. A note: Michael Caine's character might be a tribute for his character in Children of Men. If you ask me, the best part of the movie is the ""train scene"" It was the only scene that I was dramatically involved and got excited. The ""gravity"" sequence was just interesting. I didn't find it epic. Finally, about the plot, I didn't find the starting point creative, brilliant or exciting. I mean the concept of choosing a businessman for inception, weren't there better options? In other words, the main story was too poor for the concept. However, if we consider Nolan's style, to tell a story about the world of business, might be exciting for him. However, if we consider the hype, the rating, the reviews etc. it seems that Mr. Nolan has deluded audiences again or we have been incepted.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I was glad the theatre served alcohol,"The special effects were great but the science was so flawed in this movie that it was incredible. The storyline made absolutely no sense at all. It also appears to be a bad ripoff of the Matrix (can you say the Architect). Even more illogical is the fact that if the ""Architect"" can create stairs, doors, or even an entire dream environment at will, why can't they fly, destroy anything they want any way they want, or make themselves invisible. At least in the Matrix Neo could fly.The movie just contradicts all of its own rules. People were falling all over the place throughout different dream states but no one woke up, even though a sense of falling wakes you up. Even worse was the supposed technology used to put everyone in the same dream. I don't even want to get started with that one but a pair of ear-buds just will not do it. I really think we need to stress science a little more in our schools.It was pretty cool looking though.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My Favorite movie of all time,"When this movie was about to come out, my friends were excited to see it, but I was hesistant and didn't understand the hype at all. It looked generic. When we alll went to go see it in 2010, it turned out to hit every cylinder I had and was in perfect alignment with every preference, intellectual curiosity, and personality need I had. It's like it was made just for me and only me.Multilayered plot, extended and uncovered narrative, core love story within a Sci-Fi context, character team dynamics that are fast paced and engaging, visuals that will lure your attention, and a depth of ideas that uncover a whole universe of possibiliy. The exposition may be outlined more than subtle, but it does keep the movie cohesive and streamlined. Not a perfect movie in general. but perfect for its own definitions. Also a soundtrack to play for the next generation.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Good idea, bad development","Inception takes the concept of dreaming and turns it into a movie, however its not done as creatively as something like ""eternal sunshine of a spotless mind"". Looking past that there was good potential for character development, but really the only character who even feels remotely developed is the main one.I was loving the first 20minutes of this movie, but after it explained all the rules, instead of doing something creative with it, it just squared it, literally, dreams within dreams within dreams. And Inception turned out to be nothing but an OK action movie that found legit excuses to make half the footage in slow motion.In addition i did despise how the hype with the main characters wife was set up for some epic encounter and then rewarded our attention with just a melodramatic conversation in the end.On the other hand it did offer some splendid effects, but like all movies with such effects, they have nominal value, and as time passes,their real value diminishes.This movie deserves a 6-7 and nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
good but not good enough,i was really excited about the release of this when i watched it on the big screen i enjoyed it but it wasn't the prestige or momento it was similar to the matrix i was expecting the Nolan twist but this didn't happen there was mixed messages through out the film i.e Michael cane 'when will you come back to reality' maybe i got it wrong but i don't think he was in a dream in a dream in a dream but i think Nolan lost himself a bit in this one it is a good film very good but not the best id be happier to see a Nolan film with a 5 million dollar budget and i think he'll pull a masterpiece of with it brilliant films can be made with small budgets i don't claim too be a film critic this is just an opinion,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Never in my wildest dreams...,"Inception opened my eyes to the abstractions of a world manifested once we close our eyes. It is one of few films, like 'The Matrix' - to not dabble in the external, but refreshingly; to dive deeply within the internal psyche and extract the inner occult mysticism of the lesser- known self, something achingly overdue to be assessed and explored in film for a while now...And what more could a film-goer pursue in a motion picture? It captivates everything that perfects cinematography. And it's not only aesthetically either, like so many other films; but in the rich, thought-provoking nature of its plot-line, superfluous acting, the shapeliness of its rising tension that comes to apex with such effortless majesty. Alas, from my first watch, it was stupendously clear this was not a film of bland ordinariness, no...Inception takes in the 'beginning-and-end' introduction with a firm grasp on a plot that otherwise would be remarkably tedious, it shows how common criminals in all their 'real-world' sparsity to wield the arcane abilities to exercise great power through the exploitation of a realm that few are consciously aware of. Thus, hailing about the premise of a dream setting to host the niches of such a plot - with all the inflated, excitable ridiculousness that such a situation might hope to conjure with it. It does a fine job on the big screen, that's for sure - the big name actors are only complementary to that.8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Too Much Matrix But An Excellent Work!!,"Today, I took a nap before I went to movie theater, since I knew that this movie would be a mind blowing experience. There are still parts that I did not understand, but probably I will watch it again and I will understand much more better. I and my friend called this mind blowing experience as Matrix effect(I did not understand Matrix totally when I first watched it).I should say that movie is 148 min, but it is worth it. I think describing the situation, putting things together and presenting a good conclusion could not be illustrated for such a complex story in less than this duration.DiCaprio's character is full in depth and his struggle in his mind with his dead wife presented in the whole story so well.Also special effects are gorgeous. Some of them were used in Matrix, but all those city upside down effects are awesome.I should say that this movie is a really good mind blowing experience. Probably most people will say it is a masterpiece. I do not know why but it is not as good as Matrix. Actually when I first watched Matrix, I thought as the same way. So my critics could change when I watch it again.I strongly suggest Matrix lovers to watch this movie. Probably, you will not totally understand in first time and you will definitely want to see it again.I did not vote for this movie yet since I did not totally understand the whole situation, there are a lot of points which I did not see or understand.

I am a big fan of the ending, with it being a subtle cliffhanger that is not the usual cliche type and takes the film back to the very beginning and reminds of all again of the purpose of Cobbs misson.

The concept of the film is very alike like The Matrix except the fact that you won't die in your sleep like how The Matrix did.Every scenes of Inception is meticulously detailed and requires one full attention in understanding about the stages of the dream world and what may happen in the dream world.It is like taking Carl Jung and Siegmund Freud hypothetical content analysis theories and turning them into movies.The film shows an important item which they called it totem. A unique item where only the user knows what is it like and for them to know that they are actually in the real world.However, the state of having a dream within a dream is not impossible. It appears when someone tried to wake you up and you fall back into your sleep and start dreaming about waking up and doing your daily routine when you are actually still in your sleep and when you tried to wake up in the real world, you feel numb and still unaware if you are still dreaming but your head feels tired.I have experience and endured it before and scientist calls it sleep paralysis.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A masterpiece by Nolan.,"With Hans Zimmer by his side accompanied with enthralling music and a mind wracking plot and screenplay, Nolan surely has gave his all in this film. And today he's a household name for every movie goer especially the Sci fi.

My Re-Review of Inception: It's Chris Nolan's Best Film; And My All-Time Favourite!,"Inception is what cinema wants the audience to feel and more: a dream that ceases to be fake on every conceivable level. It's a meta-film that comes full circle with its implications as to what the audience can take away from a truly impactful movie, whether all the story was a dream or not, whether most of it actually happens until a certain point, or whether the story has no 'right' way to interpret it.The story is relatively simple for Cobb: he's a man trying his best to clear his name and return to his family in America, and he needs to plant an idea into the mind of a media mogul's son about to inherit his father's empire. The rest is something else entirely; Cobb is a master 'dream-thief' who has inner demons of his own and he keeps these demons at bay even if it means risking the mission at hand.Inception is a blockbuster that has the makings of an art film populating an action-adventure story, and making the absolute best of the scenes Nolan's given. This film has classic moment after classic moment; the dream-elevator, the rotating hallway scene, the car-chase, the snow fortress and Limbo make for some of the film's many golden moments. The set pieces are amazing, the direction is flawless and the imagery does evoke the sensation of dreaming. Nolan makes his films have a beating heart to them and Inception is full of it through and through.Inception is the kind of reason that I can say is the reason I love movies. From its ambitious story to intricately done characters and set-pieces add up to one of the most well-made films to ever grace the planet. This is Nolan at his very best; and more!Inception gets 5/5 gold-stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best movies ever,"This film has everything meaning it's a complete package in terms of story, casting and so on. The only word I can use to describe this film is ""awesome"". I think many future actors and directors could be inspired by this movie and by the play of its actors. I have lost count of the number of times I've seen this film, but I think it's more than 10 times. I'm a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and I like his style and the way he speaks. I have seen almost all of the movies that he has played but this one is out of this world. And I should mention that Christopher Nolan is also one of the best and actually he was the reason I watched this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Incredible,"This is the rare film that I give a 10/10 with no doubt in my mind that it is completely deserved.
Everything about this movie is extremely well crafted, from its plot to its characters to its incredible effects and its great action sequences.
This is a movie everyone must see in their lifetime.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A true mind boggler,Inception confused and excited me all at once. The story was easy to follow and yet had a complexity to it that I only understood upon rewatch. The characters all feel real and each have their own goals and objectives. Yet I did notice a lack of development which was a little disappointing. Leonardo's character was the only one to get a little bit of development and even that was lack luster.The ending is great watching them reascend through each layer of the mind. Seeing all the hard work unravel in a satisfying way. Each environment seemed new and interesting and allowed the story to have a different feel every time.Some of the scenes are fantastic such as the hallway and the climax scene both are great filmmaking moments. They both felt necessary to the plot and served as a great entertaining piece.The ending is by far my favorite part. It leaves the ending wide open with the top spinning and allows you to decide if he's dreaming or not. I've always believed he was awake and happy but the area they're in has made me think otherwise because of how often we see the backyard. The ending scene is the reason I love this movie so much.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Blow the mind with dreams__Nolan's masterpiece !,"I'd make this review in points.1.From the side of directing,every thing is amazing an terrific-all cadres are impressive and his way is very sensible and effective.
2.Nolan's way doesn't make you feel bored..his way push you to think and think and think a lot-absolutely he is on of the most professional and great directors nowadays.
3.In this film Nolan doesn't depend on the performance of the actors more than the way of directing and of course the script and terrific story.
4.A very advanced technology is used in the scenes and was very amazing.
5.Finally, i think this is the best movie of that type you can see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Amazing!,This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My reaction,"With physics-defying, thunderous action, heart-wringing emotion and an astonishing performance from DiCaprio, Nolan delivers another true original: welcome to an undiscovered countryThe story can either be told in a few sentences, or not told at all. Here is a movie immune to spoilers: If you knew how it ended, that would tell you nothing unless you knew how it got there. And telling you how it got there would produce bafflement. The movie is all about process, about fighting our way through enveloping sheets of reality and dream, reality within dreams, dreams without reality. It's a breathtaking juggling act, and Nolan may have considered his ""Memento"" (2000) a warm-up; he apparently started this screenplay while filming that one. It was the story of a man with short-term memory loss, and the story was told backwards.Like the hero of that film, the viewer of ""Inception"" is adrift in time and experience. We can never even be quite sure what the relationship between dream time and real time is. The hero explains that you can never remember the beginning of a dream, and that dreams that seem to cover hours may only last a short time. Yes, but you don't know that when you're dreaming. And what if you're inside another man's dream? How does your dream time synch with his? What do you really know?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Over blown and over rated,"Don't believe the hype on this one. Its not a bad movie and has some interesting ideas. But its not the birth of a new religion - as some would have it. How this is mentioned in the same sentence as the 'Kings Speech' is beyond me.In general Im delighted to see any attempt to muck around with the usual narrative sequence or which mixes dream with reality. Mememto was a staggering film and I loved the Matrix 1.But after some early promise of mind altering visuals - the majority of the film was played out in what were disappointingly normal landscapes. They reminded me of conventional bond movie sets than anything else. Where was the Escher stair case? Where was the warping of physics? I felt a little let down to be honest. It was only when we reached level four that I became a little more engaged and impressed.The story line itself I felt badly cluttered with too many explanations of the mechanics of invading dreams. It was nearly always noisy and the dialogue often muffled. This made it hard to follow - (and yes, my hearing is fine and I have a state of the art Theatre system) But the really disappointing thing was that with a concept as subtle as invading peoples dreams and planting new ideas - we had to have gun fights all over the place. Frankly the crassness of the shoot outs clashed rather awkwardly with some intelligent ideas about the nature of reality. And why did all the baddies have 'A-team' shooting accuracy? Last point - wouldn't it have been rather easier to persuade the target to do what they needed him to - through non-dream means?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
All Flash No Bang,"I'd Like to start by saying that I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan, I loved The Dark Knight And Memento, but I am afraid that this film dropped well below my expectations.This film is filled to the brim with special effects but lacks the substance.If you pay enough attention to follow this car crash of a storyline by the end you'll wished you hadn't bothered.The only thing that saves this film is the acting performances and the special effects, which at times can even make you dizzy. So I am afraid this film is an absolute, catastrophic and undoubtedly definite disappointment. Do yourself a favour and watch something else.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as complicated as it seems,"Famous for a script that was so complicated even the actors themselves didn't understand what was going on, Inception is one of Christopher Nolan's most famous films, which, given his string of popular movies, is saying something. It's a science fiction film that takes dream analysis to several new levels. In the film, it's Leonardo DiCaprio's job to put his clients to sleep, then enter their dream subconscious and find out information they need. It gets much more complicated, but for the sake of saving your brain, that's the plot in a nutshell.Nolan recruited an all-star supporting cast, including Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in one of his first dramatic roles. While everyone tries very hard to give serious, dramatic performances to thrill and move the audience, it doesn't always come across that way. Marion seems like she's trying to remember how to speak English, Joe seems like he's desperately trying to get the audience to forget he was ever in 3rd Rock from the Sun, and Leo looks like he's out of tears and thinks a wrinkled face will be just as convincing.The special effects of the film absolutely deserved the hype and the Academy Award, as scenes literally bend and crumble into one another as the different dream sequences blend. If you love movies with incredible special effects, this is a must-see.If you even mention the title to anyone who's seen it, it'll no doubt spark an hour long discussion about what the story and ending meant. I watched the film, and with the exception of a couple of little details during the dream-within-a-dream sequences, I understood it perfectly. To me, the ending was not one that needed discussion, so I don't quite understand the reason behind everyone's endless debates. However, if that type of story intrigues you, you might want to watch this one with your friends so you can stay up late afterwards and talk about what you think it meant.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
