"""Well hello Mr. Fancy Pants.""","Picking up where ""Evil Dead II"" left off in a somewhat altered opening, Bruce Campbell, now a full blown Han Solo smart ass, is trapped in the dark ages and is eventually found to be the one fated to the Deadites after he retrieves the Book of the Dead, which can also help send him back to his own time. But Bruce, being as stupid as he is, screws up the magic words that are meant to keep the Army of Darkness away and he ends up unleashing an army of undead skeletons by accident who are led by his evil alter ego. Now he must use his 20th century know how to save the day or else evil will forever rule the Earth.Bruce is back and funnier than ever. No real horror here, more of a parody of a big budget fantasy adventure film. Sadly, a number of great gags were left on the cutting room floor that are generally only seen on extended DVD's and TV showings.Hail to the King, baby.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One the funniest movies I've ever seen!,"I remember when this film just came out in the theater, I didn't know anything about the Evil Dead films and in fact hadn't even heard of them. From the previews I had ZERO desire to see this film.  The years went by and in late 2000 or maybe 2001 I finally decided to watch it, cause I'd heard so much about it and just couldn't take it anymore, I had to see what the fuss was about.  I was NOT disappointed!  This is probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!!!This movie is definitely not for everyone though.  The comedy in this film is VERY odd, so I could understand if someone didn't find it funny at first. First thing you need to keep in mind is that this movie IS NOT trying to be serious, and most definitely doesn't take itself seriously.  The movie is just plain weird, but that's what makes it so great.  You really can't explain this movie to someone that hasn't seen it, you just need to see it for yourself.Also, if you didn't already know this, this is the 3rd installment to a series.  Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 are the first two installments, then Army Of Darkness.  You don't even need to see the first two to understand what's going on or anything like that.  In fact, to this day I still haven't seen Evil Dead.  When I watched Army of Darkness, I hadn't seen either Evil Dead or Evil Dead 2.  Since then, I have seen Evil Dead 2, but neither film is a prerequisite for this film.Also this film has an enormous amount of quotable lines.  Bruce Campbell is THE MAN!  The way he says stuff is just great!Well, I truly hope that you'll watch this movie.  But watch it with an open mind and remember that this IS a STUPID movie, but it's supposed to be. Thanks for reading,-Chris",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Hail to the King, Baby""","It's not good as ""Evil Dead 2"" but it's still a fun humorous wacky movie with a bit of horror(well when it comes to the surroundings anyways). This doesn't really have that scare factor compared to the first two, but instead it brings out the crazy, humorous and wacky elements way more this time around. And it takes place in the Medieval Ages I think. Even though this one doesn't really have much to do with the previous installments it's still has that flare going for it. sure it's one of those movies that is the epitome of just going with the flow. Because a lot of it is random or doesn't make much sense. But if you can just go with it, you can enjoy this. What really drives this movie though is Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash. His goofy, silly and wackiness while also being a badass brings a lot to this movie. And gives a incentive to root for his side. Although it can be cheesy at times it's still a very fast-paced and entertaining film. Overall it's a ridiculous movie that is so good.7.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not for the pretentious,"Most people would say you can check your brain at the door before you watch this film, but I beg to differ.  This is genuinely intelligent stuff here folks.  The director, Sam Raimi, reminds us in this film what it is like to have fun.  From the film itself, as well as the DVD featurettes, it is apparent that Mr. Raimi is having a blast doing what he does best.  It shows too.  Granted, there is not much in the line of plot or theme, but these would be totally gratuitous in this escapist piece.  Instead, we are given a fantastic adventure, appropriately tongue-in-cheek special effects, and an ode to The Three Stooges.  The facial expressions of Bruce Campbell alone make this film well worth its 80 minutes.  I don't want to give away a single joke, because the experience is just too much fun.  So, do yourself a favor.  Watch this film without being so hard on yourself.  Yes, you are allowed to laugh.  There can be non-sardonic humor in modern day America. Sam Raimi proves it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Comedy and horror rolled into one,"Okay, maybe it's more comedy than horror, but who cares? Army of Darkness is an awesome movie. Bruce Campbell does an excellent job as Ash, the arrogant and hilarious hero armed with his trusty chainsaw and 'boom stick'. The plot was great and fresh, showing that the people behind the scenes were not trying to do the same thing that made Evil Dead I & II popular. The movie is filled with sword swinging skeletons, kick boxing witches and slap stick. Bruce Campbell has some excellent one liners. To sum it up, Army of Darkness is groovy.But you can let it end here. Give us another sequel please.",,Anonymous,Horror
Amusing and terrifying bloodfeast in which Ash/Bruce Campbell returns for a third round,"This frightening , strikingly designed horror/comedy movie achieved a lot of success thanks to its unstopped terror and humor , including continuous resemblances to the original version also directed by Sam Raimi . It deals with a 20th century guy , Ash (Bruce Campbell, first and last studio film he starred in as the lead) , none too bright hero , who finds himself trapped in the middle ages . As Ash along with his car , his shotgun, and his chainsaw is accidentally transported to 1300 A.D., there he finds the ¨Book of the Dead¨ in which unwittingly emerge resurrect demons . Soon he is discovered and thought to be a spy for a rival called Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and is taken prisoner . He is freed and confronts a nasty witch (Patricia Tallman) and Duke Henry the Red (Richard Grove) . Later on , square-jawed Ash must fight an army of ghouls and generally causes all those wreak havoc . Menwhile , he romances a babe , Sheila (Embeth Davidtz) , and attempts to retrieve the Necronomicon so he can return home .A scary , tongue firmly in cheek sequel of the original festival of gore and gags in which an ancient book of magic , Necronomicon , invokes a crowd of joke-tossing , flesh-snacking skeletons . Exuberately gory and filled of guts flick , this is a big-budgeter film , while its predecessors were short-budget . This comic book extravaganza is blending from previous versions ¨Dead evil¨ with creepy creatures submitted a fantastic possession have transformed into flesh eating , being influenced by Ray Harryhausen's skeletons seen in ¨Jason and the Argonauts¨ and ¨Bedknobs and broomsticks¨ . As the entire sequence when Evil Ash grows out of Ash's shoulder starting with an eye is identical the 1959 b-movie 'The Manster' . Highly adequate make up and excellent special effect with enjoyable monstrous creatures and apparent technological exuberance . It must be stated that this is one of the grossest , disgusting and most brutally unnerving movies in the nineties . A fun retelling providing chills , hilarious situations and grisly horror and isn't apt for squeamish neither feeble stomachs . This independently produced gem features sets and production standards but is skillfully narrated and results to be an exciting horror/comedy film . Sympathetic acting by Bruce Campbell as hero hurled back to the 14th-century through the powers of an evil book and attempts to get back to his own time . Although Bruce Campbell was displeased with the studio's delayed release of the film and their re-editing of it , as he stated he wasted a year of his life waiting for the film to get released to cinemas . Thriilng as well as rousing musical score by Joseph LoDuca. Colorful and evocative cinematography by Bill Pope .All 3 films can be seamlessly cut together , including some introductory footage in the follow-ups . The first installment was ¨Evil dead¨(1983) by Sam Raimi with Betsy Baker , Theresa Tilly and Bruce Campbell who finds ¨The Necronomicon¨, dealing with a group of friends are vacationing in Tennessee woods when go into a mountain cabin and they find the book of the dead , then begins a possession demoniac and they undergo an eerie changing at night and going on a murderous rampage . Followed by two sequels with similar actor (Bruce Campbell) , producer (Robert Tapert by Renaissance pictures) , musician (Joseph LoDuca) and well directed by Sam Raimi . As ¨Evil dead 2 , Dead by Dawn¨ (1987) in which young people again take refuge in an abandoned cabin and taking place subsequent transformation the students into evil monsters until only Ash remains to battle the evil . This ¨Army of darkness¨ was stunningly directed by Sam Raimi with great originality , though takes parts here and there , too . It's become a cult favorite thanks to its relentless terror , irony , graphic horror but has still tongue-in-cheek . Well worth watching for terror and gore lovers .",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
81 minutes of pure fun!,"The third--and presumably last--of the Evil Dead movies finds Ash Williams(B-movie supreme ruler Bruce Campbell in full froth)somehow transported(along with his broken down car)in Medieval England,about to do battle,once again,with the undead,with the aid of(among other things) his ""boom stick"" and his chainsaw. While being a strange man in a strange land,he romances plucky lass Sheila(Embeth Davitz,pre-Schindler's List) and aiding the reluctant natives(among them Ian Abercrombie,MArcus Gilbert and Richard Groce).To me(and I suspect I am not alone on this),one of the neat things about this film is that it moves at such a rip-roaring pace that one has little time to catch their breath or even add up the absurdity of the story. But,to quote another commenter,Who cares? This offering,which pretty much eschews the original Evil Dead's Horror premise,and capitalizes on more of the crazed,feverish pacing of Evil Dead 2,seems content to offer large doses of humor mixed with raucous violence and only the thinnest character exposition. Bully for director/co-writer Sam Raimi,co-writer Ivan Raimi and company on this! This is a great ""palate-cleanser"" of a movie and is a solid party film(among other occasions),whether you're fans of Campbell,Raimi,berserker action films,comedies or all four.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Medieval Dead,"The evil dead films go from horror with some black comedy to a horror and comedy mix to this rather innocent adventure comedy. Army of Darkness has more in common with Hercules and Xena than the first two evil dead movies. This does not take away from the fact that this is a faithful sequel. Bruce Campbell has all the fun as he performs Three Stooges routines, goes a little Gulliver, romances a babe, and kills his evil self twice. The battle of Oldsmobile is the highlight as Ash takes on an army mixed of Ray Harryhausen skeletons and KNB zombies. The voices, the sliding dagger skeletons, and the hi ho hi ya make the battle super cool. The silliness is sometimes stupid(shoe laces?) but mostly hits the mark, mostly.*Evil Ash: I am bad Ash, you're good Ash. Your little goody two shoes! Little goody two shoes! Little goody two shoes!*",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Look what Michael Bay can do with hundreds of millions and wonder why it isn't nearly this good.,"Evil Dead 3 goes by many different AKAs.However even though the film is nearly 20 years old and was low budget even then it still holds up. It remains unbelievably quotable and helped make Bruce Campbell move from a B movie actor into a B Movie Star, and the director Sam Raimi a bona fide Hollywood big shot, I think the Spiderman films might've helped thoughIn the first 5 minutes Raimi effortlessly manages to catch us up on the first two films by showing the summarised backstory, only now including new scenes and events that featured Bridget Fonda as Ash's lady friend, and introducing his S-Mart career. Only a few details actually line up with the events of the first two films – which were in reality the same film made twice anyway – but who cares when the new elements are this fun? In short we rejoin Ash as he is dragged inexorably into another dimension by the forces of evil, ending up in an earlier time of (say) the 1200s, when men were men, demons were prevalent and a constant threat, and American people spoke with thick and contrived British accents – especially the extras.Ash immediately finds himself stuck between two warring factions, the heavily armed castle fortress of Arthur and his men, and the (allegedly) vicious and desperate forces of Henry the Red – so named due to his amazing flaming mullet. Both sides believe the other are responsible for bringing the evil to wreak havoc on one and all.After Ash hilariously proves that he is neither a ""Deadite"" nor a disciple of Henry the Red – and with his shotgun nor is he a man to be f*cked with – the local ""wise one"" declares him the ""One"" that has been foretold (look out Keanu, Eddie Murphy et al).On hearing this and enjoying the subsequent grovelling and fawning that the desperate villages bestow upon him Ash reverts back to the wisecracking, self centred and cocky character that he gradually morphed into in ED2 – though it must be said that this attitude get ratcheted up a few notches with this film. If Evil Dead was a horror film with a few chuckles, and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn was a horror-comedy, Evil Dead 3: Army of Darkness is a comedy-horror, with perhaps 75% laughs and 25% scares and gore. But even the scares are more funny and the gore is more played for laughs than gasps.Ash heads off to find the magical Book of the Dead – the Necronomicon – which will banish the forces of evil and allow Ash to head back to his own time and minimum wage job. Of course his solo quest is destined to never run smoothly, and over the journey Ash must face and defeat a series of mini Ashes (in an amazingly creative Must-see scene), his evil doppelganger Evil Ash and his interred horde of undead minions who range from mere skeletons to more recently deceased zombie soldiers.Along the way there is much over the top gore and action, some witty and incredibly arrogant dialogue, some ""Three Stooges"" homages and the extraordinary physical acting abilities of a young Bruce Campbell. He and Raimi are well acknowledged as longtime best friends, and they obviously had a ball making this film and threw everything but the kitchen sink into it amazing considering this is only an 80 odd minute film depending on which version you have. Raimi is well know for reveling in the on screen torture of pal Bruce so in the film Ash must perform some incredible ""backwards acting"", get attacked by flying and biting books, get attacked by underground bones and perform lengthy and intricate sword fighting combinations.The evil dead soldiers are often shown in stop motion animation, and there are some shots that I would guess are either homages or were influenced by the work of Harryhausen. Perhaps if they made the same film today CGI might make it look prettier and make some of the actions of the undead a little less herky-jerky, but it wouldn't make the film any better. Every one of the apparently precious few dollars can be seen on screen, with the diminished budget demanding that the film-makers and crew simply had to be more creative than ever before.Thankfully Raimi, Campbell and co were up to the task, the rough edges of Army of Darkness don't detract from the film at all, if anything they make it funnier. A scene in which one of Evil Ash's generals asks for orders and then rides off is hilarious when you look at the General's riding partner who is obviously little more than a skeleton shaped scarecrow, and the appearance of an unwitting crew member in the original version is another quirky and amusing oversight that enhances my enjoyment of this brilliant film.The Evil Dead trilogy already represents some of the best examples, in horror, horror-comedy and simply comedy in cinematic history.Not a bad effort for a few blokes with a miniscule budget and a few crazy ideas. After all look at what Michael Bay can do with hundreds of millions of dollars and ask yourself is that better? I'll break the suspense for you: Hell no it isn't!Final Rating – 9.5 / 10. A brilliant conclusion to one of the better trilogies in cinema history. Ash will go down as one of the horror genre's defining characters.P.S. I know a remake is slated for release next year, with a 0% chance of improvement on the originals why bother?",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fuller story with all of the Evil Dead DNA,"An American horror-adventure; A story about a man who finds himself trapped in medieval times. He must quest for a book of evil which can return him to his time. Unfortunately, he releases the evil trapped inside the book. The third in the film series finally proves the point that there is no substitute for a good story and high production values. Evil Dead III is funny, well acted, and consistent in pacing throughout. It retains all of the familiar tropes of the original - gore and slapstick humour - but less of the blood-soaked insanity of the previous two instalments. It is more of a cartoonish sword-and-sorcery fantasy, albeit one with some imaginative monsters and special effects with a horror element attached to it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun fun fun!,"Oh, come on, you just gotta love this. Whether a girl or a snotty old man, this movie is funny. Bruce Campbell overdoes himself into this goofy comedy, transforming scene after scene into a laughing contest. One just has to see this.Seeing the first two movies as well, I think I realize how this one came to be. I think that most of the times artists allow themselves to have fun at their own work, jewels of comedy emerge. I would just love a fourth movie in the Evil Dead series.Funny thing, though, as this is the most successful of the movies, I have seen it quite a few times, on video, TV or my computer. I can vaguely remember that one of the movies had an ending when the guy found himself in a far post-apocalyptic future after getting the potion, while in others he was in a supermarket, attacked by a demon.

What a Strange Film...,"Army of Darkness is such a mix bag for me, on one hand it is a very fun and whimsical fantasy adventure but on the other it is such a step away from the franchise that it feels out of place. It is marketed as a horror film, but there is absolutely zero tension or spooks to be had in its entire runtime, luckily the movie was actually quite funny. Raimi tried to do a bit too much in the special effects department, leaving many of the effects feel cheap and out of place. The green screen technology especially just was not there for the time. Raimi's direction was very relevant, and his signature touch on the film really helped. The performances and writing absolutely save the film. Bruce Campbell is the best he's ever been, with incredible line delivery that had be legitimately laughing out loud. The quick witty dialogue between characters was hilarious. Overall, Army of Darkness is by no means a bad movie, but it does take a step a little too far from the source material, which just didn't resonate with me as much.Score: 67% 👍

Army of the Unfed...,"What would you do, if you're chucked into a flue, that takes your mind, body and soul, and throws you down a wide wormhole, regurgitates you back in time, an ancient world that is not fine, like the one you've left behind, demons down pits you will now find, you head off in search of the evil book, the one that looks back, when you take a look, the one that bites if you come too close, the one that you should keep quite seriously closed, it's not long before the army of unfed, are on a warfront for some fattening bread, sticks and stones may break their bones, these folk are far from being quite toned.Not as good or as funny as I'd remembered it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Funny and cool!,"At the end of Evil Dead 2 Ash is sucked back in time through a time warp. He returns to medieval times where he is mistaken for the prophesied saviour.  He is sent to recover the lost Necronomicon to save the people but also return him to his own time.  Typically he makes a mistake when reading the book and he reserectes the army of the undead onto the land.  Ash must fight to defeat yet more undead fiends!The third in the series sees the gore drop off and the comedy step up even more.  The previous two were both darkly funny but this is just plain hilarious.  The sheer raft of one liners and silly/horror set ups keeps you laughing all the way.  The horror is not scary as before  mainly because the gore is gone, however I prefer this as the stop motion stuff gives it an old fashioned feel that adds to the value of it  it's hard to explain but I really enjoy this because it feels like an old Harryhausen film.Campbell is brilliant  I bet he can't believe hi s luck, the rest of his career he's struggled but Rami seem to love him.  And rightly so, he is like Jim Carrey but has so much more talent and is a classic B-movie leading man type.  The rest of the cast are so-so but really this is an one man show and he does it really well.Overall this is a great little film.  Fans of the series will love it, fans of comedy should love it and fans of B-movie cheese should enjoy it.  And the less gore means fun for all the family (almost).",,Anonymous,Horror
This has to be one of the funniest movies of all time.,"Well, at least I found it to be hilarious. I really did get into the Evil Dead series, it was so silly how it even started. I just happened to have a Blockbuster gift card and bought a pre-viewed ""Evil Dead"" and my mom had watched it with me. Strange, right? Well, because of her, I got to see one of the best movie trilogies of all time. Not to mention I couldn't believe the fan base these movies have. So it's good to know that I'm not alone.Army of Darkness starts where Evil Dead 2 left off. Ashley has now gone back in time to the mid-evil times where he has to find a way back to his time. But the people he has met through this time think that he is the one who will save them all from the evil dead. They promise to help him find a way back if he saves them. Along that journey, he meets a beautiful peasant girl, Sheila, and they have a romantic affair. Along his journey to save the people, he must retrieve the ""Book of the Dead"", but when he slurs the words and does a half assed job of it, the book rises an evil twin of Ash's and leads his Army of Darkness to destroy the village Ash has promised to save.This movie has great laughs and is a great end to this terrific trilogy.

One of the Most Entertaining Cult-Movies,"Ash (Bruce Campbell) is transported with his car to 1,300 A.D., where he is captured by Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and turned slave with Duke Henry the Red (Richard Grove) and a couple of his men. When Ash is thrown into a pit, he defeats two monsters and wins respect of Arthur's army and vassals. The Wiseman (Ian Abercrombie) points Ash as The Chosen One that will retrieve the Necronomicon but Ash is only interested in returning home. When he learns that the only way to return to his time is using the Necronomicon, Ash decides to travel to the unholy land of the Deadites. The Wiseman advises that he must say the words ""Klaatu Barada Nikto"" to safely get the evil book. However, Ash forgets the last word and an army of the dead resurrects to attack Arthur fortress and recover the Necronomicon. The battle between the living and the dead is about to start and the support of Henry the Red is the only way to help Ash and Arthur to defeat the army of darkness.""Army of Darkness"" is one of my favorite cult-movies and one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Bruce Campbell, who is one of the best actors of B-movies with Jeffrey Combs, has a fantastic performance and is hilarious. I do not know how many times I have seen this film, but today I have watched it in an excellent DVD released by the Brazilian Distributor Cult Classic, with alternative ending and four deleted scenes. The phrase that Ash is supposed to say is a tribute to the 1951 masterpiece ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"".

A Tongue-In-Cheek Film For 'Evil Dead ' Crowd,"This is the third and final installment of the ""Evil Dead"" series. Like the second in the series, it was filled with ""campy"" humor. With director Sam Raimi, you know it's done with a lot of tongue-and-check, if not totally tongue-in-cheek. If not, it would have to be classified as one of the all- time dumbest movies ever made.If it weren't the language (Bruce Campbell, in the lead, provides lots of profanity), this would be a film little kids would love with all the non-stop action and Three Stooges-like slapstick humor. The violence is so prevalent it just gets too much and the film is only 80 minutes long! The humor helps take off some of the edge of the violence.What you have is a medieval-horror-comedy film with Campbell fighting an army of skeletons, a la Jason And The Argonauts.

"Hail to the King, Baby","If you have seen the previous installments, the Evil Dead 1 and 2, you know what to expect from this movie.

I had no expectations, but right from the start of the film, it becomes clear that you are to relax, free your mind, and laugh as hard as you can.Army of Darkness has no flaws in my opinion. It is perfectly paced and this is the role Bruce Campbell was born to play. The film sets a unique tone that not many movies can. It focuses more on comedy than gore unlike it's predecessors, but it works well in it's favor.Once you watch it, you will have unlimited quotes to use with your friends.

Listen you stuffy screwheads...their names are Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell and this movie is their boomstick!,"The third time really is the charm, and ""Army of Darkness"" proves it incontrovertibly. This time, they just let the movie be what the first two movies were at heart: nice, silly, goofy, wacko, nonsensical fun. Just imagine the Three Stooges starring in a horror flick and you've got ""Army of Darkness"". The whole movie basically consists of Ash (Bruce Campbell) going after various evil spirits in the funniest way possible. And the quotes are some of the most hilarious quotes that you could ever imagine, probably mostly owing to how Bruce Campbell says them. Literally every scene is pure hilarity. Whether it's Ash showing his ""boomstick"", having trouble retrieving the book, battling mini-Ashes, or the big battle at the end, you never stop laughing yourself hoarse (I particularly liked some of the bone-related quotes). It doesn't even suffice to give this movie 10/10 stars. It deserves 100...no, a million...no, infinity out of 10 stars. Yeah, infinity out of 10 stars. Bruce Campbell not only deserves a star on the Walk of Fame, there needs to be a statue of him.Oh, and an extra note. When I went to see ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" in the theater, Bruce Campbell was supposed to be there, but had to cancel. So, there was a short clip at the beginning showing him thanking us for coming, when his phone rang: ""Hello...Oh, hi Sam. Listen, I'll get to you in a minute."" (turns to audience) ""So thanks for coming to this movie."" (retrieves his phone) ""Yeah, Sam?...""Evil Dead 4""?! I'll do it!""I just wonder how they would continue the story, now that Ash battled skeletons with his ""boomstick"".",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too silly,"I like how Sam Raimi didn't just trot out another cabin movie per the usual kind of horror film formula, and I also like how he wasn't afraid to retell the ending of the last movie when setting up this one. I really hoped to like this one more, given what I thought was a creative transition back to the year 1300. His special effect work is pretty cool as usual, and I think my favorite moments were when the false books attack. There are also all sorts of homages in here which were interesting to see, e.g. the stop motion animation work of Ray Harryhausen with skeletons in Jason and the Argonauts, Errol Flynn as Robin Hood, and the Three Stooges.For me though, it just wasn't my kind of film. It shifts the tone of the previous movies from horror/comedy, with emphasis on the horror, to action/comedy, with emphasis on the comedy - and the comedy is too damn silly for me to find funny. The film seems to go out of its way to be stupid, having the main character say cheesy lines like ""gimme some sugar baby"" before having sex with a woman he's met, and all sorts of other bits that I groaned over. The story and action scenes end up being pretty standard too, certainly not keeping up with the special effects, though I have to say, I loved the ending.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bruce Campbell in his prime,"Bruce Campbell is the absolute king of B Movies and in this movie he's in the absolute prime of his career. He's got such screen presence doing all the corny and off the wall jokes in what is the third movie of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy. The first movie was pretty much a straight up horror movie, then Evil Dead 2 while it still had a bit of true horror in it was very much a comedy film also, in Army of Darkness they go all out with the comedy. But the comedy is done tastefully and doesn't make the movie into a parody of the previous films like a lot of bad movies like Scary Movie do. Plus it doesn't hurt that they time travel back to medieval times instead of being a modern day cabin like the previous two movies were.Embeth Davidtz plays the female lead who is normally known for much more boring movies like The English Patient and what not shines in a much different role for her.

Grand finale to the Evil Dead trilogy!,"Sam Raimi is probably my favorite horror filmmaker. The excitement and over-the-top humor he brings to his horror films is just so wickedly entertaining. Army of Darkness was funnier than the first two Evil Dead films, and had a lot more comedy. It was a slam bang from the opening scene, and a perfect ending to this amazing trilogy. Bruce Campbell shows that he is the man and now on the list of my favorite movie heroes. Sam Raimi knows how to make the perfect horror/comedy and he does not fail to deliver yet again a horror film that is perhaps funnier than most comedies out there. All in all, another spectacular entry into this trilogy, and I think even better than Evil Dead 2 and on par with the first for different reasons.",,Anonymous,Horror

final chapter in the Evil Dead Trilogy but works as as a stand alone movie,"this third movie in the Evil Dead franchise is superior two the two previous movies,especially the second one,which was a pile of dreck in my opinion.this one though is very funny,and clever.it's lighter in tone.the story is much better.there are some very witty one liners.it's hard to believe this is part of the Evil dead franchise.but even if you're not familiar with the series you can still enjoy this particular film,as it works well as a stand alone movie.either way,it's a lot of fun.the only complaint i have is the length.at under 80 minutes,i found it a bit short.i think it could have been a bit longer.that's a minor issue.otherwise,i'd highly recommend it.for me,Army of Darkness is a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Most Unlikely Cultural Icon of a Movie Imaginable.,"Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness resides on a shelf alongside Metallica's ""Black"" album and Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail as required materials for 13 year-old males attempting to advance fully into puberty. Put simply, it must be watched and appreciated for male teens to fully grasp the nature of what it is to be a male teenager: cynical yet silly, horrific yet comedic, and filled with a bevy of violence and barbarism that only the middle ages and a K-Mart mock-up could provide.For those who have forgotten or never had a 13 year-old male teenage-hood, this movie can easily fail as a juvenile exercise. Those who cannot find the magic in Bruce Campbell's every glance, be it menacing, moronic, or Moe Howard-esquire will not enjoy the larger part of this movie's outflowing slapstick and zingers. And of course, anyone looking for solid character development, plot, and a great catharsis beyond ""good guy blows up bad guys"" will run screaming in fear from this film. Despite it's pseudo-independent status, it clearly doesn't fit the 'indie film' paradigm of complex, deep characters dealing with universal problems. It deals with one oaf who happens to save humanity despite his best (and hilariously accidental) efforts to the contrary.But the movie is not special only for its silly comedy. Sam Raimi, known most popularly nowadays for his work on the Spiderman series, showcases his signature style of cinematography in Army of Darkness, with unusual angles, quick-zooms, and stop-motion to create a style that is both off-settlingly jilting with the same type of jarring smoothness. The intro scene describes the book of the Necronomicon, with stop-motion animation showing words being inked into the book very jaggedly with a very scratching sound-set to compliment it. Yet at the same time it flows very fluidly, the words continuing to compile, and the scene playing out perfectly with the demonic setting. This style is perfect for the theme of the movie. His use of the steady-cam during a chase scene from the monster's point of view is admirable, as is his ability to super-impose the 'tiny' Ashes with the Big Ash as flawlessly as could have been done pre-CGI (well, except for the rather obvious ""Gulliver's Travel"" parody scene when they push closed his nostrils, which appears clearly bad).Overall, this movie is the perfect melding of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell's senses of humor and style. I think there may be no more funny facial expression in movies in the 90's than when Bad Ash suddenly is confronted with a shotgun to the nose, as Bruce Campbell's sudden bug-eyed expression drove me to howling peals the first time I saw that part. Their comic abilities create more than laughter though, they create a cultural landmark for those of us who were not quite generation X, nor generation Y, who sought identifiers as we aged. Much as generation X had the Breakfast Club, we have Army of Darkness, and for better or worse, it's helped produce a generation that mixes an admiration for both the clever and the absurd, and can understand that situations can be both frightening and funny.P.S. This movie can also serve as a social barometer for friendship. If anyone does not laugh at ""This is my BOOM STICK"", you know you should not be their friend.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Grooooovy!!!!""","One of the most unrated fantasy flicks ever made, the third part of the the EviL Dead series, Evil Dead 3 The Army of Darkness its a great, funny and unusual adventure and fantasy movie, Ash (Bruce Campell) its an over the edge character who is transported by the powers of a mysterious book, Necromicon to an medieval fantastic era. With the chainsaw in one hand and a shotgun in another, Ash fights against the evil Skeletons Army of the dark ages. Sam Raimi is a great director, the series of 3 movies: ""The Evil Dead"", ""Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn"" and "" Army of Darkness, in my opinion are his 3 master pieces.If you like ""Evil Dead 3 Army of Darkness"" i recommend:""Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn"" and ""BrainDead"".",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
In a word: awesome,"The Evil Dead series evolved from being cult, low-budget horror to comedy... medieval adventure comedy, to be precise. The first film was basically pure horror, the second was horror-comedy with a nice slice of action... now, third time around, the slice is thicker, the horror is nearly absent and we've got the all-new setting of a medieval castle instead of the secluded house in the woods. I understand that this has been met with some hostility from the fan-base... too different from the first two, they say. Interesting development, I say. With the only real changes between the films being in tone, there needs to be some genre changes and major character development. Ash is the only character who's in all the films(since he's basically the only survivor). He goes from being a dull background kind of male romantic interest and kind of coward to a bit of a tough guy in the first... in the second, he goes tougher and cooler. Here, they let tough, cool Ash roam free for a whole movie, and let me tell you, it is not boring to watch. The first film was magnificent horror, the second was pretty good horror and very cool action... how else to proceed than to basically drop the horror and go for ultra-cool action? That's what they did, and let me tell you, they most certainly succeeded. This film is even more 'guy' and entertaining than the second film, though I didn't care much for all the slapstick and Three Stooges. Ash's one-liners are multiplied from the second... there's seldom more than a few minutes without him saying something corny and really, really cool(and/or doing something of the same nature). The plot is vacant, but this is an Evil Dead flick; if you were searching for anything more advanced, you should have kept on looking. The acting is better than that of the first two. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is excellent, though a tad too much of it was slapstick, for my tastes. But when it's not, it's hilarious. The cinematography... what can I say? Raimi is a genius as far as that goes. Put that man behind a camera and he'll make dust collecting on a grandfather clock exciting to watch. The special effects are great, for what they are. The film is even more cool than the second one; remember the chainsaw? It's back. So's the shotgun. And Ash gets a new addition, too... something medieval. I won't reveal any more, but trust me, it's cool. Very. I'm very, very impressed with Raimi's vision not to mention his ability to achieve it. First he brought us a great work of horror; then a action-horror flick that rivaled the top ones in the genre; and now a medieval action-adventure. It's almost a pity that he completed the story; it would be interesting to see where else he'd take us, take Ash. What times, what genre's. But I digress. He created an amazing film here, a breathtaking atmosphere, a lot of entertainment and loads of cool action. I watched the Director's Cut of this flick, containing the so-called(and aptly named) Apocalypse Finale, after which I watched the S Mart Finale. I can definitely recommend the Director's Cut complete with its ending, but the S Mart one definitely ain't bad, either. Get it and watch it if you dug the second, or even the first. Any version. Chances are you'll love it just like I did. I recommend this to fans of the franchise, Raimi, Campbell, cool action or medieval adventures. Any guy will most likely enjoy or even love this movie. Check it out. You'll certainly not regret it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Camp Horror Classic - Close to perfection.,"Army of Darkness is one of my all-time favorites. Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi reinvent the Evil Dead series in this off-the-wall, tongue-in-cheek self-parody. Ash (Campbell) is transported to the European middle ages and must confront an army of deadites lead by his alter-ego ""Bad Ash"". Campbell's comedic acting is absolutely superb and the revamped Ashe character is an unforgettable hero and bumbler. In terms of entertainment value, AoD hits its mark perfectly - it redefines B film making by being self-consciously and intentionally hilarious. It is one of the most entertaining films in my collection.The special effects are fun, but (and everything in this film is intentional) completely and overtly ""B-film"". Every aspect of the production works simultaneously toward building the story, the characters and humor.There are many versions of this film available on DVD. If you enjoy any one of these, chances are you will enjoy the others. The only really major difference is between the theatrical release and the ""Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness"" version - which, featuring a completely different and more consistent ending, is my personal favorite. If you like this film, chances are you will want to watch it repeatedly. The Vs version also has very entertaining commentary from Campbell and Sam and Ivan Raimi.I am still hoping that the now wildly successful Sam Raimi will eventually revisit the Evil Dead series. Campbell is clearly interested in doing this, and the possibilities are certainly limitless.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Best Horror Comedy ever made!,"Evil Dead is one of the most disturbing horror movies ever made. It's perfect for a scare.

Sam Ramini has created a first rate Horror/Comedy full of loads of laughs,great action sequences,and gore.

Groovy...,"Cant say that this is the greatest comedy but I was NOT disappointed. Clearly it is not a horror movie and it has nothing to do with the first installment.

"Now Listen Up,You Primitive Screwheads...You Must Watch This Movie!!!","In the third installment of the Evil Dead Trilogy, our hero Ash is sent back in time to 1300 A.D. where he is enslaved and sent to the pit. After defeating the evil deadite that lingers in the depths of the pit, he is hailed as the chosen one. Ash, wants nothing to do with them and only wants to get back home, but the only way to do his is to retrieve the book of the dead. Unfortunately for Ash, he awakens the dead while taking the book, and now must battle the army of Darkness before he goes back to his own time.Back in the year 1981, Sam Raimi and a group of friends created one of the most terrifying horror movies to date, The Evil Dead. Again in 1987 Raimi and Co. managed to create yet another genuine horror experience with Evil Dead II. Now with the third installment in this series, Raimi gives us a comedic cult classic film that will have you quoting every piece of dialogue in your every day life.Army of Darkness is a perfect example of a cult classic. If you go walking down a street and ask if anyone has heard of it, they'll give you the crazy look. But search the net or go to any horror convention and you'll see that there are Evil Dead maniacs out there, and I am proud to say that I am one of them.Most trilogies tend to suck by the third film, Blade trinity and revolutions to name a few, but here Darkness manages to make itself a stand alone film and a fine damn one at that. It still has it's nods to the original Evil Dead, but if you're looking for the ultimate horror experience, then this film is not for you. Instead Darkness is full of comedic dialogue and actions. Our hero ASH spits out classic one-liners that so many people try to copy today...I'm looking your way Duke Nukem.Bruce Campbell is ASH. His character evolves throughout the trilogy and it's in this third installment that he is a badass. It's in this third installment that everyone remembers him from. It's in this third installment where he has the chainsaw, the boomstick, the one-liners, the sugar. Campbell will always be known for this one character. He's such a coward and yet we still feel the need to cheer him on. Campbell is the master of physical comedy and he uses it to his advantage here, fighting an army of mini ashs, splitting away from his evil self and getting his face sucked down an unknown demon hole from a book.Speaking of which, that's what makes the film even more enjoyable. It's insane bizarre comedic tone. Whether you like slapstick comedy or have a dark funny bone, this film is delightful for all. I never thought I would laugh so much at someone pouring boiling hot water down their throat. Then to have the thing grow inside of you and try to detach itself from your body, only in a movie like this can you watch that and laugh with it. Granted, it would help if you've seen the first two films and in order as well. The opening does give you a recap of what's happened, but you feel more for the film and ASH if you've been through the horrors that he has.Much like Peter Jackson got his start in the horror movie genre, so did Sam Raimi. You know, the guy that went on to direct such big hits as Spiderman and Spiderman 2. Army of Darkness has the little Sam Raimi touch with it. Once you see it you can tell that it's Raimi behind the lens. Raimi has his brothers scattered throughout the film, playing many different characters at that. As well as Three Stoogies get ups and the POV of certain objects, such as arrows being shot or forks being thrown.The effects are great and still low key. You can tell which deadites are guys in suits and the black fabric behind the eyes of other skeletons, but that's what gives this film it's cheesy B movie goodness. Seeing ASH fight against all the evil mini ashs is a feat for the eyes as well, even if it does look so fake.This is a great way to end the trilogy. I hope they do not make a fourth installment, as this is one of the greatest trilogies of all time, I'd even put it in the same sentence with Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, watch the Helm's Deep scene and tell me Jackson did not use army of Darkness as inspiration. I do not own all the DVD versions out there, which are a handful, but I do have the boomstick edition, so I'm able to enjoy the theatrical cut and the director's cut. Army of Darkness is a film that I can watch over and over and never get tired of, which is what a great fun movie should be.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Truly, a sight for sore bones!","Ha ha ha ha! This film is so silly and awesome. I love all the stop motion creatures and the the sped up film effects. Bruce Campbell is awesome. He plays the part of Ash to the hilt and you can't help but go along for the ride.The script is very funny and there's also a lot of great physical comedy, too. The skeleton army is great and I love the fact that they are slightly disgruntled.Yes, it's a homage to various other films in a way, but it's not overly reverential. It doesn't take itself too seriously and I think it's very hard to strike that balance of horror and comedy. To be fair, I would say that this is more of an adventure comedy, though.Ultimately, if you can't let go and have a blast watching this then it probably doesn't say many good things about you.""Well hello Mr. Fancy-pants!""",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Raimi and Campbell sign-off in fine style,"One reason that the Evil Dead series is such a satisfying trilogy of movies is that Sam Raimi added to the formula with each new instalment in an intelligent way. Where the first film was an out-and-out horror film, the second was a horror-comedy, while Army of Darkness was a horror-comedy-fantasy. This meant that each movie has its own distinct personality, while sharing a single core idea. With Army of Darkness, Raimi produced the most commercial entry in the series and played down the horror element in favour of fantasy battles and humour. The latter is mainly provided, of course, by Bruce Campbell. He is such an important part of this movie that it is inconceivable to imagine him not in it. Similar to his turn in Evil Dead 2, Campbell puts in a comic acting master-class. His brand of hammy acting and physical knock-about humour really has to be seen to be believed. Campbell's considerable cult reputation is hugely based on his performances in these two films; he is quite simply a revelation. Of course, Sam Raimi has to be credited too, as his kinetic style of direction is a perfect match for Campbell's over-the-top style of comic acting. Raimi remains one of the few directors who has consistently found a way of combining comedy and horror effectively. No mean feat, as all too often, despite the abundance of comedy-horrors, very rarely do they succeed in being either funny or scary.So Army of Darkness is a great way for the series to sign off. Although I think it is probably the third best of the trilogy, as I feel it runs out of steam a little once Ash has returned from his quest. At this point the film becomes basically an extended battle with the hordes of evil, which is fair enough; however, it suffers by comparison to the hilarity and invention that constitutes Ash's ill-begotten quest to find the Book of the Dead. Needless to say, Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi are in their element in this first half of the movie. While some of the special effects are looking a bit ropey nowadays, it's not a significant problem to be perfectly honest. Army of Darkness is a cult classic for good reason, and it is well worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A brilliant end to a classic trilogy.,The last film about the Demon-slashing hero breaks free from the previous genre-rules and just do as it wants. Bruce Campbell is a milestone of an actor and could carry most movies by hes own. This film is one of hes most qualitative. Tons of legendary lines and funny classic scenes that doesn't need to excuse themselves. Some creepy-looking monsters but this is a Actioncomedy Adventure in the lands of evil. The chemistry with clashes between time-cultures are one of the funniest there is. Something that was quite popular at that time. For laughs and entertainment-consideration Army of Darkness is a very solid classic. That fascinatingly enough came from a very serious Horror-film at first.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The most polished and most campy film from Sam Raimi from his Evil Dead trilogy.,"Ash (Bruce Campbell) has to fight the evil spirits again once more but this time in the medieval setting. Told by a wise man (Ian Abercrombie), Ash has to get the Book of the Dead to get back into his own time. But he has to remove the spell by saying the words ""Klauto Barado Nikto"". When Ash doesn't remember the words, he decides to steal the book and wakes up the Army of the Dead trying to get the book back. Ash has to stand up to the Army of the Dead, so he could go back in his own time with the help of King Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and his army.Directed by Sam Raimi (For the Love of the Game, The Quick and the Dead, A Simple Plan) made an entertaining sequel to the Evil Dead Series. This is the Third of the Series. This was a Box Office disappointment but when on to be successful on video and a cult favorite. This has much more humor that the first two with some good special effects. The film is never boring.The original DVD from Universal, DVD has an good non-anamorphic Widescreen (1.66:1) transfer and an decent Dolby Stereo 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD's only extras are the original theatrical trailer and production notes. Although the back of the DVD covers says it is presented in a non-anamorphic 1.85:1 Widescreen aspect ratio, which it is not true.DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.66:1) transfer and an fine digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an 20 minute Behind the Scenes featurette, Original Ending, Bios from Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell and the Theatrical Trailer. This DVD is digitally remastered in THX Picture Quality and Sound.In the limited edition and the official bootleg edition. DVD has an flawed but above average anamorphic Widescreen (1.66:1) transfer.

Trapped in time. Surrounded by evil. Low on gas,"The first two Evil Dead films are both enjoyable and fun horror movies, with Evil Dead 2 (1987) being better than the first; though the second film was more of a reboot sequel to the first, this movie is an actual sequel to the second film by connecting with its events. Army of Darkness (1992), still being a horror comedy like the second movie, is just as fun and enjoyable as the other two films, but I do think Evil Dead 2 (1987) is the best one in this trilogy. Director Sam Raimi still does a fantastic job directing, along with there being nice practical effects and makeup, cool uses of sets and props, and beneficial use of gore though there is not that much.Bruce Campbell as Ash is cool to watch, and since he is now in 1300 A. D., he uses his knowledge in the book of the dead and what is in his time to go up against the dead again to find the book of the dead and get back to his time. The rest of the cast are medieval people who are following Ash into battle against the dead army coming to attack; Ash also introduces modern weapons to the medieval army to help, but also uses old weapons, like using his chainsaw and a catapult during the battle. There is not much to say about the other characters, other than that they follow Ash despite where he comes from and how he knows certain things.The practical effects are impressive, along with uses of sets and cool looking props, like the book of the dead; the skeletons move with cool uses of stop motion, and any zombie like demons have cool makeup and effects on them. The comedy of the movie is dumb, but it does make the movie entertaining to watch, along with the action sequences being not bad with Bruce Campbell doing a respectable job in them with the stunts he does in the movie. The movie has this weird fast cinematography that was cool, especially when it has it in a first person view of what this demon entity is seeing when moving around quickly in the woods or in general when chasing someone.Army of Darkness (1992) and the other two films are all enjoyably fun and entertaining movies that people will like watching and rewatching; Bruce Campbell as Ash does a fantastic job, and he makes these movies fun to watch, along with great uses of practical effects and makeup, uses of sets, and how the movie looks with the creepy looking cinematography. I highly recommend watching this movie if you liked the other two, and if you have not seen the other two, go and give them a watch before checking out this film that completes a fun horror trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A very funny, stupid movie","From the mind that spawned Xena and Young Hercules comes a brilliant farce about a man from the 20th century hurled backwards in time and forced to destroy an ancient evil if he wants to get back home.

Army of Darkness might *look* like a poorly-made B-type movie, but that's really purely wonderful directing. It's *supposed* to look like a B movie because it engages in a lot of playful mocking of undead horror movies like ""Night of the Living Dead.""

But then my hopes weren't high when I knew Universal Studios had got their horrible mitts on it and started dictating the script and production values, culminating in a utterly typical ending!From being a truly horrifying, no-holds-barred blood and guts from the first two EV films, but polished with some brilliant dark humour and a perfectly campy role by Campbell, we end up this half-baked mix of fantasy & Arthurian legend, with little or no effective horror or gore to speak of.The sfx are not great, but neither is the script as a whole; and it all looks seriously dated and incredibly un-engaging.Campbell's charisma just about holds everything together, but the film as a whole really is a poor effort after waiting something like 5 years since the far superior Evil Dead 2 graced our screens.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Love it or hate it,"There's no in between with this movie.  No one ever says, ""Well, it's okay."" It takes a certain sense of humor to enjoy this movie, which is why it bombed at the box office, but has since earned itself a massive cult following.If you haven't seen this movie, it's basically a retelling of 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.'  To leave it at that, however, is to miss the point.  Like the previous installments of the 'Evil Dead' series, this one has copious amounts of gore, but it takes the sense of humor presented in the second film and runs with it.  The result is sort of a bloody, live-action cartoon which pays tribute to the old adventure films of times past (similarities to 'Jason and the Argonauts' should be fairly obvious).In the hands of less talented individuals, this horror/comedy/adventure combination would surely have been a disaster, but Sam Raimi's off-the-wall script and stylish direction combined with Bruce Campbell's amazing performance as Ash, make this one of the funniest movies ever made.This is without a doubt one of the most entertaining films ever, packed with enough jokes and one-liners to strangle a horse.See this movie.

Ash's relationship with Sheila is so weird, they only met like 20min ago and now they are a ""thing"". The ending was so wild and ridiculous, I'm astonished at the way they wrote this movie. The special effects are garbage, movie even has some stop motion in it. The humour is questionable, maybe it was something people found funny back in the 90s but not today.Diologue is cringe. Basically by today's standards this movie is awful but it would fly in the 90s, which it did.I wouldn't personally call it horror because they were going for more humour here but it is still considered that so whatever.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The whole movie is interesting with not one boring part at all.  It is full of everything a horror fan likes and more.  The deadites, skeletens, etc. are great looking with some awesome special effects.  It has a great plot, scares, gore, laughs, and the acting is also a plus.  With the way the movie ended, It looks like there should be a sequel, and I am hoping that SAM R. directs it with Ash starring to keep this great, entertaining series going.",,Anonymous,Horror
My least favorite of the trilogy (but still pretty awesome),"I've always liked the serious (though I use that term very loosely) aspects to the ""Evil Dead""-saga a bit more than the comedic bits, so ""Army Of Darkness"" was definitely an acquired taste for me. The first one was a pretty straight-forward horror movie, the second one cleverly mixed bone-chilling horror with comedy, but this one is just pure slapstick. And to be honest, I still don't know how to feel about that. I laughed a lot during this movie and some scenes are just incredibly inventive (Ash fighting his evil clone has got to be the highlight), but on the other hand things are getting really self-aware now. The second one was already the sheer definition of tongue-in-cheek, but at the same time it never felt forced. This one does, mainly because Ash is such a cartoon character here. 80% of what he says is supposed to be a clever one-liner, which gets a little tiresome by the end. On the other hand though, are B-movies that much less entertaining if you know the makers are in on the joke? I wouldn't say so, and ""Army Of Darkness"" is a movie that's just impossible to hate. It's a dude with a chainsaw fighting zombies in a medieval castle, what flaws can a movie like that really have? ""Groovy""!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ha Ha Horror, very good","To summarize. a little more plot, and tongue-in-cheek humor (or in this case, out of cheek), makes Army of Darkness not only the best in Sam Raimi's series, but one of the best comedic horrors. With the first Evil Dead, the gore got too distracting, with the second, the humor was fine but there was practically no plot. Army of Darkness balances all the elements just right. It offers goofy fun, and a satisfactory form of closure to the series.We pick up from where we left off in Evil Dead II. Ash has been transported back to Medieval Europe. In the course of eighty quirky minutes he goes from being one of King Arthur's chained slaves to the leader of his army. According to the prophecy of the book of the dead, he is destined to save mankind from the army of darkness. Which he does, before getting transported home.I actually found myself laughing aloud quite frequently, and with the possible exception of 'Lake Placid', I don't think any horror movie has done that to me. Even from the opening shot, which is comical, you know right away that this is going to be a fun movie. This is Sam Raimi at his best. Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Three Stooges Meet Evil Dead,"Ash is back, but this time, horror takes a backseat to comedy as our hero finds himself on a whimsical time travelers adventure. Slightly rewriting the end of Evil Dead 2, Ash is now a prisoner instead of the leader, but his antics quickly earn him respect once again. While this is far from the horror of the first 2, it does a great job pivoting into more of an adventure film. The story is fun and Bruce Campbell is having a blast galavanting around the middle ages, destroying the dead. With slapstick comedy throughout, it does get a little exhausting and the Three Stooges level jokes often fall flat. When the jokes land they're very funny, but when the humor is reduced to elongated slapstick scenes, it starts to feel like it's losing it. As a whole, the story, acting, and action triumph over the lackluster comedy and this is another wacky chapter in the story of Ash vs. The Evil Dead.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Gleeful, fun, wicked halloween perfection","To tangentially discuss the film: this is the type of film that makes me question how one should review movies. Should it be objective ie solely focused on the technical aspects and an honest assessment of character development? Should the reviewer try to objectively detach oneself from one's genre preferences? To what degree are ratings comparable across genres? Perhaps I'm being too pedantic and criticizing the rating (rather than the review). But, for example, I recently reviewed the Bronx Tale; that film perhaps has 'loftier' ambitions than Army of Darkness, but it utterly fails to live up to those ambitions. Whereas Army of Darkness knows, and it genuinely knows, it is a zany Halloween, horror comedy set in medieval times. I mean, man, is this film an energetic pump. It's wild, it's wicked, it's whacked...some of the slapstick is better than any movie with modern technology I've seen in recent years from horror movies, or in comedy movies.Army of Darkness deviates from its predecessors by not genuinely being a horror movie, but having horror elements; not being a comedy, but having rad comedic elements; not being a true fantasy tale, but having fantastical elements...and yet Raimi somehow blends them effortlessly for a film that is a shock to the system.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not the best ""ED"", but still fun.","First off, Bruce ""Ash"" Campbell is one of the coolest guys on this planet. If you need a reason to watch this movie, he's it.I would describe this movie as a Roller-coaster-ride. Its lots of fun with some good action and hilarious one-liners. The one thing this movie lacks is HORROR. The original Evil Dead and its sequel got some good old fashion horror. This one is more of a mix between slapstick and ""Jason and the Argonauts"". I would have liked to see some more gore in this third installment.""Army of Darkness"" is a very entertaining movie, from the beginning to end but it's not as dark and gory as the first two films.There's a Director's Cut available (including the original ending) which hasn't much to offer in my opinion.

Ash is the Heart of Evil Dead,"Whether you watch the entire trilogy every month or only watched this movie because a friend made you, you can pretty much agree that the thing that is really driving the movies is the character of Ash. At the beginning of the story Ash is the calm simple person that we all are (the S-mart employee in this movie) but as the story progresses, he transforms into the chainsaw wielding ultimate badass with a sawed off shotgun that we all wish we could be. The character of Ash is in his prime from the point he says Groovy in Evil Dead 2 until the point he says Groovy in Army of Darkness when he replaces his chainsaw with a metallic hand. The chainsaw hand and the sawed off shotgun are a large part of the character of Ash. So why does Sam Rami decide to give Ash his hand back and make him fight with medieval weapons in Army of Darkness. With out the Ash from the first Evil Dead movies, Army of Darkness seems to be almost a different genre of movie. The final battle seems to be more like Jason and the Argonauts than Evil Dead. Still the movie is not without its moments. The first encounter between Ash and Badash one of my most memorable. (This one actually does involve the use of a shotgun) Also everyone knows the Boomstick line. (I went to high school with kids who could recite the entire monologue) All in all the film is a good one. It is very funny and deserves the cult status that it has achieved in this day and age. Although I personally wanted to see more of Ash in action, I guess I will just have to pray for Evil Dead 4.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

'Army of Darkness',"'Army of Darkness' represents a stylish kick-ass finale for the memorable 'Evil Dead' series. The second 'Dead' movie left off with Ash (Bruce Campbell) accidentally being transported to the 13th century by evil forces. You can watch 'Darkness' without having watched the first two as it does provide a quick recap of the events in the first two 'Dead' movies.In order to get back to the present time, Ash must retrieve the 'Necronomicon' (the book of the dead). But in a rather funny turn of events, Ash must also destroy an army of the dead with the help of a medieval kingdom.  What follows is more fun fight sequences which would rival those of the hilarious second 'Dead' movie. Here, Ash is now made to be more of a larger-than-life hero and Campbell has some fun with the role, getting in plenty of one-liners and plays his psycho to the max.  Director Sam Raimi keeps the movie short, so there is never a dull moment. 'Hail to the king, baby!'Rating: (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Definitely not your usual horror film,"Seemingly made as something of a throw-away (the film appears to have been made fairly quickly, and with tongues in both cheeks), this film manages to parody contemporary sci-fi fantasies and horror movies, while providing some scary moments of its own. (The tiny Bruce Campbell clones are silly and amusing, but they're also creepy and unpredictably nasty.) Clearly intended as the ""Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" of B-movies, what's surprising is how successful it is in accomplishing this. This super-market-budget medieval post-Modern reality has its own inner logic and plays it out faithfully and with élan.You don't have to be a genius to like this film; but if you are a genius, you shouldn't feel guilty liking this film, either. It's both simple and direct, but clever and witty; this makes it work on a number of levels, which most films of this type cannot even aspire to.As for Bruce Cambell - he not only turns in a great performance, but does so playing a regular guy who happens to get smart and courageous when he has to - a real hero for an unheroic age.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Groovy!,"My Take: Some of the slapsticks may grate, but the film is still manic and wildly original.Sam Raimi has never really been one of my favorite directors, but I've got to admit about how stylish he often is when it comes to making his movies. ARMY OF DARKNESS is the third film in the EVIL DEAD series, and since I haven't seen the first two yet, I'm reviewing simply this film, without making references or comparisons to its predecessors. But ARMY OF DARKNESS still does fill the void for those who might not seen the first film, therefore free from confusion.The film isn't related to its predecessors either. For, while the first two films are more of horror films (or a satire of horrors), this one is also an old-fashioned sword-and-sorcery film, complete with cheesy (intentional) dialog and swashbuckling battle scenes. The good thing about it is that Raimi takes it all less seriously, and producing a number of hilarious bits as well.Bruce Campbell reprises his role as the chainsaw-armed store clerk Ash, who is whisked into the Dark Ages, facing rival kingdoms and the army of the dead along the way. To get him back home, he must retrieve the Necronomicon, the cursed Book with the Dead, which can also prevent a small kingdom from being invaded by the ""Deadites"". It ends up with a final confrontation against the army of Deadites when they are awakened by their lust to get the Book of the Dead back.Cheesy isn't it? But that's just the point. ARMY OF DARKNESS aims for a mockery, and it does a great job and rewards greatly. It's a lot of fun, with lots of in jokes and its own jokes, thanks greatly to the presence of Bruce Campbell, he's effectively funny. The 'low-budget' special effects are fun, and if you think they look cheesy, try saying that to the great Ray Harryhausen, which these effects pay homage to.ARMY OF DARKNESS is filled with dozens of slapstick humor and lack a number of smarter wit, but even so, it's a lot of fun and craziness. Viewers, including eventual fans of the director, will enjoy the films craziness and wit, but more on the macabre style that took to create it. It's an all special effects extravaganza, but not without being an imaginative one.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Evil Dead 2 was better, but this one is also very good.","The third installment in the Evil Dead trilogy, this movie is not as good as the second one but is still very, very very funny. The special effects are fantastically bad, but that makes it even funnier. Some moments are so stupid and illogical, you will be laughing so hard your belly will hurt. Some of these moments include when Ash(the hero) uses a shotgun almost like an automatic riffle, when his medieval girlfriend(her name is SHEILA, which I don't think existed during that era...) is captured by a flying monster, which looks like what it is: an actor in a cheap costume. Also, Ash speaks only in one-liners. Examples: ""Good, bad, I'm the one with the gun..."", and the classic "" Take that, you She-Bitch"". Overall, this movie is an horror/comedy that focuses much less on the horror part than Evil Dead 2. It's VERY funny, and also much better than recent rip-offs which targeted the teen audience like Idle Hand.7 out of 10. The second one is better but this one is also very good.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Loads of Fun but Super Rushed,"I didn't have a whole lot of expectations for this movie. All I knew was that it was a really good comedy, which after watching I can verify that.Army of Darkness isn't a horribly plot-driven movie. It's clear that the humor is the primary focus, and it does it quite well. The plot never stood out as being particularly bad or horribly rushed because it was very clear that that was the intention. But nevertheless, it was still did feel rushed at points and some parts felt like they could have been drawn out a bit more.The characters aren't anything worth mentioning. The main character just exists for cheesy one-liners, and everyone else just to provide information on the plot. Once again, it's clear that this is the intention and for the most part it works pretty well.The humor in the movie is great. It's full of goofy stuff from the 1990s, as well as lots of great cheesy moments. It's often over the top to the point of goofiness, and everything else is just as goofy, especially the one-liners.Overall Army of Darkness is a whole lot of fun to watch. While it's not superb, it's very intentional, and its obvious that this is the case. In the end I'd certainly recommend this movie to anyone simply looking to zone out and have a good time, because this movie is just that.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is terrible. How is this considered a classic?,"I love all the other films in the Evil Dead series, but there's no getting around the fact that this one just sucks. I get the feeling that anybody who considers this film a ""classic"" either saw it when it came out and enjoys it purely for the nostalgia, or was raised by one of these people and forced to watch it over and over again until they felt the same way as their mentally challenged parent and/or guardian.The ""comedic"" aspects are borderline-retarded slapstick that are the cinematic equivalent of a man making funny faces to amuse a newborn child, the ""action"" sequences are aggressively tepid and hardly worth watching, and the only ""horror"" to be found here is the aforementioned horrifically unfunny ""jokes"".And it's not even that I don't enjoy unrefined humor, at east when it's done well. It's just that seeing a man make funny faces and voices while getting hit in the face... isn't funny.Some of the other reviewers noted that this film as a ""copious amount of gore"", which sincerely makes me wonder if they watched the same movie that I watched. There's practically none here at all compared to the first two films.Anybody who says that this is the ""best film in the series"" deserves to be rounded up by secret police and summarily executed in front a firing squad to protect the general public.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I'm not sure what this is supposed to be, but I like it!","I must say this film surprised me. The Evil Dead was one of the creepiest and scariest fantasy horror movies I've ever seen. Evil Dead 2 was also scary but had a little dark humour in it. Army of darkness however, is just pure fun. I don't know why Sam Raimi made it this way, I guess he was tired of making scary movies, but liked the character to much. And let's be honest, Bruce Campbell is awesome, who would want to watch him tackle demons and monsters over and over again.I guess the only thing I didn't like about this movie, was it's lack of continuity. Weapons kinda appeared out of nowhere and Ash never seemed to run out of bullets. but then again it's not exactly a serious movie so maybe they didn't really care. I'm not really complaining, I loved this movie.Although Army of Darkness kinda focuses on slapstick humour, it still fits well into the trilogy. There are still deadits and the Necrocromicon is as annoying as always. They've just tuned down the blood and gore. And since Ash after being beaten up in the two prequels, is mow worthy of the title action here. He knows all their tricks, he's not scared anymore, and let's face it, he's not very afraid of pain anymore. I mean he did cut off his own hand in Evil Dead 2.So Ash is tougher than ever, and the deadits are quite that scary when your not trapped in an small cabin anymore. For it's minor flaws and hilarious story, I give this movie an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Purposely terrible one liners, unique slapstick action scenes and retro special effects make this a great time.","The ""Evil Dead"" trilogy has to be the most diverse trilogy ever created. The first movie was sort of funny, but it was a genuine horror movie. The second film still had the same creepy sets and horror elements from the first film, but was much more comical. The acting was extremely over the top as were many of the scenes, such as the hilarious laughing scene. Then we get to ""Army of Darkness"". All the horror from the series is gone, and the slapstick comedy introduced in the second film is prevalent.Ash (Bruce Campbell) was the only survivor from the last film and he has landed in a time warp in the 13th Century. In order to get back to his own time he must recite a phrase and find Necronomicon, the book of the dead, and it ends in war between the living and the ""Deadites"".This is not an original movie in any way, and if not looked at as purposely bad, this will be viewed as bad. The script is full of some truly awful one liners, such as ""Give me some sugar baby!"", many uses of the phrase ""Groovy."", and dozens more terribly hilarious lines. The action scenes here seem very Three Stooges inspired, from the slaps to the face and the blocking of the pokes to the eyes, to the cuckoo clock sound effects used when Ash is a little out of it. The villains are not as menacing as in the last movies because they all are comical, but this is not a complaint. The light tone of the movie makes the lines funnier and the movie enjoyable.If you enjoy silly comedies and/or slapstick comedies, then you will probably love this.

A Horror Movie That Backfired And Still Got The Point Across,"Army of Darkness qualifies itself, at least to what I believe, to be at the beating heart of all cult fanaticism. This legendary movie, equal yet still somewhat separate from the Evil Dead movies before it may seem to be nothing more than an outdated film with excessive amounts of cheese now, but beneath that lies a message that's actually innocent and light-hearted; not to mention, the years of horrible horror movies to follow the Evil Dead series would make Army of Darkness into an accidental parody, as well.As the story goes, it follows Ash, played by the now endeared-to-a-generation Bruce Campbell as the sole living survivor of an attack by demons and darkness, ""deadites"", on a cabin in the secluded woods. As he thinks he's safe, the darkness of the necronomicon - a book of evil incantations and summonings bound in flesh and inked blood - returns to pull Ash back into the middle ages amidst a somewhat confused war during the increasing gravity of the evil and deadites on their land. However, instead of being treated as a saviour or wizard, he's instantly bound and thrown into battle with a deadite in true Roman arena fashion. Of course, he has a chainsaw for a hand, man. And he's Ash. He defeats the deadite and in Indiana Jones' manner, pulls himself from the pit he's thrown into, and the hilarity ensues: ""...Shop smart. Shop S-Mart. YOU GOT THAT?!"" It's one-liner after glorious Ash/Campbell one-liner as he ventures to retrieve and hold the necronomicon away from and invading horde of deadites and skeletons, as well as an evil Ash.As amazing as the plot sounds, and the fine points in between that progress the story, watching the movie is a completely different experience. I only wish I wasn't five at the time so I could've enjoyed it in the all-encompassing encapsulation of a theater. You can tell from the first few minutes re-summarizing the nights before that this movie is no modern-day Matrix. The DVD featurettes say the movie was filmed with a revolutionary film technique called Introvision, but referring to the movie, you'd probably just laugh again, however it's actually one of the strengths of the movie. With modern-day horror films, there's a tremendous over-doing of ""deaditting."" Cutting and chopping a movie to make it appear scary but shoving in loud and obnoxious sound-bytes of single or few-frame splices of a catastrophe, or a contorted face, or... you get the picture. This, in and of itself, was actually one of the accidental parodies I was mentioning earlier. Whereas now, the somewhat dated special effects definitely appeal to the atmosphere of the movie, it's become sort of an inadvertent shot at the lackluster horror movies of today, but manages to add in insult by having such a sense of humor with such an original storyline.And of course, no actor could've pulled the part better than Bruce Campbell. The Hollywood cult-extra, he's appeared in so many things as a usually arbitrary character that you don't seem to notice him. However, no one else could've done Ash like Bruce Campbell did. He bleeds personality and there's not a single moment of the movie that isn't funny in some way, shape or form, and it's largely due to him. Not only did his facial expressions and idiosyncrasies seem almost pre-destined for this movie, but the Bruce Campbell voice is just unmistakable and his delivery defines deadpan. Simple one-liners had me on the floor just because of the amazing delivery.And of course, underneath all that's going for this movie lies its beating heart, which most people don't seem to get up-front. It's a message that the 90's, dawn of apathy in America, still has a heart that can be as light as the days that people were young. Sure, not all of the humor is all-audience, but the same token, it's not in the same league comedies like Airplane! and Top Gun were. It was more exposing the beating heart underneath the dead skin by going back to a more slap-stick and motional style of humor. When Ash is in the graveyard getting the Stooges treatment by the skeletons, it's impossible not to laugh just because of nostalgia. It's one of the few movies where the humor is as much in how the characters talk and act as what they say and do.As time goes on and horror movies get shittier, Army of Darkness embeds itself further as a gem amongst American cinema and cements Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell into movie history as a visionary and a genius.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hilarious and Entertaining,"This was a hilarious and entertaining movie.  I can honestly say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  This is one you want to get when you think you want to see a scary movie, but really want to see a funny movie.  The medieval premise was genius, and really added to the feel.

Should have been called The Midevil Dead!,"Sam Raimi's third entry in the Evil Dead series is this cool combination of his wild humor and action.After the chaos of Evil Dead II, Ash has been hurled back into the dark ages where he must once again battle the evil dead as a knight.Perhaps the most hilariously over-the-top of Raimi's horror comedies, Army of Darkness is a truly unique and ever-entertaining oddity. Raimi keeps to his beloved slap-stick comedy through out the film, giving us plenty of gruesomeness and laughs to go with it! There's lots of well-directed action and inventive camera work to keep the excitement high. The special FX are fairly well-done, such memorable creations as the 'split' personality of Ash, the aggressive necronomicon, and the army of skeletons.Bruce Campbell returns as Ash, and shows off his heroic macho side, while he does plenty of the great physical comedy.

Worthy finishing touch to the trilogy.,"Sam Raimi lowers the quality a bit in this film that ends the trilogy of his films based on the Necronomicon. In this particular case there is an exaggerated tendency towards comedy where the balance is lost and finally there are just glimpses of the good horror to which we were used to. However, there are many references to old movies through famous dialogues, characteristic scenery and various details and homages where even the Three Stooges are recognized. The film is entertaining and gives a worthy finishing touch to a series of films that could have continued if it had had a different tone.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Ash, a superb Bruce Campbell, must fight his evil self to defeat the Army of the Dead and return back in his time. Along this voyage, you see reference to Harryhausen, Spielberg, Frankenstein, Day the Earth stood still, even Dr.Cyclops and the incredible shrinkink Man. All in this movie works perfectly.

"Not as good as the first two, but a still hilarious","This film is the continuation of the first evil dead movies (although it is supposed to be a stand-alone movie). This time, Ash goes to the medieval ages and must return to modern times.This movie is much more concentrated on slapstick than it is on gore, which was a little bit of a downer to me because I do like my gore from Evil Dead 2. But I suppose it was done on purpose because it is supposed to be different from the other Evil Dead movies.Bruce Campbell as always, gives an amazing performance as the tortured Ashley Williams. The effects, are on point, just cheesy enough to provoke a laugh. I also love evil Ash as the villain of the film.One thing to mention is that in my opinion, this movie has the best one-liners from the whole Evil Dead series (except ""groovy"" and ""eat this"" from the second one).I do not have a lot of problems with the film, it is just what it needs to be. A fun continuation of the Evil Dead series. I am giving it a 7/10 because this movie fails to do something different for the genre or do something mind-blowing like the first two.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Klaatu, Barada, Nickleback!","I know that people love this movie but allow me to speak some truth. The truth is that Ash has about as much appeal as reusable toilet paper. Ash is just an ashhole. Yes, I said it! An epic chin and epic appendage does not a hero make. When a girl makes a blanket for him, he doesn't even say thanks. He's a loud-mouthed braggard with a boomstick and he deserves every bit of beating he gets from his mini-me parasites. And btw, there's nothing funny about Badash singing little goody two shoes. But let's talk about the plot. Things take a turn for the worse for Ash when life sucks him back to the medieval era of primitive screwheads who capture him and throw him into a blood-spewing hole of wicked back flippers and growling ghouls. Luckily he and his chainsaw arm make it out alive and the adventure continues. Dare I say the only part of this movie that is truly unmissable is the final battle between the living and the dead. And holy Harryhausen is it a visual feast! You see, long before Viggo, Lego and Dwarf summoned an army of dead to fight Mordor, there was another morbid mass of muertas who had a bone to pick. Bonepipers lead the way and a skeleewag plays a femur flute as the Deadite army close in on the castle. What follows is a mix bag of mayhem that will make you smile.

Army of Darkness,"""Ash"" (Bruce Campbell) is a bit of a loud-mouth hardware salesman who somehow manages to get himself, and his car, transported back seven hundred years and into a mediaeval combat zone! ""Lord Arthur"" (Marcus Gilbert) is his new master and together with his fellow prisoner ""Duke Henry the Red"" (Richard Grove) is soon facing doom at the bottom of a deadly pit! Luckily, he has a few useful things in the boot of his car, and the timely use of a chainsaw helps him escape and become the designated saviour who will retrieve the ""Necronomicon"". His quest will involve a treacherous journey through the land of the ""Deadites"" in search of a sacred book. Only the immortal words of Michael Rennie himself: ""Klaatu Barada Nikto"" can save the day... Well, needless to say, none of this grand plan actually works. He forgets half of his magic phrase and only succeeds in resurrecting a somewhat narked army of dead folks who are determined to lay siege to their castle and retrieve the book for themselves. Enemies soon become friends, arrows become strapped to dynamite, trebuchets start lobbing high explosives and all are now hoping to defeat, well, the already dead! This actually benefits hugely from not having a star. The whole ensemble cast join in to create a quickly paced, ""Camelot"" style action adventure that borrows heavily from twentieth century references (I'm sure the script has a bit of Jack Hawkins from ""Ben Hur"" here too) and Ian Abercrombie does a fine job as the wiseman. There's plenty of pyrotechnics and swordplay, a generous amount of rather daft humour and, for my money, is one of Sam Raimi's better, more entertaining features. Derivative? Yes - it is, but that doesn't stop it being an enjoyable romp through history and legend that is well worth an afternoon in front of the telly.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Delightfully Tacky,"This movie was so tacky, so repulsive, so brainless, that is was beautiful. If taken seriously may leave the wrong impression.  This film is the pure definition of a Cult Film, and was probably one of the most enjoyable experiences of poor taste in all of my 19 years.  You'll laugh so hard, you'll scream, you'll scream so hard you'll laugh.  If you like this film, then of course see its predecessors the ""Evil Dead"" flicks.

Ash Visits the Middle Ages and Traces a Familiar Arc,"Following an abrupt leap through time and space at the climax of Evil Dead II, harassed horror hero Ash Williams finds himself stranded in the Middle Ages. There, sword-wielding knights admire his shotgun, unkempt villagers ogle his Oldsmobile and learned village elders are dazzled by the science textbooks stuffed in his trunk. Pulled into a conflict between neighboring kingdoms, Ash unmasks their common enemy (an evil zombie horde), proves he's adept at the art of decapitation and agrees to stem the flow of marching dead at its source: a lost magical text dubbed Necronomicon.Despite the differences in setting and scale, that's a pretty similar premise to the first two films. Fight wicked dead things, discover cursed book bound in flesh, recite demonic incantations and smash the big boss. This shouldn't be surprising, as the second film was already little more than a polished re-telling of the first with a few extra nods, winks and evil, disembodied hands. And besides, no one really watches a Sam Raimi zombie movie for the plot, do they? This particular variety of cult-friendly jam is all about the insanely wacky scenarios, goopy creature effects and egregiously bad dialogue, as wrangled and amplified by its granite-jawed leading man, Bruce Campbell.In this third installment, Campbell again dominates the screen, one-upping his solo performance with the prop hand by playing both hero and villain, not to mention a dozen itty-bitty munchkin versions of himself in the loony funhouse scene that anchors the second act. He's the lifeblood of the film, striking badass pinup poses, glistening through all the action scenes, delivering a fiery speech or two and spitting enough hilariously awful catchphrases to be borderline unhealthy. Seriously, how did he keep a straight face through all of this?As a no-holds-barred playground for one specific actor (and/or one specific type of fan), Army of Darkness hits the mark. It may not be quite as much fun as its predecessor - the medieval setting makes for an awkward fit amidst all the schlocky horror themes - but that certainly doesn't mean it's no fun at all. A proud example of loose, silly, uncensored pulp that knows better than to overstay its welcome.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the best comedy,"Frankly I love this movie with all sorts of fun stuff. I have enjoyed other Evil Dead series and this one is the last one for Ash to battle against evil deadites although the film plot goes in a somewhat different way from other two series. Perhaps the Army of Darkness, Evil Dead3, could be a comic and adventure film rather than horror. The amount of gore and violence is much less than the other two sequels. In particular, the army of the dead at the end of the movie reminds me of seeing an old classic legend. Besides this, the Army of Darkness is overall too funny and humorous to be a single horror flick like Evil Dead and Evil Dead II but this black comedy is surely nice to enjoy at home",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The alternate ending on the DVD is great, much better than the original ending.

A fun kick in the arse.,"We ran across this flick sometime in the 90s on a movie channel.Had no interest really. Not a fan of horror. Watched the first few minutes and I was hooked. Why? Because it was funny from the get-go.Didn't know who Bruce Campbell was. But, he is funny. Droll, whimsical, off-beat. Heck? You pick the adjective and it will probably fit in one way or another.Story was pretty good. Simply, it's a story of a man, lost in time, willing to do whatever it takes to find his way back home.It's curious how non-horror fans find it palatable as long as there's humor. In fact, the (what should be), scary stuff, is fodder for most of the comedy. I'm an old guy, but even when I was younger, I had no taste for horror really. At least horror with the undead, zombies & the like. I mention it because movies like The Fly, Aliens, etc.; are often categorized as such, but bear no likeness to the former.Anyway, for me, the funniest part of Campbell, is his impatience with the medieval ""screw heads"" he must endure.Most of the movie revolves around what our star must endure as he follows the rules of the Necronomicon. Again, there's comedy in every scene. Campbell is pretty good as a comic, and better as a comedian. Each time he's frustrated/physically hurt, and/or just PO'd, he's pretty funny. A vulnerable tough guy who is plenty dumb enough to get himself into bad jams.Anyway, I scored it pretty high for its fantasy, adventure and especially, it's (often cornball), comedy. It's actually an easy watch.Okay, enough said. Without the comedy, I'd have no use for it whatsoever, which is another way of saying, the entire movie is filled with varying degrees of comedy, much of it corn, little of it intellectual. But that's ok.Hope y'all enjoy.Thx

More Comedy slapstick than Horror,"Army of Darkness continues right from get go of Evil Dead II (which was hinted earlier in that movie) Showing our hero Ash hurdled into the dark ages; battling demons and beasts head on- promising a truly unique piece to a horror comedy trilogy.But that's not exactly what we get. While it's still unique it fails to live up to the evil dead name.And the main reason is: 1)The writers/director ran out of ideas. And forced to say"" Screw it!"" and changed the whole direction of the trilogy. 2)it's extremely low in quality.The story and film itself completely takes the high road, making Ash a completely different character with a macho personality and cheesy one liners in his place- He is the savior who doesn't give a ****. And that's funny and interesting but where the movie falls apart is how the movie stops any attempt at being scary or original in any sense and puts jokes and slapstick in it's place. And leaves you with a result of the three stooges mixed with Monty Python's Holy Grail. Which is a let down compared to the other 2.As for quality: I'm talking chopped scenes, with slowed and speed up frames, bad stop motion, walmart costumes and green screens.Which is very messed up because it's budget is more than 4X(13 mil) more than it's previous(3 mil) but looks half the amount. I honestly don't know how this movie was rated R because there is zero amount of gore or scary in this film.What there is to like about this film is that it's very quotable and memorable andvery self aware of it's flaws-making it relevant in a cult film sense and becomes a so bad it's great schlock fest.

Not so great,"I seem to be on an endless search for a great horror movie. It is almost inevitable that a horror on IMDb scores between 3 and 6 out of 10, yet here we are with an old classic at 7.6. Anything that gets a 7 on IMDb is usually worth a watch for the unprejudiced!How disappointed was I... It's not a real horror, of course, it is a comedy with horror aspects. I really only raised a smile once or twice during viewing, which destroys the comedy aspect. The acting wasn't great, there wasn't much of a story and the effects on 1992 don't translate particularly well.It's probably harsh to judge a movie 20 years on. After all, some real horror classics which rate even higher than this from even earlier are un-watchably poor.All of that aside, this just isn't a great film. It's a silly film with no great story, acting, emotion, anything. Its just something to watch for an hour and a half. It never deserves above a 7 and fits perfectly with the rest of the genuine horror movies at about a 5 or 6.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The funniest, yet driest, of the series","Still trapped in the medieval assault, Ash leads the fight against the awakened Deadite army looking to retrieve the captured Necronomicon he needs to return back to his present time.Overall there's not a whole lot really wrong with this one. Obviously one of the best qualities present in this one is the utterly uproarious comedy here as there's a noticeable shift away from a Horror/Comedy into a Comedy with Horror elements. Many of the film's best scenes come from the film's supposedly creepy scenes that instead offer up truly gut- busting laughs, as the scenes of him with the group at the pit after defeating the witch and the deformity there, the goofiness of how he deals with the possessed villager in the castle and the first battle here all manage to go for the comedy rather than the scares here despite all of them appearing to be set-up as horror-based scenes either featuring solid slapstick or hilarious one-liners. The hilarity continues on for two of the funniest, most laugh-out-loud moments in the genre where this one really earns itself the best marks as the battle with the mini-Ash's in the windmill offers plenty of full-scale gags, just utter creativity in the unique situations required to pull them off and a relentless attitude that sends them careening off at such a speed that there's no rest in between the next one. There's also the other big scene of the graveyard resurrection after taking the book through dubious means allows for the glorious wordplay and even better physical gags here that really cement this one as a full-on comedy. It goes on into a comedic Action/Fantasy epic with the finale being the Deadite Army leading the raid on the castle as the defense tactics produce some amazing action, the swordplay makes for a truly enjoyable time and the entire scene is truly a lot of fun as there's the use of more modern warfare and tactics against the traditional swordplay here featured together for a ground time in this section of the film. It also continues on with the typical possession here with some truly fantastic scenes involving the deranged ghouls that showcase the spectacular make- up that this one's been known for as there's the zombie skeleton-like Deadites and the seriously deformed and rotting ghoul featured here with the witch which mall manages to featured something here with the comedy, the action and adventure parts of the film to give this one enough positives to hold out as one of the better efforts in the genre. About the only thing truly wrong here is the own individual reaction to it all who may see it all as too much of a shift in story focusing on the comedy instead of the horror, but that has nothing to do with the movie itself. Otherwise, this is a flawless movie.Rated R: Language, Graphic Violence, a brief shadowy sex scene and Brief Nudity.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The movie may not have horror in it but as a comedy it does great, its very funny with plenty of great laughs. In the movie Bruce Campbell's acting is still the same and Ash is still our lovable protagonist. The whole time there is many great and interesting cinematography and POV shots, a main staple of the series. Army of Darkness is missing one major thing: the gore is gone, I was very disappointed by this but after multiple viewings I've learned to live with it. The humor of the movie is set up like a three stooges skit with lots of slapstick jokes. One thing that sticks in my mind is the final battle between the kingdom and the army of the dead. It's fun and funny with plenty of Ray Harryhausen inspired effects.

"Enjoyable, just don't tell anyone.","Have you ever gone to a movie and completely enjoyed yourself with all the action, comedy and romp only to leave the theatre thinking that you may not even give the movie a thumbs- up if you were asked for your opinion? That is exactly the situation I found myself in after watching Sam Raimi's third installment of the Evil Dead series, Army of Darkness.Army of Darkness picks up where Evil Dead II left off 5 years earlier. Ashley J. Williams (or 'Ash' as we have come to know him) has been transported back to 1400 A.D. where he must continue to fight for his survival and deliver the people from the evil Deadites. Armed with a shotgun and a chainsaw arm (this may sound incredibly ridiculous if you have not seen the second installment), Ash is prophesized to deliver the Necronomicon, or Book of the Dead, which will rid the English townspeople of the walking dead and return Ash back to 1993 so that he can continue as a clerk at the local S-Mart.As odd or downright foolish that the plot may sound, Sam Raimi (Spider-Man) does a good job of keeping us entertained with a balanced mix of slapstick comedy and outlandish gore. Bruce Campbell (Ash) doesn't take himself too seriously and the results include such laughable quotes as 'Oh you little b**tards! Alright, I'll crush each and every last one of ya! I'll squash you so hard you'll have to look down to look up!'. These types of verbal exchanges definitely lighten the tone from the heavy blood soaked Evil Dead I and II entries.But what ultimately makes Army of Darkness so sinfully enjoyable is watching all the fun Campbell and Raimi seem to be having with the character and the notion of a self-centered fool using his 20th century knowledge in 15th century Europe. Whether it is Ash building himself a new arm or uttering modern day witticisms ('Gimme some sugar, baby.'), the movie never takes itself too seriously and that is most of the fun.In terms of special effects, the movie has both the best and the worst of what technology had to offer in the early 1990's. A scene where the army of the dead storms the castle is an ode to Jason and the Argonauts and the splendid work of effects master Ray Harryhausen. It is well crafted and choreographed and hi-light of the films effects. On the very opposite end of the scale is the scene in which Mini-Ashes run amok over the full sized Ash, jumping into his mouth, sticking him with a fork.you get the idea. The Mini-Ashes look like they were from a completely different film and the whole chapter on the DVD should be avoided if possible.So now I come back full circle with my initial statement. I enjoyed viewing Army of Darkness, and am embarrassed because of it. The humor is definitely adolescent, but you feel like a diabetic enjoying a chocolate bar, savoring the taste and hoping no one witnesses your satisfaction. Sam Raimi, who also helmed Darkman, does his best with an $11 million budget (his later $139 million budget for Spider-Man showed his true genius), and you can image by the energy exerted in such a preposterous storyline, that the cast and crew had oodles and oodles of fun during production.

A huge departure of the franchise....and a welcome one.,"I sat down tonight and watched the first three movies in this Sam Raimi horror series, ""The Evil Dead"", ""Evil Dead II"" and ""Army of Darkness"". Each has its own charm and the third film is a huge departure from the first two films in many ways. But what is interesting is that although the films were made over a 11-12 period, it's actually one continuous story...which each new film picking up where the previous one ended.At the end of ""Evil Dead II"", Ash (Bruce Campbell) is transported back to the year 1300...and that's exactly where this one picks up. Apparently, Ash needs to find the ""Necronomicon"" and it will enable him to return to the present day. But there is a huge problem. After he gets the help of the locals, Ash is a bit of an idiot and says the invocation spell wrong...and accidentally summons an army of the undead. Well, he CAN return to the present now...but he finds he can't leave the locals in peril of being wiped out by these zombies and skeletons.In so many ways, this movie is like combining Mark Twain's ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" with ""The Evil Dead"". It also is the first of the Evil Dead films to be truly comical. While there were bits and pieces of funny stuff in the previous films (particularly in ""The Evil Dead II""), this third installments way played much more for laughs. It also sported a huge budget by comparison to the first two movies...though it's still pretty cheap and you'll really notice it when it comes to the stop-motion animation.Overall, a fun film to watch...my favorite of the three, mostly because it is so different and never takes itself the least bit seriously. Well worth seeing...even if you aren't into zombie films.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The man's got a frickin' chainsaw for a hand!!!,"My introduction to the Evil Dead series, and still my favorite.  Was the redeeming factor of a fairly depressing Halloween for me.  Why this movie wasn't more popular is beyond me.  Elfman's ""March of the Dead"" theme adds to the campy humor of the flick.  If you can find the director's cut, the scene in the windmill is twice as long and twice as funny.  Also, look for copies with the original, not-happy-enough-for-an-American-audience ending. Nobody could deliver that kind of mistake like Bruce Campbell.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A disappointment,"I couldn't get into this movie at all.  How the character Ash was twisted from the caring and penitent, albbeit reluctant, hero from the first two movies to the egomaniacal waste of flesh in Army Darkness was never really explained.  In all seriousness, his love for his girlfriend saved him from becoming a monster, yet somehow, less than a week later, he's having one night stands and acting smug while brushing off his lover?The film suffers from several such continuity plot-holes which seem to have been torn into the script in order to accommodate one-liners and mindless slapstick.  Slapstick in a horror film?Where is the feel of impending evil from the first movie?  Or the humorous subtleties interwoven into the second film?  Gone, along with all hopes of the series being continued as the original script intended.  One would assume that a horror movie's creators would be shamed to admit that George Romero's original ""Night of the Living Dead,"" and in fact Jim Henson's ""The Dark Crystal"" are both more frightening and cereberal than their own poorly contrived attempt.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Army Of Darkness - My Hero,"It was a foggy friday night, I piloted my automobile to the local pictureshow rental store.  I said goodday to the shop keep, and asked for a scary movie for me and my chums to see.  He friendly shopkeep tipped his hat, and handed me Army Of Darkness. Oh ... an Army ... a dark one !! This was sure to be scary !  I gave the shopkeep my currency (2 dimes and a nickle, only back then nickles had bumble bees on them ! I'd say ""5 bees for a quarter I would !).  I drove the film home and loaded it into my project.My friend and I were waiting for the filmography to begin. ""Here Comes 2 !"" I said, as the black and white letters apperared on the screen.  Soon the film started.  It was good.  We laughed at it's cheapness, but it was there for a reason.

His Ash Williams is one of the all-time great movie characters.

More Bruce Campbell than Evil Dead,"Evil Dead is one of my top 10 horror movies of all time and Bruce Campbell as Ash in that was brilliant. Period. Evil Dead 2 did catch me off guard a little with its humour but it was an excellent sequel. I saw Army of Darkness upon its cinematic release back in 1992 and I recall thinking back then that in my opinion it just wasn't an Evil Dead movie, rather a fantasy that stars Ash and uses elements from the original story.
Don't get me wrong, Army is a well made movie. Wonderful sets (though that castle obviously is not English!), lots of action, great effects (more than a nod to Ray Harryhausen) and no end of humour (Monty Python's Holy Grail sprang to mind). This is a horror/fantasy comedy. And that is my problem. Too much of it in my opinion, this movie is all about Bruce Campbell and how much he can squeeze out of Ash. Fans of the character will delight in this but for me he quickly became more tedious than funny. I feel somewhat bad about awarding this 6/10 when I am such a fan of the original but had Ash been somewhat less in your face then I would have scored it higher.
Just finished watching the Director's Cut. I liked the additional material plus the ending (even though it has been ripped from a very well known sci-fi movie!).
It transpires that there are several releases of this cut which vary tremendously in picture quality. My DVD is awful, looks like a poor VHS transfer, but thankfully a high quality print was recently screened here in the UK.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Gimme Some Sugar, Baby","This is the final chapter in the Evil Dead series. If you haven't watched either Evil Dead or Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn don't worry. This movie has nothing to do with the first Evil Dead and neither does Dead by Dawn. But enough about that. This movie fills in the blank spots right in the beginning so you don't have to worry about missing something vital. This movie seems to back away from the extreme use of gore and instead uses a more of an adventure feel. Ash is now trapped in the past and in order to get back he needs to get the Book of the Dead from a grave yard. Seems simple, but Ash can't quiet remember the three words the wise man told him to recite before removing the book. So Ash awakens an Army of Darkness and ticks off the whole medieval culture he's currently living in. Overall the movie is pretty good, more fixation on comedy than on anything remotely scary. The movie is pretty cheesy which could be a problem if you don't like cheesy humor. Ash does have some pretty good catch lines, I mostly recommend this to the Evil Dead fans but some who didn't like the first two may very well find this one a fresh step in a different direction.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Campy action-horror-comedy...,"I haven't actually seen the first two Evil Dead installments, and I understand they are better horror movies than this one.Personally I like the comedic touch. Bruce Campbell is just that kind of guy, a 'take-no-crap' kind of cheesy action hero. The chainsaw in particular provides more than its share of quirky moments. Campbell and Raimi together are a dynamic duo, and they continue to prove that even now.Sam Raimi is a talented guy, and he makes cool movies. Problem is a lot of people need quality, not just cool. And I digress - yeah, it's a bare-bones attempt at horror, relying much more on the comedic touches for effect. It's a guilty pleasure movie.

Definitely killed the feel of the first two.,"I love The first two Evil Deads, a lot. Their dark, and eerie feel contribute to them being two of the best horror films ever made.Now... this one, not so great. I fell in love with the spooky feel of the first Evil Dead, and same for the second, but this honestly ruined it... for me. We lost the whole feeling of the first two movies, and the whole horror element. I hate that there was a comedy element to it, seeing as how it, in my opinion, is not supposed to be there. Such a cliché, was ruined even more, by the orchestral score to the movie. The music had that usual ""uplifting"" and happy music, as seen in many stereotypical feel-good movies. I ask, ""What is this?"" This can't be in the same family of movies as the Evil Dead.All in all, if you loved the first two films for their horror, and eerie aspects... don't watch this.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Groovy,"Easily one of the most divisive film within the Evil Dead franchise, Sam Raimi's approach to ""Army of Darkness"" sees him maintain those horror aesthetics that make it work but letting his hair down and really embracing the camp to a point of no return. With this being more of a fantasy action film rather than a flat out horror comedy, an even bigger budget sees the film use time travel as Ash finds himself in the medieval times and captured by Lord Arthur who believes him to be a spy for Duke Henry but eventually he proves himself innocent and is sent on a mission to retrieve the Book of the Dead in order to get back home only to unleash an army of ghouls in the process. What follows is pure fun as Ash's new chainsaw arm proves to be a truly iconic weapon in the heat of battle and this is easily the most entertaining that Campbell is within the franchise as he's asked to juggle being various versions of Asn including Evil Ash, and he's the glue that holds this film together in every scene but the additions of Ted Raimi, Embeth Davidtz as Ash's love interest, Marcus Gilbert as Lord Arthur, and Ian Abercrombie as the Wiseman make for solid supporting cast members. At a very brisk 80 minutes, the film leaves little to be desired giving us a fast paced film that keeps the spirit of the franchise alive while doing something completely different from the previous two films, leading to great special effects makeup and even some solid stop motion animation in the final big battle scene and it's obvious that Raimi just wanted to have a blast with this film and he did just that.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A great movie for 13+,a good laugh for Evil Dead fans","The movie begins where Evil Dead II left off,with Ash - the sole survivor - being sucked into a vortex and finding himself confronted by a hundred men at arms and knights. Ash is arrested as an enemy of King Richard and marched to the castle with several Scotsmen.Upon entering the courtyard they are marched to a large pit, where the King explains that they will meet their deaths in a pit containing one of the Evil Dead.When Ash is thrown in to the pit hilarity ensues,as he fights a zombie that seems to know karate.Then the Wizard retrieves Ash's chainsaw and throws it to him,whereupon Ash quips ""come get some"" and proceeds to slash the evil dead into little bits.After Ash escapes from the pit he gives the King a little lesson in manners,then challenges the crowd with ""Who's next?Come on,who's next?You!?You want some?Do ya!?Huh!?"".The movie unfolds, and Ash learns he must once again retrieve the Necronomicon,this time from a large cemetery..but after forgetting the magic words he only pretends to say them,mumbling the last word silently before he picks up the book.Uh oh,you've wakened the dead! The next 40 minutes consists of Ash rallying the troops to defend the castle and the Book within from the Evil Dead,and giving some Frame-by-Frame skeletons a bloody good smashing.Army of Darkness is a departure from the Evil Dead and Evil Dead II in that there is far less gore,and the movie exudes a campy feeling in every moment of seriousness. This is less a tribute to Evil Dead and more about the good IL harry hausen films of yesteryear.The movie is hilarious and engaging as a pure back in time/fight the undead story,but Bruce Campbell breaths life into it as his ever-growing character Ash.Such witticisms as 'come get some' and 'gimme some sugar,baby' are liberally sprinkled throughout the dialogue to highlight the camp feeling in moments of seriousness,and bring us back to the point - which is laughing.Is it a comedy? I think so,but then I laughed at both Evil Dead movies. Definitely worth checking out regardless to whether you're looking for a tion or comedy.Sam Raimi fans be forewarned,this was not directed by Raimi.",,Anonymous,Horror
Somewhere in between....,"Some movies are good, some are bad. Some movies are so bad they're good. Because of this, some people try to make some movies that are so bad they're good. If you try to fail and do so, have you succeeded? Well we don't have to ask that question with this movie, because it's not bad enough to be bad or good, and it's really not good. Thus we conclude it's a mediocre attempt at being so bad it's good.Our hero the brazen braggart Ash goes back in time, where he is the Chosen One who will defeat the Army of Darkness...provided he can remember a few simple syllables. That's really it as far as the plot goes, along with the whole deal with Evil Ash the doppelganger leading the Army of Darkness. For some reason, it sounds better on paper, and it really shouldn't have.That said, this movie still has it's tongue-in-cheek charm. Ash's lines are made-for cult favorites, and the action is wonderfully banal. One of the strongest parts of the movie has to do with its pacing, how development is discarded to just get the action moving from scene to scene. For instance, the wise man continuing nonchalantly with his speech after Ash dispatches of a Deadite that interrupts them.It is quite definitely a fun, good time not meant to be taken seriously, more fun especially with friends and a good crowd.--PolarisDiB",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Am I the only one in the world who didn't like this movie?,"First, let me say I knew EXACTLY what I was getting into when I rented this. I love Bruce Campbell, and I love camp, and the idea of Bruce Campbell taking on campy skeletons while spouting off campy one-liners was too great to pass up. And it certainly has its moments: the free-falling car in the beginning is classic, and Bruce is too cool for school kicking demon butt with his sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw, while being an arrogant jerk to the villagers he's helping.Yes, those parts are all good. But there's FAR TOO LITTLE of them. Half of the movie is just some screwed up Saturday morning cartoon! I was hoping to see Ash being a badass and killing monsters the whole time, but instead I had to sit through this slapstick humor that seems to be aimed at 5-year-olds. Honestly, for all you die-hard fans of this movie, is it THAT entertaining to see Bruce fighting with 4-inch-tall versions of himself? Is it THAT entertaining to see him being attacked by a flying book? There was too much goofy and childish stuff going on, and I sure didn't expect that from a movie about a guy with a chainsaw for a hand.

"Flimsy to non-existant horror, great comedy","Army of Darkness is essentially a hardcore comedy with horror elements.  It doesn't seem to be a mainstream deal but, if it were, little boys all over the place would be watching this.  Bruce Campbell makes a very unappealing hero and he's not engaging whatsoever but he's got charisma in spades and so we watch him without paying much attention to him.  The plot is a one trick pony.  Ash is sent back in time and must retrieve the book of the dead to make it back.  The ""primitives"" that he aligns himself with need it too. Ash messes up (hilariously) and the army of the dead awakes.  The skeletons attack Ash and his buddies, led by Ash's evil twin that split from him in an earlier scene.  There's nothing scary about this movie but the comedy is A+ if you like Three Stooges' style slapstick.  As I stated earlier, this is a little boys dream movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
Army of Darkness (1992) Comedy? Yes. But... what about terror?,"The second film in the Evil Dead franchise proved to us that Sam Raimi was able to combine horror with comedy in a way that works. However, in this third film he simply forgot the horror element and just did the comedy. The change in tone is very large and this is a negative point for the film, given that certain sequences of jokes are very bad. However, Ash is still a very charismatic character and carries the film on his shoulders. The real big problem is that they just want to make jokes and leave no space for the horror to shine like the second film. Of course, the film is not bad, because it is well executed, but it could still be a little better if it didn't focus so much on comedy in an exaggerated way.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Love the first two but don't like this,"This is a review of the 96 min. directors cut. Basically this is ""Evil Dead 3"". It picks up right were ""Evil Dead 2"" left off with Ash (Bruce Campbell) back in medieval times. He wants to get back to present day (1992) but has to get a book that holds the incantation and battle the evil dead.Unlike the first time this is R rated--the first 2 were unrated but would have gotten an NC-17 easily. Also unlike the first two the accent here is on humor not horror and the gore is significantly toned down. Also the plot in this one is all over the place. It's fairly simple but Ash is constantly insulting everyone and telling bad jokes. Also it comes to a dead halt sometimes to indulge in some VERY violent (and unfunny) slapstick. The sequence in the windmill and when Ash first encounters the skeletons seem to come from a Three Stooges short! I hate the Three Stooges and I don't think I have to sit through TWO of their routines while watching a horror movie! On the plus side director Raimi had a LOT of money for this one and the special effects are dazzling. The stop-motion skeletons were just a joy to watch. Also Campbell's WAY over the top acting helps the story speed through its dull spots and Embeth Davidtz is very attractive and convincing as the love interest. Also the studio cut has a silly ending (with Bridget Fonda) but the directors cut has a more serious (and better) ending. This one just left me cold while I loved the first two so I can only give it a 5. The slapstick humor and stupid comedic lines were totally out of place in an Evil Dead film.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Hail to the king baby!!!!""","Many people have tried to make crazy horror-comedies, and many has failed. But those who have succeeded, has really made a tasty goulash of horror and humor. Two other good examples I can think of is Peter Jackson's cult movie ""Braindead"" and the modern British cult-classic ""Shaun of the Dead."" But still, my favorite remains ""The Evil Dead trilogy"", and especially ""The Army Of Darkness.""The movies takes place shortly after the second movie ends. It opens with a small flashback to the moments when Ash has been forced to cut off his possessed hand, and replacing it with a chainsaw. He then escapes through a time vortex he summoned with the aid of the Necronomicon (the book of the dead) which all the movies plots are based upon. The book, covered in human skin, and written in human blood contains a direct gateway two the underworld and in the wrong hands it may provoke the end of the world. In the first movies Ash has his hands full trying to fight off his friends which all are turned in to horrible demons. In the third movie Ash find that in the past people are living in constant fear of the living dead who roams the land. It's time to fight back. Good ting he brought his chainsaw and boom-stick (a twin-barrel shotgun which can fire a surprisingly high numbers of shots in a row.)This is the final movie in the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy,"" and the movies goofiness and crazy-humor is accelerating from the original and comes to it's climax the third movie. The Army of Darkness is like the first two ""Evil Dead movies"" hovering gracefully in the strange spot between a ""low budget horror turkey"" and a well directed epic tale of bravery and bone-chilling terror. It's a movie poorly made in many ways. The ""sceleton army"" looks like a bunch of those plastic skeletons your biology teacher used to drag out from a closet, and the voice overs is sometimes done with a goofy German accent. There's one thing that saves Army of Darkness from being ridiculous, and that is that it's fully aware of it's own flaws. Sam Raimi is by my opinion a genius, and manage to turn the sometimes terrible special effects into a vital part of the movies humor. It's not a bad, it's just not taking itself very seriously! This movie is far from a ""low budget turkey."" It's got a great plot, a great cast (wonderfull overacting by Bruce Campbell) and it got some really god laughs.It exist two versions of this movie. The original theater version and the directors-cut. The main difference is the endings. One containing the well known catchphrase ""Hail to the king, baby!"" and a sort-of happy ending to the trilogy.

The series went from hardcore horror (""The Evil Dead"") to splatter comedy (""Evil Dead 2"") and this final entry is almost pure slapstick with only an occasional flash of gore. Bruce Campbell, who evolved incredibly as an actor, reprises his role of chainsaw-swinging hero Ash who's now catapulted back in time to somewhere early in the medieval era. In order to get back to his supermarket job in the 20th century, he has to join and train a castle community in their battle against evil. Ash's very own clone leads the evil troops and they largely exist out of walking 'n talking skeletons. ""Army of Darkness"" is a very funny and light-headed film that ignores the horror in favor of funny gimmicks and cheerful swashbuckling. That's not necessarily a bad thing but it's understandable that most people rate it as the least good part of the series. Bruce Campbell, however, is terrific and this definitely is the role that defined him as the ultimate horror icon of the last two decades. Some of his quotes are already considered classic by now (""Hail to the King, Baby"", ""Shop smart. Shop S-Mart"") and most fans are still secretly hoping for a third sequel. The ""March of the Dead""-theme by Danny Elfman is splendid and Sam Raimi's direction is as professional as ever. Unlike the previous Evil Dead installments, ""Army of Darkness"" may not be a genre milestone but it sure remains great fun to watch it over and over again.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of a kind,"After being introduced to the evil dead movies by a friend of mine, it was time to see the Army of Darkness. I liked evil dead 2 so much that i didn't think it was possible for a sequel to be any better. I was wrong. I borrowed the film from my friend and watched it. I was blown away. This is a must if you liked the 2 evil dead movies. And if you are a horror/comedy person.I laughed so hard that i almost fell of the couch. The way the main person, Ash, acts and speaks is enough to make you want more. A great script, great lines, and great humor are the main reason that this movie is so fantastic.Go rent or buy this movie today!!!Hail to the king baby",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Army of Darkness"" - An Entertaining Blend of Comedy and Horror","""Army of Darkness"" is an entertaining film that combines elements of comedy with horror. With a rating of 8/10, the film offers a mixture of humorous moments and fantasy action, although the gore effects are relatively minimal.The story continues the adventures of Ash Williams, who finds himself in a medieval world teeming with demons and the undead. Director Sam Raimi employs his distinctive style to create a blend of comedy and fantasy adventure. The comedy elements are often exaggerated, resulting in many amusing moments. However, this heavy focus on comedy can sometimes come at the expense of the intense horror atmosphere present in the previous films of the series.Bruce Campbell's performance as Ash is once again outstanding. He embodies the role with charismatic charm and delivers a combination of heroism and bumbling antics that are essential to the film's humor. Campbell is undoubtedly the heart and soul of the series and contributes significantly to the success of ""Army of Darkness.""In terms of visual effects, the emphasis is more on fantasy elements rather than intense gore effects. The creatures and sets are imaginatively designed, with the plot relying more on action-packed battles and spectacular moments. Although the gore effects are not as prominent as in the previous films, they still add to the entertainment value and align with the film's exaggerated aesthetic.""Army of Darkness"" is an entertaining blend of comedy and horror that succeeds with its humorous style and imaginative storyline. While the comedy elements sometimes overshadow the intensity of the horror and the gore effects are not as prevalent as expected, the film still provides an enjoyable experience for fans of the series. With a rating of 8/10, ""Army of Darkness"" stands as a solid sequel that shines through its unique style and the charismatic performance of Bruce Campbell.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
fun for youngsters but not for me,"I expected this movie to be good because of the high ratings on IMDb. But I will try my best to take them down (o yes, I will).This movie lacks any form of intelligence and the storyline is just crap. The one-liners of the leading character obviously aim at young viewers (16-) or at people who are 'mentally challenged'. The special effects are pretty good at times although the mere 'bone' army of darkness (clay figures) transforms into a 'flesh-and-bone' army (actors) in several face-to-face action scenes. Probably this is cost-reducing but somewhere it insults the viewer's intelligence.I'm pretty sure that teenagers could enjoy this movie, whilst picking their noses and lurking at beercans. For me however, it was a big waist of time.I rate this movie: 1/10 (couldn't give a zero)",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watch Smart....watch this movie....GOT THAT?!?!?!?!?,"Undoubtedly one of my favorite movies. Army of Darkness was nothing but pure fun to watch, and how anyone could hate it is beyond me. Before I go into detail, I'd like to make a few pointers to the reviewers who scolded this movie since they were so ridiculously stupid: 1. Of course the graphics aren't gonna be GREAT, this was made in 1992, not 2002 you primitive screwheads. CG were a relatively new thing still. So stop saying ""The graphics sucked"". 2. The movie is supposed to be goofy, not scary. The first movie of the series was scary, but then they decided to take a new direction and go for comedy, hence Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness. I thought they did a hell of a job myself, Ash's lines were always funny because they were corny and random, he wasn't trying to be Hannibal Lecter and always have smart and sophisticated things to say. 3. Its not supposed to make sense. The mechanical hand and the chainsaw would never work in real life, I realize that. I don't need you to point it out. Part of the fun in this movie was the unrealisticness (if that is a word) If this movie was 100% realistic, there'd be no movie at all considering a worm hole cant open and take you to 1300 AD. There'd be no Evil Dead series altogether. So stop with the stupid ""unrealistic"" comments. .... well, now that that is out of the way, the movie was fun to watch, I thought I'd be taking a gamble buying it without seeing it or Evil Dead II first. I didn't even need to see the 2nd movie to get this one, it explains it all in the beginning. I saw the first movie, but that and Army of Darkness have almost nothing in common. But over all, I'm glad I took the chance and payed $6 for this movie, it was money well spent.Great movie, was a lot of fun to watch, never really a dull moment (except one or 2 parts but come on, all movies have that).I recommend this movie to fans of Evil Dead I&II, and to anyone just looking for a comedy/horror movie. Remember, you don't need to see the first 2 movies to see this one.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's just a little tid bit.,"I'm a huge Bruce (Ash) Campbell fan (and with 1000 words permitted here I cannot express why I think about the trilogy). So I'll give you a nice trivia tip, In Army of Darkness Ash needs to say 3 words before taking the Book, which are: Klaatu barada nikto. Which obviously he screws that up!.Thouse words are from the 1950""s Movie: The Day The Earth Stood Still. Klaatu is the name of the main alien character played by: Michael Rennie.PS: If they make a remake of Evil Dead without Bruce or Sam Raimi...That would suck big time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun Third Entry in the Series,"Army of Darkness (1992)** 1/2 (out of 4)Ash (Bruce Campbell) finds himself get sucked back into time where he gets involved with a small village who need the Necronomicon so that they can defeat the Army of the Dead. Ash needs the book to get back to his time so they team up to try and win the battle.Sam Raimi's third film from THE EVIL DEAD trilogy is without question my least favorite of the series and I honestly just don't find it as funny as I'm sure everyone intended. The movie was obviously meant to be a cross between a Three Stooge film and a Ray Harryhausen film and there's no doubt that Raimi keeps the mood light and fast moving.If you're coming into this expecting something like the first two films then you'll certainly be disappointed because this goes off in its own direction, which was a pretty brave thing to do. After all, when you're going into a sequel you just expect to see the same thing as before. This probably explains why the film didn't do too well at the box office but it eventually found a cult following.Raimi certainly keeps the film moving at a nice pace and of course there's Campbell returning as Ash. It goes without saying but Campbell is what keeps this movie going with his zany and comic performance. He manages to milk out all sorts of entertainment and is there anyone better for this campy lines that he has to deliver here? ARMY OF DARKNESS is a nice throwback to the Harryhausen films but I still think it's the weakest of the series. I'd argue that the Director's Cut is certainly the version to go with as it contains the better ending and doesn't feel as rushed.",,Anonymous,Horror
"It was more groovy many years ago, but still entertaining.","I saw the Evil Dead trilogy for the first time about 12 years ago. I was 19 years old then. I'm rewatching the trilogy now before I watch the series because I've never seen that.I didn't like this movie as much today as I did 12 years ago, and I probably would have liked it even more if I saw it when it came out. The effects are very old, but in some cases a little eerie. The acting is okay in this one.This is the best one in the trilogy in my opinion. It has more humor and is funnier, but lacks the scare factor and gore. I think it was fun to see Ash on an adventure other than the cursed cabin. This movie has arguably the most memorable quotes from Ash. The action sequences were okay for the most part, while some sequences were very stupid. For example, when the Army of Darkness storms the castle's gate and the soldiers who are supposed to defend form a wall and just walk towards them without striking. Both sides just walk into each other with their swords in the air.The first film had a focus on horror. The second film had a focus on horror combined with comedy. This one focuses on comedy and action. This one entertained me the most.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

undead fun and games with a battle thrown in,"army of darkness is, quite literally, the funniest film since the middle ages! once again our hero ash takes on soul-swallowing deadites, but this time, he's suffering from a serious split personality and he's 400 years too early for therapy! stranded in the past, ash lands in the middle of a battle between good and evil (again) and nobody's sure which side he's on. after dispatching a few deadites and showing off his boom stick, however, he is hailed as the saviour we've known he was all along. with a horse, some magic words and the coolest prosthetic hand in movie history, he sets off to the graveyard to retrieve the book of the dead which will destroy the deadites and send him home. this being ash, however, things don't quite go according to plan. if you haven't seen it, i won't blow the ending for you. also, if you haven't seen it, what's taking you so long? watch it now! you'll cry (maybe), you'll laugh (definitely), you'll never annoy a man with a boom stick!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scare free but loads of fun,"Army of Darkness takes the Evil Dead franchise away from its horror roots and is surprisingly mostly gore free but despite all that it remains a great trilogy capper that wastes no time and dials up the insanity to looney tunes levels of absurdity and is undoubtedly all the better for it.Bruce Campbell completes the transition from final girl to action star that was started in Evil Dead 2, the physical comedy is still here and he's got plenty of screen presence and more than enough cheesy one liners as well as one more groovy for good measure.Sam Raimi's direction remains a franchise highlight, the budget has gone up again resulting in a much grander scale but it's still got that propulsive energy in its camera movements and the final battle is one big loving homage to old school Hollywood swashbuckling blockbusters.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Bones, Books, and Campbell","Highly enjoyable, fairly mindless, funny addition to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series - the third and last installment and easily the best and most engaging of the three as well. Bruce Campbell is back with a slightly different character motivation and past, but Campbell relies on his quick reflexes, both physical and mental, that made him famous in the first two Evil Dead movies as Ash and kicks it up not just a notch but three or four. Here he is obviously parodizing his character and those of adventure/horror films of the era. He is a walking one-liner amidst hokey plot contrivances, imaginative special effects(for its time bear in mind), and some pretty mediocre acting talents. But none of that really matters because Campbell and Raimi are out to make you laugh and Army of Darkness is no more a horror film than Fatal Attraction is a romantic comedy. Raimi is agile and adroit with the camera and innovative. I really liked the walking skeletons in the battle scenes, and Raimi gives them ludicrous lines to say to make sure no one confuses this with anything more than what it is intended to be. Campbell shines as he always does as a bigger-than-life persona with lots of comedic ability. The scene with the books was a real hoot as were his multiple fights with various demons. Though part of the Evil Dead series, this really has virtually nothing to do with the other two except for some names that are the same and some plot elements that allow Campbell to run, shout, contort himself in most amusing ways.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The dude below missed MY point.,"Sorry dude (you who said i missed the point about army of darkness) but i think you missed my point, i most certainly am aware of the fact that Army of darkness is supposed to be a humorous adventure/fantasy flick with obvious intentions to parodies them old fantasy movies. But I thinks it's not only supposed to be just that, in my eyes it's a great continuation to Dead by dawn and i have nothing against it taking the humor of the precursors a step further. But i also love the animations (obviously inspired a lot by Harryhausens work o movies such as ""Sinbad""(triology) and ""Jason and the Argonauts"") for more than the humorous value, I love it simply because i love that sort of animations. And I sure as hell know it ain't suppose to be a very serious movie like LoTR!!I actually think you've missed the point if you only see it as a parody which has nothing to do with Evil dead 1 and Dead by dawn! I'm not saying that that's the case but it almost seems like it...What i meant by great scenery wasn't some joke i sincerely think so, the studio feeling gives me great satisfaction because it brings me back to when i was young, growing up with Conan, Sinbad and so on. And that was what i meant by a great feeling in it. And maybe it's all meant to be a joke but i love it, every second of it and fact that you so obviously can tell that they are in a studio and the clay animations (the skeleton-scene is almost a direct rip-off from Jason and the Argonauts!)is wonderful!At least we can agree that it's a great movie and the alternative ending is super!Now to the movie! You who have seen ""Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead 2 - Dead by dawn"" knows what it's all about and the third movie picks up where Dead by dawn ended: Ash has traveled back in time and is now a slave, but after showing what he's made of in ""the pit"" he sets out on a dangerous journey, looking for the Necronomicon knowing that finding it is the only way he will ever get home, back to his own time again.

If a classic can be defined as something that improves with age than this does qualify. When I saw it, after seeing the first two Evil Dead movies, I was first disappointed that it took a different route. I could also see why it was not Evil Dead 3. But then I got sucked in and was rewarded with a masterpiece of a movie. Immensely entertaining at first watch, later viewings bring up more and more hidden gems of Raimi's direction and vision. Bruce Campbell also grew from a blood splattered pseudo hero to a comedic talent further showcased in the underrated ""Brisco County Jr"" TV show years later.

"Better Than he First, Not As Good As The Second","Army of Darkness is the third (and so far final) movie in the Evil Dead Series. Before director Sam Raimi went legit with a series of critically acclaimed dramas and the Spiderman series, he was a low budget horror genius. Army of Darkness begins right where Evil Dead II ended, with Bruce Campbell trapped in medieval times to battle the deadites once again.The trilogy started out in Evil Dead as a pretty straight horror movie. A group of people discover a book of the dead and unleash gore filled horror upon themselves in a remote cabin. Evil Dead II basically re-tells the same story with a different cast (except for the ever present Bruce Campbell), bigger budget and plenty of slapstick. The second movie is by far my favorite in the series. It keeps the ghoulish gore while adding hilarious physical comedy and some classic one liners. Army of Darkness furthers this tradition by adding even more slap stick and one lines while removing almost all of the gore.What little plot there is goes something like this: Stranded in the middle ages Bruce Campbell is at first captured by a small army for being mistaken for a member of a rival army. Bruce quickly uses his ""boomstick"" to gain clout with his captors and is sent on a quest to recover the Necronomicon which will both send Bruce back to his own time and save the army from evil. Bruce being Bruce he gets the book and unleashes an army of the dead. There are two endings released for this movie. One happier ending was released in US theatres and another sequel set up unhappy ending seen in a theatrical cut in the UK and on many US DVD versions.Raimi once again does a nice job creating a mix of horror movie cliché's (which range from Jason and the Argonauts to Gulliver's Travels) with the slapstick of the Three Stooges. Unfortunately the comic elements seem to take over this picture leaving the horror end of it as more of a backdrop. It feels more like a Zucker brother's movie more than a horror film. Most of the evil dead are formed as skeletons which only crumble when destroyed rather than burst into a mess of blood and guts as they did in the first two movies. This may seem to be an absurd complaint, but as a fan of gory movies I felt disappointed with that choice.The cinematography is actually quite well done throughout most of the picture. My DVD copy is actually quite beautiful in scenes. Especially the exterior shots around the windmill. The use of color and lighting is well above par for most horror films. The pre CGI special effects effect the quality of the print in several areas, but still hold up as goofy Raimi effects. I kept thinking the picture was too pretty for what was actually taking place on screen. Bruce Campbell once again does a nice job of making Ash come to life. He delivers his lines with the comic timing of a comedian while still delivering enough pain to make his albeit over-the-top beatings believable. The rest of the cast is hardly memorable as characters or for their acting.Army of Darkness still makes a nice end to the trilogy. In a way it makes a nice bookend to Evil Dead's pure gore horror with the single middle book being a mix between bloody gore and slapstick comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Shop smart, shop S-Mart",One of the coolest movies ever kicks even more bootie. The DVD Director's cut rules. The studio ending pales in comparison to Raimi's mind-twisting ending.

Charming fun.,"This is definitely the best evil dead movie but I would still rather watch the original. I found it more charming and I liked the smaller scale. Army of darkness has a surprising epic scale and some really impressive set pieces that I wasn't expecting.I've been conflicted about Bruce Campbell's acting throughout the evil dead movies, but he is really good here. He embraces this roll and smashes it out of the park, he is really funny and great during the action sequences as well.The dialogue is probably my favourite thing about army of darkness. My favourite scenes were the build up to Ash's quest to find the book. Each scene is just riddled with gags, even if they don't all land there are enough of them that you're going to like one eventually. The dialogue is also very quotable, so many lines that I didn't even realise I was quoting until I watched this. Also ""groovy"" is the best line and line delivery, I love it.Again the effects are great and very charming, even though I like a lot about the evil dead movies I always feel there's something missing. I don't get the same experience as others from these movies, it's dumb fun to me, nothing more.I know many people love these movies but I'm sorry I can't really get into them.

Nice ending to a fantastic trilogy,"The third movie in this Evil Dead trilogy.You see a clear growth in the film: From a bad acted film with almost no money and very creative camera-work to this big money action film.Raimi puts the setting in a different land and age, presumably because the wooden cabin had grown too small for this big production. Raimi keeps the humor and the one-liners in the movie but it is sometimes a little too much. He wants it to be too funny sometimes and it becomes more slapstick then the two other films were. Nonetheless this movie isn't a bad movie. It has a high pace, enough humor and the character Ash is fantastic.

Best of the 'Evil Dead' trilogy,"Following on directly from 'Dead by Dawn', Ash and his Oldsmobile fall out of the sky, and are trapped in 1300 AD.

Well, they throw Ash in a pit with a deadite, Ash kills the deadite, and now everyone thinks he is the hero from the prophecy - the hero will fall from the sky and stop the Army of Darkness.Only the Necronomicon can save the middle-ages-dudes from the deadites, and send Ash back to his proper time, so its up to Ash to find the Necronomicon. Of course, there are some... complications in his quest.'Army of Darkness' takes the 'Evil Dead' series in a whole new direction. The horror and gore is gone, replaced by comedy and fantasy. Some other reviewers have already hinted to the best way to describe this movie: Campy b-movie inspired by older fantasy movies ('Jason and the Argonauts' in particular'). If you enjoyed the first two 'Evil Dead' movies, don't expect much of the same style in 'Army of Darkness' - the 'Evil Dead' style is all but gone. Except for Ash. Ash is King.However, there is nothing to be disappointed about. 'Army of Darkness' is a very funny movie. Well written, some really cool special effects - even the acting is better, and this a schlock movie! Simply put, this movie is basically the adventures of the Cult-God Ash, Hail to the King!

Army of Darkness,"Ash is back for the final time to battle the 'Army of Darkness' in this third and final entry to the original Evil Dead series.Picking up right where things left off in 'Evil Dead II', Ash is captured by Lord Arthur having been accidentally transported to the Middle Ages. Lord Arthur is convinced that Ash is a spy for his enemy Duke Henry. After killing a deadite, Ash is considered a hero and is released from captivity, eventually meeting a woman named Sheila who he instantly feels a connection to. One of Arthur's Wise Men who seems to know a lot about the Necronomicon approaches Ash and tells him that if he wants to return to his time period, he will need to go retrieve the magical Necronomicon Ex-Mortis located somewhere in a haunted forest.Ash goes exploring to find it, coming across some evil forces throughout the forest. Once he gets in to the book, he discovers there is not one, but three books which look identical. He picks the correct one, but says the wrong words to the incantation which leads to holy terror being unleashed in the village. Will he ever be able to stop the evil and return to his time period?Army of Darkness was a bit of a letdown for me after two strong Evil Dead movies before it. A lot of the same comedic and gore elements were repeated here, but with a lesser effect. Maybe it was the new setting that I wasn't loving, or the bigger budget look to it, but Army of Darkness lacked the charm and overall horror that the first two gave us.Bruce Campbell was his usual amazing self, and really shined when ""Bad Ash"" entered the scene.

Army of Darkness (8/10),"The hilarious performance by Bruce Campbell in Army of Darkness has got to be the reason for his massive cult following. His one-liners are so off the wall and quotable that replay value will always be existent with this film. Army of Darkness, unlike the previous Evil Dead movies went light on horror substance and built itself around Ash and a plot that is seemingly close to the book, Lord of the Rings: Two Towers (since the movie wasn't out yet). However, there are so many memorable scenes that the flick really stands out on its own even with the insane amount of parodying the film took. In my opinion, Army of Darkness is the best in the trilogy and should be accepted in the comedy genre just as much as it is in the horror genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Evil Dead goes full fantasy,"Army of Darkness was the third and final film of the original Evil Dead trilogy and the final film directed by Sam Raimi. Like Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness was a comedic film and there was some absolute zaniness, like Ash fighting mini-versions of himself.Army of Darkness wasn't as violent as its predecessor, but it made up for that by being a horror version of a sword-and-sorcery film. The opening with Ash being chained being up felt like Conan the Barbarian, the costume and lighting seemed like a classic period drama from the Golden Age of Hollywood, and the final battle was influenced by Ray Harryhausen. It was the hybrid of fantasy cinema from the 50s/60s and the 1980s. If you those sorts of films, then Army of Darkness would be up your alley.Army of Darkness did stand out because of the genre change and it had more narrative than simply surviving the monster attacks.

"Not my type of movie, but not really that good anyways","""Army of Darkness"" is different from most movies I see, as I'm not really into the whole comedy genre.  I had heard a whole lot about the movie from a whole bunch of people who loved it, but I wasn't convinced that a low-budget movie with an evil force that makes people go back in time would be worth my time.  And, for the most part, it wasn't.Yes, ""Army of Darkness"" does have its funny moments, but it wasn't laugh-out-loud hilarious.  The plot mostly makes sense, I guess, but wasn't anything new and unique.  A guy goes back in time and fights evil.  Wow. But, at the same time, it IS parodying movies with plots like that.  But the movie, although the claymation is good and the cinematography decent, just isn't really that exciting.In conclusion, watch ""Army of Darkness"" if you want a few laughs and you like spoofs.  But if you're looking for thoughtful cinema or even good entertainment, don't waste your time.Final Grade: C+",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I didn't find it the least bit entertaining.,"So, Sam Raimi had a lot of weird ideas for horror movies and decided to implement them in a horror comedy where substance was not an issue. The result: 'Army of Darkness'.I suppose there was a good reason for not calling it 'Evil Dead 3'. I can't imagine fans of the first two films being satisfied with this rather atrocious installment in the franchise. Having been transported through a wormhole, Ash (Bruce Campbell) now finds himself in the year 1300. For some reason, this character suddenly is very arrogant. Ash was a likable character in the first two films, but here I couldn't find myself rooting for him. Apart from being arrogant, he is a hopeless idiot who's only claim to fame is the fact that he is from the future and therefore holds knowledge the medieval people don't have. And - off course - his logical reasoning is hampered by a woman. Yawn...'Army of Darkness' is downright silly slapstick humor that seems to go on forever during some scenes, making it almost unwatchable. There's just way too much silliness for anything to be taken seriously. One can't even call it an 'Evil Dead' spoof because - apart from Ash - it has nothing in common with the other films. Instead, I'd refer to it as a spoof of the living dead and epic battle films. The fighting sequences towards the end are cliched, but with the dead instead of living armies. I couldn't wait for this to end...",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
fun fantasy adventure film,"Ok so its no Citizen Kane but still think that this deserved more praise then it got. The critics dislike this because it was different from the previous films, which is true. I have yet to The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn maybe when I do see these films my view of this film will change. Ash is transported to 1300 AD when he goes through a wormhole like thing. To get back to his time Ash must get the book of the dead and say three magic words. Ash forgets the last word but takes the book as the result he awakens the army of darkness also known as the deadites. Ash decides the people to fight the deadites because they refused to send him home. The film makes great use of fantasy and humor; the film is more comedy then horror unlike the first two films. If you are looking for a horror film this isn't for you but if you want a funny fantasy adventure film this is for you. Short run time, plenty of action and laughs makes this film quite watchable even if you don't like it. An exciting, entertaining and fun fantasy adventure comedy; though some of the special effects are campy the comedy makes up for that.

Peep This Reviews,"The ""Evil Dead"" series gets lots of deserved love. But in the midst of all that love the original film, it's re-imagining, the comics and now TV series over shadow part three. Just because it doesn't have ""Evil Dead"" in the title this is an epic film. Slapstick humor, violence, gore are all on display in this criminally under-rated masterpiece of a the beloved franchise. Side note: There are many versions of this film available due to many different factors most involving the studio not approving of certain aspects of the film. It's all good but the bootleg/director's cut with the original ending is the must see.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Has its lion's share of memorable moments and quotable one-liners, but it just isn't 'Evil Dead.'","The third entry in the 'Evil Dead' series is certainly the strangest, with a medieval setting and completely comic tone - think a three stooges skit mixed with a wacky cartoon with Bruce Campbell right in the centre. 'Army Of Darkness (1992)' does have its lion's share of memorable moments and quotable one-liners, but it just isn't 'Evil Dead.' Even its most horrific elements are more strange than scary, making the movie feel much more like a comedy-fantasy than a comedy-horror. Basically, its main issue is that its mix between horror and humour is incredibly unbalanced. It's definitely possible to divorce the experience from its franchise and have some silly, irreverent fun with it, though. Campbell is suitably ostentatious as his new, one-liner spewing self and the physical comedy on display is enjoyably impressive. It's certainly distinct, too. Though it's actually quite rough for quite a while, it eventually settles into itself and becomes an enjoyable experience. Its finale, which is essentially an extended ode to Ray Harryhausen, is especially entertaining. In the context of its series, however, the overall picture lacks all the grit of its predecessors and, as such, it's a disappointing third entry, especially for those who favoured the genuine gore and scares of both 'The Evil Dead (1981)' and its sillier sequel. Having said that, the piece is still a solid slapstick comedy. Depending on what you're looking for, that may very well be enough. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun Movie,"I must say this film surprised me. The Evil Dead was one of the creepiest and scariest fantasy horror movies I've ever seen. Evil Dead 2 was also scary but had a little dark humour in it. Army of darkness however, is just pure fun. I don't know why Sam Raimi made it this way, I guess he was tired of making scary movies, but liked the character to much. And let's be honest, Bruce Campbell is awesome, who would want to watch him tackle demons and monsters over and over again.I guess the only thing I didn't like about this movie, was it's lack of continuity. Weapons kinda appeared out of nowhere and Ash never seemed to run out of bullets. But then again it's not exactly a serious movie so maybe they didn't really care. I'm not really complaining, I loved this movie.Although Army of Darkness kinda focuses on slapstick humour, it still fits well into the trilogy. There are still deadits and the Necrocromicon is as annoying as always. They've just tuned down the blood and gore. And since Ash after being beaten up in the two prequels, is mow worthy of the title action here. He knows all their tricks, he's not scared anymore, and let's face it, he's not very afraid of pain anymore. I mean he did cut off his own hand in Evil Dead 2.So Ash is tougher than ever, and the deadits are quite that scary when your not trapped in an small cabin anymore. For it's minor flaws and hilarious story, I give this movie an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very fun film of the early '90s,"So, I haven't reviewed a film for quite some time. I picked this up cheap after hearing about it for so long. My first exposure to it was through the roleplaying game of the same name by Eden Studios. Little did I realize, this is as much of a comedy as it is an action-horror film. And it works.I knew Bruce Campbell from Burn Notice, so it was interesting to see him age backward here. He's retained much of his confident, relaxed personality over the years. Many quips he makes throughout the film are reminiscent of Bob Hope, while others seem to have been influential on shooter video games to come. I think it's safe to say that many of his one-liners here defined certain popular phrases of the time, much like Buffy would later do for 2000s slang.Notable points of the film include the unique magical book, which is easily the most badass interpretation of a trope. Everything from The Care Bears Movie to D&D had books with faces in decades previous, but this one is absolutely terrifying. It's easy to imagine actually possessing it. There's also the masterfully animated skeletons. A high point for them is a scene where they are talking and moving their heads, all with a flame flickering in the background. Simple stop motion would avoid having a flame as the still frames would make it look choppy and unrealistic as a result. The skeleton's stop motion walk cycles suffer from low frame rate at times, but they certainly hold up to the expected Terminator stop motion of the time. Robots and skeletons can't make complex expressions which make them prime candidates for stop motion animation. Overall, it's a breath of fresh air to see villains who aren't digital models. The soundtrack is very unique, a blend of Elfman's bouncy melodies mixed with LoDuca's huge symphonic score. The music adds to the playful yet dangerous atmosphere the film is set in.Some low points include a long scene which utilizes miniaturization, a common trope of the time seen in films such as Honey, I Shrunk The Kids and Indian in the Cupboard. It just hasn't aged well and feels far too childish for an R-Rated film. There's also this persistent feeling that Star Wars and The Terminator influenced various aspects of the film. Regardless though, this film has gone on to inspire works such as Chainsaw Man and Doom.In conclusion, this action/comedy film is certainly worth seeing if you enjoy Campbell's acting and want a blast from the past. A great deal of '90s culture is contained in this film and by the end, you'll wish that a certain department store still existed today.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Wild Tongue In Cheek Thrill Ride,"'Army of Darkness' is the 3rd and final entry in Sam Raimi's original 'Evil Dead Trilogy' and caps off the saga in a unique yet fun way by going down the fantasy adventure hybrid route and yet still retaining that heavy dose of horror and comedy that is just simply entertaining to watch. This unforgettable gem is anything but your typical horror fare.The Plot = Ash (Bruce Campbell) finds himself transported back to medieval times, where he must retrieve the Necronomicon and save a kingdom from an army of the dead so he can finally return to his own time.This entry in the series continues the tongue in cheek nature of previous entry and goes in an even wilder and wackier direction full of over-the-top sequences, cartoonish silliness and creative visuals which gives the flick an almost animated feel to it, making for a dark comedy that always pushes the limits of insanity as it delves back and forth between horror, action, adventure, and slapstick comedy. The combinations of these genres are highly enjoyable and balanced out quite well, thanks to Sam Raimi's vibrant direction and Bruce Campbell's stellar anti-hero performance with these 2 elements combined you can't fail. The special effects are gruesome yet highly creative, and jam packed with outrageous creature designs that serve to frighten and entertain you at the same time in hilarious fashion.Bruce Campbell once again reprises his iconic role of Ash Williams and bringing plenty of camp flavour to the not so heroic deadite slayer and having a total blast with the role and hell this even feels like a natural progression for his character and nails every aspect of it.Overall 'Army of Darkness' may be lacking that special something the first 2 movies had, but its still a solid entry in the series and thrives in its off-beat nature and out of control nature. This is comedic horror gold and a wild entertaining ride from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why Even Bother?,"First off, I would like to say that I thought Evil Dead was a really scary horror movie which deserves a spot in any horror fans top ten list. Evil Dead II was also pretty good, although a little ridiculous. The third installment was just no good.Comedy and horror do not mix. They do on occasion but not when they start of as horror and descend into comedy. I have seen this happen countless times with other films. Freddy Krueger started life as a fearsome boogeyman but his later films resembled black comedy. The same happened with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Childs Play films. Evil Dead was an extremely creepy movie where you were waiting for something to jump out whilst Army of Darkness was too much of a comedy.I can live with Ash being transported back in time. However, this was far too comedic. It's perfect if you haven't seen the first two films but if your pants were scared off watching Evil Dead I and II then this film is totally unsuitable for you.Horror needs to remain horror. Could you imagine if the likes of Michael Myers, Jason Voorhess or Pinhead turned into comedy characters? Army of Darkness was disappointing and if the rumours about a fourth Evil Dead movie are true, I hope it is better-and much much scarier-than this one.",,Anonymous,Horror
Great Fun!,"In the realm of Cult classics it is right up there with titles like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", ""Rock & Roll High School"" and ""Wizards"".

I have always been a fan of ""B"" titles and have enjoyed watching this one on a regular basis, at least once every couple of months. There are several scenes that I love to pick out on the DVD and just play them with out watching the whole movie. But, that rarely happens. Bruce is a great comic.

But where he was the anchor of the first two movies, here he is honestly just the salvation for what is otherwise a movie that's not very good.

20 stars!,"One of the most fun, campy, cult classic movies of all time. Non-stop fun from beginning to end. It really is a thing of its' own, pretty much, and it stands out from the rest of the Evil Dead group. As others have pointed out, being shot on real film gives it a very cool look and feel. They also really pushed the edge of non-cgi special effects, especially on a budget. I think that in the end though those cheesy models are just outstanding with so much 'soul' in them which their equivalent modern CGI 'cousins' lack alltogether. It hankers a bit of ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" with the stop motion stuff, and a bit of Monty Python with the humor and visuals. It's a B level masterpiece of art in every sense of the word. A great, well rounded adventure tale. Fantasy fans and especially D&D and other RPG fans will definitely find this film right up their alley.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Shop Smart. Shop S-Smart - good comedy in ""The Evil Dead"" trilogy could have been much better","Army of Darkness (1992) is a good comedy with some horror aspects but could have been much better more scary, but it wasn't. This movie isn't scary like was the first original movie. The Evil Dead (1981) is the best horror film of all time in my opinion and my favorite horror film of all time. Third movie in the trilogy is alright. It still has a horror elements in, it is mixed with good comedy effects. Bruce Campbell as hero Ash Williams was terrific and excellent in his acting performence. Director Sam Raimi directed this film well. Was the final saga in ""The Evil Dead trilogy.""This third chapter goes for more of the laughs rather then the scares and actually offers up a fun take on the genre mix director Sam Raimi tells. Ash is now trasnported in to 1300 A.D., in which he has to retrieve the book of the dead Necronomicon while he was searching on the graveyard for the book he accidently says wrong words and he awokes up ""the army of the dead"" and he doomes everyone with that action. While selfish, he wants to go home, but he decides to stay and fight againts the army of the dead.This was the third and final saga in The Evil Dead trilogy before this movie was rebooted and get the series Ash vs Evil Dead with Bruce Campbell returning his character Ash. Never saw the series before, but Army of Darkness I like. I would say it is a step back from The Evil Dead (1981) movie because I love horror movies this is more lighter tone and more lighter aspect than a horror movie it self.The problem I had is Bruce Campbell aka Ash dosen't use his chainsaw that much, he only use in the opening scene and that it is. Why this poster has Ash with chainsaw when he barely use it. Ash is iconic with chainsaw and his shootgun not without chainsaw. The third movie is more lighter, not creepy enough and not scary or terrifying enough. That's ym problem with this film. Evil Dead II (1987) is MILES way better movie this isn't.They are 4 cuts of this film the directors's cut, televison cut, theatrical cut and international cut. I watched years ago Director's Cut I hated it that version of this movie, but Theatrical Cut is a bad-ass. I am glad I have theatrical cut on Blu-ray otherwise I would hate this film. Bruce Campbell also isn't happy with Collector's edition he also dosen't like those cuts on this film.What can I say the film has a lot of action, good FX stunts, some creepy monsters, funny moments. Bad Ash and the Skeleton army I like that Ash mades weapons in the history. I love his new knight iron hand. I like the ending the finale in which Ash is in the store fighting with monster with his sexy girlfriend Linda. Did not know she was played by Bridget Fonda this time. The theatrical cut has better ending than director's cut (Ash waking up in a post-apocalyptic future where human civilization is destroyed) just dosen't fit in the movie and that scene too me was really disappointment and stupid!Army of Darkness I like, I have Screwhead Edition on Blu-ray disc and I am still going to watch this movie. I love The Evil Dead (1981) to death, it is my favorite horror film of all time. Army of Darkness is on the third spot in the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Yeah,"When i first saw Evil dead i was sold! The first movie is almost a pure horror movie but with a few laughs in it. The second one and the third one (Army of darkness), takes the humorous side of the first film even further and Army of darkness is almost entirely a comedy.

A great magical world!As you might not know Ash takes a trip back in time to set things straight in Army of darkness. In this mystical world he meets a lot of different weird creatures and he must now make a great journey to find the solution to all their problems and end this Evil. but will he succeed?Maybe this movie alone isn't the greatest movie of all times, might not even be one of mine favorites but since i have seen the whole trilogy and loved every second of the two first movies i can't dislike this one. It might not be a horror movie but it works perfectly as a continuation to the first and second part of the trilogy and it is a great movie!

"""Gimme some sugar baby"",","It's strange that I have been doing movie reviews on IMDB forever now and I am just getting around to talking about this now. If you haven't seen Army Of Darkness by now, you are either a youngster or have been in a coma for the past 30 years. This 3rd installment to The Evil Dead series was not a blockbuster at the box office, but like many of the best films it has been much more appreciated later to a rabid cult following. Army Of Darkness is not strictly a horror movie or even a horror/comedy. This movie blends genres into its own tasty concoction. There is horror/fantasy/ action and comedy adventure in one ridiculous movie. So basically, Army Of Darkness is pure entertainment. Picking up where Evil Dead 2 left off with the Necronomicon creating a vortex and taking our hero Ash(Bruce Campbell) back in medieval times. Bruce Campbell brings his A game as a swashbuckling, wisecracking action hero. He talks tons of trash and delivers ass whooping to the legions of the undead. Sam Raimi turned down the lever on the suspense and the gore, but cranked up the slapstick comedy and the action. Bruce Campbell really killed it in this role, being able to play Ash Williams in any situation, he truly makes it look easy. The film looks good and is before CGI ruled the world so there is tons of really great and creative practical f/x. Army Of Darkness is just a lot of fun, you have demons, one liners, butt kicking, Bruce Campbell all in a Monty Python And The Holy Grail on acid type of setting. This is a one of a kind movie that is fun to watch and easy to like.

Sam Raimi had to put an end to the series somehow!,"What was once a tale of terror in the woods has now become an epic story that dates back to the 1300's, in the time of King Arthur and what-have-you. This movie shows Raimi's love for slapstick comedy and Bruce Campbell turns in a great performance as Ash once again, Campbell's one-liners are hilarious but seemed a little too 'dummied-down' if you know what I mean. I feel this movie lacked the technical sophistication that Raimi usually thrived on in earlier films, it seemed a little too sloppy and cheesy in some moments (Raimi never lost his touch there). I was about 80% satisfied with the movie and 20% critical of how it was handled. Overall it is a great, enjoyable and laughter filled picture but the plot just seemed too condensed, I just really feel that the plot could have had more meat on it's bones, oh well, all in all I'am still glad Raimi came out with this movie and I look forward to another possible sequel in the future if he decides so.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"An Action Packed,Hilarious Classic Finale To The Evil Dead Trilogy.","Army Of Darkness is an excellent,Action packed,fun and Hilarious film filled with great direction,an excellent performance by Bruce Campbell,great Action,fun laughs,special effects and is a classic finale to the Evil Dead trilogy.Set in medieval times in 1300 A.D,hero Ash(Bruce Campbell)has been transported back to time and this time has to battle an army of dead skeletons,help a group of people and get the Necronomicon(Book Of The Dead)back so he can get back to his time,and for Ash it's going to be dangerous,full of adventure and will be groovy.What would happen if The Three Stooges met The Evil Dead? You would get Army Of Darkness,a classic film that is an absolute blast from beginning to end. What I love about Th Evil Dead Trilogy is that while all three films are connected with one another,they're different in terms of tone. If Evil Dead was pure Horror and Evil Dead II was a Horror-Comedy,then Army Of Darkness is in the Action/Comedy/Fantasy category with a little bit of Horror thrown in. The Comedy and laughs in the film are hilarious and ingenious and over the top with Sam Raimi using Three Stooges-style Comedy and slapstick in the film and with the character Ash being apart of the joke going through many bizarre and crazy things on his adventure. Ash's journey of trying to get the book of the dead is definitely one of the film's many great and funny highlights,seeing Ash's many reactions to the evil forces around him trying to stop him from getting the book of the dead and the things Ash goes through is over the top and funny. What is also funny is that Ash not only has to deal with evil spirits but also has to deal with the leader of medieval swordsmen to battle the army of the dead and it is hilarious how he teaches and leads the swordsmen how to battle and not act like cowards. Watching Ash being a leader is funny but you as a viewer are rooting for him all the way. AOD is also an homage and parody of films like Jason And The Argonauts and the original Clash Of The Titans in terms of cinematic style and influence,it's an homage to those films but a parody as well especially with the dead skeleton army which is an homage to special effects artist Ray Harryhausen. The skeleton army in the film and the way they're used is absurd and funny and having the army talk and react makes them even funnier. If you love Ray Harryhausen you will AOD. The Action and fight scenes in the film are well-done and fun and add to the film,because the Action isn't always serious to the point when you have to laugh at the wild energy and insanity during the Action scenes and throughout the film. Despite being a sequel to the first two Evil Dead films,some fans maybe a little disappointed to find out that AOD is the lightest film in the Evil Dead trilogy,meaning this film is less of a Horror film and more of Action/Comedy/Fantasy. Where the first two films were Horror films and had blood and gore,AOD was more of an adventure that didn't really need blood or gore because if AOD had that the film would've had a different tone to it and like I said before one of the things I love about the Evil Dead trilogy is that they're all different in tone,if you keep an open mind you'll love all the Evil Dead films including this one because like the first two film AOD has the same crazy and insane energy that the first two had. The ending of the film is a great,Action-packed and very exciting conclusion that will have viewers clapping and cheering at the screen and is one of the reasons that the Evil Dead films,Bruce Campbell and Ash are so legendary and iconic and in the immortal words of Ash it's...groovy.The cast does a great job. Bruce Campbell is excellent once again as Ash,bringing laughs,Action,toughness and great one-liners. Embeth Davidtz is wonderful and beautiful as Shelia,Ash's love interest. Marcus Gilbert gives a good performance as Lord Arthur and plays it straight. Ian Abercrombie is great as the Wiseman. Richard Grove is wonderful in his small role as Duke Henry The Red. Also lookout for cameos from Bridget Fonda(Linda)and Ted Raimi(S-Mart Store Clerk).The direction by Sam Raimi is excellent with Raimi with Raimi going nuts with the camera especially with the POV shots of the demons,the tilted angles and Raimi also does well with the Action scenes. Great job,Raimi.The score by Joseph LoDuca is wonderful and great sounding and fits in with the tone of the film. Great score. Also,lookout for a score cameo from Danny Elfman.The special make-up effects by K.N.B are well-done,memorable and very realistic. K.N.B does it again.In final word,if you love the first two Evil Dead's,Sam Raimi,Bruce Campbell,Action,Comedy or Fantasy,you love Army Of Darkness,a classic film that is an great conclusion to an excellent trilogy. Highly Recommended 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not an Evil Dead movie,"Army of Darkness is nothing like the first two evil dead movies. It has no gore, different setting, and isn't even a horror movie. It is like an action/comedy. I knew it would have a tiny bit more comedy, but I didn't think they would drain out all of the horror. They have really bad special effects, like when someone got stabbed you could tell so much that it was just like the knife you would get for halloween that goes in when you press it against something and out when you took it away, you could even see and hear it going out. I think they meant to for a comedic reason, but it got a little annoying. I just couldn't get into it, and it was pretty predictable too. It did have some pretty funny moments, like when Ash split into too people. Unless you are a big Evil Dead fan, you may want to give this one a pass.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
AoD v. SOTD and Various Editions of AoD on DVD,"Alright--two questions for everybody. I start with the controversy. I recently saw Shaun of the Dead.

All in all, I'd call SOTD a great film, but I'd call Army of Darkness a great movie, if you'll bear with my snobbiness for a minute. What does everybody else think? I loved how SOTD paid homage to AoD when Shaun says ""Ash called out sick today.""Second--I only own AoD on VHS. Before you stone me to death, I really want to purchase AoD on DVD, but there are like three special editions/director's cuts, etc. Which one is best.

The costume work and small stop motion pieces of this movie pleasantly surprised me. I think what brings this film down is the protagonist. Ash just is... annoying. I don't enjoy how arrogant and mean he is at times. I get that he is supposed to be a rough and tumble type of guy from the 20th century but he is basically a dick to everyone except for this one girl, and he's only not a dick to her because he wants to sleep with her. This film is weird, there is a scene in the middle of this film that just felt so out of place. It's like they threw all their cool fight scenes are costumes out the window for some incredibly stupid CGI comedy part. Still though, this movie is fun, and if you like the silliness of older films I would recommend this.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best movies ever,This movie has it all. its very different from the first 2 evil dead movies but don't let this fool you. Ash is funny as hell and this is probably Bruce Campell best part ever. Not everyone will enjoy it though. Its kinda like the 3 Evil Dead movies have evolved from horror to comedy u can already see this a bit in part 2. Anyway its Raimi's best movie by far. I also heard there is going to be a remake of Evil Dead without Bruce Cambell and I'm totally against this idea why would Raimi want to remake it after it was already perfect and why no more Bruce Cambell? Anyway every1 should have seen this movie because its the best movie out their in its genre,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sam Raimi's Three Stooges fixation in full flower!,"Of the three ""Evil Dead"" movies,this one is the silliest, the funniest and the most enjoyable overall.  Throwing aside any pretext of making a horror movie, Mr. Raimi and company pull out every Three Stooges gag they can think of and put them into an evil-spirits-menace-medieval-England millieu. Leading man Bruce Campbell hams it up like never before.This movie also has the greatest number of fighting skeletons outside a Ray Harryhausen movie.",,Anonymous,Horror

Third movie in a row where I'm left wondering what Sam Raimi was doing that made him come up with this.,"Sam Raimi really outdid himself again for the third in the trilogy. Honestly what did I just watch. This one is just off the wall.He reconned the intro to this one again, which was funny again, and went to nowhere and back with the story because why not. Not like the plot is really that important.Really this one was less enjoyable and more just absurd for me to experience. It makes sense that this would be the evolution of the trilogy but it also makes literally no sense at all. But that is literally what the first two were.Really I think I just talked myself into giving this film a higher rating than intended.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Captain Supermarket,I never expected when I first drank in this strange cocktail of early cinema slapstick and cod-fantasy medieval skellington battling over a decade ago that it would be undermined in the intervening years by by a television series. The awkward truth is that Ash vs the Evil Dead does a far sharper job at characterising Campbell's chainsaw-handed bonehead and going from re-watching that to this is jarring. In Army's shallow caper the world he finds himself in is just as cartoonishly juvenile as he is which throws the balance off hugely. The wildly inventive multiple-ash segment is still the only real highlight here for me.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court by Sam Raimi,"That's what I thought when I first saw the movie . I wonder why didn't they call it ""Evil Dead 3"" ? After all it's part of that story . Oh well.The movie is definitely not for everyone . It moves fast , real fast . The characters are barely written . And of course the wild sense of humor won't please everybody . You have to admire Raimi's imagination. The whole movie feels like a crazy mix of cartoon + horror + grindhouse movies.Bruce Campbell rocks as Ash in his macho performance . I can't imagine any other actor playing this part. Yes , sometimes he overacts , but the whole movie has that hiper-active feel to it. The music by Joseph LoDuca is great and the special effects after all these years still look quite good .Compare to two previous movies this one is rather light in terms of violence . Some people might be disappointed with it. Anyway , I had fun . My favourite scene is in the mill.I give it 8/10. Mark Twain would be proud.

Disappointing,"I remember about a year before the movie was released how excited i was to see it. I read every bit of info i could get my hands on regarding the making, especially after loving the second movie so much, i had high expectations for this one. But sadly, i was extremely disappointed. To me, the movie just felt so cheap and amateurish. Of course the first two movies werent exactly of the highest production, but in the third movie, it seemed they just bit off way more than they could chew. The visual effects and stop motion animation looked bad compared to Jason and the Argonauts which this movie was paying homage to, lol.

Bizarre,"My first ever viewing of the Evil Dead films was to watch all three back to back, and I never would have predicted after the first that we would end up with a film like this.It is just so bonkers and bizarre, very shamelessly so. It has no problem poking fun at itself and rejoices in self parody.The plot is one of those where you just have to throw reason and logic out the window and enjoy the ride.In terms of the acting Bruce Campbell plays the part to perfection. Whether you like the part he is playing or not is another question, but you can't fault his commitment to it.The effects are perfectly fine. Quite obviously dated but not so much so that it ruins the enjoyment.This is easily the least scary of the three, with the horror elements largely kicked to the curb in favour of comedy and action.Despite the fact that this is probably the worst Evil Dead film in terms of quality, it is the one I had the most fun with.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Starship Troopers of horror,"This movie is the Starship Troopers of the horror genre. A film created to mock the industry in a way subtle enough to be missed by the casual observer. Army of Darkness is a bit more blatant in its self-ridiculing mannerisms than the preceeding ""Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead II"", yet many miss those overtones while watching. Don't expect the gory shock value of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" nor the psychological depth of ""Saw"", but to appreciate what this film is trying to say, a certain familiarity with horror films of their nature is recommended. As the prototypical cult classic the Evil Dead series will forever remain largely misunderstood, but to those within the cult who understand and appreciate it, these films will leave you wanting ""more sugar baby!""",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"much fun, much horror and much enjoyment",This is a film following on from two cult classics. It's prequel's (Evil dead 1 and 2)were cheap but full of humor and one notable actor (Bruce Campbell). Army of Darkness although my favourite film of all time would have been better as a cult film not a big budget movie. Overall though it is a great laugh the acting performances of the supporting cast work well but the obvious talent of Bruce shines through.Fantastic movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good as a stand alone film, but no Evil Dead","Army of Darkness, when looked at as a singular film, is funny as hell and of course Ash rules!  This film was released as both a stand alone and a sequel to Evil Dead II.  I made the mistake of watching this film the first time back in 93 as a sequel, and I was disappointed.  First of all, they show Ash working in a Walmart-type store.  I'm thinking to myself, ""didn't he timewarp to a medieval world with his car and a saw attached to his arm at the end of E.D. II?  Why is he here?"".  From there on, I lost all respect for what Raimi was trying to do; trying to please both E.D. fans and gain new ones with an original movie.  It just doesn't work on that level.  The lack of plot continuity threw me off.But as a stand alone flick, it rocks!  Funny as hell and cool fx.  I remember when I saw this movie for the second time with a friend, he started humming the theme from ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" because he thought this movie was stupid.  He just didn't get it; it was, for the most part, meant to be that way, with groaner one-liners and silly skeletons.If you've seen the first 2 E.D. movies, don't rent this expecting a continuation of those movies.  Just enjoy it for what it is.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Not Awful, But still a huge disappointment","I am a huge fan of the horror genre & Evil Dead II has to be one of my all time favorites, and whilst Army of Darkness is OK for what it is, it was a huge let down as the third installment in the series.One of my main problems with this movie is that it has nothing to do with the rest of the series, I mean when did a creepy psychological thriller about demonic possession suddenly turn into a medieval fantasy epic.Whilst I found allot of the slapstick humor quite quite amusing and Bruce Campbell's one-liners delightful (his acting is one of the main redeeming features of this movie), I still don't see how this movie is anything like the rest of the films, which where very brutal gory horrors (This movie is pretty tame in the gore department and I can't even except that it is a horror movie).I think that this movie that just suffers for being too close to the original, I think it is good for what it is but as part of the Evil Dead series it is HUGE disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is because he didn't find it scary at all.GEEEZ!!! Can you believe that??? He didn't find ""Army of Darkness"" scary... hmmmm???? ....

"Comedy, Camp, and Chainsaws","Army of Darkness, directed by Sam Raimi, is a distinct and often humorous addition to the Evil Dead franchise that moves away from the traditional horror formula, blending elements of fantasy, comedy, and adventure. The film follows Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell), who is transported to a medieval world and forced to battle an army of undead. Combining slapstick humour and campy effects, Army of Darkness creates a quirky experience that leans more towards cult comedy than pure horror. While it may not resonate with all fans of the series, its absurdity and memorable one-liners offer a unique charm.Bruce Campbell delivers a wildly entertaining performance as Ash, fully embracing the over-the-top action-hero persona. His delivery of iconic lines such as ""This is my boomstick!"" perfectly encapsulates the film's self-aware tone, blending humour with physical comedy. Campbell's charismatic, exaggerated portrayal holds the film together, making him a captivating protagonist and a cult icon for fans.Raimi's direction takes a lighter approach than previous entries in the franchise, employing playful camera angles and slapstick gore, which showcase his versatility as a filmmaker. The medieval setting, while creative, sometimes feels disconnected from the horror roots of Evil Dead, resulting in a film that is more of a fantasy adventure than a horror-comedy. The special effects, though charmingly dated, enhance the campy feel but may seem out of place for those expecting a darker, more horrific tone.While Army of Darkness is fun and quotable, it lacks the tension and horror elements that defined Evil Dead and Evil Dead II. Some fans may appreciate the film's absurdity, but others might find that it strays too far from the franchise's gritty charm. The film's disjointed tone and shift away from horror may limit its appeal, but it remains a cult favourite for its humour and inventive style.In conclusion, Army of Darkness is an entertaining, offbeat entry in the Evil Dead series. Although it lacks the scares of its predecessors, its comedic twist and Bruce Campbell's performance make it memorable. For those seeking a traditional horror experience, it may not satisfy, but it stands as a distinct chapter in the franchise's legacy.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The great medieval adventure of Ash Williams,"Coming into the third and final chapter of the original trilogy, we see Ash Williams facing his greatest challenge yet. This movie offers more details about Ash as a character, since in the previous movies he was just a generic surviving character. Here he gets to know him more and clearly he's a jerk who's been through a lot in the previous movies and doesn't want to face evil. Here Ash comes to evolve in a certain way, since he has no choice but to face the forces of evil if he wishes to return to his home. The curious thing about this film is that, unlike the previous ones, it completely moves away from terror and abandons gore as a medieval fantasy comedy. Sam Raimi originally planned for this film to be a medieval horror story with enough epic saga humor to wrap up the trilogy, but Universal wouldn't let him. The reason was because the company did not want a horror movie, but an action movie. That completely changed Raimi's plans causing him to modify several things that he had planned. That is why this film has another title and is the softest in the saga, but it maintains the rhythm and humor of the saga. Of course, here the humor becomes more explicit, making this film quite a comedy. Also, Universal's intervention was another reason why the film had two different endings. The original, which could have given the saga a definitive closure, could only be seen in the extended version, which has more humorous moments. Without a doubt this film could have been an epic horror and fantasy story. Fortunately, what can be admired a lot about this movie is its amazing special effects and makeup. It has very good sequences like the battle against the skeletons. Even Joseph LoDuca's soundtrack is also admirable. While this movie isn't an epic terrifying ending to the original trilogy, it is a fun comedy-fantasy movie that delivers some amazingly hilarious moments. My final rating for this movie is 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
If You Think AoD is Horror...,"...you're sorely mistaken.  AoD is a throwback (and a parody, much as Monty Python & The Holy Grail is ) of the big box-office epics of stuff like Excalibur.  The ""horror"" elements are basically relatively insignificant, and AoD effortlessly parodies fantasy action/adventure f;ocls by transposing a modern-day man into medieval times (much like A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court).  The first two Evil Deads are basically an excuse for this movie, so don't look for any real continuity either in plot or Ash's characterization.  You can see the seeds of Raimi's revisionist/historical Hercules/Xena here, whether in the non-existent nod to historical accuracy, or the goofy fight scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Gotta love those stop-motion skeletons,"There's a lot of fun stuff in this movie, especially from Bruce Campbell (the quintessential King of Camp), and Sam Raimi is definitely a talented director, but it doesn't quite compare to the previous movie, Evil Dead II, despite its bigger budget.  I think the problem is that the fun and charm that made Evil Dead II so good comes off pretty forced and more obvious in this movie, especially with the cartoony sound effects and Campbell going REALLY over-the-top as Evil Ash and the Tiny Ashes.  The best stuff was with the army of skeletons (brought to life with puppets and stop-motion animation) bickering with one another.

I don't really know what the point of the film is know, it's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's not cool enough to be a great action movie, it's not even slightly scary.

Evil Dead 3,"When I first watched this, I had no idea it was part of a series. It's been over 10 years since then and I have re-watched this (after watching Evil Dead 1 & 2) and it still very much holds up. As part 2 did, this invents a totally different back-story to support the new direction this is going. While part 2 also hinted on the funnier side of horror, this almost goes completely overboard with it! And it also shows Sam Raimis love for ""The Day the Earth stood still"" (the original that is, not the awful Keanu Reeves remake).The movie had it tough though and Sam had to shoot a different ending than he intended. I actually like both endings (should be on the disc you're about to buy/rent), but I did watch the commercial/producers request one first. I might tend to like that one more because it seems to come full circle. Whatever your feelings are, this is funny and I can only hope an Army of Darkness 2 entry here on IMDb (even for 2016) proves to be legit (we've been waiting for so long now)!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

There's nothing to not love about this movie.,"Army of Darkness (1992) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline picks up where Evil Dead 2 left off with Ash waking up after being sucked through a void and into Medieval times 🏰. He has been captured and is about to be tortured to death when it's discovered he has powers from the future and can help the people find the Necronomicon that will both protect their lands and send him back to his own time. The evils of the land and the Necronomicon won't be make it easy for our hero.This gem is directed by Sam Raimi (Spider-Man) and stars Bruce Campbell (Bubba Ho-tep), Embeth Davidtz (Bicentennial Man), Marcus Gilbert (Rambo III), Bridget Fonda (Point of No Return), Bill Moseley (House of 1000 Corpses) and Ted Raimi (Drag me to Hell).Army of Darkness brilliantly shifts gears from the first two Evil Dead pictures and gives us more of an Action Horror masterpiece. We get all of the great Ash one-liners, which is on overdrive in this film. Bruce Campbell delivers a tremendous performance and a fun narration throughout the film. The settings, props, and attire all capture the imagination of the era perfectly. The make-up and depiction of the deadites was perfect and the scenarios our hero has to overcome are both funny and wildly entertaining. There's also underrated camera angles and cinematography to give the audience a feel for the desperation Ash finds himself in. The villain is fantastic and well delivered and the conclusion is great, both the final battle and grocery store sequence. There's nothing to not love about this movie.Overall, I'd rate this the second best evil dead movie:1) Evil Dead 2
2) Army of Darkness
3) Evil Dead
4 Evil Dead Rise
5) Evil Dead RemakeThis is an absolute must see that I would score an 8.5/10 and strongly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Second best Evil Dead,This is an excellent film with a few holes. Probably the second best in the series but lacks a little horror that made the first two so great. This is more an action film than anything else. It would have been better as a horror action with some comedy. This is very funny with one scare element and really is enjoyable but this enjoyment is aimed at a wider market and tragically suffers a little for it. A definite must for fans of the first two. Enjoy this classic early action from Sam Raimi - a precursor to Spider-Man? This is pure silliness and I love it! The sets look small and the action is tame but the comedy and the Bruce of it make it excellent.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Three Stooges meets Willow and The Mask,"What happened here? I don't quite understand how this works...Two fantastic, disturbing, and fun horror movies shocked and amused us at the same time, The Evil Dead and Evil Dead II. Evil Dead II left us with an amusingly unfortunate and suggestive ending, Ash got sucked into the portal and found himself in medieval times.Okay, so he's in medieval times, it does leave the expectation that the next movie would be more of an 'adventure' than a horror, but this still isn't quite what was expected. Instead we got this strange comedy 'spin off' if that's what we can call it, Army of Darkness.If you haven't already guessed by the fact that the title doesn't even include the words ""Evil Dead"", this is going to be very different...The problem is, although a very entertaining flick on its own, especially for somebody who hasn't seen the original Evil Dead movies, this movie hardly bares any resemblance to the original 2 films. Ash is a different character alltogether, his cowardly behaviour and developing insanity are gone, and have been replaced by a one-liner spouting superhero who likes to say ""baby"" a lot. There is no gore at all. There are only 3 'deadites' or possessed people from the original films and they are all at the start(the only part which had even a remote resemblance to the original 2 films) the rest of the movie is filled with living skeletons with English countryman accents.I'm sorry to sound harsh about this film, but you just don't think Evil Dead when you see a man's face stretched out of proportion like a cartoon and shaking it back into shape.Don't get me wrong though, this is a good movie. It's thoroughly entertaining. Just try to forget it's an Evil Dead movie. Don't be expecting an ""Evil Dead 3"", because it doesn't work as one, which is probably the reason why New Line insisted there was no ED3 in the film's title. The relationship it shares with the original ED movies is pretty much the same as ""Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare"" shared with the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies. It involved the characters, but it was different, and pretty much just a big joke.It's best to see Army of Darkness as a fun flick made to answer the people who wonder ""Wouldn't it be funny to see what actually happened to ash in medieval times."".As I said in my summary, it's like The Three Stooges meets Willow and The Mask. It's a fantasy adventure, with cartoony out of proportion slapstick humour.",,Anonymous,Horror
Bad film,"This film had a lot of promise. The idea that a modern man would be transported into the Middle Ages and learn that the demons and witches are real, is pretty cool. The problem is that the film makers decided to write this so as to appeal to the mentality of mildly autistic teenage boys, and virtually no one else. The film never manages to rise above that pit of mediocrity it dug for itself at the start. It's a real shame, as this could have been a much better film.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silly but lots of fun!,"Being a huge fan of the Evil Dead franchise, and a huge Bruce Campbell fan in general, I knew I was going to enjoy this. It totally abandons the horror aspect of the first 2, but is still A lot of fun.The plot is completely off-the-wall, and I loved it. It picks up where ED2 leaves off, with Ash transported to the Middle Ages. He has to find the Necronomicon in order to return to his own time, but inadvertently unleashes Hell upon the world...literally. Great plot, kept me absorbed and enthralled from beginning to end.Ash has got to be one of the greatest characters ever put on film. He really comes into his own in this one, spouting more one-liners than ever. Bruce Campbell is a very underrated actor who really deserves more recognition. The rest of the cast are pretty good as well.Though it's nothing like it's predecessors, this is a great film.

"Fun, fun, fun!","Bruce Campbell returns as the hapless hero Ash in this third instalment in Sam Raimi's exceptional Evil Dead' series. In Army of Darkness' Ash is transported back through time to 13th Century England where he must yet again do battle with the evil deadites if he is to ever stand a chance of being transported back to his own time.Continuing the comical feel that Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn' so brilliantly executed and now almost steering clear of any horror aspect, Army of Darkness' is nothing more than a stylish comic romp with the usual sheer brilliance of Sam Raimi's unique direction. The story, albeit far-fetched, plays perfectly and very little of the movie fails to entertain. There are some obvious plot-holes but unlike the original, and to a small extent the first sequel, this is not in any way a serious movie but in fact a well thought out and well scripted comic fantasy. Having said that there are still many horror elements to the movie, but they are there more for the comedy rather than to shock or scare. Fans of the previous movies will be treated to an Evil Ash, an army of skeletons and the typical deadites that we came to love (well you know what I mean) in the first place.Bruce Campbell is at his zany best as Ash, once again delivering his one line catchphrases the way only he can and unlike the previous two movies he is aided this time around by a relatively strong supporting cast including Embeth Davidtz in an early career role as the female lead Sheila. Campbell and Davidtz seem to share some type of special on-screen chemistry which makes their interactions with each other throughout the movie all that more distinctive.Once again the viewer is treated to some top notch special effects and inspired direction which come together magnificently to produce the wonderful Army of Darkness'. Despite perhaps being overly camp at times and being rather distant from the beginnings of the series I personally rate Army of Darkness' as one of the better movies of the 1990's and would recommend it as an accomplished and different second sequel. Not much horror but as a horror-comedy fantasy it's hard to beat! My rating for Army of Darkness'  7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Good, bad. I'm the guy with the gun.""","Briefly recapping the previous films in the ""Evil Dead"" franchise, ""Army of Darkness"" then picks up as the poor, bedeviled Ash (Bruce Campbell) is magically transported back to 1300 A.D. and the days of Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert). He learns that in order to get back to his original time and place, he must once again lay his hands on that damned book known as the Necronomicon. His evolution into obnoxious moron now complete, Ash is so dense that he can only remember two of the three words that he needs to utter before removing the book from its resting place. In so doing, he resurrects an army of skeletal warriors (a nice nod to ""Jason and the Argonauts"") that will be led by an evil version of himself.Some fans of the previous movies simply don't care for this entry, largely because it's much too comedic and silly, not to mention light on true horror, for their tastes. But this viewer has always loved it, because it seems that co-writer / director Sam Raimi (who penned the script with his brother Ivan) was having so much fun. ""Army of Darkness"" is basically a spoof of the entire medieval fantasy genre, and it has some great gags, in addition to some highly quotable dialogue. (""Gimme some sugar, baby."") The studly Campbell shows off plenty of comedy chops in the leading role, who through the course of the story finally becomes a genuine hero. Production design (by Tony Tremblay) and cinematography (by Bill Pope) are wonderfully atmospheric, and the effects, for the most part, are delightfully done. Past Raimi collaborator Joseph LoDuca composes most of the music, with Danny Elfman supplying a rousing new ""March of the Dead"" theme.Campbell is nicely supported by the lovely Embeth Davidtz as leading lady Sheila, Ian Abercrombie as the old wise man, and Richard Grove as Arthurs' human nemesis Duke Henry the Red. ""Evil Dead"" fan Bridget Fonda has a cameo as Linda; also doing the cameo thing are Patricia Tallman as the gnarly possessed witch, and Raimis' actor brother Ted (in a few roles). Bill Moseley plays a Deadite captain.Among the highlights: Ash being tortured by miniature versions of himself, his duels with Evil Ash, and the final raid on Arthurs' castle & compound.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

For all those that have asked, no you don't need to see Evil Dead 1 and 2 to understand or even appreciate this.It takes the horror elements of the first ones, and lets Bruce do what he does best...over the top acting delivering brilliant one liners. Probably as many one liners get repeated from this film as any Monty Python film, so that's saying something. It's not blockbuster quality, by today's standards, but that's probably some of the appeal. There's nothing wrong with the puppetry used, and the ""splash gore"" fits right in.So pull out your boom stick and give this one a watch. Over and over.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A hilarious comedy,"If you completely ignore the fact that The Evil Dead was a horror movie, you will find this movie hilarious. I have only seen the director's cut and I loved it. There is no bloody gore unlike the first two and there is no horror in the atmosphere. There is not a single scary part to this movie. It is hilarious. The one-liners he uses make no sense to the time period, which I think is very funny. The mini Ashes attacking big Ash and the face stretch, I think, are incredibly hilarious. They may be a little cartoony, but it is entertaining to watch. The skeleton army is also quite entertaining to listen too. An excellent comedy",,Anonymous,Horror
"Just Comedy, and hardly any horror","Good movie if you love slapstick over horror. They did serious on the first, then some serious and more comedy on the redone second film, which is just a considered remake from the director, so he could add on the sequel of this movie. This one though is really mostly comedy over anything else. Not really a rated R kind of movie at all. The tamest movie in the series. The 3 stooges kind of scene, is beyond pathetic and not even funny. How people think stupid is funny is beyond me. Don't get me wrong, that this is a good movie but that is it good. The worst in the series. I even think the new Evil Dead 2013 is in the middle of the first and redone second. This one, is just what the heck kind of movie. This reminds me too much like Back to the Future III without a time machine. Should of been rated PG-13 for lack of gore and swearing, and no nudity. What I do not get, is why the director thought comedy is better than horror, when it tainted the series. Even the new one wipes this one out of the scene. When I go to watch the movies again. I debate on even watching this one at all. That is how bottom of the series this one is.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Must see cult classic!!!,"Army of Darkness is without a doubt the best installment of the Evil Dead series. Army of Darkness is more or less a sequel to Evil Dead 2. But don't worry you won't have to see Evil Dead 2 to be picked up to speed to what's going on since the story so far is summarized by Ash in the beginning of the film. The Story is about a man named Ashley Williams(Ash) who goes to a cabin with his girlfriend. Unspeakable terror happens at the cabin because of an evil book called the Necronomicon and Ash is sucked into a vortex that brings him into the middle ages. Because the town their is infested by evil, Ash is asked to retrieve the Necronomicon to banish the evil. The Army of Darkness is released because of a mistake made by Campbell and it's up to him and his army to rid the town of evil. Army of Darkness is an outstanding movie even to this day.

Stupid ain't the same as Funny...,"We were en route to see ARMY OF DARKNESS when a former friend and I spotted Sam Raimi on a local side street shooting second unit footage for THE HUDSUCKER PROXY. It was cold and raining and my buddy thought I was full of s--- when I yelled at him to stop. He shot me a quizzical look and asked me why. ""Back there,"" I said: ""It's Sam Raimi- the guy who made ARMY OF DARKNESS."" Whereupon he informed me that I was full of s---. ""Just let me out and go around the block and pick me up,"" I begged: ""I just want to see him in person."" And he did. And I did. Then we went and saw ARMY OF DARKNESS. I warned him going in that it wouldn't be half as good as EVIL DEAD II (which we'd both loved); afterward, he thanked me for the heads up: he was better able to accept the movie for what it was (and wasn't). I've been a Raimi fan since first I laid eyes on THE EVIL DEAD, but I've often wondered if he really GETS the difference between Stupid and Funny.

"A Classic Movie, Give Us Some More Sugar Baby.","I hope director Sam Raimi is not finished with the Evil Dead series. Sure his Hercules and Xena Warrior Princess shows are doing great, but nothing is quite like his Evil Dead Series.Army of Darkness takes us to medieval times (a continuation of where Evil Dead 2 left off) where Ash has become known as the promised one who will rid the people of this time of all the dead that have risen from the grave.This film was called 'Army Of Darkness' because this was the first Evil Dead movie that had a wide theatrical release. They didn't want movie goers skipping it because they hadn't seen the previous two. It does stand by itself, but I would recommend following the whole series. They changed the beginning of this film a bit from the ending of the Evil Dead 2. Where in Evil Dead 2 Ash falls through the rip in time, and is instantly saluted as the promised one, he is now thought to be an enemy. He has to prove himself to the population first.  Unfortunate, but I'm sure it made a better storyline.The rest of the movie is a classic horror/comedy. Sam Raimi has invented an entire new genre with the Evil Dead series. It's a fun movie that has clever little things inside. For instance the chant 'Klaatu Verada Nicto' taken from The Day The Earth Stood Still. H. P. Lovecraft's Necronomicon, and copies of Fangoria magazine are all little things that made this movie fun for me.This is the American version however, and was altered. The main difference was the ending. The ending was too depressing for U.S. audiences according to the movie studios, so they changed it. That is unfortunate.

"Sir Ash, Lord of the medieval madness","""Army Of Darkness"" is a 1993 horror comedy directed by Sam Raimi starring Bruce Campbell and Embeth Davidtz. The final chapter of Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" trilogy is the most overexcited of them all. While the shift from splatter horror to horror comedy sounds weird, but is still imaginable, the idea that the third outing is a medieval fantasy comedy is absolutely overwhelming. Centered around our chainsaw and shotgun wielding anti-hero, Ash Williams, the whole plot takes place in 1300 A.D. - and as messed up as it sounds - it's absolute fun from start to finish. The premise might sound tremendously ludicrous, but the execution managed to be ludicrous in a good way . It has a cheap but adorable charme to it. Mostly thanks to the crafty dialogue and absurd humour of the Raimi brothers the odd atmosphere comes to life. Next to exaggerated slapstick stunts (that pay an homage to the Stooges!) and hilarious, but well crafted visual effects, it even offers a decent story with extreme absurdity and ridiculous comedy gold. Let's not forget to mention the score, especially the theme of the army itself. Some scenes are too ridiculous even for my taste, but it's the style of the film that fills me with vast infantile joy. The final battle, with all its pompousness and impressive stop-motion effects, feels weirdly epic in its own unique way. It appeals to the inner child in all of us and it doesn't want to achieve anything more. All in all, this film is a treat for hardcore fans of the predecessors. It's stylish, weird and absurd from start to finish and if you can embrace the medieval madness you'll enjoy it as I did it. It's not everybody's darling, but a groovy end of an iconic horror franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Definitely Raimi's most personal  and best movie,"This is definitely Sam Raimi's best movie. No one but him could have made such a tour-De-force. I have always admired Raimi, his way of shooting and all his camera-acrobatics (at least until this one movie......), which I think represents an unmistakable trademark. The story starts right where The Evil Dead 2 left about 8 years before, but since the first lines it's clear that this movie is gonna take a different way. The movie itself is already funny (of course in a horrific way), but the winning at-out, that something which gives it the push to get beyond, is Bruce Campbell's re-interpretation of an old favorite character, the brave and unstoppable Ash, who, as usual, is fighting zombies, monsters and demons while pursuing the ill-famed Necronomicon, the latter ravenous and conspicuous as ever. Bruce's acting and mimic skills are here really in evidence, he shows a great feeling for his character but most of all he makes you laugh, he makes you laugh a lot with his unforgettable sentences and his unique, exuberant fight style.

"The ending to a very good, but rather odd set of movies.","The first movie was Evil Dead then came Evil Dead II and finally this little gem, Army of Darkness. The first one was almost pure horror, while the second interjected some humor here and there, but was still mainly a horror while this one has very little horror at all and is more of an action comedy. Once again this movie sort of picks off where the previous movie leaves off, sort of as we have our hero Ash transported back to medieval times where he is mistaken for a member of an opposing army. The previous movie had him hailed as a hero right away, but here he is taken prisoner and forced to fight the evil dead in a very cool pit fighting scene. He quickly wins the respect of the ones who tried to kill him and he is sent on a quest to fetch a book that has the ability to send away the evil dead and help him get back to his own time. What ensues are some very funny scenes and a rather big battle at the end which is also rather funny, lets face it seeing a guy picking up obvious fake skeletons and acting like they are attacking is just humorous. Bruce Campbell is great in this movie, however no one else in the cast really sticks out all that much except for the main villain who also just happens to be Bruce Campbell.

You can't put this movie into any one, or even two genre's (horror, fantasy, adventure, comedy, action). Lets just call it great campy fun. The reason this all works is because of Bruce Campbells character Ash. Ash is simply too cool for his own good and you will just enjoy watching him in every situation. It may not be a classic in the usual sense of the word but for pure camp and fun it's in a class all it's own. Hail to the king baby!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Deliciously campy, wildly funny horror-comedy-action romp.  Good to the last line!","Packed to the gills with hilarious one-liners, this film is an absolute classic.  Bruce Campbell (who was wonderful as the title character in ""The Adventures of Brisco County Jr."") reprises his role as Ash in this third installment of Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" series, playing the ruggedly handsome, lovably pompous, smart-ass anti-hero with terrific flair and energy, not to mention presence, charisma, style, and charm.  Big time movie buffs will appreciate AoD's throw-backs to earlier cinema (""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""Jason and the Argonauts""), and the amusingly uncharacteristic casting choice of ""Schindler's List""'s Embeth Davitz as Sheila, Ash's love interest, but there is enough in this impishly clever flick to make it a must-see for anyone looking for funfunfunfunfun!!!!

The best bad movie ever.,"This movie really is not scary, it took more of a comic approach. It is part of the Evil Dead series, which started out going for the old scary routine. When they realized they weren't getting it, they went for a half-serious, half-comedy idea. For this one, I think they had about $300 to do the movie, and went for an all-out comedy movie. They succeeded in making one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but made it hilarious at the random, and unexplained jumps and objects in the movie. I would definitely pay the $2 again to rent this, and I might even buy it. I would also definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good laugh.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excessive consumption of alcohol: the cure for chronic sequelitis.,"I absolutely loved the The Evil Dead, a brilliantly inventive splatter-fest that showed how a low budget needn't be a restriction on creativity; sadly, I found the sequel to be a bit of a disappointment in comparison, being little more than a rehash of the original, only with the horror diluted somewhat by director Sam Raimi's proclivity for slapstick humour. The very last scene in Evil Dead II, where hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) is thrown back in time to defeat a medieval 'deadite', did however offer a glimmer of hope, suggesting that a third chapter might be a little more epic in scope and would expound considerably on the Evil Dead mythos.Five years after EDII, and I finally got my chance to see how Raimi's vision would pan out, securing tickets to an early screening of Army of Darkness at The London Film Festival; unfortunately, after a long wait in a pub knocking back Jack Daniels, I was completely rat-arsed by the time the performance started. The next morning, all I could recall about the film was the final shot, an impressive post-apocalyptic vista with Ash screaming in dismay at his eventual plight; this excellent bleak ending led me to believe that Raimi had made amends for the predictability and dreadful physical comedy of EDII and that I had just sat totally mullered through a possible future favourite.When Army of Darkness got its official release, however, a second viewing revealed the film to be far from the inspired horror classic I hoped it to be: instead, I was shocked to find that the Three Stooges inspired buffoonery had taken complete precedence over scares. Army of Darkness was a relatively horror-free effort packed with drawn-out slapstick routines (albeit ones performed by skeletons and miniature evil versions of Ash) and that Ash had been turned into a jerk of massive proportions; worse still, the cool downbeat ending had been replaced by a dreadfully cheesy crowd-pleaser. Grrrrr!The moral of this tale: if you're a huge fan of the visceral approach of the first film, but didn't care so much for the second, watch Army of Darkness completely blotto. And make sure it's the Director's Cut.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
My favourite movie of ALL TIME!,"I'll start off by saying that this is my favourite movie of all time. Not at all for it's amazing acting, effect, story or ANYTHING that normally makes up a good movie. Now if you're reading this you've probably already seen the movie, so you'll know what I'm talking about. This movie is amazingly fun and, being the first movie I saw by Sam Raimi, I'm now obsessed with his movies.

It's the way almost every guy would love to be...or maybe that's just me. But anyway, if you haven't seen this movie RENT IT NOW. If you have, show ALL your friends.

This movie is so good that a scene in ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" was actually based on a scene from this movie(almost holding a candle near gunpowder).

My favorite of the bunch,"Funny, entertaining, and absolutely ridiculous- Army of Darkness may not hit home on every front, but it is certainly the best film in the franchise. The film is largely held superior by Bruce Campbell's larger than life performance, which is both hilariously over the top, and incredibly entertaining and stupid to watch (in the best of ways). The film takes a much different approach, for the most part, than the previous installments, which some may call as a fault, but I think it is what makes it so uniquely enjoyable. The film works best when it is doing its own thing, instead of relying on the messy timeline of the films before it. The gags and visuals are quite enjoyable, although some do not hold up super well today (mainly the skeletons). The films pacing is far greater than the other films, providing a solidly entertaining, and very odd ride, that is enjoyable from start to finish. The films biggest flaw is when it relies on previous film ideas too harshly to a fault, and relying on miscommunication tropes, and formulaic attributes to tell its own story. Best said, it is better when it is being original, instead of when it is not. In the end, Army of Darkness was a surprisingly enjoyable third installment in a film franchise I never quite enjoyed as everyone else, but i'm glad I enjoyed this one. It's often very funny, amusing, and so ridiculous it's hard to take your eyes off of the screen.

Possibly the best worst comedy on video.,"This one's a Halloween evening favorite at my house; just watched the widescreen DVD, and enjoyed it again. It's not for everyone: if you roll your eyes at campy humor, grimace at continuity errors (how many *are* there? Count and see!), or expect flashy special effects, you may not get the proper groove out of it. It is for those who enjoy silly humor, low-budget movies, Bruce Campbell's work on TV, or for that matter TV's 'Xena' and 'Hercules', which he and the Raimi brothers have worked on. The DVD features a 'bonus' of sorts, as the Wayne and Garth types who did the special effects are interviewed.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Good, bad, I'm the one with the gun.","When it comes to cheesy cult cinema starring Bruce Campbell, I am a fan. Bruce has a certain panache that other actors do not have. I do not think that he would be accepted as a mainstream hero, however go into any comic book shop and ask them who there favorite cult actor is and chances are that a good percentage will say Bruce Campbell. He possesses ineffable characteristics that attract a fervent following. His characters have minimal differences like any of Clint Eastwood's western portrayals. They are always cocky, austere, and always ready for the one-liner quips. His portrayal of Ash in the Evil Dead series is no exception.Army of Darkness is the third film in the Evil Dead series. It is more silly, less gory, and more irreverent than Evil Dead II. Unfortunately, like most 'cult' films it was a disappointment at the box office and there will be no fourth film (as of yet). Army of Darkness takes place after Ash defeated the phantasm in Evil Dead II and then was sucked into a vortex that sent him into the medieval past. A slight discrepancy between II and III is that in II he shot a flying 'deadite' creature and was revered at the ending in two, but in three, he begins in chains as a prisoner.He escapes his fetters with the help of his ""boomstick"" and is sent on a quest to find the Necronomicon -- the book of the dead. This will help him get back to the future as well as rid the land of the evil curse. However, he has to say the right words before picking the book up. Otherwise, he will unleash the ""Army of Darkness."" Can Ash do this without screwing up?Raimi, who also directed Evil Dead I and II, has an eye for allusion. There are more Three Stooges references in this film then a Mel Gibson flick. He also alludes to Taxi Driver and Rambo. There is even an issue of Fangoria in Ash's trunk. Raimi's schlock sense of humor is a bizarre mix of slapstick and horror. One of the funniest scenes is when an army of mini Ashs confronts Ash and one of them jumps in the mouth of Ash and in order to kill it Ash swallows boiling water. It then mutates Ash into two separate Ashs -- on evil and one good. The banter between the two provides some ecstatically funny scenes.Army of Darkness has the best use of skeletons since Jason and the Argonauts. They are an integral part of the latter half of the movie. Of course, I liked most of this movie. Sure there are plot problems and logical mistakes, but I enjoyed this film because of its originality and Campbell's character. One of the reasons this film has a cult following is because there are not many films similar to Army of Darkness. However, this film has not been accepted by the mainstream, it is embraced by a select fanatic few.Alternate Ending:I am going to be vague describing my feelings on the ending. I do not want to spoil it for anyone who has not seen the movie. I have not seen the new DVD version that has many extra scenes. I am referring to the special edition Army of Darkness that has the alternate ending after the credits.Supposedly, the alternate ending was the original ending. While I enjoyed watching it, I felt the theatrical ending was stronger. While the alternate ending had a twist that was akin to its predecessor, it reminded me too much of the ending for Planet of the Apes. The theatrical ending was more aesthetically pleasing to me. I felt it was more true to the movie. It also left an opening for a sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The old stile of making these very bad special effects is somehow more interesting then the now-days horror movies. In the time of The evil deads, the crew was working really hard on making it look as good as possible, and they succeeded. the army of darkness looks more like a slapstick kinda flick instead of the first evil dead that scared the hell out of me, being a young boy back then.

A Cult Classic,"Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness has got to be one of the most quotable movies of all time.  I highly recommend it to anyone who's having a movie watching party and wants a flick that's a lot of fun to watch with a big group of friends.There have been lots of crappy comic book movies in recent years (Batman and Robin has to top the list), and while AoD isn't based on any comic book, it is probably the best filmed version of comic book sensibilities I have seen. It's goofy, funny, exciting, while never taking itself too seriously. Bruce Campbell would be a great super-hero in any movie, and here, as Ash he's just about perfect.  Sure he's got the block chin, but besides that, he is a fantastic physical comedian, and a highly underrated actor.The effects range from cheesy good to cheesy bad, but even at their worst they only add to the goofy fun.  For those looking for the horror or very black comedy of the previous two Evil Deads should look elsewhere, or at least expect AoD to be quite different.

In each installment of the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, he seems to be trying too hard--one-upping himself constantly in terms of horror and humor, but with neither of those elements being very strong to begin with. ""Army of Darkness"" is the third installment in the trilogy, a film that thinks it's a lot funnier and scarier than it really is.  Most of the time, Raimi wants to covey, as loudly as possible, ""ISN'T THIS HILARIOUS? IT'S OH-SO OVER-THE-TOP!"" when, in reality, it's not.  Special effects eventually take over the meager plot.  Bruce Campbell is a capable leading man who gives the material his all, but he's mostly reduced to uttering hit-or-miss one-liners.

Less horrific and less dark than the other two, it is one thing... funny as hell. (literally I guess as well as figuratively) Not quite as good as the other two (Evil Dead and ED2) because of the exodus from the main theme. However, the main character is the stealer-of-the-show. You find yourself rooting for him and knowing that, this time, he is going to come out on top. Maybe. This movie is a must-see for just about anyone that likes off-beat humor.

"A must see movie, if you love horror movies!","First of all this is a very strange movie! It is really funny and very interesting too. Well the plot maybe a bit boring, but the chase and horror scenes seem to be very original and intelligent to me.The hero of the movie is Ash (Bruce Campbell) who opens the Necromonicon, a book that consists of human skin and is written with human blood, and thus gets kind of teleported with the book into medieval times. More interesting is that the book now lies on a cemetery and Ash will have to retrieve it in order to manage to get back into present time! Well the movie would have been a bit shorter if the book have been teleported right with Ash. Well let's believe this!Ash, also has a chain saw instead of one of his hands to fight the creatures which terrorise the medieval kings and knights. Well, more should not be told, watch the movie it is very interesting!Now to the original scenes. The one where Ash hides into a wind mill in and a broken mirror brings little Ashes to life which fight him is absolutely brilliant!

One fun movie,"If anyone can view this film and then say to me that Sam Raimi is not an ""auteur"", I'll cram the entire Evil Dead trilogy down their throat.  Sam's movies are always fun and visually unique, and Army of Darkness is no exception.  Here, Bruce Campbell's Ash character becomes a sort of wise-cracking action hero, as opposed to the zombie punching-bag he was in the earlier films, and the focus of the series shifts from comedy-horror to supernatural comedy-action.  The film is a total trip from start to end, and Raimi's oddball camera tricks coupled with Campbell's over-the-top performance add to the fun.  Also listen for some great one-liners, which have been ripped off in other media (Duke Nukem, most notoriously).  A must-see for anyone who likes total escapism.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A cult movie that lives up to its reputation.,"I LOVE this movie! I have yet to see the other 2 installments in the trilogy in their entirety, but I can already tell that this is my favourite. I first saw it on video in '94 and was laughing pretty hard. I saw it again last year and was pleasantly surprised. It holds up well to repeat viewings. Some viewers complain about Bruce's acting style, but it's totally in character with the rest of the film. As a bonus, we're treated to an early glimpse of Embeth Davidtz, who of course went on to Schindler's List and a turn in another great subversive film, Matilda. The homage to Ray Harryhausen in the finale is great. I had a friend complain to me that the special effects in the movie were great up until the Deadite battle, which he considered cheesy. I think he missed the point. This is a fun movie, pure and simple. Sam has moved on to bigger things, and turned into a ""serious"" director, which is a shame. The industry needs less serious directors and more inventive visual stylists, of which Sam is one of a dying breed. It's a pity.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

That's the part where people clearly went too far.,"Of course it is nice to see the same scenario in a different environment and that in the same film series but what I do not like at all is that the sound and the mood of the movie are completely in another direction.The narrative arc where unfortunately spanned and the humor exaggerates it in many places and tried too often convulsively funnier than he should.This of course results in the fact that most of the film is completely unpleasant, the whole serious moments are only mediocre and I did not enjoy this movie. And that's a mistake, such movies are not there to teach people or to make them think so much, these movies are supposed to be fun and have cool effects, though the effects could somehow be seen, I am really disappointed that it has become so boring and unpleasant I should not have been that.i like the end the alternative ending is actually pretty cool too and if it were not for Bruce Campbell I would not like this movie at all but unfortunately it is my least favorite part.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Masterpiece,"Simply amazing. Pure, unadulterated, almost guilty cinematic fun. Sam and Ivan Raimi's character Ash from the Evil Dead series returns in this sequel. After being sucked into a time vortex he finds himself in medieval, feudal Europe. Ash faces trial after hysterical trial, from poker-wielding mini-Ash's, to a ""Bad Ash"" alter ego (""Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."") as he quests for the Necronomicon to rid the world of the evil and send him back to the 20th Century. The over the top, ultra-macho yet hilariously inept Ash is perfectly played by Bruce Campbell. The wild, frantic and funny script is flawlessly complemented by Sam Raimi's ultra-kinetic cinematography. With Army of Darkness, Raimi shows that he's a true auteur with a definite style that exponentially enhances the narrative. He's having fun, and so do we. All in all, it's a filmic treat that never ceases to entertain and be so much fun, it almost shouldn't be legal.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The most under-rated film ever?,"Every once in a while, a film comes along that just seems to slip through the net.  Ask many film-lovers about this movie, and often they won't even have heard of it.  Mention ""Evil Dead"", and they will definitely remember the first one, and possibly the second. How did this happen?  Is it because it is just a bad movie, best forgotten? Well, you would be forgiven for thinking so.The amazing thing is that this is, quite simply, one of the best films I have ever seen.  It is also probably responsible for setting up a new genre, that of ""comedy fantasy horror"".  The unfortunate thing is that the original ""Evil Dead"" movie became so associated with the ""Video Nasty"" tag in the 80s, that anything attached to the franchise tended to be avoided by anyone except horror fans.This is a real shame, because many people who would have otherwise enjoyed the film immensely, were put off by the association.All I can say is, that as a person who is not a great fan of the original Evil Dead movie, this is one film that I have watched an unhealthy number of times, and will continue to do so.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Needs More Nikto,"(This review is for the 96-minute director's cut.)A film that aims to please as much as ""Army Of Darkness"" does shouldn't be too hard to enjoy. But a weak story and flat characterizations did limit my enjoyment of director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell's signature inventiveness.The last of Raimi's acclaimed ""Evil Dead"" films that all featured Campbell, ""Army Of Darkness"" marks a major tonal shift for the series, as the horror elements that dominated the first two films are replaced by humor, and the eerie original setting of an isolated cabin is swapped out for an unconvincing medieval Europe.Ash (Campbell), deposited in the Middle Ages at the end of ""Evil Dead II,"" makes an uneasy peace with Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and his people. Ash goes out to find the Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead, which has the power to send Ash back to his own time. Ash finds it, along with much trouble, all because Ash forgot the last word of an intonation he was supposed to deliver when taking the book. Leave it to Ash.""Did you speak the exact words?"" Ash is asked by Arthur's bearded wise man (Ian Abercrombie), whom Ash calls ""spinach chin.""""Look, maybe I didn't say every single little tiny syllable, no,"" Ash replies. ""But basically I said them, yeah.""At the head of the evil horde roused by Ash's miscue is a familiar looking character, Evil Ash (also Campbell, in heavy make-up.) The series premise didn't start out being about Ash's stupidity, but that was what it became by ""Army Of Darkness,"" now doubled by Ash's cruel-but-equally-dim doppelganger.Watching the two trade macho quips and get fooled by each other is fun for a while, but as ""Army Of Darkness"" goes on it becomes obvious Raimi doesn't have much else on offer this time. He's still got that ingenious hyperkinetic style, with POV shots of flying arrows and catapult boulders, but as a story it seems oddly artificial. The other ""Evil Dead"" films were artificial, too, but their accent on thrills and gore made this easier to accept.Here Raimi and Campbell double down on the comedy. Sometimes, it works, as when Ash and Evil Ash first meet and we find out why Evil Ash gets to wear such over-the-top make-up for the rest of the film. Yet the reliance on catch phrases gets annoying, as every action scene seems an excuse for a close-up of Ash saying something like ""Come to Pappa"" or ""Gimme some sugar, baby.""There are bits of story that seem to get away from Raimi and his brother/co-screenwriter Ivan Raimi, like an alliance between Arthur and a rival lord which comes out of left field. And why is Bridget Fonda in this movie? She's gone after two minutes in a non-speaking role, yet was at the time by far the most recognizable face in the cast. If it was an in-joke by Raimi, I didn't get it.The director's cut also suffers from a lame trick ending, which I won't give away except to say it is both too obvious and too heavy. I would have minded it even more if I had cared about the characters.Mostly, the problem with ""Army Of Darkness"" is that it both requires familiarity with the other two ""Evil Dead"" films to understand at a basic level, yet pulls away so dramatically from what you expect going in as to make that backstory not only unnecessary but counter- productive. It's a strange film on its own, often funny and exciting, yet on the whole disappointing, too.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Ash is just tooo much. Like the movie itself, he is way over the top, and that's the way it should be.

The Deadites are gruesome and sarcastic. Reading the quotes doesn't do justice to Campbell's delivery of his lines. Plus any hero with a chainsaw for a hand just has to be impressive.

When Horror Gets Hilarious,"In ""Army of Darkness,"" Sam Raimi takes comedy and horror to absurd extremes, turning the film into an experience fueled by pure, unabashed weirdness. Released in 1992 as a loose sequel to ""Evil Dead II,"" this movie is less about traditional horror and more like a hyperactive parody of medieval stories with a touch of horror satire. The plot hangs on a thin continuation thread, where Ash (Bruce Campbell) is transported back to the Middle Ages because of a cursed ""book of the dead."" This leap in premise not only sets a new stage for the hero's bloody and bizarre adventures but also gives Raimi the freedom to fill every scene with irreverence. With cartoonish humor and over-the-top fights, ""Army of Darkness"" is a treat for anyone who loves a movie that completely embraces the ridiculous.Campbell brings back his iconic Ash, now in an even more outrageous context that lets his comic streak shine. With his classic comic book hero look-a square jaw and an always self-aware attitude-he plays a character who mixes a fearless tough guy with a goofy, exaggerated style. In the film, Ash not only takes on the challenge of leading a fight against an army of the undead but does it with a mix of arrogance and humor that flips the idea of a ""hero"" and makes his presence a core element of the satire. His mechanical hand-chainsaw and the shotgun that never seems to need reloading are the perfect symbols of this style: nothing has to make sense, as long as it entertains. Campbell takes each scene to the extreme, and his performance brings a spark to scenes that might have otherwise just seemed bizarre.Raimi's direction is, as always, full of energy, and ""Army of Darkness"" might be his most self-aware work in terms of style and tone. The action scenes and use of practical effects create a frantic rhythm where one battle barely ends before the next one starts, keeping the pace relentless. The aesthetic here flirts with the grotesque and comic book visuals, especially with the animated skeletons. The practical effects and makeup bring a handcrafted charm that only adds to the film's appeal. The production leans into physical humor and exaggerated situations, and Raimi doesn't hold back on the visual violence or the bizarreness of the scenes-it's a spectacle that mixes fun and grotesque in explosive doses.""Army of Darkness"" also finds humor in the use of horror movie clichés and medieval battle tropes, but without taking anything seriously. Raimi both smashes and reinvents every convention of both genres, pushing the heroic battles, romance, and medieval mysticism to their max. Ash is an anti-hero with the style of a slapstick comedy character, unable to take any situation seriously. His interactions with Sheila (Embeth Davidtz), the film's love interest, are so shallow and rushed that they become almost a parody of traditional epic adventure romances, poking fun at the ""damsel"" and ""warrior"" archetypes. Everything is treated with blatant irony, turning even the most intense moments into visual gags and ridiculously funny lines.Though the film is technically well-made, it does fall a bit short of ""Evil Dead II"" in originality and impact. While ""Evil Dead II"" was groundbreaking in blending horror and comedy with a unique tone, ""Army of Darkness"" feels like it's repeating some of the earlier tricks but in a more exaggerated, comedic package. This recycled style, which was once fresh, can feel a bit forced in a few scenes, as though Raimi knew he was delivering the same kind of comedy for a younger audience that may not have seen the original. Still, the film is fun and fulfills its purpose to entertain and amuse without taking itself too seriously.Overall, ""Army of Darkness"" knows exactly what it is and doesn't try to be anything else. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell craft a lighthearted and ridiculously fun cinema experience that goes beyond being just a horror movie sequel. It's a film that stands out for its self-satire and its ability to turn a nonsensical story into one of the most entertaining and irreverent genre experiences of the 90s. It's the kind of film that celebrates the bizarre and invites the audience to do the same-a medieval horror comedy where the only rule is that everything can (and should) be taken to the extreme.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

To all the whiners about this movie I'd ask them to imagine, on their own, without copying other films (I'd explain the differences between copying, tributes and parody but it wouldn't do any good)a trilogy like the one this film caps.  I mean imagine every detail, shot, joke, effect, etc.This was a coup for Raimi.  Few have made this happen.Wild.  Madcap.  Insane.  Deliciously over acted.

However, they both share common origins, Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"", an important turning of corners in horror.Innovators who turn corners are at first copied, to cash in on the talents of others, then, respectfully utilized as springboards to take original and gutsy ideas in other directions.  A sincere flattery.Ten years hence, twenty, this movie, and it's first two installments, will be picked up on the dime sized dvds of the future and watched by friends gathered where everything is mixing and meshing just exactly and everything said and done prompts peals of laughter because everyone is so bloomin' glad to be in the moment.If you don't understand about those moments, I am truly sorry.Great entertainment, killer fun film, laugh, jump, shriek, jab your elbow into your neighbor's ribs, moan, enjoy.

Not exactly the continuation I was hoping to see.,"""Honey, you got real ugly.""I thought The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 were fantastic. Their low budgets didn't preclude them both from being some pretty entertaining horror movies in their own unique ways. Army of Darkness totally eschews all pretense of being a horror movie, and goes solely for a campy vibe that revolves around Bruce Campbell's character, Ash. This will be right up some people's alleys, but I can't say I loved the change.As the movie picks up where Evil Dead 2 left off, Ash is transported back through time. The evil of the Deadites and the power of the Necronomicon still wait for him in England's Dark Ages, however, and he's unwillingly thrust into a battle to save a castle full of people from the an army of undead.Some people will probably welcome the shift in scope and total change in tone, but I really missed the vibe of the first two flicks. Sure, they were way over-the-top and occasionally campy/silly, but Army of Darkness is a completely different animal.

Besides that it's certainly not creepy or even exciting, due to the incoherent directing by Raimi. A movie with a crazy plot like this has so many oppurtunities for good jokes and 'shocking' moments, and it's really a shame that only a few are being used by the director. Go watch Evil Dead II or Braindead/Dead Alive by Peter Jackson instead if you want to see some serious over-the-top gore and fun.But I have to say that there's one good thing about this movie, it somehow brought back that nice ""elementary-school-birthday-party-creepy-but-funny-movie""-feeling...Rating: 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Big ambition and takes major chances.,"""My name is Ash and I'm a slave.""So begins this out of left field sequel to the splatter horror flick Evil Dead 2.This remarkably zany film easily sustained my interest. It is remarkably rewatchable; I had more fun this time than on my first viewing 25 years ago. I really felt Sam Raimi was trying to outdo himself and, hit by a rush of manic inspiration, made the movie he always wanted to make since he first wanted to become a director.The film begins with a rushed synopsis of the previous film, and it seems even more ridiculous in a minute and a half summary. This condensed silliness sets the tone for this installment. Hyper and without patience for detailed explanation, every second is filled with lots of humor and curious visual detail.Ash is painted as a stubbornly modern character sent into a foreign land lost in time. He has no interest in adapting to his environment. He spouts shopping center slogans as if they were wise proverbs. ""Shop smart. Shop S-Mart.""Later he tries to trick a soldier.""You know your shoelace is United.""Confused, the soldier looks down.(Shoelaces were invented in 1780, in case you were wondering.)When you come across someone with a chainsaw arm and a magical double-barreled ""boom stiklck' with a seemingly infinite supply of ammo, you are going to listen to what he has to say.This is a big production, or at least it seems gigantic in a low budget sort of way. Big sets. Lots of extras. Some extensive make-up effects.The shots are well storyboarded and composed. The score is perfect: quaint and expressive in little bits. Modern but not overtly dramatic. The art direction is full of ramshackle details. The visual effects are the true star of the show. Puppetry and sots of functioning mechanics have the same effect as stop-motion classics like Jason and the Argonauts, though I am pretty sure these were all practical effects done in-camera using creative trickery.There is a sequence where Ash is ambushed by a gang of manic little pygmies. They torment and annoy him. At one point, they strike a pose and then, in unison, sing, ""My - fair - lady."" What? I am still confounded.Raimi really has grown in confidence as a director. The cartoony elements won't appeal to everyone, but I personally love the whole picture. I can't think of anything I have seen quite like it.Sam Raimi went on to produce the TV series ""Hercules"" and a spin-off,""Xena: Warrior Princess. Those shows seem inspired by the general action with period details from Ay of Darkness without the absurd, cartoony bits. Both series were continually playing on TV stations in the 1990s. It seems that Army of Darkness has quite the legacy and was remarkably influential.Highly recommended. A must see for fans of inventive b-movies, fantasy action cinema, and cartoons. Among the best sequels of the '90s.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Name's Ash...housewares,"Well, the Evil Dead trilogy started off as a genuinely terrifying experimental film from director Sam Raimi and pal Bruce Campbell and soon became so much more.  Now it has descended into a farce, a farce that had me laughing so hard I had trouble breathing.  From the title ""Bruce Campbell vs Army of Darkness"", you can tell what kind of movie you're in for.  The skeleton army looks ridiculous and the special effects used were the worst I've seen in decades, and this whogivesacrap attitude about the whole movie is what makes it work.  And then there's Bruce Campbell, the man with the greatest jaw in Hollywood.  After watching this film, I pulled down my poster of Kurt Cobain and put up Bruce Campbell and that ridiculous poster with Embeth Davidtz and the skeletons.  A damn fine flick.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A hysterical sequel to ""Evil Dead 2""","Before viewing this movie, rent and enjoy ""Evil Dead 2.""  Sam Raimi has put together cult classics that are sure to please and make you laugh out loud!

How to make a cult movie,"Many movies have been touted as cult movies and dissappeared as quick as their hype. This one shows how a real cult movie is made.First: don't take yourself too serious. Even, no, especially with comedies. Little is more awful than an comedy that seriously tries to be fun. This movie is fun not only because of the script, the screamingly funny one-liners and the excellent goofball macho acting by Bruce Campbell, but because you can feel the fun the whole team must have had during making this one.Second: take a handful of excellent, but under-rated actors. According to the motto ""lots to win, little to lose"" they give much more intense performance than actors with a reputation.Third: money is not that important. Freedom is. The Effects look sometimes cheesy, but they are fun nevertheless. What elsewhere would have been a blooper adds to the fun here. And the more freedom the production crew gets, the more creativity and details they put into the film. Of course, this very nice and fun movie could have been the box office hit, but forgotten afterwards - the rules of what cannot be done and what has to happen for a hollywood production are also the rules of how to make boring movies. If Producer, Author and the crew don't care much for those rules, you get movies like Dark Star, El Mariachi and this one.Third: Stay in peoples minds. After you've seen it many times, you still should enjoy it the next time. It doesn't matter how you get this done; make it so people keep remembering the movie. AoD manages with its humour and some pictures you can't get out of your head.So this is a cult movie. A cult movie cannot by definition be everybodys piece of cake, so you may find it boring. But else, believe me, you find yourself quickly not only liking, but loving it. And that's the last point: polarize.Everything else has been said. Have fun.

The Culmination to An Entertaining Series!,"Army of Darkness is a film that concludes the Evil Dead series.  The previous two films were excellent examples of classic horror comedies, but lacked something that Army of Darkness has.  In my mind, I think the classic one liners of Sam and Ivan Raimi put the icing on the cake.Army of Darkness is a film that touches upon good versus evil.  You may be saying that this plot has been covered many times before.  Even though this is true, Army of Darkness puts a spin upon this that, in the end, will have you wanting more.  Ash is the hero that is sent back in time, in Evil Dead 2, to the time of King Arthur.  Ash needs to win the respect of Arthur, capture the book of the dead, defeat the army of the dead, and get back to his own time period, the 20th century.  While trying to accomplish these objectives, Ash spurts out classic one liners, endures a tremendous amount of pain, and entertains the audience to the maximum.  I ask everyone to at least give this movie a chance.  GO to your local Blockbuster, and pick it up.  You will not be disappointed.  In the end Ash will have you muttering his own words.

Takes a different course than the other two.,"EVIL DEAD was experimental horror. EVIL DEAD II just plain sucked. ARMY OF DARKNESS is a new kind of experiment. A terrific blend of action and horror.The EVIL DEAD movies aren't really together though. EVIL DEAD II was kind of a remake and kind of not. (It was kind of confusing) ARMY OF DARKNESS takes place after EVIL DEAD II but kind of changes the ending of EVIL DEAD II.At the end of EVIL DEAD II Ash goes back in time and is surrounded by soldiers. They say he is the saviour that will save them from the ""deadites"" and go HAIL! HAIL! HAIL! Ash screams nooooo!At the beginning of ARMY OF DARKNESS Ash goes back in time and they take him prisoner.EVIL DEAD is more of an H.P. Lovecraft type story, based on Sam Raimi's test short film Within The Woods. It experiments with Sam Raimi's facination for gore effects he had since he was a kid.ARMY OF DARKNESS, experiments with horror and action! And the ACTION is really a must see. Sam Raimi can even Jim Varney look like and ACTION STAR with this directing techniques! It is really a style of his own. It sort of seems like he is inspired by Robert Rodriguez because they are kind of similar but far from being the same! The cute one-liners are also a gem.I actually like this one BETTER than EVIL DEAD. It's more original. EVIL DEAD II is really stupid and makes no sense. I don't like that one.

Totally awesome sequel to the Evil Dead movies!,"Army of Darkness was a hilarious movie. I hope that no one takes this movie as a serious movie. It simply tries to be bad for the excitement of the audience. Evil Dead 1 and 2, which were the first two in the trilogy, were more horror than Army of Darkness. The first was a serious cult movie. The second was sort of a remake of it, adding a lot of black comedy and not taking itself seriously. Army of Darkness, the third, adds a lot of comedy elements, it doesn't even take itself really as a horror movie.

The Right Approach,"The special effects in this movie are not grand and it was best that Sam Raimi made comedy more of a priority than horror. There is nothing more funnier than seeing Bruce Campbell shoot down skeletons with a shotgun and crack one-liners.""Army of Darkness"" is the biggest of the Evil Dead movies. The budget exceeds the first two movies combined and it shows on screen. Bruce Campbell is shown in a different light again, this time as a ruggedly, handsome superhero. This approach is the best of the trilogy and displays Campbell's wide range of skills as an actor.One complaint about ""Army of Darkness"" was the three mini-copies of Ash. The scene took well over twenty minutes and definitely took away what basis of humor the film held. The scene signified the comic horror movie to an overt humor fiesta. Thankfully, the film got back on track after a few more scenes.By excitement, this movie ranks first. But by craftiness, Evil Dead II knocks out the rest. One must think why this intriguing, exciting horror series died out while others like Jason and Michael Myers has continued. Let's just hope Raimi gets Campbell back for one more ride because it would be worth it.The question mark I had in ""Evil Dead II"" about the chainsaw man in the 13th century has finally been answered with an exclamation point and Bruce Campbell brings it with a punch.

The Deadites want to kick some Ash!,"This is the third movie in director Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" series, and it's definitely the funniest.  ""The Evil Dead"" was pure horror, while ""Evil Dead 2"" mellowed out somewhat.  ""Army of Darkness""... okay, sure - it's still horror; anything with an army of the dead is going to have horror.  But it's funny horror... 'Fake Shemps' (the Three Stooges routine with the skeletons in the graveyard and later with the Deadites), Ash's inability to remember the phrase 'Klaatu Barada Niktu' (from the movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""), his parody of the sword-wielding hero (chainsaws, anyone?), a double-barrel shotgun that fires four times without reloading, Sheila the Ash-kisser... even the Deadites themselves are funny.The acting is a little wooden in spots - Bruce Campbell has said that he's gotten better with every movie he's done (and he has), but this is one of his early ones.  The stop-motion skeletons are stiff and jerky, but they're supposed to be... that's also part of the fun.  Some of the other F/X aren't as smooth as they could be, but they're easily survivable... you don't go to a movie just for the F/X anyway.  Makeup is a little patchy in spots, but that's also something that doesn't detract from the movie.The plot is nothing new - ye olde 'reluctant (and somewhat inept) hero who eventually saves the day'.  Yet in Raimi's hands, it hits new heights of silliness.  Raimi has also gotten better with every movie he's done, but there are still a few spots in this where it doesn't flow quite that smoothly.  Even so, there's never really a dull moment.For any of you wondering, that really is director Sam Raimi's car that Ash uses... according to reviewer/author/actor Bill Warren (he's known Sam Raimi for almost 20 years now), Raimi uses (or used) that Olds in every movie he did in the beginning - which means that it got seriously banged up on the set.  Everything you see in the trunk of the car - including the chemistry textbook - are really what Sam Raimi has in the trunk of his car... there are no product placements here.  Another Raimi touch are the 'Fake Shemps' (you have to be a Three Stooges fan to get that reference)... yet another is having his brother(s) - such as Ted Raimi - in the movie, even if they're uncredited.Humor and horror might seem to be an odd mix, but it works out well - I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the Three Stooges and slapstick, or any Mel Brooks movie.  In terms of acting and plot, I give it a 7... in terms of humor, I give it a 9 - for an average of 8, which is a heck of a lot better than a lot of stuff coming out of Hollywood these days.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness - Chainsaw for a Hand, Brain on Standby","Ash is the guy who could've been a Knight of the Round Table-if said table were made of wooden pallets and surrounded by undead corpses. Catapulted into the Middle Ages with a chainsaw grafted to his wrist and a sawed-off shotgun in tow, he crashes onto the scene like a party boy from Marseille landing in Ibiza: loud, brash, and utterly classless-but damn, he's lovable. Bruce Campbell turns every line into a haymaker, wielding his B-movie charisma like a weapon of mass destruction.The story? Ash has to retrieve a magical book, but like a high schooler cramming for finals, he messes up the incantation. The result? An army of skeletons rises and wreaks havoc. Nothing makes sense, and that's exactly what makes it brilliant. It's as if The Lord of the Rings was directed by a Monty Python fan on acid. Every scene is an excuse for ridiculous gags and over-the-top ideas, and honestly, we're here for it.Sam Raimi proves once again that with a limited budget and boundless creativity, you can rival the biggest blockbusters. The skeletons are animated in a style reminiscent of Ray Harryhausen, the makeup is dripping with low-budget genius, and every shot radiates a love for DIY filmmaking. It's a carnival of old-school visual effects that's more enjoyable than half the lifeless CGI we're force-fed these days.Ash's dialogue is a treasure trove of absurd punchlines. From ""Hail to the King, Baby"" to quips thrown like grenades, it's a medieval stand-up act. The film never takes itself seriously, and that's its greatest strength. You laugh at the absurd scenarios, the ridiculous fights, and even moments that were probably supposed to be scary. Raimi isn't here to terrify-he's delivering dark comedy in armor.With knights in cardboard armor, DIY catapults, and skeletons that might as well start singing We Will Rock You, this Middle Ages is a slap in the face to every boring history lesson. Heroism gives way to gleeful stupidity, and it works like a charm. You're not here to think; you're here to laugh, and on that front, Army of Darkness is a flawless victory.Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness is the cinematic equivalent of a greasy burger: it's messy, unbalanced, and utterly delicious. A pure, unhinged romp to enjoy without moderation, with Bruce Campbell as your star waiter and Sam Raimi as the Michelin-starred chef of chaos. Watch it, rewatch it-chainsaw in hand, grin on your face.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Joseph Loduca's score is dynamic and sweeping, containing many great themes; especially 'Building the DeathCoaster'. (There's also a theme made by Danny Elfman, The March of the Dead). The special makeup-effects are incredible and the stop-motion very good.A movie that is made for having a great time in front of the TV or a screen. Pure entertainment!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
getting groovy in the middle ages,"Sam Raimi's Army Of Darkness completes his demented Evil Dead trilogy in high style, and with way more off the wall humour than the first two, which made you laugh while simultaneously going straight for the jugular with gore. Slapstick seems to be the theme here, as Ash and his trusty accessories of destruction find themselves catapulted straight into the heart of the Middle Ages, where the denizens of the Necronomicon have somehow once again found him. Joining forces with a medieval King, and hopping into bed with a shapely princess (Embeth Davidz), Ash uses his modern day know-how and sassy disposition to battle hordes of skeletal beasties and flying deadites, with occasional breaks for absurd humour and near surreal set pieces. My personal favorite is when he finds himself under attack from numerous pint sized versions of himself after setting off an ancient spell in the nearby dark forests. ""Ramming speed"" they chirp as they jab him in the ass with a metal fork and giggle like demonic Borrowers. Only in these movies, man. The change of setting from a cabin in the woods to a castle allows for a much larger scale of action, involving entire armies and much more moving parts. The deadite horde has a satisfyingly creaky, Harryhausen- esque way of moving, and look great when blown to bits by the ol' boomstick as well. They also inherit the silliness and near constant mischief of the demons from the first two films too. Whether it's trees, deer heads, zombies or skeletons, anything that materializes as a result of that book just seems to have a flair for bizarre and childish shenanigans, kind of like their trademark mode of behaviour. That too is what makes these films so distinct; they're horror comedies, yes, but not in the sense that Scary Movie or Young Frankenstein is. They're like a clown with ADHD prancing about the place and destroying things in their own special and unhinged way. Different from the other films in the series, no doubt, but a welcome and very successful departure.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Almost like the makers tried to make something comedic out of something which was an ultimate horror classic with the first film, and it also feels there was some kind of pressure on the makers from the film censors to not make it so gruesome, that's understandable to not make a blood brutality .. but to remove the scary factors, then where will this film get at, a horror film changed to a comedic film gone wrong 😂 .. now we know why so much less was spoken about the sequels of Evil Dead .

A movie everyone should see,"The first two evil dead were some of the best horror movies made. Army of Darkness is no different. Although not all horror, this movie is the pinnacle of the genre. The underrated Bruce Campbell returns to his role as Ash and gives one of the coolest performances from any movie I have ever seen.(I believe this has the best one liners of any movie ever) The plot is a continuation from the first two movies and is pretty solid. The special effects are a bit campy, but they are enjoyable. A very enjoyable film that gets my highest possible recommendation. A 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Total Classic,"Some people may think that these movies (Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness) were intended to be scary.  Well, um, duh, not really.  Yes, they are horror themed, and if you were truly scared by any of them, well, that means you haven't seen a real horror film.  So I'm here to state that these three movies are meant to be fun.  You can't find better B acting with a better B plot.  The original Evil Dead was made on a college budget.  Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell both attended Michigan State University and filmed it as a film project.  With the two follow ups, Evil Dead 2 (which is not a sequel, but a remake) and Army of Darkness are sort of poking fun at horror movies.  Completely worth watching if you are a true horror movie fan. These three, including Army of Darkness have become Cult Classics for a reason.  Why else would they release 50 (yes, an exaggeration) different special edition DVD's?",,Anonymous,Horror
It's not my genre :/,"Until the end I did not know that it was written and directed by the acclaimed film director Sam Raimi, this type of film does not embellish very well and it's because uses special effects and sets typical of the time.You feel nostalgic when you see this type of film and remember lying on the couch and watching it with your family and being scared and amazed by the monsters and the skeletons.Without going any further, it does not have a soundtrack very good, it is more of a parody and is not poorly produced and directed, but as I said, seeing it after more that 30 years does not do it justice.I give it an average score of 5 out to 10 since I was expecting something more, but for Sam's beginnings it's not bad at all.Thanks for reading me !",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A visually-fantastic masterpiece of perfection.,"What is one of the greatest films of all-time?  Army of Darkness.  No doubt about it...it blows away the previous two Evil Dead films.  The dialogue is very, very memorable...especially lines such as ""Give me some sugar, baby"" and ""My name is Ash...and I am a slave"".  KNB proves themselves with some terrifically unmatched F/X sequences.  Campbell is in fine form, showing that Ash is the ruler of the universe.  He obviously knows how to save the day, no matter the circumstances.  All of the performances are top-notch and, better yet, the script is in good shape.  I've read it.  With nearly 600 cuts, it's non-stop excitement, and never boring.  This is definitely a film that can be watched countless times and will never become boring.  A true classic, indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Hail to Bruce Campbell, king of the oneliners","First of all i want to make warning, if you have a weak heart or brokens ribs. Don´t see this one, because you will laugh so much that it hurts in your ribcage. But hey, if you wanna die with a smile on your lips, see this movie. I haven´t seen the first one yet, but the second film was a really funny movie. Didn´t think that the third one, should come up with any surprises. Oh god, how wrong i was. From the very first scene, a feel great feeling is starting to bubble inside you. Bruce Campbell is just great in his role, no one could done it better. Not even Bruce Willis could done the oneliners better, Bruce is the king. Sam Raimi is one hell of director, the guy must have a very odd fantasy. But why complain, this movie is great. One more thing, after this movie i have one new favourite actor, his name....Bruce Campbell of course, well the man isn´t Robert De Niro or John Malcowitch(how do u spell his name?) but when it comes to oneliners then he´s the man.

One of the greatest movies of all time!!!,"Army of Darkness is truly a work of art.  It is my favorite movie in an incredible trilogy.  I have both the theatrical addition and the limited edition, and I love them both, except for the ending in the limited edition. I really can't say much except that the one-liners are awesome and the effects are pretty cool.  Bruce Campbell's acting is also great.

"Hail to the King, baby!","Just finished watching Army of Darkness (1992) and while it is the least best installment of the Evil Dead Franchise, I still love this movie.Positives for Army of Darkness (1992):
Once again, Bruce Campbell is absolutely killing it as Ash Williams and honestly without him as this character, this franchise won't even work. I also enjoyed all of the side characters that we get in the Middle Age setting. The comedy in this movie is far the best in the series and in fact this is the only entry in the Evil Dead Franchise that isn't really a horror movie and instead is a full-on dark fantasy comedy. And finally, the Deadites in this movie are all awesome and while the practical effects in this movie look dated, it fits perfectly with the tone and approach in this movie.Mixed for Army of Darkness (1992):
The thing that will definitely divide auidences with this movie is that Army of Darkness is a full-on comedy. And while, I do understand that this might turn off some people and is the reason why this is the weakest entry in the franchise by default, Sam Raimi did fantastic job at making this franchise's transition to full-on comedy work perfectly, you know something that Don Mancini failed to do with the Child's Play Franchise. And my final mixed element of this movie is the ending. This movie has two different endings and I actually prefer the alternate ending over the original ending. For one, the alternate ending of this movie ends Bruce Campbell saying ""Hail to the King, baby!"". Also, this ending does a better job at setting up Ash vs. Evil Dead (2015-2018).Overall, I had a blast with Army of Darkness (1992) and while the transition to comedy won't work for everyone, it definitely worked for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ding ding ding Johnie! Let's see what you've won!!!,"I have had the pleasurable experience of seeing this delightful film and I am happy to say that it is one of the best I've ever seen, for it's fairly low budget. Like Evil Dead and yes, Evil Dead 2, this movie has the familiar Ash, only this time he's got a chainsaw arm and read to kick some undead booty. With legions of skeletons and all sorts of other horrible things, this combines a sort of medieval feel with the beseiging of a castle with a hilarious futuristic hero with swift one liners such as ""Groovy"", and ""Swallow this"" (in reference to a remark made by a zany ghost thing. Yes, it may not be a top blockbuster, but heck, who likes those anyway? I highly recommend this movie, or as it's said, ""I shall feast upon your soul"". Not literally of course but in a figurative sense, because that would make me evil and downright insane to do so in actuality. Well with this I'll leave until the next comment made by your humble fesis, Poop.",,Anonymous,Horror
Three Stooges- Back from the Dead!,"Although I didn't actually see Moe, Larry or Curly, they must have been there- this was easily the best Three Stooges movie of the last 30 years! All the slapstick was enhanced by some of the finest visual effects of the early 20th century. This is work that might have inspired Ray Harryhausen (it certainly couldn't have been inspired BY his work). Everything combined to suspend disbelief most effectively, transporting the viewer back in time by presenting a movie that seems like it might actually have been made using 14th-century technology.Seriously- I don't think this is the work that won Raimi the job of directing Spider-Man, but he and Campbell seem to have been having a great time. If you keep that in mind, this flick can be a decent bit of fun.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'm still in shock,"Wow! Thats all that really needs to be said about this movie. It is so good to see a refreshing piece of cinema like this one. Sam Raimi is a truly wonderful director and he really shines in this one.

Bruce Campbell blows Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone away as an action star.  Which often makes me wonder why Bruce hasn't made it huge yet.  His one-liners are hilarious and not at all corny like those of Arnold and Stallone.

"Army of Darkness reveres classic and recent films in the nineties, but the horrible visual effects and ridiculous humor scenes make this one the wordt of the trilogy","In 1992, after much insistence from the producers - especially Dino DeLaurentis - Sam Raimi returned to the Evil Dead franchise, in Army of Darkness, starting his feature in a different way, first with an even more elucidating narration than the one executed and Evil Dead 2, which already helps to build the picture of a product more palatable to the general public, making this chapter the most familiar of the films in the saga. Okay, how to make another sequel if the outcome of the last movie had been as clueless as possible? Simple! Follow the scene and spice up the script with even more bizarre situations, fill it with laughable visuals, forget about the horror, put on lots of clown scenes and that's it; no one else will realize how silly this idea is. Even because, with so many ""unusual"" situations popping up in our faces, who will care about the fact that the protagonist has traveled in the dimension of time and tele transported to the past?After Darkman's financial success, the film was produced as part of a deal with Universal Studios. Originally titled Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness, filming took place in California in 1991. The creatures' makeup and special effects were handled by two companies: Tony Gardner and his company Alterian, Inc. Were responsible for Ash & Sheila's makeup. , while Kurtzman, Nicotero & Berger EFX Group took the rest of the other characters' special effects. Tom Sullivan, who had previously worked on Within the Woods, The Evil Dead and Evil Dead II, also contributed to the film's visual effects.Army of Darkness actually has a lot more differences than similarities to the first two movies. The clearest of all is the comic tone. While The Death of the Demon is trash with all that footprint of gore and goo, A Hallucinating Night is already heading towards the camp and the splat stick. The third film in the trilogy completely leaves the horror aside, and aside from Ash and the possessed in common, bets on slapstick humor and the physical comedy and expressions of Bruce Campbell.The fact is that as much as purist fans turn up their noses at this departure from the demonic universe of the first two features (and especially the cabin), whoever knows the story behind Raimi, Campbell and producer Ropert Tapert, childhood friends of the Michigan suburbs, you know that ever since their Super8 trials in high school, they've always had a penchant for comedy and The Three Stooges slapstick. A Hallucinating Night already left that unsaid, especially in the scene of the blood lamp. This gender shift in Uma Noite 3, is a kind of more than natural path traced by its creators.The first film was an authentic low-budget trash horror filmed in practically a single setting, with lots of guts and fake blood gushing in the viewer's face. Thanks to the inventiveness and talent of Sam Raimi, who managed to create a tense and macabre atmosphere even with few resources at his disposal, the film became a classic of the genre. Six years later, and its sequel, Raimi made a sort of alternative version/sequence of the events of the first film, betting on a little better special effects due to the bigger budget and, especially, on top of a lot of black humor. In this closing of the trilogy, the director embarks once and for all on the atmosphere of parody with science fiction and practically leaves aside the dark atmosphere of the first part, which was also present in the second film.In the movie Ash (Bruce Campbell) is resized for the 14th century and will have to face an army of the undead. This troupe of supernatural beings is led by Evil Ash (Campbell's double in Evil Dead 2). As soon as he reaches the medieval period, the character is thrown into a pit and forced to fight a hideous creature. Upon leaving intact, Ash is seen as a ""savior"". Elevated to a new category, the hero is summoned to retrieve the dangerous Book of the Dead, but something goes wrong along the way and he will need, through his wisdom, acquired from previous films, to save that ""homeland"" and himself, in the most irreverent episode of the Death of the Devil franchise.The script, signed by Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi, continues to reference well-known cinematographic and literary manifestations. An excerpt read wrongly by Ash, at a certain conflicting point in the script, is responsible for awakening not only the dead, but the memory of cinema. The quote is a reference to the 1951 classic The Day the Earth Stood Still. The fight scene between Ash and his miniatures draws an amusing parallel to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. The text written by the Raimi brothers develops the character Ash, a bit stagnant since Evil Dead 2. If in Evil Dead - The Death of the Devil, he was a romantic and quiet boy, in the second episode the boy is undeveloped, since the story it doesn't give the character much room, but focuses on the transfer of style that bridges the blood and macabre of the first to the nonsense and caricature of the third. In Army of Darkness - Arms of Darkness, Ash is rude, rude and has the traits of a hero, far from the victim status of the previous ones.The transformation into an anti-hero happens automatically, alluding to the change of character thanks to the extreme situation and hopelessness that Ashley goes through. Not even a concern on his part to save bullet shells for his shotgun. Preparation for the battlefield emulates film two, building weapons for its handling of the (now from the beginning of the film) one-armed protagonist. The character's ideal is very different, after the grief for the loss of Linda, he finally moves on, finding peace in the arms of Sheila (Embeth Davidtz). The journey towards the Necromicon's version of the time makes him have a clash again with the strange creature that keeps chasing him in the forest. However, even this apparition does not return the more serious tone, as A Hallucinating Night III is in fact the most playful and parody episode of the series.This third part is quite surreal. If many fans of the first movie complained about the exaggerated scenes of the second movie, in this one, everything multiplied. Forget the terror! There is no scene, nothing, that can give you even a scare. In fact, it seems that neither the director nor the screenplay tries. I think they realized the clowning that was involved and just decided to make fun of all the ridiculous situations in the script. Remember the hand possessed scene in the second movie? Because nothing could prepare the audience for a scene where the protagonist fights against several other child copies of himself entitled to a lot of physical and exaggerated humor. The doubt that remains in the minds of many is the reason why all this happened. It's just one of those things that ""just happen"". At this point, many already found Ash completely unbearable, because the character was brought to the brink of madness and idiocy. The transition from horror movie to swashbuckling escapist adventure may make it strange for those who have only watched the first Evil Dead, especially in Ashley's drastic personality changes and reactions. Clearly her character has gone from being a generic B-horror good guy to something much bigger, a figure of disdain for the classic hero, who misrepresents the paladin archetype, making him a huge joke.Raimi gives his star room to shine, in terribly constructed clash scenes with pitiful CGI scenes in the extreme, reminiscent of the paltry budget of many movies out there. Combat with their diminutive counterparts doesn't even have a physical fit, and constitute but one of the crazy incarnations thought by the pair of friends Campbell and Raimi to represent the character's dual personality, a factor that worsens the evolution of the character's duality of character, already mentioned in second movie here evolved the question of Evil Ash. The other visual aspects help the comedy even more, but they are laughable. Released a year after the then visually revolutionary Terminator 2 (1991), this film has the same technical quality as the first Terminator movie of 1984. The stop-motion effects of Hell's skull army are so surreal and botched that they totally displace the audience from the experience they are seeing. Even with an infinitely larger budget and one of the franchise's recognizable films, this third part is grander in scale, but the most bizarre in technical quality.Army of Darkness reveres classic and recent films in the nineties, from Gulliver's Travels to Highlander, both in visuals and on-screen situations. In a way, the laziness that affected Sam and Ivan Raimi in his screenplay served to allude to more recent parallels, renewing his theme. The final battle with the evil counterpart is laughable in virtually every consequence, from the clash itself, involving dozens of extras and scenarios, to the main character's hand-to-hand combat and his rotten version, which increasingly decomposes during the event. Greg Nicotero's makeup lives up to its golden moments, and manages to raise the playfulness to the maximum level, tied very well to the ending of the story, which shows a terrible apocalyptic future in the extended version and the protagonist's return to the present day, a factor that would give ballast for the upcoming series Ash vs. Evil Dead, as well as marking time as one of the most creative attempts to mix humor and horror in modern cinema.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

A little advice, IF YOU ARE A TEENAGER WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR YOU WILL LOVE THIS FILM!!  Basically, it's The Three Stooges meets 80's Horror and Action Adventure.  Also, this film has more quotable lines than perhaps any other film I have ever seen (except for possibly Ghostbusters).

Ideal evening: Army of Darkness and Bruce himself,"The first time I saw this movie was at a screening of Evil Dead, EDII and AoD. After the completion of ALL THREE, who should walk on stage but Bruce himself for a hilarious question and answer session. His answer to when EDIV might come out ""It will come out...when monkeys fly out my butt!"" It seems that Sam Raimi took particular delight in torturing Bruce throughout the trilogy (mostly in EDII and AoD).As for AoD, it is easily my favorite of the three. It is hilarious from beginning to end, with the obvious 3 Stooges references to the more subtle spoofs of earlier movies such as the Disney flick ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"".  Yes, the effects are cheesy and the castle is a matte painting but WHO CARES?  I'm sick of movies with bloated budgets and computer-generated actors. Not everyone has a 100 mil budget to work with and Sam Raimi was making this on a shoestring budget (for the time).Possibly the funniest scene in the film is Ash versus the mini-Ashes in and around the windmill. This is NOT a scene to be missed and fits perfectly into the topsy-turvy world that Ash has fallen into and now has to get himself out of. Bruce Campbell is quite possibly the quirkiest actor in the business (yes, even quirkier than Johnny Depp!).  He has no hesitation about doing small parts if they're interesting (""Escape from LA"" and ""Spiderman"", notably) yet has the presence and talent to carry off leading roles with penache.More power to you Bruce and may AoD live forever!",,Anonymous,Horror

"""Army of Darkness""-  The biggest, broadest and zaniest of the ""Evil Dead"" film trilogy.  Just a darned good time all around.","Since the first entry roared onto screens in 1981, the ""Evil Dead"" franchise has been a special and important one for fans of the deranged and the ridiculously hilarious. A series built around an expert mixture of laugh-out-loud comedy and disgusting gory horror, Sam Raimi's cult classic film (and now television) series is B-movie royalty, with an ever-growing and ever-rabid fanbase. However, even with a bigger-budgeted 2013 reboot and a popular new Starz television series, perhaps the most ambitious and broad entry in the ""Evil Dead"" saga is still the 1992 swashbuckling epic ""Army of Darkness""- the third theatrical release.We pick up right on the heels of the whacked-out climax seen in ""Evil Dead II""- our cynical, oafish hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) is sucked through a magical portal and lands back in time in the Middle Ages. After running afoul Lord Arthur's (Marcus Gilbert) men and proving himself worthy by battling ""Deadites"", Ash is sent on a mission to collect the dreaded Necronomicon in order to use its spells to send him back to his proper time. However, through a bit of complete idiocy, Ash not only collects the book, but also raises a massive, malevolent force- the Army of Darkness. And so, he must assist Arthur in training his men to face this vile threat, and try to stop the Deadite hordes once and for all in order to get back home...The film absolutely belongs to star Campbell and director Raimi, who take their low-budget tricks and ramp them up to the next level thanks to a bigger budget and studio backing. Campbell is a B-movie god for a reason, and that is because he's just so much fun, no matter what. His amusing over-acting and sarcastic cool- guy demeanor make him just a blast and a half to behold, especially when paired with such great material. He plays Ash not quite as an ""everyman"", so much as a ""likable jerk."" He's the sort-of character you wanna sock in the jaw one moment for acting so deplorable, but then take out for a beer in the very next when he says something clever and amusing. And Campbell's definitely born to play the role.Sam Raimi excels with his trademark kinetic and off-kilter style and crafts a brilliantly entertaining tale. Part of the reason I and so many others worship him is for his rampant talent and willingness to put the audience's entertainment and emotional state first and foremost in his aim... whether it be with a gritty thriller like ""A Simple Plan"", a superhero epic like ""Spider-Man 2"" or indeed a bizarre ""Three Stooges""-meets-Swashbuckler epic like ""Army of Darkness"", he commits. His keen use of brilliant slapstick humor and sharp dialog shine, and he delivers yet another creepy-yet-comedic masterpiece.The supporting cast is just perfect. Marcus Gilbert plays it straight as Lord Arthur, who is a good sort-of straight-guy foil to Ash's buffoonery. Ian Abercrombie and Embeth Davidtz add a degree of class and elegance in their respective roles as a Wise Man working for Arthur and a young woman who quickly catch's Ash's eyes. And Richard Grove rounds out the cast quite nicely as Duke Henry, a sort-of rival that Arthur is strongly against, and blames for much of his troubles. There's also some nice cameos by Ted Raimi and Bridget Fonda in small but memorable turns. Add to that an amusing and wild score courtesy Joseph LoDuca and Danny Elfman, the gorgeous cinematography of Bill Pope and the creepy and eerie effects of KNB and you have just a perfect team to build this third chapter in the ""Evil Dead"" story.While it may falter here and there due to some studio-mandated re- edits and cuts and the fact that despite its own excellence, it can't quite reach the insane brilliance of ""Evil Dead II"", ""Army of Darkness"" is still a very worthwhile continuation of the much- beloved cult-favorite series. It's a joy to see Ash once again, and it delivers the screams and the laughs at a mile-a-minute. And for that, I must give it a very good 8 out of 10. Hail to the king, baby!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The scariest horror franchise turns into a childish comic sitcom,"Army of Darkness (1992) :
Brief Review -The scariest horror franchise turns into a childish comic sitcom. I don't know how Raimi and Ivan Raimi thought of turning The Evil Dead franchise into a fantasy comedy for the worse. I have so many frightening memories from The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2, and this movie destroyed them all. I couldn't even follow the story-forget humor and presentation. Evil Dead 2 ended with Ash killing a flying dragon and locals hailing him as a messiah, but this movie starts with him being chained. See, there's no continuity. Ash gets trapped in a mysterious world, and the mystical happenings around him did catch my attention in the first 20-25 minutes. I didn't even mind a beautiful chic coming along and Ash asking her for sugar and having sex. But things became too childish after that. The army of the dead didn't scare me at all; rather, they looked funny. Ash's conversations with the locals and wise men sounded terrible for a horror fantasy movie. I didn't understand how Ash forgot the words and then didn't ask the wise men to repeat them so he could end the curse right there. He simply stated that he forgot, and they moved on. The entire war scenario would not have happened if he had gotten the words from someone. His platonic girlfriend called him ""coward"" when he was about to leave, but the next moment he had a change of heart and became the leader of the gang. Things are weak, fragmented, and illogical like this throughout the hour or so until the childish battle between the evil dead and locals takes place and the red army joins them. Raimi had no right to destroy the 80s nostalgia for the sake of 90s modern cinema. Evil Dead 1 and 2 will forever remain among the greatest horror movies of all time, but Army of Darkness will be remembered as a complete waste of the potential of the same iconic franchise.

If you complain about the archaic special effects, then you've got no respect for the type of budget these people were fighting against to make as awesome of action sequences as they possibly could.  This film has got enough one-liners to make Jimmy Pop Ali look like a Carrot Top act (if that wasn't an obscure enough reference).  If you haven't seen it, check it out and be wowed. Course, I don't see why you'd be reading this if you haven't seen it (that is unless you're a Bridget Fonda fan finding out info on movies of hers you've never seen nor heard of... she plays a HUGE role in this movie so watch it for her best performance ever...

Probably the most significant horror film of the 1990s.,"Maybe it's an exaggeration to say AoD is the single most important cultural event of the nineties, but there's no denying that it has fundamentally affected pop culture.  Ash is the ultimate wisecracking anti-hero, and he will live in our hearts and video-games forever.  Not to mention the fact that the success of this film paved the way for Raimi et al.'s later projects (ie, Hercules and above all Xena).  Not that any of that matters particularly when you're sitting down to watch the flick; let's just say it's probably the most entertaining movie since Star Wars and leave it at that.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Groovy!,"Bruce Campbell is ultra-cool in this follow up to the wonderful ""Evil Dead 2"". This movie is a lot different in tone than that classic flick- this is more of a slap stick comedy/adventure about a normal guy sent back in time to Medieval Times to fight the forces of evil. Sure, thought of as a sequel to ""Evil Dead 2"" it's a little disappointing, but I guess that's why it's not called ""Evil Dead 3"", they didn't want people to think it was another haunted cabin movie. And I'm glad they did something different instead of getting repetitive and doing the same thing over and over like other horror series.""Army of Darkness"" stands on it's own as a great movie (despite annoying parts, like when Ash illogically builds a mechanical hand instead of keeping the awesome chainsaw hand he starts the movie out with). Ash is a great hero, a wise-cracking guy who's always in over his head. I think this movie should have been rated 'PG-13', not 'R', as there is no gore or anything, just a guy fighting cartoonish skeletons. It's in the same spirit as the Brendon Fraiser ""Mummy"" movie, although much more witty.I guess that's all I have to say about this movie. It's good. Thank you.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hilarious horror-comedy fun.,"Army of Darkness is the third in Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead' trilogy. Previously, the films were aimed at a select group of viewers; those who could stomach the gallons of blood(and occasionally, bile) splattering across the screen. They turned out to be extremely popular with this audience; to the extent that this latest effort has much improved financial backing. This turns out to be a mixed blessing.In order to be commercially viable, the movie needed to aim for a wider audience. Thus, the gore is toned down greatly, which will disappoint those who enjoyed the slapstick brutality of the first two films. However, the increased budget does allow for more extravagant visual effects during the fight scenes. In my opinion, they enhances their entertainment value- more than the lack of blood shown on screen diminishes it. Another consequence of increased funding is that the film has a much grander scale to it than either of the previous Evil Dead films. This is mainly due to the more impressive sets, as well as the hundreds of extras involved.I thought the script to this movie was hilarious. I particularly liked Bruce Campbell's mean-spirited, but witty, anti-hero Ash. His disregard for the feelings of others is evident from the beginning of the film, as he addresses the medieval populace as `primates', ridiculing their `primitive intellect'. I found seeing a character such as this in a main-stream movie refreshingly amusing, especially with Campbell's performance.The supporting characters, while given relatively little screen time, were expanded well enough for me to care about what happened to them. Once again, the emphasis is on humour; I thought some of the character's mannerisms were hilarious. Such as King Arthur's method of taking his sword from a `sword boy' squatting in front of him. He grabs the handle offered to him, and stomps the servant to the floor. His subject falls backwards, keeping hold of the scabbard and thus removing it from the blade.The plot itself often makes little sense, but it doesn't take itself so seriously that this is a problem. Some of the less believable moments do actually add to the comedy. For example, Ash finds a conveniently placed book entitled `Steam Plant Operation' in the boot of his car. With the aid of a medieval-age Blacksmith, he then uses the information in the book to construct a steam-powered engine for the vehicle.Unlike Evil Dead II', this movie follows on from the events portrayed in the film preceding it. In a neat twist to the continuing story-line, in Evil Dead II', Ash read a history of what happens in Army of Darkness'. Little did he realise that later, he would be sent back in time and that he was reading about his own future.To conclude, I found watching this movie to be seriously fun. While there are no life changing lessons to be learnt here, I thought it worked brilliantly as a piece of humorous entertainment. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I Hope They Don't Make A Remake Of This Gem,"As a fan of the first two films, which introduced me to Bruce Campbell. I can say this third installment is a worthy follow up. The pit scene and Sam Raimi's name, you can't go wrong. The artwork put into a film of this caliber is fantastic. The humor of the onlookers, the spirit, and everything seems to all be there. And you are cheering Ash on with the crowd as he is fighting like a gladiator. The book of the dead, the Necronomicon is the basis of the whole film. You destroy that book and Ash would never even be in this mess. He just wants his life back. Though this film is ""S-Smart."" And it is a win! A lot of points earned for the epic battle with the ""deadites."" If anyone has read the book the ""Swan Song"" by Robert R. McCammon, you know what I'm talking about. Though this is kind of like referencing the parking lot when everybody is butting heads, it does its own thing. I am for Raimi's artistic direction and all, but things spin out of control as far as is direction. This needed to be explained to me. How Ash managed to fix his car that dropped from the sky, and then had time to turn it into a battle rig, is beyond me. Some things like this make no sense. I understand this took a while to orchestrate, or at least it looks that way, but the deadites are already dead. Why on earth would they be needing wooden shield roll-aways? they are ""bags of bones."" Anyhow, I will say this is a very original work and Sheila is a hoot. There are parts that suggest an admiration for Brian de Palma's ""Carrie, 1976"" involving her. Sheila ""got real ugly"" when she copies Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) standing in front of Ashes car. This was really my only complaint. Raimi could of thought of something better for this shot, something more original. The only difference from Carrie using her powers is Ash abandons his vessel. So she just woke up one day and was a crazed strung-out possessed zombie? Oh well, still cool. Good resolve at the end by Raimi, bringing us back to the main objective of the whole film, the book. My final thought is the whole film could be in Ashes imagination as he is working. And then he wakes up in his bed, and realizes it's all a dream. The score was interesting and I think anyone who is a fan of Steven Spielberg's, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, or Tim Burton's, A Nightmare Before Christmas will appreciate this.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"You'll laugh, you'll cryyou'll be terrified. (OK, a little far)","The two preceding `Evil Dead' movies were good but they lacked the lightweight humor, slapstick, and camp of the closing third.Ash, brought back in time to the Middle Ages, lands in the middle of a war and is taken prisoner for being part of the opposite side. Unfortunately he still has to deal with those evil spirits that possess human bodies. But armed with a chainsaw, a car full of supplies and one trash-talking mouth, these satanic schmucks are nothing the blade can't handle, even when they make a doppelganger of him. Eventually you'll have no problem telling the difference between the good Ash and bad Ash.

Should have been great - but wasn't.,"This film should have been great - but wasn't. The plot summary, that a man falls back in time and ends up leading an army of knights and surfs against the 'army of darkness', should have given enough scope to create a memorable and enjoyable film. Unfortunately that was not to be. The characters remain paper thin and the plot lacks any depth of interest and is too simple and obvious. With what must have been a limited budget the effects are limited, but that would be OK if the plot and the characters engaged you. Its a relief to get to the end of the film. If you haven't seen any of the following I would recommend them as a better use of your time :'28 days later''Dawn of the dead' (2004 version)'Aliens (Alien 2)''Land of the dead' (2005 version)'Ghosts of Mars''Tremors' (1 only, not 2 or 3).Have fun watching film !",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Don't watch this movie expecting anything serious at all.  It is for fun and nothing else.  It doesnt try to be a serious deal and thats what I like about it.  Its got no message, a small and non-intricate plot, and the characters are foolish.  One of the memorable moments in this movie occurs when the hero, Ash, is attacked my mini versions of himself.  This scene illustraits the point of this movie.  The comedy featured in this scene is pure physical comedy, which is found less and less in movies today.

Great Horror Comedy,"The ""Evil Dead"" trilogy is among the greatest film trilogies of all time, and is easily my favorite horror film trilogy (it's actually my favorite horror film SERIES, on top of that). This trilogy combines horror and humor more successfully than any other. They're are masterpieces when it comes to entertainment and fun, and ""Army of Darkness"" is no exception.It's quite different than the other two ""Evil Dead"" films, due to it having a less dark tone, and a more mainstream feel (on top of this, it's also set in a much different time period than the first two). At times, it feels much more like an action comedy than a horror comedy-but it's extremely entertaining regardless. Most of the humor comes from some of the most well executed slapstick I've ever seen, and there's also plenty of quotable lines and a great comic performance by Bruce Campbell.With its brilliant special effects, hilarious dark comedy, and thrilling action, ""Army of Darkness"" remains one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A corny movie that's worth watching repeatedly!,"Ok, no big secret here. This movie is downright CORNY. However, its is far better than a LOT of non-corny movies that I have seen! A man from modern times is transported to medieval times, and must retrieve the Necronomicon, or Book of the Dead, to get home. Corny, but interesting at the same time.The fun factor here has to be the highest of any movie I've seen in the past. Don't worry about intricate plots and confusing storylines-this film is just for laughs and excitement. It's really a comedy disguised as a medieval horror flick.Although many would disagree with me, I think Bruce Campbell (Ash) put on quite an impressive display of acting. I mean, who could possibly imitate that crazed face he makes as he lops off his right hand with a chainsaw, or that expression of shock and agony (which I thought was the funniest part in the whole movie) as a nail embeds itself into his foot! Also, his one-liners are terrific. ""Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."" has got to be one of coolest quips ever spoken by a movie hero.The undead skeletons that appear in the latter half of the film also add a great deal of laughs, with their evil-but-comical remarks. Trust me, these monsters are anything BUT frightening, but I think of it as a welcome change, and an original innovation compared to the gory, terrifying beasts of most other horror movies.Overall, I don't recommend this movie to a die-hard fan of the horror genre. I do, however, recommend it to individuals who are just seeking an evening of entertainment and laughs. Trust me, don't pay attention to the corniness, just sit back and giggle. This film isn't meant to be broken down scientifically, because if it is, one can find many imperfections (firing more rounds than a shotgun can hold without reloading, falling to the ground from a high castle wall without receiving any noticeable injuries, etc.).All of this said, Army of Darkness is a lot of fun to watch.

Better than Evil Dead 2,"After being dissapointed with Evil Dead 2, I wasn't sure whether or not to rent Army of Darkness. But I did, and this time I knew what to expect. It was going to be an adventure, a comedy, a fantsy and a horror. So i watched it, and I loved it! The movie starts where Evil Dead 2 left off: Ash in the Middle Ages. Now he has to find the Book of the Dead to stop and army of Deadites from awakening and destroying a kingdome. As you would have guessed, he accidently unleashes the Army of Darkness. What I liked about this film is that the blood wasn't really exaggerated, except for the start of the movie. From then on, it was seemingly realistic blood and gore, and not a lot of it. The acting has improved by ten points this time, even from Bruce Campbell, making him the best of the bunch. This movie was bizarre in it's own little way, but not as much as Evil Dead 2. There were times that you'd laugh because it was so stupid and wierd, and other times when you'd laugh because it was funny.

"The funniest movie in cinematic history, I mean it!","It is almost unbelievable that my favored horror film (along with ""Halloween"") and my favored comedy (along with nothing because no other film can keep up to this one) belong to the same trilogy. The Evil Dead is the most frightening movie ever and Army of Darkness is just terrific. When seeing this one I became an instant Bruce Campbell fan.

Now he has to fight a horde of skeletons with the aid of Prince Arthur and Henry ""Mr. Fancy Pants"" the Red.There's one reason why this movie is so fantastic: Bruce Campbell.

"""Hail to the King, Baby"" or ""I slept too long!""  ?","Army of Darkness brings the Evil Dead Trilogy to a close (for now at least) with the funniest instalment.  Evil Dead was horror with comedy, Evil Dead 2 was comedy with horror, but Army of Darkness is comedy with fantasy.  As Sam Raimi admits, it's less a homage to horror films but more to the old Ray Harryhausen classics like Sinbad or 'Jason and the Argonauts' (most obviously the army of skeletons).There are numerous different versions of the film, each with their own good points, although the recent Director's Cut release is the one Sam Raimi considers to be the most complete.  This has 15 minutes extra footage beyond the American Universal release, including the original ending.  Here in England, the original release was far closer to this new Director's Cut, though there are welcome additions.  Most noticably, the battle with the 'army of darkness' is much longer and features some amusing fight scenes which were previously cut for running time.  The longer version also fills in a number of plot holes and, as Raimi points out, sorts out many of the continuity errors.Opinion is generally divided on the subject of the ending.  The original American release featured a re-shot ending where Ash, back in the present, fights an evil-dead-hag in a shopping mall before finishing with the famous ""Hail to the king, baby"".  This is much funnier than the official ending and it's a shame it's not included as an extra on the Director's Cut.  However, it's easy to see why Raimi and Campbell prefer the original, 'downbeat' ending.  It fits the tone of the film better, and bears closer relation to Evil Dead 2 by ending on a cliffhanger.  It also has more interesting implications about what could happen in a sequel, should one ever be made. The one complaint I have about the Director's Cut is the replacement of the legendary line, ""Good, Bad.  I'm the guy with the gun"", with the international version's ""I ain't that good"".Personally, I think newcomers to the series might be better off seeing the 80 minute version (or perhaps the international version) first, but those who've seen the first two films should stick with the more complete and more satisfying 96 minute Director's Cut.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty much you either love it or hate it.,"Probably one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Great one liners.Bruce Cambell (Ash) isn't the greatest of actors, but wow, for this he was the only choice.While Rami's previous movies are entertaining, (Evil Dead, Evil Dead II) this one hits the top. Combining great effects with slapstick comedy. I would recommend it to any twisted individual who seeks campy comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great movie that is often misunderstood.,"I remember seeing Army of Darkness for the first time nearly two years ago. I immediately became obsessed with it and the other films as well in the Evil Dead trilogy.  While Evil Dead is great, and Evil Dead II has its moments, it is Army of Darkness that stands at the head of the pack and deservedly should be recognized as the greatest B-movie of all-time.The genius behind this film is that it appears to hypes itself up to be some great horror masterpiece but is really a comedy instead(just read the back-cover of the movie before watching it and you'll see.)  Every cliche that is commonplace in bad horror movies is made apparent in Army of Darkness, yet the movie does nothing to disguise itself from the fact that this was done on purpose to ridicule the common faults of bad horror movies.I love watching people complain about this movie. ""That isn't possible, there is no way a belt can knot itself around a chain like that"" or, ""How can he shoot off 32 rounds from a shotgun without reloading?""  People who mutter these comments often miss the point of the movie.  Those things were added on purpose.  YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO DISSECT THIS MOVIE AND TALK ABOUT WHAT IS AND ISN'T POSSIBLE.  You are supposed to just sit back, forget about the laws of nature, and enjoy the great one-liners by Bruce Campbell(God of B-movie actors) and the hilarious and idiotic plot created by Sam Raimi. This is a movie about pure entertainment, not dramatic and artistic values.In this way, Army of Darkness is often a misunderstood film.  People try to look and find substance when substance isn't there to begin with(which is the reason people love it in the first place.)  If you have never seen this film, go out and watch it as soon as you can.  However, as I have warned you above, don't try looking too deep into it.  Just sit back, get ready for some cheesy lines and a plot made out of velveeta, and enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wicked,"This movie has it all, comedy, romance, action and suspense. The third in the series this movie follows a man (Ash) who goes back in time with his trust Boom Stick (Shotgun) to face an unholy army of dead. Packed with One-liners this movie is the bomb. **** Out of *****",,Anonymous,Horror
That's the part where the people clearly went too far.,"Of course it is nice to see the same scenario in a different environment and that in the same film series but what I do not like at all is that the tone and the mood of the movie are completely in another direction.The narrative arc where unfortunately spanned and the humor exaggerates it in many places and tried too often convulsively funnier than he should.This of course results in the fact that most of the film is completely unpleasant, the whole serious moments are only mediocre and I did not enjoy this movie. And that's a mistake, such movies are not there to teach people or to make them think so much, these movies are supposed to be fun and have cool effects, though the effects could somehow be seen, I am really disappointed that it has become so boring and unpleasant I should not have been that.I like the end the. And even alternative ending is actually pretty cool and if it were not for Bruce Campbell I would not like this movie at all but unfortunately it's my least favorite part.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sam Raimi is God,"I absolutely adore the Evil Dead series.  Raimi's style and humor are unique and hilarious.  Although I think Evil Dead 2 is the best of the series, Army of Darkness is a very good edition.  More of a comedy than a horror film, it still is a good ol' time with Ash.  Bruce Campbell should do much more than he does in the film industry.  He is the ultimate badass.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Love it or hate it?,"Well, I love it. It is so appalling that it's good! Surely that's the whole point of it. The entire film is nonsense and any connection with the two earlier films is purely accidental.Bruce Campbell is wonderful. He's one of my all-time heroes and this film is his piece de resistance. Surely he added all of those incredibly funny one-liners as he went along? You couldn't script such rubbish! The scene where he splits into Good Ash and Bad Ash and fights himself is hilarious, as is most of the rest of the film.Personally, in the same way that I think Tim Burton made a mistake calling his film 'Planet of the Apes', I think it was a mistake to call this film 'Evil Dead III'. I can see why they did but I think people then watch with an expectation, one that this film certainly will not live up to. It's about the unscariest film I've seen - and so does my nine year old grandson, who thinks it is hilarious. It's his favourite film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Come get some!""","Hail to the king, baby! This film is probably the most excellent movie I've ever seen! Choosing Bruce Campbell to be Ash was the perfect choice. This is probably the best of the ""Evil Dead"" series.The plot of this is that Ash gets sent back in time to the Medieval Ages where he helps a city obtain a power that destroys the ""Deadites"" and sends Ash back home.  If you want a fun, medium-scary movie, with zombies, killer clones, evil books, and Xena-shrieking creatures, this is it!  Quoting Ash, this film is ""Groovy!""",,Anonymous,Horror
"A perfect ""trash"" movie.","When I saw this movie a few hours ago, I didn't know it was a sequel to ""Evil Dead"", a movie I haven't seen yet. I generally like to start the franchises in the right order. However, and as far as I was reading, this film is the one that most differs from the antecedents, not least because the action takes place in the medieval period, and revolves around the possession of a book, the legendary Necronomicon.Contrary to what one might think, the Necronomicon was not an invention of Sam Raimi, or any of the elements in the film. The book was created by the writer H. P. Lovecraft, and the idea came to be used for the film. Raimi is a creative and original director, and it's not surprising that such a bizarre film came out of his head. Basically, what we have here is a simple warehouse employee who, after handling the book, is teleported to the year 1300. And of course, to return to our time, he will have to find the book there, and overcome dangers of various order, starting with the medieval nobles themselves, at war with each other.Bruce Campbell is the only actor who deserves mention in this cast of vast names in which there is no one who stands out positively. The cast is really one of the weaknesses and uninteresting of the film! And even Campbell is so irritating and arrogant that I didn't sympathize with his character at all, even though I know he's the hero and will somehow end up saving the day.The film is corny, it's quite cheap (we only need to look at the poor quality of the stop-motion animations and visual or special effects to see that) and it's so absurd that it's hilarious. There are scenes that seem to be taken from a satire, or a school play. It is impossible not to laugh at such a film, a perfect ""trash"" film.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Laughed My Ash Off!!,"I'm not an 'Evil Dead' fan. I've only seen 1 & 2 once some dozen years back (in the same weekend). Having said that, I am getting antsy to give them another shot. So I'm probably part of the minority that thoroughly enjoyed part 3 over it's predecessors. Why? Director Rami was beginning to graduate into a more polished film maker by this time with less of the rough edges that were in the first two (many may rightfully debate that this is part of their 'cult status' appeal). And Campbell had many moments that proves he's 'leading man' material. His acting is much more assured and FUNNY in this one.So at $12.99 plus tax for the 'Official Bootlegger's Director Cut', just couldn't pass it up. Love that original ending (equally love the 'reshot' ending too!). Miss that ""I'm the guy with the gun"" line though. And Campbell and the Rami's bantering in the commentary made me a believer that some commentaries are worth listening to (which usually aren't justified except as an added selling tool).7 out of 10! Wish there were more movies that were this much fun.",,Anonymous,Horror

The greatest director of all time (Sam Raimi) has done it again with some great visuals and a lot of style in the making.

Classic B-Grade Movie!!!!!,"This movie, contrary to my beliefs, does not have the greatest special effects of its time. It still is an outstanding movie, despite its low-budget. It delivers and it delivers it hard, shunning out any other B-movie that I can think of. It stars the underrated Bruce Campbell as the one-line-spitting-shotgun-blasting-chainsaw-hacking Ash Williams. This movie, being one of his only starring rolls next to the other Evil Dead movies, is creative and funny. It isn't as gory or scary as the first Evil Dead movies but keep in mind it also has a completely different plot. The first 2 were located in a cabin in the woods and this one is located in a barren area in medieval times. Theres not much that I can find that bothers me about this movie except that the end of Evil Dead 2 is different than what is shown the beginning of Army of Darkness. The end of Evil Dead 2 shows Ash saving people from a flying beast and the beginning of AOD shows him as a slave, but you can't let that ruin the movie. It is a great movie and my favorite at that and I look forward to Campbell starring in a leading roll sometime soon. RATING **** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Quite possibly the greatest ""B"" movie ever made...","**WARNING** The following contains a plot summary of Army of Darkness.  If you want to enjoy the movie without knowing the plot ahead of time, do not read the paragraphs below.Bruce Campbell dons the mantle of our beloved hero Ash in the third of the Evil Dead series.  This is almost a completely stand-alone movie, and can be watched without having to view the previous two.  Bridget Fonda makes an ever-so brief cameo in the beginning as his ill-fated girlfriend from Evil Dead 2.  Why make an appearance in a movie like this if you have never been involved with the project before?  As Bruce Campbell himself said, when asked the same question, ""Would YOU turn down Bridget Fonda if she asked to have a small role in Army of Darkness?""The Book of the Dead, or Necronomicon, opens up a space/time gateway to medieval England, and Ash, along with his Oldsmobile, land with a thud. He is happened upon by a scouting party who mistake him for an enemy spy. After proving his worth to the nobles and peasants by fighting a Deadite in a breathtaking pit sequence, and winning the unwanted attention of a young maiden, the ""magicians"" of the court tell him that the only way to get back to his own time is to once again find the Necronomicon, which contains the needed magical phrases.On his quest for the Book of the Dead, he spends a night in an old, dilapidated windmill.  Evil magic is afoot, as his reflection in a mirror takes on a life of its own, calling itself Evil Ash.  After a short scuffle with Evil Ash, Ash whips out his trusty boomstick, shoots Evil Ash dead in the face, and utters one of his famous taglines, ""Good...bad...I'm the one with the gun.""Traveling on, he finally comes across his prize...or prizes as the case may be.  Ash comes across a dark altar with not one, but three Necronomicons. Remembering only part of the incantation needed to take the Necronomicon from its resting place, coupled with choosing the wrong book, Ash makes a costly mistake.  Evil Ash is raised from the dead, his face half-blown off from Ash's gunshot.  Being formerly part of Ash (his reflection), he knows what Ash knows, and knows where Ash will be bringing the Necronomicon. Evil Ash uses his dark power to raise a Deadite army, with which he will lay siege to the town and castle.Ash, returning to the castle with the true Necronomicon, finds himself playing peace-maker between the locals and a neighboring town, who have been overtaken by the Deadite army.  The two factions settle their differences, and make their stand against the Deadites, but not without initial loss. The young maiden who had caught the eye of Ash, is spirited away by a Deadite winged scout, and brainwashed into joining the Deadites.The Deadite army surrounds the castle, and Ash, being the ingenius hero we have all come to know, uses his knowledge to devise semi-modern weaponry to use against the Deadites, including gunpowder-tipped arrows and transforming his Oldsmobile into a battletank.In the end, all is well.  The epic battle is won by Ash, Evil Ash is blown apart by a cache of gunpowder, the spell over the young maiden is broken, and the Deadites break ranks and flee.  Ash uses the Necronomicon to return home, but not without one last surprise.  A superb gem of a movie that deserved much more credit than is granted it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Awesome. Funniest Movie you'll ever see.,"If you're like me, Army of Darkness is one of those movies that you saw when you were about 15 or 16, and then didn't tell anyone about it, because you thought it so cool, and you wanted to keep it to yourself. Then 6 years later you realize that alot of people have seen this film and have kept it a secret too. Now it has gained some sort of quasi-cult status by a great many people under the age of 25, who don't realize how popular this film has become.It is hard to believe that that the same man, Sam Raimi, who directed ""The Evil Dead"" in the mid 80's directed ""Army of Darkness"" (Looking back on it it is even harder to believe that he is the man who brought us ""The Gift and ""A Simple Plan"")AoD is one of the most creative and mind bending comedies you will ever see. It is rife with film references that only a true geek could appreciate, on top of that it parodies everything from ""The Day the Earth stood Still"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Jason and the Argonaughts"", and more than anything else, the previous two Evil Dead Films, that are truly Cult Classics.Bruce Campbell's ""Ash"" who appeaed in the two Evil Deads, is the archtypal Alpha Male, shotgun wielding, with a chainsaw for an arm (literally), and over-done chisled looks which almost mock the notion of what makes a good looking man.Ash thinks he is control, which often leads to his undoing. Especially when he finds himself in 13th century england after being sucked into an odd vortex at the end of Evil dead 2. The inhabitants of the realm find themselves plagued by the ""Deadites"" an army of undead warriors brought to life by the same evil force which has inhabited the settings of all 3 films. The run-ins with these creatures culminates in an climactic battle between humans, skeletons and Ash's mutilated clone.Only Ash has the ability to defeat these monsters, but how will he get back to the present? A little Hocus Pocus, wouldn't hurt.If you want to see an excellent film taht will make you laugh... go rent ""Annie Hall"". If you want to see one of the most innovative, off the wall comedies ever made, go rent ""ARMY OF DARKNESS"".",,Anonymous,Horror
Worst of the series,"Just continues the further descent of the trilogy. Bruce Campbell is classic, and there are some terrific scenes, but overall it's silly, cheezy, and not really that funny. The fantasy horror aspect of it doesn't mesh well with the action adventure element, and the comedy makes it go way over the top. I did like the obvious influence that it had over the Helm's Deep battle in Two Towers, though there's no doubt in my mind at all which sequence is better. The ending is pretty ballsy too. But the slapstick doesn't work nearly as well as in the second one, and the acting, script, and even visuals are all pretty poor.

Raimi's evolved style of total comic book hilarity,"Sam Raimi's third (but possibly not last) installment in his 'Evil Dead' series shows Ash (Bruce Campbell, a cult hero of sorts) right after Evil Dead 2, now back in medieval times, still fighting against the unpredictably grotesque and bizarre Necronomicon. This is just a set-up though, like with most comic-books, for mostly a series of visual gags, in-jokes, puns, homages, and out-right hilarity and parody. In other words, if you're wanting to watch this for the same reasons you wanted to watch the original Evil Dead, you may be disappointed. This is the sort of evolution that Raimi has taken the series with: the first was a film from a filmmaker 21 years old, with an over-load of visual energy, pumping out one of the most visceral and inventive of all horror films.The sequel went half and half- at times it took the sincerity and true horror of the first film, but it also had a lot to laugh about too, as it didn't take itself seriously for most of it. With Army of Darkness, it's tongue-in-cheek incarnate. Take a scene where Ash has just resurrected the ""deadites"" (through some fault of his own, mumbling the last word of his forgotten phrase to stop the curse from the book of the dead) to rise. He suddenly gets pulled down to the ground, and the skeletons from the graves have their way with him, in short, having a fight in the tradition of a Three Stooges skit (blocking eye-pokes and all). This leads up to the skeletons forming their 'army' of the title, and it's more like a wild send-up of Jason and the Argonauts than a real 'zombie' film as some horror fans might be mis-led to believe. By the time Ash gets out his chainsaw wielded on his arm, its become cliché all the way, but expertly clever cliché.There is no 'message' from the film really, it's just a full-blown, ludicrous romp with the middle ages and the occult- and it's all the better (and gets better on repeat viewings like Brooksfilm comedies) due to this. And the film may or may not work for some depending on the stamina and prowess of Campbell, who for me is one of the funniest people working in low-budget films today (he comes up occasionally in big-budget films too), but may be a little too 'ham' for some viewers. Like Evil Dead 2, From Dusk Till Dawn, and Return of the Living Dead among others, Army of Darkness joins that handful of films that's for a select audience (it's not as graphic with its gore as in the first film, but its still in high gear), to have as a good 'party movie' with friends.

Sure it is no longer a Horror Comedy and more so just a Comedy but it still balances a lot of tge elements that make the franchise great and creates something unique from it, instead acting as a parody of the dark fantasy movies and giving it a great strange Sam Raimi spin.The film is just iconic, so many great lines, Bruce Campbell is at his very best and insane here and the franchise is at its very best script and direction wise.
God dammit, I just love this film, it's just cult film at its finest. With so many great lines of dialogue and both Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi at there finest, well at least in my opinion.What can I say, this one is my favourite, it's what I want in a film from the Evil Dead franchise; a strange, dark and hilarious passion-project of a film with great direction, editing, special effects and not to mention the hammy dialogue of the best kind.Great movie, always a fun watch, hammy and epic in all the right ways and just an absolute iconic fantasy film. I give this movie a Hail to the King Baby/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Third in the Evil Dead Story...,"After Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell), housewares, is transported back through time and space, he finds himself in a village that must fight the Evil Dead (the Deadites). To defeat them and create a portal back to the future, Ash must retrieve the Neconomicon and face great peril: miniature versions of himself, demons and other baddies.Usually a film of this caliber would not get such a high rating. The acting is cheesy, the plot rather weak and the costumes are poorly constructed (no one can possibly believe this is 1300). Even the dialog is unusual and the camera shots (a Raimi staple) are just not very solid. But somehow the film pulls it all off -- making the viewer believe that all this was done intentionally (and apparently Hollywood believed it, too, since they gave Raimi the Spider-Man franchise).We get more of the slapstick humor we found in ""Evil Dead II"" and the Bruce Campbell many horror fans have grown to love. Only now he is trapped in medieval times. This is clearly the lesser of the three films (the horror element is lessened and the humor aspect raised, which I think hurts the overall feel). Yet, you'll find it hard to watch one without the other.Bill Moseley makes an appearance as the Evil Deadite Captain. You can't tell it's him, and I'm willing to bet many horror fans who love Moseley are not aware of his part in this film. It's an odd paradox: ""Army of Darkness"" is probably a better loved film than ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre II"", but Moseley is better known from the latter (and now ""Devil's Rejects""). Confront Bill about this if you ever run into him.Bridget Fonda also makes a very brief appearance. It's very strange... but maybe not so strange once you've seen her in ""Jackie Brown"". That Fonda clan is a strange bunch...But anyway, lacking a great plot or gore or nudity or even professional acting, this film shines and will remain a cult favorite long after I'm dead. As much as I'd love to tear it apart for the critical flaws, I just can't: my love for it is right up there with the love from the other fanboys. All I can hope is that they eventually get around to an ""Evil Dead IV"" (which I guess will never happen now that they've approved ""Spider-Man VI""...)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very underrated.,Flies by with its hour and 20 minute runtime. This film is extremely entertaining and proves how creative Raimi can be with a concept.

Army of Darkness,"The Evil Dead trilogy has had a truly remarkable evolution. The first movie was a drive in horror film, the second movie was a horror comedy, and the third movie is a rousing adventure movie. Army of Darkness is definitely my favorite of the three and it's probably the most quotable. Bruce Campbell is very charismatic and he delivers his lines with gusto. Everything from ""boomstick"" to ""gimme some sugar baby"" are memorable lines. Personally, for my money my favorite line is ""Good, bad. I'm the guy with the gun."" Bruce Campbell definitely carries this movie and Sam Raimi's stellar direction helps. Danny Elfman's orchestral score to "" March of the Dead"" is quite good, it makes the movie feel far more epic than it is. It's amazing what a great genre director can do with a 11 million dollar budget.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, Bad, ... Campbell's the guy with the gun!","Put simply, this is one of the best action-adventure films ever made. Bruce Campbell is absolutely awesome in this flick. He's the model superhero: funny one-liners, fast moves, a great shot, and a ladies man; what more can you ask for an action film like this. Campbell's Ash makes Indiana Jones look like Mr. Rodgers! Campbell isn't the only great element for this movie. You got great medival backdrops, horrifying monsters, and great special effects. The other actors, especially the lady who played Sheila (I forgot the actresses' name!) portray their roles convincingly well, too. ""Army of Darkness"" is a great film to watch on Halloween night, even though this movie isn't really that frightening, but it will give you chills up the spine.

In fact, I really cannot comment on the rest of the cast except to say that they supported Campbell well.

not just pillowtalk,"Bruce Campbell is captivating (read: decapitating) as ever in this great sequel of Evil Dead 2.  He plays the arrogant hero with unsurpassed facial acrobatics.  'Army' is less experimental, shows off it's big budget and has totally different brilliant action scenes that kept me laughing (hysterically pounding with my feet on the ground).  It has a more solid plot (no matter which version you choose), better actors than The Evil Dead (doesn't actually matter, because Campbell rules anyway, especially when he's on his own), eviscerating art direction, a walnut stock, cobalt blue steel and a haired trigger.But seriously: it was the first movie in the series that I saw ('94) and I was immediately caught up in Raimi's web.  Moreover, I can't resist any movie which features Bruce Campbell since Army.  They both blow the Evil Dead concept to almost epic proportions here.  Cinematographer Bill Pope gloriously continues Peter Deming's stunning work on Evil Dead 2.  E.g. the 'Ash/little Ash' scene in the mill is fabulous.  Unfortunately, the hard-core experimental b-movie appeal is (almost) gone with the arrival of Dino De Laurentiis.  Still, you can call me in the middle of the night to watch it again anytime.  The ultimate recommendations after seeing this one should be Chinese Ghost Story (1987), Braindead (1992) and of course Evil Dead 2 (1987), although The Evil Dead (1982) started all the fun of course. Oh, and the terrible waster Evil Dead Trap (1988) has NOTHING to do with this one.More serious (far-fetched) recommendations about guys trapped in the wrong time/system are: Catch-22 (1970, Nichols) and Brazil (1985, Gilliam) and maybe even Kafka (1991, Soderbergh), Le Procès (1963, Welles).  Warning: the last two are definitely neither meant to be funny nor horror.10 points out of 10 :-)",,Anonymous,Horror
"Army of Darkness doesn't possess as much edge or novelty as the prior entries, but it's still a good time.","After being sucked into a time portal, Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) awakens in the year 1,300 A. D. in medieval England where Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) is fighting against the possessed humans known as deadites while also waging war against Duke Henry the Red (Richard Grove). After an initial misunderstanding, Ash is determined by the Wise Man (Ian Abercrombie) that he is the one prophesied to defeat the deadites and in exchange for acquiring the Necronomicon they will send Ash back to his own time.Following the international success of Evil Dead II and even larger success of Darkman, Sam Raimi got the traction he needed to make his long gestating Army of Darkness at Universal. Writing alongside his brother Ivan, Raimi set to make a film inspired by swashbucklers and Ray Harryhausen adventure films such as 7th Voyage of Sinbad and Jason and the Argonauts while still maintaining the identity of an Evil Dead movie. While Raimi had free reign to film whatever he wanted, problems with both Universal and the MPAA lead to certain elements getting excised or removed including the original ending which was switched out for something more upbeat. The movie also had issues with the MPAA as the initial cut was given an NC-17 rating while Universal wanted a PG-13 and despite Universal themselves recutting the film it was still rated R while given little promotion due to disputes between Universal and Producer Dino De Laurentis. The movie performed modestly on its release and received decent if slightly more mixed reviews. For the most part I think Army of Darkness is a really enjoyable film even if it's been slightly homogenized in the studio process.Raimi has a lot of fun with the Medieval setting which is very much evocative of those old adventure films Ray Harryhausen would provide effects work for. The movie features some good prosthetics work and stop motion for the titular Army of Darkness, and while it may not have the over the top bloodspatter we saw in prior entries there's still a lot of fun and creativity on display with the sequences even if they're lighter in tone. Bruce Campbell still remains great as Ash and even pulls double duty as an evil doppelganger. We also get a funny sequence where Ash is attacked by evil miniature versions of himself a la Gulliver's Travels and the comedic timing and effects work is spot on. The movie features plenty of quotable moments and cheesy oneliners so it's pretty much guaranteed you'll have a good time.While Army of Darkness probably isn't the best Evil Dead movie objectively speaking, it is the one that I most frequently revisit due to the humor and fun. Despite the R-rating this is actually a pretty decent starting place if you want to introduce newcomers to the series and you could probably work your way backwards to the original in terms of upping the intensity.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The most entertaining bad movie you'll ever see...,"For those fans of the Evil Dead, you need not a review. This movie is just a continuation in the incredible series and that should be good enough. But for those who aren't familiar with the series, ""Army of Darkness"" is still a VERY entertaining stand alone film.If someone were to explain the plot to you, you would think it sounds like the cheesiest movie plot you've ever heard. ""Dude, it's about this guy who sent back in time to like the medieval period and he's sent on a mission to kill a bunch of monsters and zombies, his evil twin and such to recover the book of the dead to vanquish the army of darkness."" It just sounds ridiculous. AND IT IS! And that's what's most appealing about it. It's got the ultimate B-movie appeal. It's filled with great humor mixed with slapstick and one-liners, it's a low budget production (if you're into that), and it's central character is perhaps one of the most enjoyable ever imagined.Ash (or simply Bruce Campbell, the two have become interchangeable) is a very fun character for two reasons. First, he is perhaps the most incompetent hero you'll ever encounter and the only incomplete idiot. Ash truly shows that if you're going to be good at just one thing...be good at fighting the undead. Second, Bruce Campbell is a grade A Badass! Whether it's his Ugly American attitude of being loud, crude, rude, egocentric, and obnoxious or simply his attire of wielding a chainsaw for a hand and a shotgun he calls his boomstick, Ash always comes out as top dog. Campbell could easily give Norris, Stallone, Willis, and Statham a run for their money.All in all, ""Army of Darkness"" just might be the most entertaining bad movie you'll ever see. Meaning it should be bad based on so many elements, but it's amazingly fun and memorable.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Crazy, it knows it and works because odd it. Rami trilogy ends with a bang.","This movie is just but, that's all can say. 81 minutes of our, high energized insanity. It's confused about itself. Does it want to be a midlevel picture, a goofy comedy, a gore splashed horror fright fest? These are, but here I can't really complain. It all so unapologetically  insane, and it knows it. From that, I help but want more and more. The first two films in this series kind of get this too. Yet here it's much more personified.Rami is a quite interesting filmmaker. His directing techniques are very low quality, that too adds to the charm. of dutch angles and clever camera movements. He really knows how to make a scene move and move fast. Of course, we need to have a talk about the one and only Bruce Campbell. He carries the film quite naturally. He is at his most funny and schematic of the whole series here. He makes me laugh and get behind him when he makes commentary on the of whatever situation he finds himself in, just that good constantly with him.In the end, this is a short film, it goes by in a snap, and I enjoyed every minute.

Cult Classic,"Army of Darkness A.K.A. Evil Dead 3 is once again directed by Sam Raimi and it's the epic return of Bruce Campbell as Ash, our hero with a chainsaw for an arm. The Evil Dead is one of my favorite movies ever and Evil Dead 2 is so different that's it's also pretty good in its own right (although I am one of those weirdos who prefers the first Evil Dead). While the first film in the series was going for a campy horror tone, the second one was more of a goofy campy horror movie and now Army of Darkness leaves all the horror behind and focuses 100% on comedy.The movie is a slapstick comedy and it never tries to be anything else. It's goofy, schlocky and it never takes itself seriously, at all. I love the set designs, costumes and makeup too. It's all pretty schlocky and weird but it's so great especially because of the movie's tone. I love the skeletons that move in stop-motion. And I really love about the first 30 minutes of Army of Darkness, it's constant laughter. After that however, after the scene Ash goes into the mill, the movie starts to go downhill. The comedy doesn't always work and it becomes very hit or miss. The story also becomes predictable when everyone thinks Ash will abandon them to die and it's so obvious that he's gonna stay and fight. The battle feels way too long (even if it's not) and it's because not all of the humor works. Oddly, I found so many similarities between The Two Towers and Army of Darkness. Many shots and set designs of the castle during the battle looked pretty similar to the battle of Helm's Deep in Lord of the Rings. Also some of the things that happen are very similar: like Henry's army arriving to save the day when all hope seems lost. It's like when Gandalf shows up with the Rohirrim.Anyway, Army of Darkness is certainly not a great film, I probably wouldn't even call it a good film but it works (for the most part) and there's a reason it's become a cult classic by now. Bruce Campbell is amazing and delivers some of the best one-liners ever and it's just a movie that has so much energy. It always puts a big smile on my face.",,Anonymous,Horror

Army of Darkness,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe story in this installment is the best bay far. The medieval aspect of it is just plain awesome.The acting has gotten a lot better and Bruce Campbell's Ash is once again a badass.The pacing is fast and the humor throughout the film is great. There are many hilarious moments that keep the film light.The gore is not as gruesome as the first two films but the monsters are still fresh and unique. Some of the special effects are outdated but still good for 1992.Pros: Great story, good acting, Ash being a bad, fast pacing, and some hilarious momentsCons: Some poor special effects and not as gruesome as the first two filmsOverall Rating: 8.3",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bruce is back!,"'Evil Dead.' The original 'video nasty.' 'Evil Dead II.' The half sequel, half remake, three quarters reboot of the original 'video nasty.' 'Army of Darkness.' The sequel to one ending of the remake of 'Evil Dead' which sort of follows on, but also kind of creates a new continuity which then gets erased depending on which version you watch and then how you interpret what follows in 'Ash vs The Evil Dead.' Confused yet? It doesn't matter. Basically, if you're a fan of cheesy horror-comedies (or just love Bruce Campbell as much as I do) then you'll have a blast with 'Army of Darkness.' Despite 'The Evil Dead' franchise's 'liberal' attitude to continuity, no one seems to care. That's probably because its fan-base is just so damn loyal that they forgive these frequent lapses in story-telling and simply enjoy the films (and now TV show) for what they are - dumb, silly - and very, very gory - fun.'Army of Darkness' carries on this tradition. Yes, you probably should have watched at least 'Evil Dead II,' but this (sort of) third instalment will hardly punish you for not knowing its entire back story. Basically, a man gets trapped in medieval times and has to fight his way back to the present. However, it just so happens that the man in question has just so happened to have a lot of experience in slaying disgusting monsters and manages to do it without the use of a hand and an array of dry quips (and a shotgun - that comes in pretty handy, too). Yes, it's none other than 'Ash,' played effortlessly by Bruce Campbell.If you've never heard of Ash/Bruce Campbell, it's actually quite hard to tell where one ends and the other begins (assuming they're different people to begin with). He's certainly not your average hero. He's definitely not politically correct and fits perfectly with the whole 'Evil Dead' feel of gore and gags. It never takes itself seriously and delights in spraying more unnecessary pints of blood all over the screen for as long as possible (most of which ends up on Bruce one way or another!).I suppose if you're completely used to 'modern horror' and like your films 'dark, gritty and realistic' then you may hate 'Army of Darkness' (and the whole 'Evil Dead' vibe). The special effects are pretty cheap-looking (not much computer-generated effects here, mainly blue screen and practical effects). It's hardly scary, choosing self-knowingness over true horror. But it certainly is disgusting. And great fun. There's a reason why the 'Evil Dead' films have stood the test of time (and why its dark and gritty remake of 2013 is barely worth talking about). 'Army of Darkness' is a shining example of a great film that can be made without the need for a massive budget (although, compared to the original 'Evil Dead's' budget, I guess 'Army of Darkness' was 'expensive!'Hail to the king of B-movies and the whole 'Evil Dead' franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A funny gross out adventure,"I never saw this back in the day and just watched it without realising that it is the third film of the 'Evil Dead' movies. It works as a stand alone however.I found it funny and something really interesting was the outdoor daylight shots were very beautiful, there is something to be said about actual film recordings. It looks great in places, but then there are so many weird things that happen and they are composed together a little rough; some of the effects didn't really age well.A note on the non stop action and music, it got a little tiring on my ears. This film is a little on the noisy side with little moments that calm damn and give a breather. Also I didn't really like the settings in the 1300 medieval period, it's not really my thing.I would have given this a 7, but the Ash character was great in particular Bruce Campbell is amazing in this role. I gave another point because of this quote alone:""Alright you Primitive Screwheads, listen up! You see this? This... is my BOOMSTICK! The twelve-gauge double-barreled Remington. S-Mart's top of the line. You can find this in the sporting goods department. That's right, this sweet baby was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Retails for about a hundred and nine, ninety five.

This third installment of The Evil Dead franchise sees Ash as he travels back in time to medieval England. There he must fight the army of the undead alongside his own army of knights. This horror/comedy is a wild ride. It's ridiculous, campy, and very entertaining. The one-liners all throughout the movie are hilariously awful.

hilarious!,"i'd seen this movie kicking around video stores for years and it looked kinda weird. well, the other night , curiosity got the best of me and i wasnt sorry that it did!!! this movie was the most bizarre movie ive EVER seen, but in a good way! the acting was great, being intentionally corny, i guess to spoof some of the acting in many horror movies. bruce campbell was hilarious as ""Ash"", an employee at ""S-Mart"" (get it?) who becomes involved with the ""necronomican"" (i cant believe i know how to spell it!)and some ancient evil is released which kills his girlfriend and then comes back for him. he gets sent back to medievel times, and needs to retrieve the necronomican to get back to his own time. campbell has some really funny one liners which left me laughing. there are even some spoofs of george lucas/steven speilberg movies that are kinda hard to spot. and the cinematography in this movie was INCREDIBLE!!!!! great weird shots that added to the campy dark quality of the movie. the humor in this movie is downright bizarre but absolutely hilarioius. i was almost suprised this was in the ""horror"" section at the video store. its a great spoof of horror movies with many very original moments as well. i give this a 10 outta 10. i couldnt find any flaws. the special effects were bad, but i think they were supposed to be to add to the tone of the movie.  definitely worth checking out for horror or comedy or movie buffs!",,Anonymous,Horror
Department store worker goes back in time,"A book awakens evil forces and sends Bruce Campbell into a magical past resembling Highlander medieval times with Scottish people. Just before sending him to this other realm, the book which is alive enters into his body and Bruce must chop off his hand with a handy-dandy chainsaw. He then puts the chainsaw in place of his right hand. In the other realm, he is captured by soldiers wearing English knight armor and Renaissance uniforms. At their castle the soldiers all throw Bruce into a pit where he kills a zombie. Even though they confiscated his chainsaw, he recovers it from a sorcerer who throws it in there so that he does not die. The magical sorcerer also lobbed Bruce's shotgun below. He releases the other prisoners who were about to be throw in the pit after him. With the shotgun he makes the rules now! So, basically, he is King in this realm because of his technology. Fortunately, his car was sent with him as well. He uses it in the final battle against the forces of Evil, the Evil Dead Army.

The dead won't let Ash go.,"Army of Darkness. The dead won't let Ash go. ""Army of Darkness"", the third film in the cult ""Evil Dead"" series, is a unique combination of horror, comedy and adventure. Director Sam Raimi once again delights viewers with the charismatic Ash (Bruce Campbell), who finds himself in a medieval world, fighting an army of the dead and his own demons. The film stands out for its absurd humor, exciting action scenes and an unpredictable plot. Filled with eccentric characters and cult quotes, ""Army of Darkness"" has become an example of a genre mix that captivates from the first minutes. The special effects, although they look naive by modern standards, fit the atmosphere perfectly. Campbell presented a cult hero who awakens nostalgia and is hilariously funny. This film is not just a sequel, but a standalone work that perfectly combines elements of horror and fantasy, making ""Army of Darkness"" a must-see for all fans of the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

the best in the series,The best film in the series. I can't believe it took me this long to realize it's Evil Dead 3.

"Great Movie, last guy didnt know dick.","Being a huge evil dead fan, i unfortunatly saw this movie first out of the series. When i saw the rest, i compared it to the other two movies. Sure the first two have more gore and excitement, but Sam raimi had a larger budet then the previous movies. about a 100 million more. This gave him the chance to create a larger scale evil dead movie. I agree you dont need lots of money to make a good movie, but the over all effect of the movie is so much funner to watch. Who doesnt like a little three stooges slapstick in a horror everynow and then..? lol But anyways as for the last guy who commented on the two towers and comparing it to army of darkness....

Ash Vs. The Medieval Dead!!!,"I didn't like this one as well as the first two films, but it's still good in its own right. The 3rd film in the Evil Dead series takes a new direction and sends Ash back in time to the Middle Ages. It's not as gory, and takes a ""Jason and the Argonauts"" route.After the Necronomicon sends him back in time, Ash is caught by Lord Arthur's army and imprisoned. He fights his way out using his chainsaw hand and shotgun (boom stick) When he publicly kills a Deadite, he's celebrated as a hero and hooks up with Sheila (Miss Honey from 'Matilda') The only way for Ash to return to his time is find the Necronomicon and repeat the words ""Klaatu barada nikto"" before safely removing it from its temple, but of course, Ash screw it up and causes an army of deadites and skeletons to rise. Ash must lead his own army of men to defeat the Deadites if he wants to get back to his own time.

"""Well, hello, Mister Fancy-Pants. I got news for you, pal; you ain't leading but two things right now, Jack and sh*t, and Jack just left town.""","The film follows Ash, who gets transported to 1300 A. D. due to the incantation of the book in the previous film. It was really fun to see Ash being more ""civilized"" in the medieval era. I did think it was a mistake that the film had a tone that felt really light-hearted, especially in comparison to the previous entries. The film was still very fun as it used the idea of Ash being more advanced, being able to use the tools and the knowledge he had for battling the army of darkness. The scene similar to Gulliver's Travels was also good. Some of the scenes were too absurd though, making Ash look more invincible.Following the second film's portrayal of Ash, he is now even cooler here in this film with his bravery, action, and his great one-liners. I did think his relationship with Sheila was very unexplored and could have benefitted from more scenes.The visual effects are top-notch as always. The practical effects, make-up, and costumes are just really fun to see and never seem to get old.Departing from the tone of the first two films, Army of Darkness is a fun and creative take on the Evil Dead series. While its plot and character actions have great absurdity, Ash and the visual effects are once again very much worth watching. Hail to the king, baby.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Insane movie,"After 2 parts of Evil Dead I was sure this would be super good and a horror type movie. Going to the cinema, I thought this was a horror movie. Until everyone in the cinema started throwing popcorn all over the room, screaming and laughing whenever Ash did something dumb (every second). This is the type of movie to watch high with friends. Not gonna lie, I cried while watching this. My stomach hurt so bad from laughing. Crazy movie because I didn't think something like this would be let to go to the cinemas. But then I learned what the producents said. Just make a 3rd movie I don't care have as much money as you want just please make it. Guess what? They spend 90% of the money on drugs on the plan. Everyone was high while the making of this. There wasn't even a scenario. A crew member comes up with an idea - let's make it. I loved this.

"Hail to the king, baby!","After being transported to the middle ages at the end of Evil Dead 2, Ash finds himself caught between rival kingdoms as they go to war. But there is a new threat - deadites threaten both sides, as well as all of humanity. Cast out as an abomination or spy, Ash soon proves himself by single-handedly killing a deadite after being left for dead. He is then sent on a mission to recover the Necronomicon, as it is the only way to vanquish the evil and for Ash to return home.The original Evil Dead was a pretty serious horror affair with some completely ridiculous gore, and the second film pumped the gore up to overload but balanced the shocks out with comedy. This third entry dials back the gore to focus its efforts purely on the comedy and action, and I have to say it is extremely enjoyable. Ash is an amazing anti-hero, with great lines and questionable morals, and some of the set pieces and action scenes are awesome. The deadites look great, and you can tell this film had a much bigger budget and the creators had more experience as everything is grander and more fleshed out.The thing is though, you kinda get this feeling that this film is sacrificing part of its identity for the sake of broader appeal. Despite avoiding many plot cliches that you'd come to expect from a film like this (especially if you watch the director's cut with the originally intended ending), it just feels a bit too silly, a bit too comical.... and the ridiculous over the top gore just isn't there to teeter the film into intentional satire.If you are in the mood for an early 90's action movie that doesn't take itself seriously whatsoever, has some great effects and awesome one-liners... then Army of Darkness delivers in spades. However, in my opinion at least in terms of striking that perfect balance of action, comedy and horror - the second film has it beat...",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Tolkien trilogy about Rings has also been filmed by Jackson who debuted with some Brain horror. Anyway....Bruce Campbell is a gem. My favorite comedy actor ever - sardonic and rough and funny.

And he fights the army of the dead lead by.... his dark alter ego. Lots of funny moments coming from Evil Dead. Many easter eggs for hard cinema fans. But mainly lots of fun and blood.

A Schlock Masterpiece,"Watching Army of Darkness is basically a requirement for all geeks everywhere, on the same level as being able to quote Monty Python by my estimation. It's a film that is entirely enjoyable on the surface level as a low budget, easy to quote, fun film that's quick and painless. But from the filmmakers perspective, it's a lovable piece that wears its cheapness on its chest. That's a wire, there's a green screen, that's a voice over on a plaster skeleton standing in place. It's so endearing.The cheapness isn't what makes this movie fun for me, it's how much fun the actors are having. Bruce Campbell is a joy to watch, spouting one liners and having plaster skeletons thrown at him from off-camera. The extras waving their swords haphazardly are having a blast, the director is, the stars are, and it translates to a big dumb smile on you, the viewers, face.I don't have to explain this movie to you. Most likely, you've already seen it. If you haven't, you're missing one of the best B-movies of all time, a spoof of the sword and sorcery genre disguised as a silly horror movie disguised as an homage to the Three Stooges.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Only a little disappointing,"You've gotta hand it to Sam, he certainly knows how to make us laugh.Ditching much of the horror and goriness of the previous two films for sheer childish hilarity, he takes us on a rollercoaster ride of a movie that only fails in a couple of places.I like the idea of having an antihero rather than the usual Mr.  Goody Goody.  Poor old Ash has been stuck in a cabin with a bunch of murderous deadites for two nights and has now been catapulted back in time to the year 1300ad.  To put it bluntly, he's having a bad week.  So it's understandable that he's such an a**hole in this film, but the audience stays with him anyway because they realise they're stuck with him for the rest of the film.Now the down points:Although the film has some really funny moments not all the humour works all of the time.  Also the special effects aren't exactly brilliant (although the stop-motion skeletons were really well done).  At the beginning of the film Ash falls out of the sky and lands in the middle of a desert.  You know... that really famous desert that was around in 14th century England.On the whole.

And yet, here is Army of Darkness and it's one of my favourite movies of all time. While the horror is there, painful mutilation and things from the nether regions of hell appear in pretty much every scene, it's the comedy that shines through.  I laughed my ass off, and much of that has to be credited to Bruce Campbells performance as much as the writing and direction. Despite the weird and wonderful situations he finds himself in, our reluctant hero battles on with a handy wisecrack and his chainsaw fist.Highpoints have to be the over-the-top battle scenes against hordes of undead and skeletal warriors, who are obligated by movie history to look and move as if Ray Harryhausen had animated them.  Ash and evil Ash battle it out across medieavel ramparts, wisecracking all the way and kicking record amounts of ass.  Low points for me are some of the out-and-out horror scenes at the mill, but since I'm no fan of horror that's not surprising.

THE Action/Horror/Comedy of the 90's.!,"I think that what make this film, and its two preceding films so amazing is the character Ash. Never has there been such an obscene depth of character. He goes form the depths of cowardice to the heights of heroism. You go from loathing him to loving him. From groaning to gleeful. Aside from Indiana Jones and Ferris Bueller there is no better person to take on any situation than Ash and I think that is why he is so lovable. He has the dumb luck that Jones has and then the smugness of Ferris.Well the movie may have doomed Raimi's career. It is by no means a studio picture and he was forced to cut some 15 minutes and shoot an alternate ending. It's about the closest thing to Big Trouble in Little China we've seen in a while (also you should check out Brainsmasher a Love Story). But he was back with Quick and the Dead (which was a delightful intertwining of two cliche western story lines to produce something quite original). Oscar contender Simple Plan and now For Love of the Game. Is this all a ruse to lure the studios into funding Evil Dead 4?

A Misunderstood Indie/ Cult Hit Phenom that Rocks!,"Army of Darkness plays out like a sick, existential nightmare of a tangled protagonist's web of inner demons, set up against the backdrop of a premise that all to gladly parodies itself in the name of good comedy; but backfires as the premise gets water thin; and the audience is left to wonder if horror movies have embraced laid back nostalgia as a substitute for sheer terror and dauntless tension.  As compared to Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"", this film plays out like a sick and syrupy snow cone that's been allowed to sit out on a late summer afternoon, on a porch, for a little too long.  As a result, it is a nauseaus mess, at times.  I still enjoyed the symbiotic interplay of the characters, and the story and dialogue should keep any enlightened existentialist glued to their chair, and the movie runs at a breakneck pace, and brings back fond memories of fond times past, in a good-natured, devil-may care, David Lynch awe-inspiring way.

Solid horror / comedy.,"Lately I've been craving to find a truly good horror film, and with Evil Dead II, I've finally found it. If you're a comedy fan and even a casual fan of horror, you simply need to watch Evil Dead II. It's such a perfect mix of comedy and horror that you just can't go wrong. I haven't jumped so many times at a horror film in ages, and I've never laughed so hard at the same movie.On the horror side of things, this movie is truly a horror film. I jumped and squirmed so many times I lost count. From start to finish it's filled with gore and disturbing creatures of all sorts. The effects may be cheesy by now, but it really doesn't matter. You'll take a sick pleasure in watching poor Ash scream in borderline insanity. Yet, it thankfully never crosses the line from dark fun all out sick. It's gruesome gore filled fun, but it stays on the right side of the fine line between fun and sick.On the comedy side of things, Bruce Campbell has become a cult action comedy hero from this movie. You'll laugh so hard at his utter breakdowns of emotion you'll wonder what side your rooting as good and bad blur into smear of insanity. The laughing room scene cracked me up and freaked me out all at the same time, and Bruce never misses a beat of the hair trigger fun.Rirath_com",,Anonymous,Horror
Taking more influence from Slapstick than Schlock,"Army of Darkness completes the Evil Dead (Sam Raimi) trilogy - where we find that Ash, the hero, has been transported back to the Dark Ages in England where he accidentally unleashes a huge ""Army of Darkness"". This movie is completely different (in my opinion) than the previous two - there is much more emphasis on slapstick than schlock (see The Evil Dead). More comedic - this film reminds me a lot of the Three Stooges sort of painful slapstick stuff. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is portrayed as a witty action flick movie star (it works!) where he is seen taking on the evil hordes whilst flicking off one-liners a la Arnie style. Even though the movie is only 80 plus minutes long - it tends to drag around two-thirds the way through.  But if you love action adventures (or the other two entries in the Evil Dead Series) you'll probably enjoy Army of Darkness.",,Anonymous,Horror

"Did you see Airplane? It's more over the top, but saner.","Army of Darkness has all the cheesy tag-lines that you expect in an ""Ah-nold"" movie (""Give me some sugar, Baby""), but it's a lot of fun. A great Saturday afternoon movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
"not as good as evil dead II, it must be said","im no film critic, but I can tell when a film is good. A friend lent me evil dead II and it was incredible, matched only by braindead in sheer incredibleness.  I cant think of a single person who doesnt like that film, and the lines that live long after the film has finished(""groovy."", ""look whos laughing now!"" etc.). Evil Dead III was somewhat of a disappointment. I guess I was expecting another EDII, but it was not to be; The gore which supplemented the humour and made it special was taken out and replaced by just plain stupidity, like the stretched face scene.  Some bits show promise, but overall I thought it lacked the special coolness of EDII. Good quotes though ;)",,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely Ridiculous...Brilliant...,"Go and see this movie. Now.I don't think you'll ever find a more entertaining film. The movie is a parody of itself.  It is knows that it is completely ridiculous and their are so many holes in the plot that you just might fall in and end up in the middle ages....oh wait.....This movie is violent, hilarious, and at times pretty scary. It has anything you could ever hope for in a movie.  Aside from maybe Airplane!, this movie has about the best one liners in film history.  The only movies that I can think of that are even remotely as fun as this one are the first two movies in this incredible trilogy: The Evil Dead and The Evil Dead II.  Please, do not judge Sam Raimi's film making abilities on Spiderman.  Watch Army of Darkness. Prepare to laugh. Prepare to jump in terror.  Prepare to be filled with a desire to kick your best friends in the face after watching this movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
Humor replaces gore in 'Darkness',"It seems like yesterday, but I remember seeing ""Army of Darkness"" on the big screen six years ago.  Just as the movie started, I began to laugh my ass off.  Bruce Campbell (TV's Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess) returns as the macho and offbeat hero Ash, not only armed with a ""boom stick"", but one-liners as well.  Unlike the first two ""Evil Dead"" films, this third installment has no gore.  Instead, it references classics such as ""Jason and the Argonauts"", ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", and ""Gulliver's Travels.""  Also, the soundtrack is cool; especially Danny Elfman's ""March of the Dead.""Picking up where ""Evil Dead 2"" left off, Ash gets transported back to 13th century medieval times surrounded by a bunch of ""primitive screwheads."" These primitives must rely on Ash to save them from the ""army of the dead."" To get back to his own time, he must retrieve the ""Necronomicon"" (a.k.a. ""The Book of the Dead"") and must correctly recite the magic words ""klatu, verata, nektu"" or the dead will wake up.  He fails and has to deal with the walking skeletons.  Ash must recruit a bunch of men for the final showdown.My evaluation: *** out of ****.",,Anonymous,Horror
Classic Cult Cinema!!!,"This film is so totally cool that it's off the charts. From the breathtaking overview of EVIL DEAD 1 & 2 to the climax of the story you will have trouble catching your breath. Not only does it harken back to director Sam Raimi's earlier work, it creates new ground with it's scale and passion. I think that this film is perfect in every way, even in the fact that ""mainstream"" audiences didn't get it and Universal's sorry dismissal of the film. What has become one of my all time favorite films, be sure to check out the three different cuts that add all new dimension to the drama.ps look out for the EXTENDED windmill scene in the director's cut and sci-fi channel special edition. THE greatest scene in the trilogy in my opinion.RATING: Groovy.",,Anonymous,Horror
This is Awesome,"I love this film being a huge fan of the Evil Dead films growing up, i got to see this when it first hit UK cinemas and i loved it and still do. Bruce Campbell's character Ash gets better and better as the trilogy went on and he's somebody we all can relate to because he dosen't want to fight the Deadites but he has too, one thing though the original ending is much better than the super market ending, because that fits the trilogy well as in can anything ever go right for this poor guy.

I can't imagine how much better this movie  is on director's cut, and I desperately need to see that version.

Ash is Back.,"""Army of Darkness"" is a fantastic movie that really delivers. I have seen this movie about 20 times and I know it by heart. I liked this one more than ""Evil Dead II"" mainly because it wasn't set in a cabin again instead they did something original and gave Ash a whole new environment which was a very smart move by Sam Raimi. The movie is absolutely hilarious and is filled with lots of ""Evil Dead II""-esque one liner's. I really reccomend this one very highly I have seen both endings to it and I can't wait for the criterion collection DVD I just hope that they make an ""Evil Dead IV"" that will be sweeeeet.",,Anonymous,Horror

very silly,"This was OK, and there were parts that made me laugh, but I still like Evil Dead 1 and 2 better.  This movie just had too many silly scenes that didn't make a whole lot of sense.  And there was no gore and blood like the first 2 movies.  The director should have stuck with the same formula by making a horror comedy like Evil Dead 2.  Instead, this was just a comedy, and the bad guys were really fake looking skeletons that fall over when anything touches them.FINAL VERDICT:  If you just want to see a comedy, then you will enjoy this. But, if you are looking for something like Evil Dead 2, you won't find it here. Instead watch Dead Alive.",,Anonymous,Horror
Ash trounces the Evil Dead once again,"Ash has carved himself a niche (as well as a few witches) as a cult hero, and Army of Darkness is the vehicle that really is what Ash is all about. Whilst Evil Dead was one of the best horror movies ever, and Evil Dead II was one of the best movies ever, Army of Darkness is the best Ash ever, so come and get some.I see no reason to go into the plot of this movie as it really is secondary to the outlandish humour, slapstick and fun, so much so that the fact that there is a plot makes it even more funny. You could get away with a lot when you have Bruce Campbell as your star - his mere presence on the screen makes you laugh sometimes, and his one-liners are priceless.Ash works for S-Mart, in housewares, but as soon as he is called upon to save the world from the deadites again, he can ride horses, is a master of martial arts, is deadly with a shotgun, and can swordfight also - this is what I call pure escapism, and brilliant.Get the lads around with a crate of beer, and watch this movie and I guarantee you will love it - except if you look for reality - of which there is none, and why should there be - it's Ash after all.Army of Darkness - a masterpiece of unadulterated comedy that makes no claims to be anything other than a vehicle for the excellent Bruce Campbell.",,Anonymous,Horror
"An insult to the ""Evil Dead"" movies","I would not describe this as a horrormovie at all, this is pure comedy.

I now regret having seen it, it destroyed every feeling I had for the other ""Evil Dead"" movies.Campbell still acts good, but I guess he can't do anything about the script he got in his hands.

It wasn't until a few years latter that I went through a horror film renting faze with another friend of mine that I bothered to rent Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.  Never before or since have I cheered a laughed more at a movie than I did will watching Army of Darkness.  Bruce Campbell and the Rami Bros create a story forces you to stand up and cheer.  Every movie I have a rented since has been as a pale attempt to recapture the sheer amazing experience that was my first viewing of this magnificent film.  Bruce Campbell's Ash delivers more superhumanly cool action lines in this one film then Arnold, Sly and Bruce have ever done in all there films put together.  So many films (and video-games) have tried to replicate a character as awesome as Ash and all have never stacked up to the original swashbuckling, chainsaw handed, Deadite crushing, ultra rapid shot gun reloading, hot babe kissing, gauntlet fisted, sword swinging, spear slinging, time travelling, no nonsense super hero that vanquished the Army of Darkness.

"Very Cool, I want some sugar baby!","This film is really more of a straight out comedy then the other two Evil Dead films, and it is the better for it.The Director has managed to bring the trilogy round from horror to comedy very well, and this film contains some classic moments and quotes of outright weridness (My personal fave remains the ""this...is...my...boomstick!!"") Fans of the first two should enjoy this, and Bruce is very good in it, playing everything just right.And now to the ending.  I live in England so I have seen the international ending which is quite downbeat, and fits into the film nicely.  However, the video release of the film contains the other shop ending at the end, which I have not seen.  I have to say, I believe the more downbeat ending would be a fitting climax to Ash, considering the early events of last two films, but you shall have to see for yourself.Watch it, but like Evil Dead two, a few drinks wouldn't hurt.",,Anonymous,Horror
Combining heaping doses of comedy with horror.,"Combining heaping doses of comedy with its horror, 'Army of Darkness' is funny and fast.

Different,"Not better or worse than Evil Dead II, just different.  Just as stupid, but just as loveable and hilarious.  Like its predecessor, this is not a film for people who can't appreciate sick, twisted, humor.  Like I said in my Evil Dead II review, if you're one of those people don't even bother with this film.  The rest of us with a sense of humor will sit back and spout ""Groovy"" from time to time.Everything that made Evil Dead one of the few great horror/comedies returns in Army of Darkness, only now the setting has changed, and the plot has been revamped.  Bruce Campbell reprises his role in a way only Bruce Campbell can; if you hated his lines in Evil Dead II, don't bother with Army of Darkness.  He's one upped the cheesiness and hasn't gotten any brighter, and no that's not a complaint.Sam Raimi returns to direct this third installment, again bringing his unique 3 Stooges-ish humor to his little horror/mideival world.  Ted Raimi makes about a half dozen appearances, oh yeah, and Sam's car is back for more abuse.Army of Darkness throws back the restraints of its predecessors, and just goes all out to be the biggest laugh it can be.  I think it succeeds.  Kudos to anyone who can identify Danny Elfman's musical contribution (not that it's hard to identify Elfman's style).  Improved special effects, though dated now, they're fine for this film.All of my opinions on Evil Dead II stand and apply here, so you can read there if you want a little more information on why I like this film.  But basically, in a nutshell, Army of Darkness is extremely corny, but it knows exactly what it's doing, and it doesn't try to be anything more than it is: It's a fun ride with a dark atmosphere.  As stupid as most of the elements are, Army of Darkness is a fun move; therefor, who cares?  Sit back and have fun with it . . .",,Anonymous,Horror
An absolute blast for action/comedy/fantasy fans.,"*** out of **** (theatrical release)** 1/2 (director's cut)Proving you can't keep a good deadite slayer down, Army of Darkness marks the return of Ash in the third film of the highly popular Evil Dead trilogy. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is no longer confined to the isolated cabin in the woods, now that he's been transported to the 14th century (don't ask), apparently somewhere in England.  He's seen as an enemy by the local Lord Arthur, but quickly becomes hero and savior to the people when he kills a couple of deadites.  Consequently, and in order to return to his time, he's sent on a quest to retrieve the Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead.  What should be a simple task results in the creation of the army of darkness, which Ash must battle to keep evil from spreading throughout the land.Army of Darkness' plot is pure nonsense, sort of a mix of Monty Python and just about every fantasy movie you may have seen.  The entire movie's success is based on humor, and it delivers with consistent comic ingenuity. All traces of horror its predecessors had is all but gone here, those expecting to experience terror with their mirth will be sorely disappointed. Army of Darkness is a silly comedy from beginning to end, and it revels in its silliness.Easily the movie's anchor and probably the only reason I couldn't stop giggling for all 81 minutes is cult fave and comic genius Bruce Campbell. Roles of this kind are perfectly suited for him, and he doesn't disappoint. Whether it's his sharp one-liners, priceless facial reactions, or general good-nature about making a complete fool of himself, Campbell is hilarious as Ash.  This is undoubtedly my favorite performance of his, period.Director Sam Raimi shows off his usual kinetic style, delivering plenty of zooms and swirling camera movements.  Most of the action sequences (and there are a LOT of them) are played equally for laughs and thrills, but probably succeed at the former slightly more successfully than the latter. The only movie I can think of that managed to keep its action completely thrilling while consistently mingled with silly physical humor is Stephen Sommers' The Mummy (which obviously gained inspiration from this movie).As much as I enjoyed Army of Darkness, it's not as if though the movie couldn't have been improved.  Some jokes fall flat and the concept of Ash fighting his evil twin hardly lives up to its full potential. While the intentionally cheesy and fun special effects and make-up effects are perfectly suited for the film, I would have preferred more sets.  Most of the movie is based around one castle (albeit a very large one), without even a small village surrounding it; kind of gives off that low-budget vibe (though it's easily the most expensive of the Evil Dead series).The director's cut attaches another fifteen minutes to the movie, most of which neither hampers the movie nor enhances its enjoyment.  In fact, I would have welcomed this 96-minute cut if not for the alternate ending, which may be more in tone with the trilogy, but doesn't measure up to the hilarious S-Mart finale of the theatrical cut.  As far as comparison with its predecessors, it's different enough in tone to not warrant any comparisons, but what the hell, I'll give one, anyway.  Army of Darkness is more consistently enjoyable than Evil Dead 2 (which wasn't scary and only sporadically funny), but not up to par with the original The Evil Dead (which remains one of the most frightening films I've ever seen).",,Anonymous,Horror

Not enough laughs but plenty of action,"This film usually describes itself as more of a comedy than anything else but the humor is practically nonexistent when opposed to the incredible action scenes and great special effects.

This time out, an evil magical book transports Ash back to medieval times where he must do battle with several Dark Knight foes before he can return back to his own time. As usual with these kinds of films, there's enough gore to keep fans of that genre interested.",,Anonymous,Horror
Fun and frolics in fantasyland,"Poor old Bruce Campbell.  He just can't catch a break.  Once again, he's everybody's favourite punchbag, but at least he gets to deliver some cracking dumb-but-funny macho misogynist lines.The film starts slowly and patchily, and it's no longer even pretending to be horror, or a gore fest - it's a slapstick comedy ""Cult of Ash"" vehicle, pure and simple.  That's not necessarily a criticism, and things picks up when the titular Army of Darkness appears - a dodgily animated but genuinely charismatic skeleton horde that are actually better actors than the generic mediaeval live action rabble!The plot is painfully thin, and the whole film is basically a series of vignettes leading to excuses for a one liner or a quote (or, bizarelly, a *misquote* of Henry V).  Really, the only thing worth watching is Bruce Campbell as the various incarnations of Ash, but he is *very* watchable. Indeed, when Raimi and Robert Tapert went on to develop this ""psuedo historical slapstick action"" concept into the Herculese and Xena shows, it's amazing that Bruce was only given an occasional guest role.All that said, Army of Darkness isn't something I could watch a lot. There's only really half a good film in there, plus some rather lame padding.  The thought occurs that it could probably be edited right down to a quality 1 hour TV special and not lose anything significant.",,Anonymous,Horror
"fun, yet kind of lame","This movie kept me watching and wanting to see more, but it never really gave me what I was looking for. What I mean is, it was entertaining, but not great at all. I guess I wanted to see another Evil Dead 2 and this was certainly not it. The humor, which in that film was campy, was corny in this one. The monsters weren't realistic looking in evil dead 2, but they were kind of believable in the sense that you didn't look at them and know exactly what went on to create them. Here, they are too elementary. The bad guy leader is dumb looking and the skeletons would have been so much cooler if they didn't talk. As far as visual creativity, this movie really doesn't have it. The skeletons were done exactly the same decades earlier in Jason and the Aragnaughts. Alas, it was not a bad movie. It kept me watching, hoping that some creatures would be cool and I guess occasionally they were. It's fun, but clearly stupid fun. So if you're in that kind of mood, no thinking, just watching and laughing, then go for it. But don't say I didn't warn you. Fun but definately not funny.",,Anonymous,Horror
Didn`t Peter Jackson Remake This ?,"Hmmm , a strange film as sequels go since EVIL DEAD 2 was more or less identical to its predecessor while this second sequel is an entire universe away from the original with only the comic book black humour giving a hint that it`s from the same franchise . Unfortunately because it`s set in a pseudo dark ages period it`s impossible not to be reminded of a certain film that was released last Christmas , you know the one where a group of humans are beseiged by dark forces . I said unfortunately because ARMY OF DARKNESS can`t help draw attention to itself for having a pathetically small budget , , the castle is obviously a matte painting in the long shots , many of the exteriors are obviously studio bound while many of the locations seem to have been shot in the Arizona desert . It`s also difficult not to notice how bad the cast are , Bruce Campbell is absolutely painful to watch while the rest of the cast fail to rise above substandard . It`s saying something about a film when the best performances are by skeletons , they really do give a meaty performance ( HA HA HA !)So I wasn`t too taken with ARMY OF DARKNESS , the fact that I`d seen THE TWO TOWERS a few months previously didn`t help , but it`s really good seeing director Sam Raimi improving beyond all recognition since ARMY OF DARKNESS was made in 1993 and have no doubt he`ll be remembered alongside Peter Jackson as one of the 21st Century`s great film directors",,Anonymous,Horror
"Lighter, Goofier & Weaker Than Its Predecessors","The third & final entry in Sam Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy, Army of Darkness is a lot lighter & goofier in tone when compared to its predecessors and begins where the previous entry signed off. With the setting changed from deadly cabin to medieval times, the story never manages to create the suspense & ominous aura that often pervaded the earlier chapters despite the comedy elements at play and instead dives headfirst into camp with heavy dilution of horror & scares. Surprisingly, the ride does become somewhat enjoyable as one settles into the premise, and the final battle is packed with some impressive choreography & special effects. A tad too different in its treatment & approach, the film is missing the franchise's manic energy and is rather overdosing on silliness to the point of nuisance.",,Anonymous,Horror
Lots of Skeletons in the Closet.,"Bruce Campbell is transported through a time warp to 1300 after his encounter with the dark forces from ""Evil Dead 2"". Now he must help the natives (who are even dumber than our hero) fight the titled force and keep the peace in a time and place that history obviously forgot. Really only a sequel to its two predecessors because of Campbell's goofy character, ""Army of Darkness"" is yet another bargain basement level production with hopelessly awful special effects and a two-bit story-line. Director Sam Raimi once again shows just how much he has grown as a film-maker with this early career waste. Recent talks about a resurrection of this series have occurred.

I'd like to add one thing...,"Yes, this movie is campy, escapist fun, like everyone says itis, and I like the way Bruce Campbell alternates between tough guy and fall guy.

When Ash meets his evil twin, and he calls Ash a goody-two-shoes, Ash blows him away and says ( I think you all know this one by now) ""good, bad, I'm the guy with thegun"".  This is heady stuff.  Perhaps Raimi was just poking fun at the ""hero by default"" concept, but it made me wonder, does might really make right?  How much control do we have over ourselves, anyway?

"The film that has what HARRY POTTER so desperately needed, a central character to blow everyone else out of the water!","Perhaps my personal all-time most cherished flick, ARMY OF DARKNESS is easily the most ENTERTAINING film ever made. Following on seamlessly from the first two tales in the trilogy, its way bigger budget shows. EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN was a classic in its own right (will anyone, and I mean ANYONE ever top the plate-smashing sequence?) but this is another level up again!Unless you are dead, one-dimensional, humorless  or just straight-out contrary, you could not fail to be dragged along here for a riotous and action-orientated laugh-fest.After Ash and his beat-up Chev are sucked into the vortex in 2, they are spewed out in medieval times...none too gently either! It is the very mix of impossibly conflicting worlds that sets this film up for so much good-natured (and scripted) idiocy. A send up of every schlocky horror made, including itself, Ash battles the armies of the evil dead after he fails to retrieve the Necronomican without uttering syllable for syllable the immortal words ""Klaatu Barada Nicto."" Playing multiple roles here (check it out, if you didn't know already), Ash is the bravest knight of them all, wielding one-liners as dextrously as his broadsword and chainsaw.This is fun with a capital ""H."" Amazing fx and Danny Elfman's stirring score is as good as anything he has ever done. It is NOT a film to analyse and critically disassemble, it is one to ride and kick-ass with! Perhaps the absolute highlight of the flick is the very last scene in the supermarket - ""Gimme some sugar baby."" No film to my knowledge has come up with any more inspired an ending.Bruce Campbell is so perfectly cast as Ash...he can never escape the role - nor would any of us ever want him too. For all that Brando, De Niro, Pacino, Davis (Bette), etc, have achieved, Campbell has topped them all as far as screen ""immortality"" is concerned. Who will ever forget,  ""Well maybe not EVERY little syllable!""Much as I would like to see Sean Connery do one more Bond, I would prefer to see EVIL DEAD 4!",,Anonymous,Horror
this was so dumb,I loved the first one. The second one I liked. This was dumb. I hated how these movies turned into comedies. Like the first one was so scary. But this one was just dumb. But even though I dont like this one I have to admit that there were some funny stuff in this movie. Over all even if I dont like this movie I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good comedy horror movie.,,Anonymous,Horror
I'm looking for a specific t-shirt. Please help!,"Hey guys. I have been looking for a specific Army of Darkness t-shirt. It's black then in red it has the witch from the movie and the quote ""yo she bitch let's go"". I have found shirts with that phrase on it on other websites but the picture is different. I'm only looking for the one with the witch and text in all red and shirt black.It was my friend's favorite shirt and it got ruined. I can't find it anywhere and his birthday is coming up so I'd really like to find it. If anyone knows what I'm talking about and knows where I can get one pleeeaase email me (AMStrid@aol.com).I'd really appreciate it. It'll be your good deed of the day!",,Anonymous,Horror
What a waste!!,"I feel I have to write down my views on this film because the majority of the opinions shown here are favorable. I have to say I thought it was a complete waste of an opportunity to complete what might have been a classic cult trilogy.Instead Rami cuts down on the laughs and gore, raises the budget and adds to much story line! In short moving completely away from the formulas which made Evil Dead and Dean By Dawn such entertaining movies.Sure it was funny in places but was I the only one sat there thinking - WHY!!!! WHY!!! NO!!!!!I'll give it 4 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Horror
"This is not a movie, it is a store house for one liners.","The only person capable of pulling off Ash's character is Bruce Campell. His oneliners may be tired and used for us, but put them in the context of medieval England, and they are more than fresh. If you have seen Evil Dead 2, you can understand where Ash gets those steel cahoneys. All in all, a great film to see with a beer.",,Anonymous,Horror
What a Dark Army!!,"Army of Darkness was the final installment of the Evil Dead Trilogy. It was funny, and it still has Bruce Campbell as Ash in it.What I Did not get though was why change the genre of the trilogy as it goes along?. Still it was a good film all in all, but the 2nd movie was and still is my favorite!!I give it a 6 out of 10",,Anonymous,Horror
Sam Raimi's Masterpiece! ***** out of 5,"Well, let me go ahead and tell ya.... everyone has a favorite and this happens to be my personal favorite 'Evil Dead' entry.It's always been a big battle between II and this one, but in the end I think this one wins out.I doubt there's a single movie out there with more memorable lines than this one. You have the severed arms, an army of marching skeletons, sword and scorcery, and bare trees amongst tombstones in a dank creepy graveyard. It just draws me in. And the fact that there's a bumbling, smart aleck, wise cracking, chainsaw wielding, hero in the middle of all this makes it all the better.This was the first film I ever saw in the series. This introduced me to the character 'Ash'. This is a good reason why I'm a horror fan.Now I realize that there isn't quite as much gore and guts in this entry, but it really doesn't matter. It works very well without too much gore. However, it isn't entirely bloodless. It does feature a huge fountain of the stuff shooting out from a well.You still get lots of demon possession but it's all set against a splendid swashbuckling adventure story.There really isn't a word I can use that would express my feelings and love for this film. In short the only word I can sum this film up in is...'Groovy'.",,Anonymous,Horror
It'll Swallow Your Soul,"I loathe mindless entertainment junkies because they are more concerned about letting their collective brain cells deteriorate rather than do some critical analysis.Why is Sam Raimi great?  Because he invests everything into the camera and its movement and nothing else.  Perhaps effects are the only thing that come after the cinematography.  That said, Army of Darkness concludes his ""Evil"" frame of mind.Whereas ED2 parodies the horror cliches of the 70s and 80s and insults the pop genre surrounding them, ""Army"" tries to create its own pop influence. Needless to say, it's all too obvious in our culture now.  It is more coherent and slicker than its predecessor, but there's something wrong.  ED2 felt experimental and out-of-control, where anything possible could (and often did) happen.  Here it feels too formulaic, too mainstream.  As with the predecessor, we see more of the same with an even bigger emphasis on comedy.I consider this Raimi's third best movie.  It is better than ED1, Darkman, Spider-Man, and the Gift, but still has some lacking qualities in the bizarre department compared to ED2 and the Quick and the Dead.  When it comes down to a challenge between Raimi and Tim Burton, though, I'll stay with Raimi.Overall, despite being destructive to the social thought world, Army of Darkness is more referencing and appealing to the adolescents.  2.5 out of 5.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good fun, but not enough horror!","I agree that this film is good entertaining fun, but i would have preferred the film to have been an 18 certificate, and shown some more gory bits like if the first evil dead, but it is still very enjoyable! 7/10",,Anonymous,Horror
