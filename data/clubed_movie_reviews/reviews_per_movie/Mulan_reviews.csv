"Disney comes through with yet another animated masterpiece, and this one goes by the name Mulan.","Mulan is a young girl in ancient China. When the Huns start attacking the country, the Emperor orders one member of every family to join the Chinese Army and defend the country. The one member must be a man, but in Mulan's family, the only male is her injured father. Not wanting to allow her father to die, Mulan dresses like a man, and escapes into the night to join the war. To protect her, the ancient elders of her family ask the great Stone Dragon to watch over her. Unfortunately, the great Stone Dragon is destroyed by the little tiny dragon Mushu (Eddie Murphy). So with Mushu and a small cricket by her side, Mulan heads off to help destroy the Huns.I think we can all guess what happens. Mulan, although a woman, manages to save the day. The plot line isn't really a surprise when you break it down. And the animation is, by now, expected to be great, and Mulan certainly lives up to the great Disney tradition. It's the story and the feeling you get that makes this movie so wonderful. Disney went through a lot to make sure it's depiction of ancient China was accurate. From the decorations on the walls, to the matchmakers, to the great honor in family, Disney manages to show what the country of China was like, and in many ways, still is today. Following the Disney tradition, there is a strong female character, this time taking lead. There are the over the top bad guys, and of course, the comic relief. Eddie Murphy was just down right hilarious in this movie. I wish they had showed more of him. The songs were sort of a change of pace, with Matthew Wilder and Jerry Goldsmith doing the honors, and not the venerable Alan Menken. The music was good, but the lyrics in some of the songs were weak.The reason I feel Mulan was better than recent Disney fare like Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame is because it had a much more lively feel to it. Hercules was very dark, animation-wise. Everything was centered on the color blue, so it didn't feel alive. And The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a more adult story, and some of the scenes were very dark and broody. Mulan took a simple plot, put it in ancient China, and made it very colorful and fun to watch. It was light, and ""Disney"" enough for kids to enjoy, while still being adult enough for the parents to enjoy.Overall, I'd say Mulan is definitely one to watch. Disney animation has done it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Thank you Disney, for making mulan so great!","Mulan is a well-known ancient folktale in Chinese history. It tells the story of mulan, who disguises herself as a man and goes to the war to protect the country in place of her aged father, and finally returns as a national hero/heroine. Although the story of mulan was evidently modified from its original, Disney did a fantastic job at retelling the story, and delivered it through the beautiful hand-drawn animation that has been lost to us for many years. As a Chinese myself, I know the mulan story like millions of Chinese people do. Some people (espcially Chinese people) may not like the Disney version of mulan simply because Disney didn't stay true to the original, but i feel somewhat differently about this. Not only did i have no problem with Disney's decision to make modifications to mulan's story, I actually kinda appreciate that they did. Cuz Disney's retelling of mulan turned out to be rather amazing, and even better than the original in my opinion. I mean, the original story is great, but it lacks fun and humor, which you can find in Disney's mulan. In the Disney version, Mulan is an outgoing, smart, and independent young woman who has difficulty fitting in the more traditional and reserved ancient Chinese society, where a woman's value is judged by marrying into a good family and being a good wife. So naturally this creates conflict and inner struggle for mulan, and thus brings out the musical number ""reflection"" that expresses mulan frustrations and desires. This song is so beautifully written and the lyrics have such meaningful morals and depth that it touches me every time i hear it, and I'm a guy! This song can certainly relate to a great many of young people, not only girls but also boys, cuz its central theme is all the same, that is to be your true self regardless the environment that you in. And now back to the movie, there's a lot to love about Disney's mulan: the story, the fun characters, the songs and music, the beautiful animation, etc. The story is smoothly-paced and very believable. You have no problem understanding why things happen the way they do and why mulan has taken certain actions. And I think Disney created the characters very successfully because they made them look like real Chinese people instead of the classic Disney characters that we used to see. And they made the backgrounds in the animation look like beautiful Chinese landscape paintings, which really amazed me! And the opening of the movie is probably one of the most brilliant among the Disney animation features. I was completely blown away when i first saw it in the theater. Although Disney didn't completely stay true to the original mulan, it stayed true to the spirit of the original story and the spirit of china in most part! And as Mulan being a Chinese story, i think Disney did its best to make it look like and feel like Chinese, and i really appreciate their effort. So thank you Disney, for making mulan so great!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why Mulan sticks out as a great Disney film.,"I was impressed by this Disney film for so many reasons, too many to list here, but I will go on the record as saying that Mulan has got to be one of the best Disney female characters that ever saw production, in the midst of a colorful and artistic film, that will resonate in your memory.Mulan sticks out in my mind for this reason. For once, we have a strong female lead, or at the least, stronger than most of them. She isn't counted among the Disney ""princesses"" line-up. She doesn't want for herself, and she seeks to look deeper within herself to discover her inner being. She isn't like Ariel, who wants to be someone else. She isn't like Jasmine, who sits in luxury, waiting to be swept off her feet by Prince Charming, just like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and almost any female character that Disney brings to life. And while she does share some traits among this list, she stands out because she does something that these do not. She uses her mind.Mulan, in fact, has more in common with male Disney leads than the female Disney leads. Mulan is a thinker, and a do-er. She's resourceful, like Aladdin. She is quick to act, like Eric (mermaid.) And she sacrifices herself for the sake of others, like Hercules. She also speaks her mind, even in a culture that does not allow such a thing. She doesn't waste time pining about ""will I ever find true love?"" Indeed, we see that she has an attraction to Shang (as he was her husband in the legends,) but we see her uncomfortable and unsure of meeting the Match-maker. She begs for her father's life when Chi-Fu came to the village. When you see her make her decision to take her father's place in the army, she does so out of her love for him, valuing his life above hers. She doesn't wish to become a man to see what it is like or for a change. Only to save his life. She later doubts herself and her reasons for going, but she did so because of her inner strengths, something other female Disney leads too often lack. (And it is these strengths that Shang is attracted to at the end.)This movie also has a simple, but very effective villain, Shan Yu. Though not as memorable as Jafar or Ursula, he is more effective and more menacing because he is not fantastic. By that, I mean that he is not magical, he holds no special power. He is portrayed as a man, and as a man that could have truly existed, performing vicious acts that men do. We see the destruction that his army lays to a village, and when Mulan finds the doll, it shows that Shan Yu left no one living, man, woman or child. This is what makes him so effective as a villain, showing how truly human he indeed is. Granted, the producers did not develop him in any great depth, but they showed enough of him to remind us of his threat to China. Besides, sometimes the better villains are the ones you don't know too much about, or see a lot of.Of the rest of the supporting cast, I will only mention four of them as being memorable in any real way. Chi-Fu, the emperor's consultant, was a reminder of the way many men looked at women in this culture. He thrusts his head up when Mulan begs for her father's life, and when she is discovered to be a woman, though she is a hero, he is quick to insult her, and to order her execution, simply because she impersonated a man. The other three were, of course, her comrades, Ling, Yao, and Chian Po. Though they were mainly comic relief (almost like a 3 stooges set,) they remained loyal to Mulan and trusted her fully, even after she was discovered. I like them, because they were not discriminatory to her in any way, even trying to stop her execution. When Mulan told them she had an idea to help the emperor faster, they were the first to her side, even when Shang was still reluctant to do so.Overall, a wonderful movie to the Disney list. If you haven't seen it, then do so, you won't regret it.And yes, Mushu was a cool character as well.**** In Response to an earlier post by Phoenix-1 **** To expect any movie to accurately portray history in any way is lunacy. Even those movies that come close to historical accuracy are flawed in many ways. This was a way of telling a story, as any movie is. It can be argued that it tries to provoke curiosity in another culture, but it is also meant to entertain. I would also like to point out that Mulan is really not ""historical,"" like Joan of Arc, but rather she is a legend, much like Hercules and Aladdin, who also come from the realm of myth, stories and legends. And while there is some difference between the original legend and this movie, your examples of how Disney would butcher tales of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln do not compare to this story in any way. Your arguments for comparison should be better applied to Pocahontas, as she was an actual historical figure.",,Anonymous,Animation
The growth of the typical Disney heroine,"There are two things I love about this movie, aside from its stunning and beautiful animation.  One is that I love the fact that Disney is exploring legends from other cultures and I am so glad it brought us this one.  The other is that I just wanted to stand up and cheer at this great heroine.  I am a huge fan of Disney movies, but most of the heroines, while spunky, are still just your basic damsel in distress.  I loved Mulan's character.  She was strong, she was powerful, she could do anything she wanted, and she overcame much diversity.  I was thrilled to see the portrayal of a strong female character surviving because of her own integrity and strength rather than because of her looks.  Bravo, Disney, for bringing us this wonderfully progressive Chinese tale.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A True Masterpiece,"Every Disney movie is always advertised as ""a masterpiece"", but Mulan is one of the few that REALLY fit the bill.  The animation itself is simple and flowing, reminiscent of ancient Chinese art.  But the animation for this is really something else.  In fact, this is the best thing since The Lion King.Mulan is a young girl who does her best to bring honor to her family.  Then, when the Hun army invades China, one man from every household must serve in the Imperial Army.  Since Mulan has no older brothers, her crippled father must serve.  And it's obvious, early on in the movie, that it's impossible for him to fight with a crippled leg.  There's a great likelihood that this man is going to die in battle.So, out of the sheer love for her father, Mulan disguises herself in his armor and takes his place in the army.This movie isn't about some gal going off to war to prove herself, or break free from the caste system, like so many other Disney heroines.  And it isn't about ""finding your prince and living happily ever after"".  Mulan goes for the simple love of her father and because of the her dedication to her family.  She risks losing everything to SAVE everything.Mulan is a wonderful movie because the main character is realistic.  She's not perfect, she has her faults, and we all identify with her because we all try out best to please our fathers.  This is one of the few movies I watched with my dad that he really liked, and he isn't that fond of animated stuff. It's a great film.And that's what makes a true masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Movie for little girls,"I have a 4.5 year old daughter who is going through the princess phase. We read lots of fairy tales etc and its very difficult to find a fairy tale where the princess is strong and resourceful. Most of the time they are pretty passive and the worst one is sleeping beauty. I find myself treading a fine line between letting her enjoy the fairy tale and occasionally commenting on the fact that perhaps some of these princesses just don't do enough to help themselves and how they can help themselves a little bit more. I don't want to destroy her pleasure in these fairy tales, after all, I loved them too. But it took me a while as adult to see how the subconscious message of helplessness in these fairy tales can reinforce the existing values of society and parents that girls are meant to be saved.So it is a great pleasure to be able to show my daughter a story of a strong and intelligent girl - Mu Lan and its great that Mu Lan and we are both ethnically Chinese. Here is a heroine who is resourceful, uses her brains, saves the Captain and China. We draw many discussion points from the story, such as why it is that women were not allowed to join the army, the value of trying hard and training and practising hard, what is discipline and why it is needed to succeed, using your brains and thinking of how to solve a problem, not just using brute strength, etc. Even some politics - like why did the Hun king want the Emperor to bow to him and why the Emperor wouldn't bow to him but would bow to Mulan. My challenge is the explain things in a way which is both accurate and yet understandable to a 4 year old. My daughter loves the story because Mulan does a lot of ""saving"".My daughter has probably watch the movie only 3 times coz I limit TV and video a lot. But she'll ask me to tell her the story in my own words, based on the video. It works out great.The fact that the movie Mulan captivates me as an adult also helps. There's only so much I can enjoy of a barney video.I definitely recommend this movie to parents with young girls, as a good place to start talking about being a strong and intelligent woman. Another good one is Beauty and the Beast. I've not seen Pocahontas so I can't comment on that.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another great Disney,"I can't think of a single animated feature film done by Disney that I don't like. For some reason they never bore me and they never feel the same. The classics like 'Snow White' and 'Cinderella' are great but I think I like the newer ones ('The Little Mermaid', 'Beauty and the Beast', 'The Lion King') even more. 'Mulan' definitely belongs to the best ones.Mulan is a girl who doesn't do much right. For the honor of her family she joins the army instead of her father. She takes his gear and runs off. She pretends to be a man and does the training to go to war against the Huns who invaded China.With some nice new songs, great music by Jerry Goldsmith and beautiful animations this is a real Disney. A little dragon called Mushu is helping her on the way. He is send by the ancestors. The voice of Mushu is from Eddie Murphy and he does a very great job. With a quick and good story and a lot of funny moments this is a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Solid story, but needs to lose some of the kids stuff","Mulan is an entertaining tale of a young girl who takes her father's place in the Chinese army. I think what I appreciate most about this film is that they don't spend a massive amount of time on her possibly being discovered. There's one scene that creates that kind of tension, but otherwise she remains hidden until the movie is ready for her to be revealed. The rest of the time she's just treated like any other soldier who is trying their best to become an effective warrior in the battle against the Huns. I like the training sequences, I find the other soldiers that she meets to be charming, and I'm always a sucker for those scenes when the instructor presents a seemingly impossible task and our protagonist figures out how to make it happen. The film manages to condense the war down to a single moment, but I thought it was a surprisingly effective way of making our heroine a savior on such a grand scale that it allows people to ignore centuries of tradition that minimize the role of women.Where I think Mulan suffers to some degree is that the creators felt beholden to the Disney animated tropes. The small cricket and dragon are not important to the plot and mostly provide slapstick comedy breaks. I'm all for Eddie Murphy being silly in an animated film, but the tone of Mulan feels less suited to his antics. In fact, I suspect the live action remake of this film will be one of the best because they will probably excise Mushu and Cri-kee from the script. The musical numbers are good songs, but they also feel a bit unnecessary in this story. I wouldn't say they bothered me, because the tunes are catchy, but I didn't think they needed to be there. My only other complaint about Mulan would be that the entire film feels a bit rushed. This might also be based on the fact that they were trying to meet some Disney animated movie standards, and keep it under 90 minutes for the young kids. I just felt they could have used a little more time to let some aspects of the story breathe and develop some of the characters a bit more. However, Mulan works quite well as a film, and it also looks great. This is definitely one of Walt Disney Animation Studios' successes.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
She's an Oriental Yentl,"Good-looking but lumpish and derivative Disney animated musical based on Chinese folklore. Young girl, a failure in Concubine School, decides to join the Chinese Emperor's Army disguised as a boy to save her family's name. The dozen-plus ""drag"" jokes and vocal hamming from Eddie Murphy (as a tiny dragon) may make older kids giggle, but this is far from the studio's best work. The bathing sequence is a hoot, there are moments of beauty and wonder, but Mulan simply isn't a very intriguing character. The songs from Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel are not memorable and the picture seems exceptionally long at 88 minutes. ** out of ****",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Excellent, if a little different","Now I must admit I wasn't sure about this one. MULAN seemed to break most of my preconceived rules on Disney movies. These included the fairytale element - a cross-dressing Chinese soldier doesn't have the same magical appeal as, say, the son of the Greek gods searching for his birthright, etc etc. Also, this verge towards realism meant that the bad guy would not be as appealing - Disney villains are camp, over-the-top thespians by rule - Jeremy Irons in THE LION KING for example. I was concerned about the absence of king-of-melody composer Alan Menken, whose wonderful songs encapsulate the charm of Disney.However, that said, I thought this film was wonderful. The characters were well thought out and expertly drawn. Not enough songs were present for my liking, but those that were fit perfectly with the story, and the chance to hear the wonderful voice of Lea Salonga (Mulan's songs) is worth the price of this film alone. Eddie Murphy has managed to be as good, if not better, than Robin Williams as the comic sidekick. And the film's conclusion is as genuine and as heartfelt as any adaptation of this story. The mountain scene contains some of the best animation I have seen from Disney, and the rousing score from maestro Jerry Goldsmith accompanies the action superbly.This may not turn out to be a classic in the same way as THE LION KING and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, but I enjoyed it immensely. Go see it now!!!",,Anonymous,Animation
The awful remake made love this one even more,"Classic Disney. Why bother remake this great story, and remake it bad ?This animated movie has everything : characters, story, music, fun, action...Golden age Disney. The one we'll never get back.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Actually my favorite movie in the world,"I know this sounds silly, but Mulan is actually my all-time favorite movie. Trust me, I am a perfectly intelligent young woman who likes to read and is going to college, but there's just something about Mulan that I have always loved. It suffered a lot in release because it was lost in an avalanche of new CGI movies like A Bug's Life. But Mulan's story is every bit as good as those movies, even if you find the animation less impressive.The strengths of the movie for me are not the songs (which are very weak compared to earlier Disney), nor the animation (which is charming with a few Chinese flourishes) or any other technical aspect of the movie production. What makes this moving great is that it has a truly endearing, likable main character. While in most Disney movies the silly sidekicks or cute animals steal the show, in this movie Mulan is both funny and brave, making her a truly human character that I rooted for whole-heartedly.I am also a crazy feminist and for me this movie is the ultimate girl-power movie. Who would of thought that could ever be said of a Disney movie? But really, Mulan, as a Chinese tomboy who never quite feels that she fits in in her society, is an excellent picture of a woman finally proving to the world that she can do everything a man can do. After watching the movie (which I have done over 15 times) I always feel really inspired and motivated! Seriously! The movie without a doubt has lots of production problems (bad songs, clichéd side-characters, mediocre villain), but I still highly, highly recommend because fundamentally the characters are likable and believable and the plot is well constructed. Oh and I think it's pretty damn funny. Mushu always makes me laugh, and watching Mulan try to spit is still the funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie.If you want the classic singing, dancing fairy tale-style Disney movies a la The Little Mermaid, this is not quite what you're looking for. Mulan is more character driven and less lavishly made. But it absolutely belongs in the upper ranks of Disney, and it's a pity that Disney couldn't have continued to make animated features of this quality.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Pretty Good (7/10), and the characters don't break into song and dance.","Except, they do still sing--as sort of narration for their emotions.  The songs are highly unmemorable (as I sit here writing this, I can only remember the line, ""I'll make a man out of you,"" which is from the very worst song ever including in a Disney film.By the way, will Disney ever have a ""training session"" that will last more than a couple minutes and that isn't put to a song?  They did that to this movie, Hercules, Tarzan (who also grew into an adult instantaneously), and Beauty and the Beast (in that Belle changes her mind about the Beast during a song).One more really bad thing about Mulan--Mushu is a total hinderance.  I'm not just talking about his pop-culture mouth (which someone should have popped), but that he in fact causes more problems than he solves.  Would it really be so much to ask if Mulan could have made the mistake that ""gave away our position,"" instead of having Mushu shoot off a rocket?  At least that way, she's redeeming her own mistake, instead of someone elses, which gives no emotional payoff.  Better yet, why not have the falcon find the line of troops--after all, that's what the falcon is for, right?  It scouted earlier for the general's encampment and brought back the doll, remember?Oh, and the cross-dressing thing at the end was a little too weird--a bit too Fushigi Yugi and not really very intelligent--do you honestly think that anybody would fall for that trick, even if they were really women (especially considering what the Monguls would have done).The best parts of the movie were the references to Japanese cartoons (anime).  When Mushu fries the feathers off of the falcon, it looks like a Chocobo from the Final Fantasy series, but is just as likely a reference to the horseclaws from Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind (the director, apparently, is a devotee of Miyazaki).  Another Nausicaa reference--the doll, which is similar to the one that Lord Yupa finds at the beginning of the Nausicaa movie (it crumbles, and Yupa says, ""Another village has died."").  Also, Mulan's hair is given incredible attention, which is not usually the case in Disney films (usually they're just pretty and blow in the wind).  Just watch her hair when she bows in shame after they find out she's a she!Beyond that, there is a good deal of emotional content, though once the possibility of execution is lifted (a life for a life), it is never mentioned again--even though the overseer, who really hated her, could have had her executed at a moments notice once she caught back up with them.  And I'm sorry, but for all their knowledge and art, the Chinese were rather steadfast about their ways and about honor--they would not suddenly become so accepting of women, especially since they are still rather unaccepting of women.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I really liked this Disney flick that seemed to slip between the cracks,"In the 1990s, I felt that Disney made quite a few undistinguished cartoons following Aladdin. Unlike most of the world, I wasn't all that enamored with THE LION KING and subsequent offerings such as the wretched HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and POCAHONTAS were huge disappointments. Sure, POCAHONTAS is a lovely film to watch, but it's so wrong historically and it's so politically correct and hokey. And as for HUNCHBACK, the story was so dark and unappealing, I have no idea WHO the intended audience was. So it was in this context that I expected to hate or at least be underwhelmed by MULAN. Instead, it seemed fresh, well-made, humorous and fun--something distinctly missing from these other films. While the anachronistic aspect of having a lady warrior is problematic, for once Disney had another strong and likable female lead following Belle in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. This was a definite home-run for Disney and well worth your time whether you are a child or an adult.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Coming from a Chinese POV,"While most critics went into this movie expecting another typical Disney animated flick, I went in with another interest in mind: to see if Disney would give a respectable treatment to a Chinese subject.  Asian culture and their stories get limited enough time as it is in the theaters, so, being of Chinese blood, movies like Mulan are something for me to look forward to as a moviegoer.I am happy to say that I was delighted by what I saw.  On the surface was, expectedly, a rather typical Disney treatment of the alienated heroine who fights for acceptance.  However, it was framed within an uncompromising traditionalist Asian mentality, and I found it quite satisfying to see Disney pull few punches as far as this mentality was concerned: that women are inferior.  They are worthless, secondary, and there only to support men. A Disney be-yourself story is perfect against this backdrop, and it was great to see the backdrop itself so relentlessly illustrated.A normally watered down story might have featured a heroine set back by her own naturally limited abilities (such as Ariel's being a mermaid not allowing her to walk on land), but Mulan was stuck in a world where prejudices against whom she inherently was were not only unchecked but accepted as fact.  As someone who has been repeatedly irked by the ridiculous traditional Asian/Chinese view that women are inferior, Mulan's presentation enthralled me as the perfect situation to triumph out of. Everything in the movie reinforced this.  Mulan is to be presented like a piece of fruit to get married; she can not join the army under penalty of death; women are repeatedly referred to as not being able to do a man's job; etc.  Even the songs were extremely well-written to reinforce this: ""Be a Man"" straightforwardly suggests that only a man is capable of being strong enough to go to war; ""A Girl Worth Fighting For"" has the troops objectifying women to what they look like and cook like; ""Honor to Us All"" has a great line: ""We all must serve our emperor... our boys by bearing arms, our girls by bearing sons.""  Over and over again, the Asian mentality which I had witnessed so much myself firsthand was being pounded in to audience primarily made of impressionable kids!  Let me tell you, it was great!It was great to see that old Chinese mentality exposed, even if it was in a colorful musical, to a young audience.  And it was great to see that mentality refuted by the story itself: that a woman could be resourceful enough to help win a war and defeat a major villain _without_ becoming a man.  I really appreciated it.  The extra touches of ""Chinese-ness"" were also appreciated: Mulan's exclaiming ""ai-ya!"", the Ancestors and their place in the family homelife, the reverence under which the Emperor was held, the wicked official (ancient Chinese history is full of them).  One of my friends saw this in a theater full of Asians, and he said the audience received the movie with cheerful enthusiasm.  Even my parents appreciated the effort put into the movie, with my mother, self-proclaimed cartoon-hater, giving it a thumbs up!This movie did not go to lengths to misunderstand and poke fun at the Chinese.  It really did a fine job getting the point just right, especially in the conveyed attitude toward women.  Thus it scores on two levels: it shows that the Chinese can be heroic and that women are equal with men. It makes the kids happy and Asians can be in on the jokes.  I think this was a great achievement.P.S. For those of you who wonder about the actual story of Mulan: the story exists as a poem.  Much of it is spent describing in detail how Mulan made herself to appear as a man, and then back as a woman after the war was over, and, so I've been told, not much else.  The Chinese mostly regard it as one of those stories you've heard about, like the way Americans regard fairy tales.  I think it was a perfect story for Disney to ""raid,"" in its usual way :-)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"You trusted Ping, why is Mulan any different? LOVED IT!","Mulan (1998) :
Brief Review -You trusted Ping, why is Mulan any different? Loved It. I remember watching this animated flick in childhood on some TV channel or DVD but that time, by default, i didn't pay attention as a Movie Buff. Anyways, i enjoyed it then and even today when i feel like being a matured movie freak. Mulan is a story of a girl who decides to go and join Army to save her old age father and then discovers her own identity and glory. The story itself doesn't run on a dramatic path as the girl herself seems hungry to find the insights otherwise many films make mistake of letting someone else force her to do so. Apart from the girl angle the 2nd best thing is perspective set to have woman respect in society. When Mulan asks if you trusted the fake male version of her then why is Female any different? So sharp it was. Additional factors like family, drama, love are also engaging and loveable. Animation effects are quite Decent not anything spectacular may be because they wanted to keep the simplicity intact (as i figure it). Like i always say, animation gives you libery and freedom to give nasty and wild portrayal to the characters which live action films can't achieve. The characters can jump, fight, laughing, fly like anything and we won't mind at it, but the same cannot be applied in live action and that's the main reason i wanted to watch this Original Disney animated flick before giving a watch to the latest live action remake Mulan (2020). You know, there is some kind of nostalgia and cuteness in Animated films which makes them delightful and soulful. Mulan direction is upto the mark to whatever the script and visuals are provided. It couldn't have got any better, although overall impact of the film could have been better for sure. As i see it, Mulan is another Disney Product from 90s that has got deserving audience and fans.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Terrible clichéd Hollywood Disney cartoon,"Maybe I am expecting too much of a Disney cartoon portrayal of Chinese history.

Well, your experience with a film is individual, I guess.That said, I'll follow the trail and state why I loved watching this movie not once, but several times:First of all, I'm far from being a fan of animated Disney classics. I'm in that age between child and adult(currently 23), where everything is a rebelry. Most of my viewing pleasures is action or its like.My original incentive for seeing this movie was to please a friend of mine, who has a long-life fascination for oriental culture (read: karate films!). When Mulan was released in Denmark, a single copy with the original voices track (usually all animated Disneys are dubbed into danish with good result) was shown in a local theater. Asking a couple of girls out, we went and saw it. Ok, I was blown away. Before I had left the cinema that day, I too was captured by chinese history and culture. The singing and music I was prepared for; I knew The Jungle Book and Aristocats from childhood. The songs didn't mean anything to me, other than that they were few - good for me. (Some of them do kling to the ear - irritating for me!) I quickly realised Eddie Murphy was on the voices cast. I started liking the movie right then. Some find him malplaced in a Disney epic, but fact is that the business of animating classics is profiting well these years in bringing in already established names to the animations; Tom Hanks in the Toy Stories, Mel Gibson in Pocahontas, Robin Williams in Aladdin, and who else I don't know of. These names sell the film before the film have a chance to sell itself. (The danish producers, by the way, have stolen this idea when dubbing the films, using local media stars for the voice cast.) Well...it did work for me. Eddie Murphy is not as funny in this production as he is in others, but what the heck...he can't exactly use too much harsh language, it IS a children's flick. But with the room he got, his speedy tongue made me laugh again and again. I have later seen Aladdin, and find Eddie Murphy's achievement as funny as Robin Williams'. That Eddie Murphy chose this project was an interesting and probably very clever career move. Later, when I studied the rest of the cast list, I noticed a lot of chinese names. That very much pleased me. Who other than Chinese people to tell a Chinese tale to Westerners? I found some old friends, Soon-Tek Oh and James Hong, people who had worked with Chick Norris in the 80's. Pat Morita as the emperor made me smile. B.D.Wong I remembered from Jurrasic Park, but Ming-Na was new to me (had to look her up in IMDB, was stunned not to have known her before (Ok, I went wow!)). Harvey Fierstein as a ploppy little soldier and Miguel Ferrer as the Hun leader I found the perfect voice-choice for their characters...other names rang also. Anyway, a lot of the above have only value after you've seen the film. When you are an Atlantic ocean from most of the sales pitch, the film had to sell itself. It did - for me, anyway. Before then, I knew little about China and her history apart from things here and there (read: karate films!). Meeting angient China like this totally threw me away. Wership of the ancestors, the power and position of the emperor, I found myself lost in the dream of a world long gone; I loved the image of a China with different traditions but still found myself attracted to the pro-Disney story about a girl standing up to a culture's sexist prejudice. (I do find the plot a bit silly, actually, but I let myself be taken away...it's just a Disney.) Agree, the characters lack a little bit, the love story of Mulan and Shang should perhaps have had a few more frames to play with. The project was a little bit tuned down from the Disney board of directors, but honor to all who worked with it: You people did a good job! The computer animation used for the Great Wall and the attack of the Huns startles me again and again; Not many live movies can do the job as good.So that's what Mulan is for me...The dream of ancient China and Eddie Murphy's speedy tongue. I accept the term classic. I have the damn thing on video now (English language) and must prevent myself from seeing it too often, in fright of one day getting tired of it.",,Anonymous,Animation
Definitely a Disney classic!,"I love this movie, and so does my sister. I loved the fact, they based it in China, and they got the cultural aspects of Chinese life right. Bravo, Disney! The animation, especially during the avalanche scene, was spotless(loved that epic shot of the bird flying over the huns), and the music, especially in the attack of the huns/avalanche scene and the part where everyone bows down to Mulan towards the end(a real tear-jerker as was the ""greatest honour is having you for a daughter"" part) by Jerry Goldsmith was lovely too, Shan-Yu's theme was also haunting. The songs are better than they're given credit for, the best being ""Reflection"", ""I'll Make a Man out of You"" and the one in the end credits. I strongly recommend Vanessa Mae's rendition of ""Reflection"", which is extraordinary. The singing voices, from the likes of Lea Salonga and Donny Osmond, did match the voice actors, unlike Quest for Camelot. The characters are also very memorable; Ming Na's feisty Mulan(one of Disney's greatest female characters), George Takei's brooding ancestor, Eddie Murphy's hilarious Mushu- who bags most of the film's best lines-, BD Wong's handsome Shang, Miguel Ferrer's mysterious and often frightening Shan Yu(who actually is an effective and underrated villain despite having an all-too-easy and lame death scene) and of course Pat Morita's wise Emperor. Some aspects of the well-told story might fly over children's heads, but this is enthralling entertainment, that deserves a much higher rating. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Feat of a Brave Warrior or Honored Masterpiece of Evil Corporation,"Musical, adventure, drama, comedy. Do you remember, dear viewers, that in ancient times, when mammoths still walked the earth, Disney studio was associated with the words ""quality"", ""humor"" and ""great pastime for the whole family"", where viewers of all ages will find for themselves what something close to his heart? Yes, my dear old men, there was a time! This is now Disney mired in such a brown substance with its subpoena and openly careless attitude to business that it earned me the nickname ""Evil Corporation"". But let's not talk about the sad, and therefore - let us remember today one of the well-deserved masterpieces of my childhood, which I can revisit an infinite number of times - and again have pleasure, as in the very first. I don't remember the circumstances of the first viewing, but it was definitely in childhood. And here is my brief opinion - Honored Masterpiece of the Corporation of Evil. In this review we will consider the expressive advantages of this cartoon, because, firstly, I don't want to talk about the shortcomings here, and secondly, they are insignificant here, and the word ""absolutely"" does not affect the general perception. Now, let your humble servant dwell on the merits in more detail.
So, here they are:
1. Told Story - this musical, intertwined with several genres, tells the story of a brave girl Mulan - a character from a Chinese legend (about the reality and fiction of which is still debated), who went to war instead of her elderly father. And everything would be fine, but if the deception is revealed, then death and shame for the whole family awaits her. Of course, the story is retold with a Disney touch of talking animals and is filled with songs and humor. I also note that Mulan is shown as a strong and courageous girl who took such a step to save her father. At the same time, she remained a wonderful girl, very emotional. I fell in love with this heroine, and empathized with her throughout the cartoon, absolutely in any situation. A strong heroine who is loved by boys and who has been admired by a girl for more than one generation. And do not care, as it was in the legend, because it is very similar to the truth.
2. Animation - I definitely indicate this item in cartoons with classic 2D animation, since 3D is already frankly enough, not to say even worse. Characters, environments, backdrops - everything looks amazingly beautiful and does not age. I assure you, and in a hundred years, this animation will delight a new generation of viewers and bewitch with its beauty.
3. Chinese entourage - since the legend of Mulan is Chinese, the creators tried to immerse the audience in this era, applying a minimum of details, but strengthening the emphasis on being of that time (strictly patriarchal). And they succeeded. I literally ended up in Ancient China, threatened by nomadic tribes from the north. Clothes, design, music - all this perfectly conveyed the entourage.
4. Songs - I estimate them according to the Russian version, because I did not watch the cartoon in the original. But I know that the Corporation of Evil is very vigilant about the localization of its products in different countries, and knowing the experience of the Russian branch, you can not worry about the quality, because the translation is not verbal, but it perfectly fits the motive and meaning of the songs. The songs themselves turned out to be strong and emotional, and even touching, funny, and so on. Plus, the dubbing actors obviously tried, and in their voices you can hear the whole gamut of feelings that a person is capable of. Bravo!
5. Images - fear of the enemy, the ominous image of a strong enemy, the monstrous consequences of a bloody battle and much more - the creators of the cartoon managed, in the absence of blood or scenes of a cruel slaughter (after all, a cartoon for family viewing), to convey all this through the images, actions of the characters. Using a minimum of details, the creators were able to demonstrate and make us feel emotions, including fear for China and the heroes.
6. Humor - Evil Corp would not be Evil Corp if there was no humor in their cartoons. And he is here, there is a lot of him, and he is amazing. In some moments you experience a real ""Spanish shame"" for the heroes doing such that at least stand still fall. The lion's share of humor is formed here by the dragon Mushu - my favorite. Of course, some jokes were adapted to Russian realities (naturally in dubbing), and this added points to the cartoon from the viewer in the CIS and the former USSR.
7. Characters - each is worked out and interesting, both first and second plan, from a soldier to the Emperor himself. But Mushu takes a separate place. For without him it would be definitely boring, I assure you. Mushu is a cartoonish loser-merry fellow who hooks the audience from the very first appearance in the frame and does not let go until the very final credits.
A little about the main characters:
1. Fa Mulan is an ordinary girl who, in a difficult time for the country and family, committed a daring and deadly act - disguised as a man and went to war. An awkward, daring, strong and courageous girl. A real warrior maiden. Who did not become a radical feminist, but remained a woman capable of feelings and excessive emotionality. She will be admired by both boys and girls. A worthy image of a strong girl who evokes sympathy from start to finish.
2. Mushu - a dragon, the keeper of the family, who went to help Mulan in order to help her cope with an impossible task. A treasure trove of humor and a source of endless laughter. The classic loser who gets the chance to make something memorable and benefit. In the original, he is voiced by Eddie Murphy himself, but in Russian dubbing he speaks in the voice of Valery Kukharyoshin, whose voice will always remain with me.
3. Li Shang is the commander of the recruits, in whose ranks Mulan has arrived. I must make from yesterday's peasants a combat-ready army, which must defeat the invaders who attacked China. He shows himself as a skillful mentor and a courageous commander who knows how to make decisions in difficult situations. Well, the romance has not gone anywhere. It looks appropriate and evokes emotion and joy.
There are still many heroes that deserve mention, but if I list them all, I will ruin the viewing for those unfortunate people who have not yet watched this wonderful cartoon.
Of course, there are some comments, but they, I repeat, are insignificant and do not affect the overall impression. Let's call them small shoals that are inevitable when working on an animated film.
This masterpiece has a sequel to ""Mulan 2"", but it is frankly weak, and keeps only on Mushu's humor, but even it is better than that squalor called ""Mulan"" 2020, which I don't even want to talk about, otherwise the pressure will jump up and you will have to drink funny pills ... Therefore, let's imagine that the story of the brave warrior Mulan ended in this cartoon with a predictable and well-deserved ending.
As a result, we have a real masterpiece of the Corporation of Evil about the brave girl Mulan, with an excellent script, great surroundings, great humor, catchy characters, great songs and stunning animation.

"Very good, but not perfect","Mulan is a very good movie. Simple, yet moving. It is certainly not traditional Disney film.Mulan is a film where the tragedy and comedy is wisely mixed. It balances itself wittily, except one last minor thing. In the end they should not have used nowadays music style to express happy end. Otherwise the score was great. I give 10 out of 10 for music. Osmond and Salonga are first rate musical singers and do their part superbly. I have also heard mandarin version of ""Man out of You"" with Jackie Chan and to tell the truth I found it even better than English version. Although I do not understand the language, I felt the poise in the singing, and it was superb. So for Chan I add one extra point 11 out of 10.The Huns were presented as evil as could get, yet wise, which gave depth to their characters. The battle scene in the middle of the film has very interesting and good angles in cinematography. Very well thought out.The supporting characters were good. Mushu was very well created character and had some very funny lines. Usually many sidekicks are too overwritten, but Mushu, even when talking too much, had something to say as well. Murphy did great job. There were some lines even that were spine chilling (Emperor's).Although the movie was very well paced and intelligently created, it was not perfect. And simply because it tried to be too commercial. If some cheap jokes were omitted, it could have been great.Overall I give 9 out of 10 and highly recommend for everybody. One of the triumphs of Disney indeed, and worthy partner to The Lion King.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Pretty fascinating, even if it isn't as dark or in-depth as it could be","'Mulan' is good Disney.There's a lot to enjoy about this film, it's not without a few less entertaining parts but overall it's one that many will like. The plot is pretty fascinating, even if it isn't as dark or in-depth as it could be.Ming-Na Wen gives a more than acceptable performance in the lead role. Eddie Murphy, though, is definitely the most memorable voice from this. I don't love his character, who is a bit too cartoon-y and looks out of place, but Murphy is simply funny, in what certainly feels like a precursor to his role in the 'Shrek' franchise. None of the other cast standout, yet still give what's required.Animation-wise it's nice, while a few of the songs are catchy. I don't, as already alluded to with Murphy's Mushu, overly rate the character design. Aside from the aforementioned, I also don't like how Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) looks - he, at least to me, just looks angry all the time rather than terrifying or threatening.I do class this as a film worth watching for sure, the pacing helps keep things enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wow.,"Definitely one of my favourite Disney movies ever.  It's always nice to see a female come to the rescue.  And after Hercules, I'm glad that the villains in this movie were actually scary.  A chill went down my spine during the mountain scene.  And the ending was great too, not completely wrapping up the story like most Disney movies do.  Excellent work.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as bad as I first thought,"I'll be honest here. I started watching this movie with a pretty negative attitude about the whole thing. I think that most Disney movies have gotten worse and worse over the past few years, so I assumed ""Mulan"" would be no exception. But then, after I watched the movie for a little while, I realized it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it might be. The characters are quite well-developed, and the movie itself moves along fairly smoothly. I think the only thing that really ""clogged"" the movie was the frequent songs, although I truly enjoyed a couple of them. All in all, I found the movie quite enjoyable, and I give it about a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
An excellent adventure,"Mulan came as a bit of a surprise after the rather shallow ""Hunchback of Notredame"" from  1997. Mulan is the name of a Chinese girl and takes place in ancient China. China is attacked by its enemies and the emperor decides that a man from each family must serve in the army.  Mulan`s father must once again be a soldier, but he is old and sick. Therefore Mulan disguises herself as a boy, and takes her father`s place in the army.  But that proves to be very tough. The animation in Mulan is simply stunning, the character-voices are good and the songs are fine.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Jerry Goldsmith and Donny Osmond failed to make a man out of me!,"""Mulan"" is one of Disney's last ""hand-drawn"" animated works from before it bought Pixar and started exclusively producing computer-animated films and pre-teen pop starlets. The animation here is certainly nice when compared to Disney's television shows, but like other Disney cartoons from this era (Pocahontas, The Emperor's New Groove) the lines are simple, the colors are a bit flat and the cast seems to be on auto-pilot. Yeah, Mulan isn't a Disney film that I would say was particularly ""inspired"".The musical numbers by Jerry Goldsmith are pretty droll and even offensive (for instance, the fat Chinese soldier character sings about how his ideal woman would know how to cook beef, chicken and pork; you know, like on a Chinese food menu?). Donny Osmond sings the main theme song for Mulan's training montage. I don't like Osmond, but the song is actually flawed by the weak and tepid songwriting, not the vocal performance. Most of the songs here are memorable because they're so laughably awful. I mean, compared to ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" or ""The Lion King"" the songs here are not even in the same ballpark.Eddie Murphy isn't laugh-out-loud hilarious, but he's the only saving grace of the film. He voices a sassy supporting role, Mulan's pet dragon and best friend, and is the only entertaining part of the film. He's a little miscast, but is also somehow the only substantial character. For instance, the villains (here it's the Mongolian Horde, ancient China's consistent historical adversary) have such little character depth -- not to mention humanity. I know Disney films paint the world in simplistic shades of good and evil, but good golly... the Mongolians are depicted here as a collective race of monsters! They're given no incentive or individual reason for existence. And I don't recall seeing any female Mongolians either. Their whole depiction is clumsy and comes across as ignorant. Also, it's kind of weird that Mulan falls in love with a tough guy who, well... beats her into shape.The film's not unwatchable, it's just really mediocre. The use of the CGI makes it clear that Disney was just about finished with their signature (historically significant) hand-drawn animated works. But Mulan comes nowhere close to any of Disney's back catalog. To any parents looking for a good Disney animated film to watch with their kids, go for anything before Pocahontas. Mulan is lackluster in the departments of charm, pacing, songwriting and memorability.I've heard the more recent animated Disney film ""Lilo & Stitch"" was much better, so maybe I should check that out.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Despite a few weak songs this is a great cartoon,"Mulan is a tomboy of sorts - not something that is looked for in a Chinese wife, and she causes constant worry and dishonour to her family.  When the Huns attack China, the Emperor commands each family to put one man forward to fight.  With Mulan's aged father the only man of the family it looks like he must fight, but Mulan dresses as a man and takes his place.  With the help of dragon Mushu, Mulan overcomes her status as a woman to help take on the Hun.I wasn't sure I would like this film as I have grown a little tired of the Disney formula of `songs, romance and smartassed comedy sidekicks', which Mulan sticks to pretty well, however I did really enjoy this film.  I think it was mainly because of the sweep of the story, the big battles and the majestic feel to the movie.  The plot moves swiftly and felt like it was all over too quickly.  It has the usual mix of laughs for parents and kids as well as having quite a good story behind it all.The only major weakness is the songs.  I didn't exactly start tapping my feet at any of them and, while they are not bad per se, they aren't great and after a few lines I was wanting to skip past them (but couldn't - it was showing on TV).  Asides from these the film is funny and quite dramatic and is good fun to watch.  The cast are good.  Ming-Na is a good Mulan while Murphy rehearses for Shrek with his smart mouthed dragon that gets plenty of good laughs.  DB Wong is a good actor but has a `straight' role and doesn't distinguish himself.  I was worried at first by the presence of Harvey Fierstein, but he did good work and wasn't half as irritating as he usually is.With colourful animation that is good without being Pixar, this is a good cartoon that is fun, funny and, at times, dramatic.  I'm not a big fan of Disney over the last few years but I did really enjoy this film and would watch it again.",,Anonymous,Animation
excellent movie,"I first saw this movie as a little kid, but I still enjoy it now that i'm 15. I consider this to be one of the first GOOD movies to come out of that greedy capitalist hellhole called Disney in years. Some of the arguments against it have been ridiculous.""It's racist!"" Oh come on people, it's supposed to be and adventure/war movie, not a remake of Ghandi! The Huns are bad, the Chinese are good because that's how it was in the ancient legend. A movie like this is not supposed to put political correctness before entertainment.""It's discriminating against men!"" Lighten up, please. I'm a guy and I wasn't offended by this. It's from Mulan's perspective, and I think it's safe to say she was somewhat prejudiced. Besides, Shang was cool. There was nothing wrong with him.""It's too violent!"" I hate to break it to you, but war happens. Yes, there are fields of bodies. Yes, the bad guys kill people. Yes, it might scare little kids. But seriously, the evening news is way more violent. These things happen, and if your kids never know about it then they're going to be pretty freaked out when they first encounter the real world.In short, Mulan is a great movie for anybody who doesn't want they're kids to live in a bubble. It's got action, romance, friendship, the whole works, and would have been great even if it wasn't animated.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Would have been better without Mushu's character,"I love cartoons.I think ever since the first full-length cartoon movies have been made, there was the ""funny"" support character which was responsible for the laughs.In later times this character was in general the hero's aide: the Genie in Alladin, Philoctetes in Hercules and so on.The problem is that the funny character tends to get more and more exaggerated every time, borrowing standard and oh-so-predictable lines from poor comedies, spoiling everything. Don't get me wrong: The Genie and Philoctetes were perfect, because they didn't overdo it, but Mushu certainly overdoes it.What need do we have for this kind of silly humor in a children movie? All the lines were heard and reheard, stupid and boring... and not funny at all. A movie CAN be nice without somebody telling the same old jokes over and over again, jokes which sound the same whether they are told in I-don't-know-which-century China (like in Mulan) or in the next century (like in the last semi-science-fiction movie I have seen, The Sixth Day).A cartoon movie is dedicated first of all to children, and I think that at least for them we should keep the movies nice, like the stories were when I was a kid. Why do kids these days watch mostly cartoons about bigger and bigger robots fighting each other and not Tom and Jerry anymore? We should try to change this mentality...Other than that the movie was very nice, the musical score was great and did a great job in sustaining the action.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another great Disney modern,"Modern Disney is kind of a funny thing with me. Their formula, more or less, keeps getting recycled every single movie. Despite this, there are good modern Disney movies, and there are bad modern Disney movies. Yet even with the good ones, there is always some kind of funny aftertaste. Mulan is an example of a great modern Disney movie. I'll point out the good parts first and get to the funny aftertaste later.First, this is a touching and dramatic story. Mulan is only the third Disney movie that was able to touch my heart, The Fox and the Hound and Bambi being the first and second. It is about a young woman's struggle to do what's right and save the life of her father, who for once is a caring but firm man and not some goofball like you see in some of the other Disney movies. This is also about her struggle to find identity, her struggle to persevere, her struggle to be like one of the men, and her struggle against the Hun army and the horrors of war.Now the funny aftertaste. As usual, Disney insists on throwing in a comedic sidekick. While he is funny, it does get annoying sometimes. Some of the songs are good, but others are real snoozes. And Disney's modern formula still hasn't changed any. Disney also still insists on modernisms and pop culture.Despite these flaws, which appear in practically all modern Disney movies, Mulan is still a great Disney movie with a strong story. This is one the family will enjoy over and over again.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mulan,"Mulan, directed by Tony Bancroft & Barry Cook, produced by Pam Coats, is one of Disney's first princess', that really wasn't a typical princess, doing princess duties. Bancroft & Cook incorporated great heart-warming messages throughout the story, treating the kids like actual human beings, and also giving the adults something to be invested in as well. This was a big ""girl power"" movement, but I was perfectly okay with it, due to it's soulful messages. The story was pretty fast paced, but well balanced with the tones & amount of content they had to offer.Hand Bacher & Ric Sluiter did an amazing job bringing these fantastic drawing-animations to life, backed up with favorable voice overs by Eddie Murphy, BD Wong, and more! All of these characters looked great, and were balanced out very well; nobody shadowed one another. Mulan was an empowering character, that you really cared about because she embraces such an influential & powering figure. Her character development meant so much to the film, with the narrative flowing through her actions. Mushu is one of my favorite Disney characters of all time! He is the needed comedic relief of the film, having just enough screentime to not over saturate his character. The antagonist is pretty creepy, while posing a huge threat at all times. All of the additional side characters were great! They were all great fun, and utilized nicely, complimenting Mulan.The screenplay was very serious at times, but managed to sneak in well placed comedy, and deep dialogues. The dialogues were wise and witty, with a few silly moments to really even out the tone & pacing.The score by Jerry Goldsmith had a great battle score. Goldsmith had a hand from Stevie Wonder, Mathew Wilder & David Zippel, to help create these near-classic songs.Overall, this movie was very unique, and it truly paid off. Disney classic!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
How animated films should be,"I must say, Mulan is a truly wonderful film. It used to be one of my favorites as a kid.It deals with ancient China, where only men could join the army. To fight the invading Hans, the government recruits men to join the army to fight the invaders. This affects Mulan's small family. Mulan is reluctant to have her father fight in the war, because she knows he could easily die, so she steals his armor and sword and sets off to join the army as a man. She later gets a companion named Mushu (voices by Eddie Murphy) who is a miniature and funny dragon sent by the ancestors. And so our story begins.I really loved this movie. First of all, he story deals with a semi-sexist community, and one of the people who are considered lower, stands out from the rest. I found this to be very dramatic, and it reminds me of other movies, such as Rabbit-Proof Fence, where the despised half-castes run away from the cruel camp. This is a similar situation.Second of all, the film is very funny. Eddie Murphy shows off his comedic talents when playing the role of Mushu. It's rather silly at times, but it doesn't hurt to laugh. I thought one of the funniest scenes was the bath scene, but it was pretty gross though.Third of all, the animation is superbly detailed. The characters do look a bit funny, but the artists defiantly took their time in making this wonderful film.Mulan is very powerful, very detailed and very funny- just like all animated films should be. I don't know why this isn't in the top 50 animated films. It's wonderful.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
What ever happened to good plots?,"This isn't a BAD movie. The problem is that it's the same movie Disney ALWAYS makes. Thorough formula, completely predictable, sometimes it seems like they just change the names.Eddie Murphy's Dragon was totally irritating. If a movie must have a comic buffoon, the character should at least be funny, and have enough charm where you understand why the other characters put up with him.The cricket was cute. The two lead characters were good. The music was subpar. But overall, there's just no reason to watch this movie instead of a dozen others. I didn't HATE it. Heck, I kind of enjoyed it. But it's forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A movie only a kid could like,"_Mulan_ might have been a masterpiece at a time when Disney films had strong creative voices behind them, but the film has been badly marred by Disney's current committee-style production process. The film simply can't seem to figure out what it's trying to achieve. It's nominally feminist, but undermines that feminist message with its overuse of male gender stereotypes and regressive ending. It is a musical in format, but features uninspired and forgettable tunes that play only a subordinate role in plot and character development. It attempts to realistically portray war, but stretches the laws of physics and basic concepts of military strategy in a way that only a six-year-old could ignore (Run! It's an army of six Huns!). Finally, it tries to lighten this rather somber mess with a wacky sidekick, but Eddie Murphy's voicing of the dragon is so over-the-top that it destroys what could have been the film's greatest strength -- the mystical, exotic mood created by the sweeping Chinese landscape. _Mulan_ seems to me to be compelling evidence of Disney's schizophrenic 1990s creative philosophy: it tries to be feminist and conventional at the same time, and attempts to deal with issues of war while still being comprehensible to toddlers. The result is a confused mess so full of holes and inconsistencies that older children and adults will find it very difficult to suspend their disbelief.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney is the not the real world....,"Perhaps I am not the best person to review Disney cartoons...I spend too much of my time thinking things like......Hey they seem to be wearing Tang Dynasty clothes but they are practicing ancestor worship which was not introduced until the birth of the Neo-Confucian religion in the Song Dynasty.However Chinese stories have always gone through a process of growth and change, with elements added and removed by different story tellers and at different times.Disney's Mulan tells the historic/legendary story of Hua Mu Lan, a character popular with Chinese woman.The historical innacurracies are really just a Disney Uber-China where the core elements of Chinese history are fused for the purposes of story telling.I avoided seeing this movie for a long time because of the feeling that it would be racist. In many ways it was. Firstly it projects a western view that Asian women are meant to be stupid and compliant, when in fact Asian women are meant to be intelligent, well read, educated and capable and Chinese literature often admires these women. However the world's of women and men are meant to separate. The idea of women being brainless is a Western culture value projected onto Asia. The idea of women not being determined or strong is also a western culture value.The other problem is the portrayal of the Huns as yellow eyed inhuman creatures or demons.But the is the world of Disney. The good guys are good and the bad guys bad. The values of families sticking together, good beating evil, try your best etc are the 1950s American values that have lived on at Disney.However it is an enjoyable story, and I watch it in China, in Inner Mongolia (Mongolians being from the same region as the Huns), with Chinese and Mongolians....and well they weren't offended....and it is a lovely story, funny, sad, serious, with a lot of beautiful shots, heroic battles, clever dialog in the Disney fashion. Not an artist masterpiece, but a nice pick-me-up movie on a cold dreary night in Mongolia.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Not one of Disney's best, but still good fun.","When China is attacked by the Huns, the emperor enlists one man from every family to help fight the savage invaders. In order to save her father (the only male in her family) from what would probably be certain death, beautiful Mulan disguises herself as a man and takes his place. Aided by Mushu, a wise-cracking dragon, and a 'lucky' cricket, Mulan learns how to be a soldier, saves the day and still has time to steal the heart of a dashing captain.Disney's adaptation of the Chinese legend of Mulan is a well animated and entertaining tale, but one that may not appeal to younger children due to its rather slow start and historical setting. Technically the film is superb, with some lovely stylish oriental flourishes to the animation and superb action scenes, but the unmemorable songs are less than impressive and many of the supporting characters lack the 'personality' we have come to expect from recent Disney films.Although definitely not a 'classic', Mulan is nevertheless still entertaining fare and, let's face it, even a poor Disney movie usually has enough merits to warrant a viewing (unless it's the Black Cauldron or Cars, of course!).",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Young lady poses as a man to save her father.,"What I wouldn't give to be able to see this movie for the first time again. This Disney Musical/Comedy/Drama was a delightful surprise for both me and mydaughter. The artful animation(watch the smoke) the terrific songs like ""Be a Man"", the laugh out loud antics of Eddie Murphy's Mushu, and a heroic, feisty, and really likable Mulan help make this movie truly special. Every time I take it down from the video shelf I'm surprised at how good it is. Some of the subject matter isn't appropriate for small children. The movie does remind us of the historical repression of women and the sorrow of war, which adds meaning tothe story. But overall the film is lots of fun. So ""Be a Man"" and watch this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
fun and serious,"This movie is fun as usually, but it surprised me with how serious it gets sometimes, something missing from modern animated movies. i was a little nervous at first, with it possibly not holding up, but as soon as mushu and the gang joined the movie, it took off.the only thing keeping this from being much better is the songs. don't get me wrong, they weren't bad, but they aren't songs i would listen to outside the movie. although there was one musical score part that gave me super goosebumps (about 5 viewings, 6/10/2020)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Very good, but not classic.","Mulan is just about Disney's last really good 'classically animated' style movie (at the time of writing). The whole thing has a pleasing, mildly intoxicating atmosphere to it. There are scenes of considerable emotional impact, mixed with sufficient comedy and adventure, and some really nice landscape shots. Eddie Murphy, though slightly annoying as the salamander-thing, has not at this stage developed into the outright annoying animated voice-over artist which would come with Shrek.The film could have strayed into irritating political correctness (G.I. Jane in Ancient China), but it pretty much manages to avoid this. If you can put up with the silly American accents used for Chinese characters, I'd recommend Mulan. Particularly in a visual sense, it has the feeling of a traditional oriental painting at times.I'd sooner watch this than anything by Disney I've seen since (though nearly most of them have been at least alright)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wish Disney still made films of this quality,"It is a shame that Disney has not produced any animated films in recent years of this quality, with the exception of the Pixar films.A truly wonderful film.A good story. Shows great respect & importance of family. And, even though based in a time long ago, the film sets a standard for female roles.Great music, last Disney film, in my opinion to have a soundtrack of this quality.

Mediocre effort at telling Chinese folk tale,"Not really poor, by anybody's standards except Disney's, that is. This movie shot for yet another in a long line of breath taking animation extravaganzas for the famed studio. It fell a bit short.The movie has many scenes of wide shots, enormous structures, army multitudes, and feeds its dialog with plenty of ancient Chinese wisdom. But there is little involvement for the audience where the central characters, especially Mulan herself, are concerned. In a movie about a woman who impersonate a man in order to become a soldier, that is integral to invoke interest. But the story never pulls it off; at best, Mulan comes off as a spoiled rich daughter who whines to herself, and sneaks around regardless of the consequences. It's difficult to accept her as a heroine of ethnic diversity (as was intended, it seems) when the character sounds more like a modern western middle-school girl talking on her like cell phone. The Chinese folk tale character was lost in translation somewhere.By the time she does her super hero routine in the battle scenes, it only evokes a ho-hum response: did we (yawn) beat the bad guys, yet? Most scenes from the film are too over the top to be taken seriously. Others are forgotten soon after seeing the film.The film has its moments, but it's among the weaker movies by Disney.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mulan kicks butt without wires!,"That's my background - grew up with Aristocats, Jungle Book, 101 Dalmations etc but I've avoided stuff like Pocahontas and The Lion King like the plague because cutesy animals and horrible moralising have replaced wit and charm. So I gave Mulan a chance.And I was really pleasantly surprised. Mulan manages to keep a reasonable flavour of Chinese/Hong Kong cinema without seeming patronising or watered-down. It's not too cute or fluffy and the villain is not even remotely camp or risible. He's just plain EVIL. Course the songs are sometimes naff, but I really loved Disney's take on the staple ""kung fu boot camp"" .Even the romantic angle isn't too gloopy and soft focus, it just leaves you with a hint of a beginning.Anyway for more cross-dressing martial arts heroines, check out Brigitte Lin's career.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Disney Movie with a Different Beat,"After watching Mulan at a local movie theater with my family, I have to admit, I was amazed.  I had seen previews for it on TV, and I was disappointed.  I pictured Mulan as a dark, gloomy movie about war and fighting. Honestly, it was the opposite.  With the hilariously clever Mushu and cute Cri-Kee, Mulan colorfully displayed a young girl, growing up, trying to find her way and prove she is worth something to her father and to herself.Mulan is certainly not the typical, traditional Disney film...and I applaud it for that.  Focused in Ancient China, it is about a young, ordinary girl. She is not a princess (Jasmine) and she is no extraordinarily beautiful woman falling in love (Pocahontas).  She is just a young girl trying to save her father and trying to prove herself.I admit to scrutinizing Mulan for not being about a princess and not being about romance, but because of that, it proves that a movie about people, ordinary people, can do well too.  Mulan came at a time when Disney movies were not as appealing as they once were (The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules), but it revived the Disney scene anyway.While I still say that the new classics, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King are the best films Disney has produced, with well-written storylines and amazing musical scores, Mulan is a wonder of its own.  The lack of music was disappointing, but nonetheless, Mulan is a wonderful movie for families, especially young girls and their fathers.",,Anonymous,Animation
the progression of the Disney princess,"The Huns led by Shan Yu are invading China. The emperor is calling up one man from each family to join the army. Fa Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) fears her father is too sick and instead joins herself disguised as a man. Her ancestors call on the Great Stone Dragon to retrieve Mulan but clumsy small dragon Mushu (Eddie Murphy) accidentally cracks the statue. So Mushu tries to make Mulan a war hero so that they can return in triumph.It's a good evolution on the Disney princess movies. She is no longer the helpless victim. Like Beauty and Beast, Mulan willingly sacrifices herself but she's doing even more. She is actively trying to break out of the traditional gender roles. It's an admirable advancement but it's missing a few things. The most notable is the absent of any catchy great new song. Also Mulan dressed as a male soldier doesn't make for the best doll for the collection. Nevertheless this is a good story and fun exciting animation.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great,"This is really a Disney classic and one of the best Disney films I've seen recently (The Emperor's New Groove was something of a disappointment, though I haven't seen Atlantis and Monsters Inc. yet).

You know I do not like most of his post 1990 stuff too much, except maybe Metro and The Nutty Professor II, but when he lends his voice for an animated film (like this one or Shrek) it is almost poised to be great.8 out of 10 (this film spilled 0,5 points with that ghost ancestor stuff in the beginning and end)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A solid movie with two big flaws.,"In ancient china, you don't cut your hair due to filial piety. Your hair represents your love for your family, but also your dignity as a human being.There was a sentence where your hair are cut short. So everyone can know at first glance you committed a crime :)""Dishonor on you! Dishonor on your cow!""Since the bad guys are the Huns, the story take place somewhere between the Qin dynasty and the Northern and Southern dynasty. So way after the Warring states period and the birth of Confucianism. In the ballad of Mulan, it is generally considered the story takes place during the sixteen kingdoms, so more than 100 years after the end of the Han dynasty. So by looking at the bad guys, it is hard to identify when the story is happening.In the movie, the clothes are closer to the ones during the Han dynasty and the architectures are closer to Ming/Qing dynasty. So... when no one after they became an adult (~15ish yo) cut their hair short... except criminals... which was a type of sentence as I said earlier. (which was why during the Qing dynasty Han Chinese people were forced to cut their hair since it was a sign of the Manchu dominance and those who did not cut their hair were seen as rebels that wanted the restoration of the Ming dynasty)So, the hair cutting scene was very disturbing to me. Although I get the meaning behind this specific scene, it was too foreign for the story... So instead of being moved by Mulan's decision to protect her father and the country... I was unable to emotionally connect for this scene.Another thing that bugged me a lot back then is Mushu. His name was more like a random fake Chinese name, so it made no sense. The way the dragon is portrayed through Muhsu was so different from the ones I was familiar I was unable to enjoy its presence. I wasn't offended, but I wasn't amused either.These are the two main shortcomings in the movie for me but it is an overall a pretty good movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

It, along with the Lion King and the Lion King II are probably the only movies I can watch more than once in a day. And yes, I have watched Mulan more than once in a day. And I've rewound (it's VHS. I still live in the '90s. Get over it) some parts over and over during those viewings. This movie is just so fantastic I can hardly put it into words. The music isn't tiresome or annoying like some Disney movies, the message is strong and a good one, and there are some dark elements in it that won't scare the children but will provide a little extra entertainment for adults.I personally think that this movie should be in every household - whether there are children or teenagers or adults watching, it's fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The backdrops are wonderfully drawn. The songs are memorable and entertaining, plus they're sung by two very good singers: Lea Salonga and Donnie Osmond.

Eddie Murphy's comic relief dragon is funny (and obviously a precursor for his work as Donkey in the Shrek series). The songs are nice, though few stay with you for very long after the credits roll. Good score from Jerry Goldsmith. The animation is solid and occasionally impressive. The cultural diversity helps greatly as the story is predictable to a fault.

"Despite a Unique Source and the Typical Disney Pedigree, Mulan is Merely Average","Warfare and gender politics (plus musical numbers and pet dragons) around imperial China in this Disney-fied adaptation of an old eastern fable. It's flashy and well-produced, with a strong female lead and up-front morals, but the plot seems too convenient and there's very little life outside the spotlight's bright glare. Funny, that last point, as Disney's always been so thorough about granting attention to the little details in their better preceding efforts.Mulan is just fine. The animation is fluid and smooth, a crisp blend of classic western style and traditional Chinese décor that brims with character while paying service to a stiffer, more respect-driven society. The plot, up-tempo but shallow, hits its important points and changes the scenery before younger minds have a chance to wander. Singing and dancing cartoons aren't really my thing, but the tunes in Mulan are aurally inoffensive, at least, and kept rather short and utilitarian. I didn't hate anything, really, but I also didn't love anything... it was all just there. Yep, that looks like a Disney movie. Yep, that's the bad guy. Yep, there's the cursory romance. I appreciate the envelope-pushing hinted by the premise, encouragement to challenge the status quo if you find it unjust, but the film's conviction to see that message through adversity seems shaky at best. Even Eddie Murphy's comic relief side character, the aforementioned cat-sized dragon, doesn't get much to do.The ideas are good, the animation is top-notch, the music is tolerable, but the big picture stuff is half-baked and the window-dressings are shockingly bland.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

The invocations/prayers to the ancestors, the burning of incense in their shrine, the calling forth of the guardians, the immobile face of the Emperor before the Hun leader(though he was at death's door)honor above all.  The dialogue and one liners were actually dramatic and memorable in these scenes.""Though the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow before it"" ""A girl like that does not happen every dynasty""But the music really brought this  picture alive; I'll make a man out of you is one of my favourites soundtracks ranking second to Let The River Run (Working Girl OST).

Very good... maybe the Disney boost?,"This is one of the best Disney pictures from ""The Little Mermaid"". It seems that they have realised that their public is not only còmposed by children and that the animation genre does not necessarily be musical to death. With only four songs -rather good, but not as breathtaking as before- and a BEAUTIFUL score from Jerry Goldsmith, it has some important differences from the former Disney structure. There is no love story, but some real social revindication -the girl is not looking forward to finding a man to marry to and have children. The plot is well balanced showing both crude real-life scenes and good gags.Maybe the Disney boost? Since ""The Lion King"", nothing really remarkable was made...

Disney gets a little provocative.,"This is one of the best Disney films of the last several years.  Although it does mostly conform to recent Disney formula with the goofy little sidekick, beautiful hero and heroine, evil nemesis, and use of magic, it is unique in several ways.  First off, this is not a musical per se.  I believe there are only 3 or 4 songs and none in the second half, so we are given more opportunity to enjoy the characters and story.  Mulan is not all that original a character, yet her historic magnitude and awkward charm make her more interesting than most of her predecessors.  The intensity of the narrative is also more compelling than most of the vain and selfish interests of previous Disney tales (e.g. Arial's and the Beast's desire to be human, or Jasmine's and Quasi's want for a sensitive mate.)  This tale is true selfless heroics; defending one's nation from apparent Juggernauts. Although the Huns lack the colorful persona's of their predecessors, they are terrifying antagonists more in the vein of Warner Brothers *The Secret of Nymh* and *Anastasia* rather than Disney.  The artwork is quite daring, in that the animators tone-down the overwhelming colors and spectacular backdrops we are used to, and go for more bleak and austere landscapes, foreboding settings, and compelling virtual camera angles and framing, all of which enhance rather than distract us from the film's focus.",,Anonymous,Animation

An awesome Disney movie for so many reasons ...,"Finally, Disney has a great feminist character! Disney has created a beautifully artistic and cultural movie, with an excellent story, in the form of Mulan.The story: Mulan is a young Chinese girl preparing for a life as a housewife, but she knows she's far too strong-minded to be something as menial as that. When the Huns invade China, her father (the only male in the household), is selected to fight in the army, despite the fact he has old wounds that prevent him from fighting properly. Determined to save her father, Mulan disguises herself as a man and takes his place in the army.This movie has been a personal favorite of mine ever since I saw it when I was a little girl. Since I watched it, Mulan has constantly been a role model of mine: she is a girl who's brave, who will do anything for her family, a girl who dares to be different, and a girl who dares to follow her dreams, and her heart.But the character of Mulan isn't the only awesome thing about this movie. The other characters are excellent and not at all one-dimensional. Eddie Murphy - who voices the tiny, jive-talking dragon Mushu - is hilarious most of the time. Shan-Yu has to be one of the best villains Disney has created in a long time. Shang is interesting, but is possibly the weakest, least-developed character of all.The music is wonderful, the battle scenes are epic, the song items don't interfere with the story at all, and the detail is beautiful. My only complaint is that it could have been a bit longer. I would have liked some more development within the story and with the separate characters.Nonetheless, an awesome Disney movie!8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Disneyfication of a Chinese Legend,"The animation of Mulan is what you would expect from Disney adapting a Chinese legend - i.e. being a film that features cute animal sidekicks and kid-friendly humour.Mulan has a positive message about a girl who wants to save her father's life from being conscripted and ends up becoming the saviour of China. There is the growth of her relationship with her war comrades see her as a liability and ends up loving her. There were powerful moments like when Mulan's father accepts his conscription papers and practices with his sword despite being frail health. ""I'll Make a Man out of You"" was a great musical number.But the film does not stand up as well against some of the other films from the Disney Renaissance because it relied more on slapstick humour than some of the other films from the period.It is an enjoyable but minor offering from the House of Mouse.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Maybe I just wanted to look in the mirror and see someone worthwhile...,"Mulan...so much bravery and courage in this name.
As for me Mulan is one of the best Disney's movie and I can explain why :)
1. The Plot. Watching this animated movie we get a real combo: travelling to China, history points, relationship and respect in Oriental culture. We have an opportunity to get closer to the idea of ancestry's veneration, a guardian spirit of a family, women's position in society etc. So, from this prospective Mulan is quite informative.
2. The cartoon is absolutely neutral and can be highly appreciated by any age and gender. It's cute but not too romantic; it's funny but not cheesy.
3. The Characters. They are awesome here. Decisive Mulan, role-model Li Shang, fussy Mushu, jolly Granny and etc. It's extremely difficult not to take a great fancy to them, as all of them have nice personality and life values (except Shan Yu and his co., definitely)
4. The Songs. They are amazing here, with nice lyrics covered with a light flavour of oriental melodies.To recap, 'Mulan' is worth watching as it can inspire you, push you to call your parents a bit oftener and just help you feel revitalised in the presence of a vivacious soul of your personal dragon.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of Disney's finest stories,"I saw this for the first time two nights ago, 5 years after its release in theaters.

The lyrics are just as awesome an accomplishment as the melody of the song. The animation on Mulan and the Captain of the Imperial army was very lifelike. I could actually picture what the people might look like in real life. That's a first for me with a Disney animated feature. I was very impressed.The only possible flaw I saw in this movie, not being an expert in East Asian culture, but knowing a little, is the way Mulan's family behaved when she returned from running away, even though they knew where she'd gone and what she'd done.

"One of the best animated movies ever. A ""Best Picture"" movie epic made as an animated feature.","My Take: Yet another Disney classic. Impressively animated and beautifully told.Epics have always been one of Hollywood's most regular films during the golden age of film making. Epics are done in very high budgets, and at the time, one of the most astonishing. Another powerful Hollywood genre, is animation. It was powerful as well, that it earned an award slot in the Academy Awards (""Best Animated Feature"").What's great about ""Mulan"" is that it combines these to staples in Hollywood in one very satisfying movie. The film is based, as I've heard, on a poem about a typical village girl who, in favor of his father, joins the Imperial army on resent against the invading Huns. Disgused as a man named Ping, Mulan sets on an incredible journey, and finds herself changing the course of history forever. This movie interests me for the fact that it is done in great skill, as if the producers were making a live-action epic. The films moments of war matches the very moments of those on big-screen live-action epics. The score by Jerry Goldsmith, one of my favorite composers of all time, gives his best by providing the music, and of course it was great. But when Goldsmith scored this, he wasn't focusing on an animated movie score, but as if he was scoring, perhaps, a David Lean epic.""Mulan"" has always been one of my favorite animated movies. Perhaps, it may just be one of the best animated movies ever. A ""Best Picture"" movie epic made as an animated feature. If David Lean were to make an epic and threw in some first-rate musical numbers in, it would have been somewhere akin to MULAN.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Dragon!,"Coming out at the end of the Disney renaissance and after a small string of films with a more mixed reception, Mulan can be seen as the film that called back to the earlier films of this period. It took a simple yet interesting premise and gave it plenty of emotional heft as well as comedy in an attempt to reconnect with a general audience. For the most part it is successful in achieving what its original aim with even a little extra added because of its more cultural and historical basis. Though it is by no means amongst Disney's strongest works, it is a very well made and frequently enjoyable piece.The story of Mulan is loosely based on the Chinese legend of the same name. It sees the Huns invade ancient China and the man of every house must join the army. Because Mulan's father is too ill to fight she takes his place and must impersonate a man or face the death penalty if found out. This is a very good premise and an area Disney has only really touched on before, with the themes of fighting for your country and war. It gives us something Disney enjoy which is a main character fighting against adversity and here it's in more ways than one. It also successfully walks the fine line between seriousness and comedic, balancing both out effectively within the story.Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) isn't that interesting yet she is meant to be a normal person thrown into a crazy situation and for that she's just fine, she is likable and does get plenty of comedic moments. The army men, including the likes of Yao and Ling, are amongst the best things here. They all have distinct personalities and provide a number of laughs, whenever they're on screen its always funny. Li Shang is just okay and doesn't have much development, but he is heroic and easy to route for on the whole. Chi-Fu is a good snobbish character and James Hong is always enjoyable. I'm not a big fan of Mulan's dragon aid Mushu and think his more self-aware comedic stylings don't fit the film at all, Eddie Murphy provides a lot of energy but it just doesn't work for me.The animation is really impressive. It is very smooth and scenic for the most part, while managing to get across the beauty of China. When I think of the film I think of a lot of wilderness and mountains which always look picturesque throughout. The scenes showing the vast army of the Huns are very striking too. It also perfectly lent itself to the comic scenes and allowed for some amusing slapstick. The situation comedy is a highlight. Mulan's interactions with her fellow troops are usually hilarious and the comedy flows very naturally as a result, most of it is timeless slapstick or smart wordplay as she tries to hide her identity and fit in. The action scenes are good too. There is a genuine tension to the battle scenes and the film manages to convey just how big they are.It isn't all without issue however. Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) is such a dull villain. Apart from an intimidating design there is absolutely nothing of note about him. I can't recall a line of his dialogue or any actions of his. He shows up to fight and that's effectively it, he has next to no development. The music isn't that good either. None of the songs featured where memorable and most of them didn't really fit the scenes that they were playing over. Jerry Goldsmith's score is serviceable, but again it's just a touch forgettable overall. We don't get as much of a look at the Chinese culture as I'd have liked either, but then that isn't really the films focus.Mulan is another very entertaining Disney film. It doesn't go as serious with the story as it could have done or try anything new with it, but what it does do it does very well. The animation is excellent, the story is something a bit different and the situational comedy was a lot of fun. Of course some characters are a bit unbalanced, the villain is extremely weak and the songs are forgettable. Yet none of these issues truly harm the rest of the enough to damage it as a whole. It is nearly always engaging and delivers more than enough amusement throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great movie that entertains with honor.,"This was a very interesting direction Disney went in terms of storytelling with their classic charm. Based on an actual Chinese story, Mulan is unlike anything the filmmakers of Disney ever created.Mulan herself is very unique compared to most women from the Disney universe. She's no princess or pretty girl wanting more or waiting for a happy ending, instead she's a bit of a social outcast stuck in the traditional family norm the Chinese had with women at the time who just wishes to be herself and prove that she's no obedient little housewife-to-be. Mulan takes a big risk and ends up becoming the heroine China needs to save them from the crafty and ruthless Shan Yu, who leads the invading Huns.All the other characters are a true delight. Mushu (Eddie Murphy), Mulan's guardian dragon, is a hilarious character who proves to quite helpful on certain occasions and brings much of the comedy into the film. Captain Shang is tough and determined, but even he has his insecurities, which makes him a unique love interest to Mulan. The villain Shan Yu is not someone to be trifled with or underestimated because he's cold, calculating, and powerful as heck. The trio (Yau, Ling, and Chien-Po) are really fun to watch as they hilariously interact with other characters such as Mulan, Chi-Fu, and even each other.This movie has the perfect blend of amazing art design, epic action scenes, wonderful music that complements the various scenes, memorable songs, great comedy, intricate storytelling, flawless animation, and excellent themes. The filmmakers must have really pushed themselves to make this into an awesome and unique edition to the Disney franchise and they weren't too afraid to get a little dark and make the situations the characters are going through as real and sometimes as dangerous as possible, both the menacing Huns and their own somewhat strict social traditions.Overall, this is indeed a rare flower that blooms the most beautifully. I consider this to be one of the greatest Disney films ever made, if not the best. It is highly recommended that you check this movie out and marvel at the cultural and cinematic wonder that is Mulan.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great film but a little anticlimactic!,"Mulan (1998) follows a woman who disguises herself as a man in order to fight for her country. This is a fun and easy to digest film with a lot of heart! Mulan is a great character and very original. I do find it a bit anticlimactic at the end, but it's nothing too bad.The animation is great and really holds up to today's standards, with a broad range in colour palettes that result in some very pretty shots! The movie is incredibly eye-catching and a very pleasant visual experience.The movie has some quality sound mixing, and a very iconic soundtrack. The songs are extremely well written and catchy, and the original score adds to the overall feel of the film. The sound design itself is alright but nothing notable.All the voice acting is great, and I really like the character progression. Mulan is a very loveable character and is easy to sympathise with, and Eddie Murphy is hilarious as Mushu! My main criticism with the characters would be the villain, I feel he needed more screen time in order to establish him as a real threat.The film is fast paced but fleshes the story out well, and follows a basic and clear structure. It's an entertaining watch with some fairly high tension, however I feel the final act lets it down a little. It feels quite rushed and would've benefit from being longer.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awful,"This has to be the worst Disney movie I have ever seen. It had absolutely nothing to make it stand out.1) Many of the characters had little personality and you didn't find yourself drawn to them as you would with the Genie or Woody. That little dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy was atrocious!2) I didn't like any of the songs, they were definitely not up to scratch. Whatever happened to the wonderful Disney music?3) It irritated me that Disney just put in anything remotely Chinese looking in the animation(e.g. Chinese symbols everywhere)There's got to be more to China than that!4) I didn't get that warm Disney feeling inside me when it finished. All in all, this is a very under-developed movie. Not one of the worst ever made. I'm told it flopped anyway. 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Straight-forward and Thoroughly Entertaining,"Lately, I have been watching more and more Disney classics, with a marathon coming up soon. This is the first time I've watched Mulan, and I can't help but be extremely excited about it. It follows the classic hero journey, but with enough flair, humour, and girl power that I could not not fall in love with it. Especially Eddie Murphie as the voice of Mushu is hilarious. The Disney classics might not be the most narratively intriguing films, but oh my, are they entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's only 87 minutes of great adventure.,"From my generation, I'd like to say one thing.
This is Disney!
I knew the main plot of the story and I felt the time before the main character go on her big adventure was very long. I wondered if it was OK to be so slow in only 87 minute films. But my afraid was unfounded. It looked like it was redundant at the beginning, but the whole thing was very well balanced. Each episode wasn't too elaborate. Rather, it looks like a shoddy job. But I think it was really an elaborate script. ... She did a great adventure that I felt at the last scene. The Chinese 2009 version of Mulan was also a masterpiece, and I thought this one was as good as that. I thought Zootopia was interesting and I like The Incredible Family. And even compared to those, I thought this Mulan was just as good. Other than Cinderella and Peter Pan and other works of yesteryear, maybe this is the best one.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Movie!,"MULAN is a great movie which has many memorable characters and impressive scenes. The main character of this movie is an ancient Chinese girl who fights for her company instead of her old father, but it also has many interesting supportive characters. In particular, I like Mushu, a tiny dragon who travels with Mulan. He and two other animal characters---a cricket and a horse---make this serious story funny and enjoyable. their humor helps Mulan a lot to encounter a lot of difficulties and get over them. Mulan's brave behaviors encouraged me a lot. At the same time, Mushu's funny jokes entertained me a lot. I was moved many times and I also laughed over and over again when I saw this movie. Its music is also wonderful. In this movie, I enjoyed many grand, gentle, beautiful and pleasant scores. As a music-major student, I highly evaluate these scores. I love this movie and recommend it for many persons!",,Anonymous,Animation

Different kind of Disney Princess,"In a Chinese family with no male children, daughter disguises herself as a male and goes to war against Huns instead of her elderly father. Hilarious Eddie Murphy lends his voice to her sidekick, a clumsy little red dragon. The story is interesting, with lots of Disney humor, but also a good message. Essentially, this is ""coming of age"" and ""women empowerment"" drama, but shown in a typical Disney way, to the extent that even this girl warrior can be classified among the Disney Princesses. I had the impression that someone forced them to make a ""women empowerment"" movie, and then they did their best to disguise it as much as possible. I know that Disney movies are primarily intended for children, but still I think they banalized it too much. Also, I did not like the animation, but the music is excellent. Overall, a pretty good movie and a big step out of the comfort zone for Disney.7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"It was okay, I guess","Although I have a strong dislike for DisneyCorp, I have to admit Mulan is, for the most part, watchable.For the protagonist, we have a liberated 90's girl transplanted into ancient china.

Much better than I Expected... Especially 'Donkey'...,"I don't watch many Disney films these days, I've probably outgrown many of them, but I took an exception in this case. It had been recommended to me and so I thought I'd give it a look when it came up on TV recently. I was pleasantly surprised, a strong story, some nice animation and a few decent songs thrown in not too shabby. I'll give you my more detailed thoughts after this brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please go training with the army while I write the next paragraph).Mulan is a spirited girl who, having failed to make an impression with the matchmaker, is looking for some other way of bringing honour to her family. China has been invaded by the Huns, lead by the very tough and evil, Shan Yu. An army is being raised by the Emperor and Mulan's father, Fa Zhou, is chosen as one of the conscripts from their village, but he was injured fighting for the Emperor before. He insists he will go, but Mulan has other ideas. Stealing his armour and his sword and taking her horse, Khan, she sets off to join the army in his place, hoping she can pass herself off as a man. The penalty, if she's discovered, is death. To help her on this quest, the family ancestors, inadvertently, send Mushu, a small dragon with ambitions to improve his position. A lucky cricket, Cri-Kee, also comes along on the adventure. The soldiers are led by Captain Li Shang, the son of a General and a very handsome man. Calling herself Ping, Mulan is befriended by three soldiers, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po, but can she pull off this charade and will she bring honour to her family? Well, you probably guessed it, I'm not going to tell you here, those Spoiler Police will be after me if I do.I found this film surprisingly good, some great animation, a really good story and some pretty good songs along the way. The only let-down (for me) was the inclusion of the voice of Eddie Murphy as Mushu. Whenever I hear him now I think of 'Donkey' from the Shrek films. Don't get me wrong, he has some great lines and does his stuff very well, but I just kept seeing 'Donkey' in my mind's eye. The film started very strongly with a nice set-up and it was looking good until the 'comic relief' is brought in ('Donkey'). It's then a struggle for the narrative, which is very good by the way, to fight its way past the comic japes of 'Donkey'. Fortunately, it does and we end up with a pretty good film that's entertaining, funny (thanks 'Donkey') and, at times, quite dramatic.Decent performances all round, Ming-Na did a good job as the voice of Mulan, ably backed up by Lea Salonga who did the singing parts for the character. B.D. Wong did a nice job as Li Shang with Donny Osmond doing the singing parts. The voice that really stood out (for me apart from 'Donkey') though was Miguel Ferrer as the voice of the evil Shan-Yu, he was really menacing and made you believe in the character. Honourable mentions go to the voices of; Harvey Fierstein as Yao, Gedde Watanabe as Ling and Jerry Tondo as Chien-Po. I would also like to mention George Takei who had a nice little cameo as the voice of the First Ancestor.Over all a pretty enjoyable film with lots to admire. The animation of the scene where the Huns are attacking down a snow-covered hill is quite spectacular. Would I watch it again? Yes, I didn't find 'Donkey' all that bad at the end of the day, and, who knows? I may even see him as a small Chinese dragon one day Recommended.My Score 7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney has done it again with honor,"Mulan is the 9th film in the Disney Renaissance series after watching it again after so long I found it to be a honorable film despite some things that I didn't enjoy about the filmThe plot centers around the legend of Mulan in China Ming-Na Wen voices Mulan and I really did enjoy her performance as the lead protagonist. Mulan is also guided by Mushu (Voiced by Eddie Murphy) and Cri-Kee (Voiced by Frank Welker)The other cast of characters we get Captain Li Shang (Voiced by BD Wong) as the second protagonist the main antagonist is Shan Yu (voiced by Miguel Ferrer) with the rest of the cast beingHarvey Fierstein as the voice of Yao Gedde Watanabe as the voice of Ling Jerry Tondo as the voice of Chien-Po James Hong as the voice of Chi-Fu Soon-Tek Oh as the voice of Fa Zhou June Foray as as the voice of Grandmother Fa Pat Morita as the voice of The Emperor of ChinaI have to say the visuals here are top notch Disney can almost always be counted on for having such amazing visuals and Mulan is no different. To match the visuals is the animation which is well done I always enjoy hand drawn animation it really gives you respect for the art work in this film plus how the artist study the landscape of China.The voice acting is very good and there is a lot of passion in the cast performances. The music is just superb which helps to tell the story. And of course we have the songs the best song to me is ""I'll make a man out of you"".The film had some moments that could have been do without but still Mulan does offer a lot of good to outweigh the badOverall Mulan is just a enjoyable movie with a strong female hero.With strong animation very good voice work and amazing visuals this would be the film for you.I give Mulan a 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney Animation mixes the legend of Chinese folk hero Mulan with elements of Twelfth Night and Stripes to make an enjoyable comic adventure.,"In ancient China, Fa Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) is the adventurous and free spirited daughter of the Fa family who doesn't fit into to her expected role and following a disastrous meeting with the matchmaker is torn between being her true self and ""bringing her family honor"". When the Huns lead by Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) invade China, the Emperor (Pat Morita) sends out a conscription order deeming that one man from every family must join the imperial army, this includes the Fa family which has no male heirs so Mulan's infirm father Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) must join despite Mulan's objections. Mulan seeking to save her father's life disguises herself as a man by cutting her hair and taking her father's armor intent on joining the imperial army. Mulan's ancestors learning of Mulan's actions decide to send a family guardian to retrieve her, but after demoted guardian diminutive dragon Mushu (Eddie Murphy) accidently destroys the guardian instead of awaking it, he goes in its place intent on making Mulan a war hero to regain his lost prestige. Mulan enlists under the command of Captain Li Shang (BD Wong) with Mushu's help under the name of Fa Peng and prepares to face the Huns despite faltering at nuances in being a man.Mulan was the 36th film to be released by Walt Disney Animation and is a loose adaptation of the ""Ballad of Hua Mulan"". The movie began development in the mid-90s with animators Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft directing the project after previously having worked on projects such as Roger Rabbit shorts or animating the Gargoyles from Hunchback of Notre Dame. The movie while originally conceived as a ""Tootsie-like"" romantic comedy, Chris Saunders who joined the production grew frustrated with this aspect and urged the film to be more faithful to the original legend. The movie was an improvement box office wise from the previous year's Hercules while still not matching the heights of earlier Disney Renaissance films, but Mulan has created an enduring legacy for itself with many who grew up with the film fondly remembering it for its songs, character, and story with Mulan even becoming an official Disney Princess despite her character not being royalty by marriage or birth. You can also see how the benefit of hindsight the story could be interpreted as having a slight LGBTQ subtext as well as satirical skewering of gender roles which has also helped endear the film across multiple generations.Much like previous female Disney heroines, Mulan does fall under the umbrella of characters who ""dream of more"" and struggle with their own wishes weighed against the expectations of their family, community, and society. While that story was very much the bread and butter of the Disney Renaissance, Mulan does give it a unique spin so it's allowed some more leeway as to how it approaches that story and with its mixture of farcical humor and historical action epic Mulan does lend itself to some pretty creative sequences. Mulan takes a more humorous focus to its story similar to how Hercules also added a humorous slant to its own story, but unlike Hercules which put the humor and references very much at the forefront trying to recapture the manic energy of Aladdin's The Genie in every other scene, Mulan still feels like it's relatively grounded in its time and place of its story with the humor coming more from character than references or exaggerated craziness. Mulan's humor comes from two main sources: 1) Mulan trying to act like a man and 2) The misfits in the army and luckily for Mulan both work quite well and are extremely funny making the film a mashup of the gender swapped shenanigans seen in something like Twelfth Night mixed by way of Ivan Reitman's military comedy Stripes that works quite well. Eddie Murphy as Mushu the dragon while undeniably an attempt to recapture Robin Williams' Genie is at least funny (unlike the Gargoyles from Hunchback) and allowed to be his own thing. Eddie Murphy's comic timing is well matched against the animation and not only are there quite a few funny moments from him, but also some solid emotional moments between him and Mulan.Despite Mulan's primary focus on comedy and humor, the movie does also allow itself for moments of drama with the song ""Reflection"" serving as a solid character piece for Mulan as well as establishing the film's core theme but aside from moments like that we also get a good share of moments based in silence or atmosphere such as the wordless montage where Mulan disguises herself as a man or the Tung Shao Pass village scene which is an absolutely haunting piece of animation. There's some truly epic scenes in Mulan that build themselves on the same crowd rendering software that was used in The Hunchback of Notre Dame and what was already impressive there is made even more so with dynamic movements added such as the sheer enormity of the Hun Army in one of the more elaborate action beats of the film. This brings us to what's probably the weakest part of the film which is the villain Shan Yu. While Shan Yu is serviceable as an antagonist he's not really as much a character as he is a force of nature, unlike previous Disney villains there's nothing all that much that stands out from him with him basically just wanted to show how strong he is being the end all be all of his motivations and he doesn't have much of a personality besides fighting and pillaging.Mulan is a solid piece of animation from the Disney Renaissance and gives us a heroine who's undeniably familial, but frames it in a unique way that makes us care about the characters and story with both humor and legitimate pathos. While more focused on humor than pathos the movie still finds ways of doing both reasonably well and making both Mulan and the army likable and endearing characters we grow to care about. Some elements such as a rather uninteresting villain hold the film back from greatness but there's a reason Mulan is a favorite of so many who grew up with it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Could be Disney's best offering, ever","We are introduced to the title character almost immediately in this movie. She is Mulan, an awkward Chinese girl that is trying to learn what tradition dictates a Chinese woman learn. It becomes quite clear that Mulan will never be a traditional lady, even with the help of a lucky cricket given to her by her grandmother. The family has no time to recover from Mulan's failure as the Huns are invading and the Emperor decrees that each village must offer up a man from each family to fight. Being the only man in their family, Mulan's father accepts the calling, despite being a cripple. Fearing that her father will not survive, Mulan steals off in the dead of night and enlists in her father's stead. Unbeknownst to Mulan, her ancestors send a guardian to protect her. What she ends up getting is Mushu, a disgraced dragon and Crickey, the ""lucky"" cricket. Together they must work to save her lie, for discovery means death. Can Mulan help save China and defeat the Huns?Though the setting of this movie is not one with which Americans can relate, the message surely is, that women can become anything they want. What I love about this movie is this fact is not crammed down your throat as it oft is with movies that have come out since. In fact, unlike many of the feminists in newer movies, you find yourself rooting for Mulan from the very beginning. This movie does a lot for female empowerment without emasculating men in the process. Having Eddie Murphy voice Mushu was the icing on the cake. I am a straight, white man, and I absolutely love this movie and watch it probably more often than I should.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Let's get down to business...,"'Mulan (1998)' follows a young woman who pretends to be a man in order to take her disabled father's place in the army when the emperor conscripts one man from every household to fight the incoming Huns. The protagonist is certainly one of Disney's most capable (and most lethal), taking matters into her own hands and often saving those who would otherwise look down on her. There are very few instances where she herself is saved by anyone, let alone a man, and this reinforces the film's underlying theme of gender equality. Indeed, the flick is soaked in the sort of genuine female empowerment that ought to be present in a lot more movies. It's good stuff, especially considering its age, and it stands out as one of Disney's best, most progressive efforts. It's also just entertaining throughout, with engaging characters and exciting set-pieces. Its highlight is probably a training montage set to the tune of 'I'll Make A Man Out Of You', which is an absolute banger of a song that's sure to get stuck in your head (seriously, it's got to be one of the best Disney songs of all time). Overall, the picture is really entertaining. It's an enjoyable, engaging experience with a distinct setting and a strong central character. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

excellent movie
I first saw this movie as a little kid, but I still enjoy it now that i'm 22. I consider this to be one of the first GOOD movies to come out of that greedy capitalist hellhole called Disney in years. Some of the arguments against it have been ridiculous.""It's racist!"" Oh come on people, it's supposed to be and adventure/war movie, not a remake of Ghandi! The Huns are bad, the Chinese are good because that's how it was in the ancient legend. A movie like this is not supposed to put political correctness before entertainment.""It's discriminating against men!"" Lighten up, please. I'm a guy and I wasn't offended by this. It's from Mulan's perspective, and I think it's safe to say she was somewhat prejudiced. Besides, Shang was cool. There was nothing wrong with him.""It's too violent!"" I hate to break it to you, but war happens. Yes, there are fields of bodies. Yes, the bad guys kill people. Yes, it might scare little kids. But seriously, the evening news is way more violent. These things happen, and if your kids never know about it then they're going to be pretty freaked out when they first encounter the real world.In short, Mulan is a great movie for anybody who doesn't want they're kids to live in a bubble. It's got action, romance, friendship, the whole works, and would have been great even if it wasn't animated.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It looks great,"""Mulan"" always seemed like the more interesting of The Mouse's late-'90s output; certainly the cast is first-rate, and I do really like the animation style - but it also features an array of subpar songs in a Disney flick. Seriously, you have Lea Salonga and you waste her talents on these?But despite the lame villain and some of the ineffective comedic elements (including a pre-Donkey Eddie Murphy) this was a hit with the real target audience; my kid really liked this, and I enjoyed this much more through her eyes than I would've alone.

A Disney classic...,"The 1998 animated movie ""Mulan"" from Disney is definitely one of my personal favorites in the Disney catalog. And that is because of combination of the storyline and the dragon Mushu.The storyline told in ""Mulan"" is very enjoyable and it is one that easily draws in the audience and takes them along on an action-packed adventure. The story is brought to life by some enjoyable and memorable characters, which definitely helps to spruce things up.The voice acting in ""Mulan"" is good, and they had some nice talents on the list for the various characters. With the likes of Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy, BD Wong, Miguel Ferrer, James Hong, Miriam Margolyes, Pat Morita, Marni Nixon, George Takei and many others.Visually then I will say that ""Mulan"" is also good. The art style is definitely memorable, in the way that the artists made everything prominent and sort of very edged. Personally I would have like a more classic art, similar to that used in ""The Little Mermaid"" for example. But of course it is a matter of personal preference, and the art style used in ""Mulan"" definitely made it outstanding and memorable.Directors Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook put together an animated movie back in 1998 that is very suitable for the family and viewers of all ages, as there is something for everyone to enjoy here.My rating of ""Mulan"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

My favorite Walt Disney animation,"There are some films you remember the exact day that you watched them for the first time because they had such an influence on you. I am certainly one of the people that enjoyed Mulan to a fuller extent than those who still thought it was great, because I think it is near perfect. The first time I watched Mulan I was simply overwhelmed by how much I fell in love with the heartwarming story, strong character of Mulan and the musical numbers. I still remember the place and time, and how I felt.Of course, what is to be expected of Walt Disney animations? Most all of them offer some form of entertainment or positive influence on the viewers and have now for ages. The Disney renaissance was well needed and brought along a handful of lovable new installments. Mulan is just a film that I got carried away from beginning to end. My favorite scenes are the Match Maker, river and climax scenes. I also find the quote, ""The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all,"" to be one of my many favorite quotes that are out there.Anyway, if you were let down by Mulan, I strongly suggest giving it one more go. I teared up, chuckled and smiled through most of the movie and it was because it is an extremely well done animation that is probably my favorite of the Walt Disney classics and masterpieces line or even animation film in general. I really do love it that much.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great for kids and Adults!,"Whether it's Disney's best work or not is really not the point. Kids and adults will love this movie for the great story and use of color/backgrounds in the movie. Nice effects with movement/fight scenes and I enjoy the music as well. This is usually one of the first movies that my daughter and I pick out together on our movie night. I am excited for the second one to come out in the theater to continue the story. I think Disney overall does a great job and is an excellent movie for any collection, young or old. This will be a Disney classic someday due to great graphics and storyline. I don't know why anyone wouldn't enjoy it. Have fun, sit back and watch it some night!",,Anonymous,Animation
Lovely family fun!,"This is your standard Disney Princess movie, however the role the ""Princess"" plays is different compared to a lot of the films that came before.Mulan is not a helpless girl waiting for a man to save her, although that line is still shown by her inability to find herself a man to marry. Mulan takes on her Fathers responsibility and goes to fight the Huns who are invading China, demonstrating in the process she is more than capable of looking after herself (in disguise as a boy) as well as saving her fellow soldiers!It is very easy watching and isn't as Sing-Song as some other Disney films, although of course singing does still take place. The voice casting is excellent with Eddie Murphy as the dragon Mushu being a stand out. It's essentially his audition for Donkey in Shrek!The animation as you would expect is too notch. I'd happily watch this one again with the family anytime soon!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Truly great except for ONE thing ...,"The depth of talent at Disney is frightening.  It's interesting the character animation here with that in ""The Prince of Egypt"" - no contest at all.  Every character in ""Mulan"" is well, brilliantly, perfectly animated, and many great animators at Disney didn't even touch the project.  A writer here who said that the animation ""lacks detail"" merely betrays his (her?) ignorance.  One must distinguish between character design and animation: the former is what a still drawing of a character displays, the latter is the art of moving a character around.  The animation was full of detail.  I felt that every one of the 24-per-second frames conveyed something of value. The character design, on the other hand, *was* deliberately simplified, but I don't see how anyone could deny that this approach was both beautiful and fitting; and since everything (backgrounds and effects animation) had the same stylistic simplicity, the characters were more solidly in place than they usually are in animation.(The effects animation was creative and also streets ahead of ""The Prince of Egypt"".  As was the use of computers.  Watch the Great Wall scene closely: you might be able to *deduce* that computers were involved, but you certainly won't feel that they were.  Computer imagery has been misused with ghastly results in everything from ""Aladdin"" to ""The Phantom Menace"". Finally someone has it right.)I won't comment on the story - I'm still moved by it, but then I'm a sucker for that kind of thing.  I'll get to my one complaint.  It's not the music. Yes, the music was ultra-1980s with the odd pentatonic scale; but that's not intrinsically worse than being ultra-1990s with the odd pentatonic scale, and it has the advantage that we know immediately the worst about how dated it will sound (less dated than you'd expect).  No: my problem is Eddie Murphy.  He is painfully unfunny and his introduction made me sigh wearily. He doesn't belong here.  I don't have anything against comic relief, but Disney should have trusted their animators to provide it.  When Mushu is funny, it's the animators' doing - and on those occasions the humour is not at odds with the story.That one criticism pains me to make.  Swallowing ""Mulan"" whole, Eddie Murphy and all, it's still a fine movie and a reason for optimism about the future of hand-drawn animation.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just one of hundreds of reasons to watch a Disney movie.,"It'll be hard not to recommend any movie from the folks at Disney, be it a vintage classic or cartoon minus the recent stinkers. MULAN shows what the Mickey Mouse cartoonists can do with a setting where samurai warriors and concubines rule. It's been practical as always to show off familiar renderings of hand drawn art just as with past animated films, and can remain timeless in years to come. As long as stylish techniques apply the basics (like THE PRINCE OF EGYPT), the flat 2-D cartoon film will stick around longer. Even more, you can notice the 3-D effects that stand out as realistic. How many warriors on galloping horseback can you spot? With this being mentioned, it isn't stunning anymore once you saw THE LION KING for the first time. That one was incredible in detail. The story of our young mistress becoming a bold fighter in disguise to bring back peace and family honor is astounding for a Disney creation, and sounds like a step above previous summer efforts. Still, it's another kid's tale filled with the usual instances of comedy relief and sing-along songs that remain a pure delight by Disney's trademark standards, but remember that grown-ups will appreciate the entertainment too. You can't beat the Magic Kingdom for delivering wholesome quality ""family"" fare. MULAN is another excuse to be satisfied with Disney's tradition of excellence. The world can be a better place to live, if you just feed the kids a huge Disney video collection. But that's good, right?",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's best!!!,"Mulan is one of the best Disney animated movies. This movie has everything. A love story,laughs,dragons,singing and violence.Like most of the Disney animated movies this does have singing. But don't worry its not bad songs. It comes up close behind the little mermaids songs.This had great voice acting. Especially from Eddie Murphy. He had me in stitches. He had great lines also. All the others were great too.The thing i loved about this was the action and the fact that they got away with a G rating. Considering the violence.I highly recommend this. One of my favorite animated movies. They obviously put a lot of work into this and it is defiantly worth watching. This is Pixar quality. I give Mulan a solid....10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great Disney movie, but not up there with the best","During the 1990's, it seemed that every year or so The Walt Disney Company would come out with a new animated masterpiece. After the breathtaking ""The Lion King"" in 1995, the quality of the films decreased, with ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" ""Hercules,"" and, their worst feature (although ""worst"" is a relative term), ""Pocahantas."" With ""Mulan,"" that trend was reversed (though the legacy of hand-drawn animation came to an end with the dawning of Pixar), at least temporarily (I haven't seen ""Home on the Range,"" though it bombed at the box-office, ending the legacy).While ""Mulan"" may have reversed the trend, it fails to match up with Disney's undisputed masterpieces. That being said, it comes close. The animation is astonishing (though the human figures are not as beautifully rendered as in ""Beauty and the Beast""). It features a number of standout songs, and a few hilarious sequences. The voice characterizations are solid, with Disney making the right decision to use voices that work the best, and not those who are the most famous. The villain is vicious, but doesn't top ""Aladdin's"" Jafar. In short, ""Mulan"" is very good, but not the best.During Imperial China, the villainous Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army of Huns has crossed the Great Wall of China and is moving towards the Forbidden City, destroying everything in their path. The Emperor (Pat Morita) orders that one man from every family must serve in the army against Shan-Yu. This poses a problem for the Fa family. They don't have any sons, which leaves the ailing patriarch, Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) to serve. However, his daughter Mulan (Ming-Na/Lea Salonga) knows that he cannot fight, so she poses as a boy and goes in his place.""Mulan"" covers a lot of issues, none of which are taken TOO seriously: cross-dressing (how neither the MPAA nor the social conservatives have a fit about this being in a family movie is beyond me), honor (not quite taken to a stereotype), feminism, conscription, the nature of identity, and so on. Nevertheless, neither the script nor the directors have any intention of pushing some sort of agenda with these ideas. The only reason why any of these issues are addressed is to tell the story, and that's why this film succeeds.Of all the Disney heroines, Mulan may be the most three-dimensional. She's not the first girl not to be lady-like (that would be Belle from ""Beauty and the Beast""), but she has the most depth. Mulan is more of a tomboy than anything, and that makes her a very interesting character. This is taken seriously (she will be executed if she is caught), and it's also taken for laughs (whenever she tries to act ""manly,"" and a disastrous encounter with the Matchmaker (Miriam Margolyes), which is nothing short of hilarious).The other character that has to be mentioned is Mushu, who is voiced by Eddie Murhpy. A failed guardian, Mushu is demoted to waking up the ancestors and the guardians. After a catastrophe, Mushu finds himself in a peculiar position: if he succeeds in getting Mulan home safely, he may be able to become a guardian again. Internet film critic James Berardinelli likened Mushu to Robin Williams' Genie in ""Aladdin."" While I see the resemblance, I prefer the Genie to Mushu, if only because Williams improvised his lines to better effect. Still, Murphy does great work, and he has a number of hilarious one-liners.There are other great smaller characters as well. The wordless cricket has some great scenes with other characters. The tiny but outrageous Grandmother Fa (June Foray/Marni Nixon) has some hysterical scenes as well. And the three soldiers who become Mulan's friends, Ling (Gedde Watanabe), Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo), and Yao (Harvey Fierstien) serve as more comic relief.""Mulan"" has some problems. Some of the dialogue could have been rewritten, and the difference between Mulan's speaking voice and her singing voice is immediately noticeable. Most noticeable of all is the rather plain look of the people. Disney has a way of drawing the human figures to fit the culture it is portraying (like in ""Hercules"" and ""Pocahantas""). ""Mulan"" is no different, but more work should have gone into them.As it is, though, ""Mulan"" is a lot of fun for both kids and adults.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pure Disney magic,"MULAN, in my opinion, is pure Disney magic. If you ask me, what Mulan (voice of Ming-Na) did was absolutely brave. If my father were in the same situation, I'd probably do the same thing. I really enjoyed the music, especially ""True To Your Heart,"" by 98 Degrees and Stevie Wonder. Also, I was surprised to see that Eddie Murphy was in this as the voice of Mushu. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this film that's pure Disney magic to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Strong woman woohoo,"A simple movie overall, and while it's nothing groundbreaking, it's undeniably enjoyable. The strong and ambitious female protagonist is a breath of fresh air, and the fact that Mulan disguises herself as a man adds a fun, comedic layer to the story. Watching her adapt to her surroundings, learn the ways of battle, and prove her worth as a warrior, beyond the labels of being a woman or a man, is truly inspiring.One of the most emotionally impactful moments for me was her father's reaction at the end. He doesn't care about her glory, achievements, or the honors she brings - he's just happy that she's safe. That sentiment alone elevated the movie for me, showcasing a beautiful father-daughter dynamic that felt raw and genuine.The supporting characters were also incredibly charming. Mushu, the tiny dragon, and Cri-Kee, the lucky cricket, added plenty of humor and heart to the journey. They balanced the seriousness of Mulan's mission with lighthearted moments that kept the story engaging.Then there's Captain Li Shang (I think that's his name, correct me if I'm wrong). What's up with him? The guy absolutely despises Mulan the moment he finds out she's a woman. Even the other soldiers didn't react so strongly, so what was his problem? Was he struggling with the fact that he might have been falling for her as a ""man""? KKKKKK, kidding aside, it's a small quirk that makes his character arc even more interesting to follow.All jokes aside, Mulan is a great watch with heartfelt messages about honor, family, and self-worth. It's funny, empowering, and emotional in all the right ways, making it a classic that holds up even today.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
An unfortunate disappointment,"With all the wealth of Chinese art and history to draw upon, Mulan, in its visual style, looks like 1950s Disney: bland, slick, and bright.  Only the opening title gives any hint of rich beauty of Asian art.  Closer attention to traditional silk painting, scrolls, screens, etc. might have helped lift this one a notch.As it is, its manner of storytelling is only a b-level imitation of other Disney flicks of the late '80s and 'early '90s.  Standard stuff, though Eddie Murphy provides a little (very little) relief.Still, Asian-American kids might (MIGHT) get a kick out of seeing one of their most revered cultural legends come to life onscreen.  For the rest of us, it's slow going, though at least the heroine is not some airhead princess.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Average Disney still rates a classc!,"This is by no means an average Disney effort but like I said,an average Disney still rates as an all time classic.Nobody can beat them in the family/animation genres.What makes this one average as opposed to it having been one of the best was the fact that I found the animations a little rough.They could have made more spectacular background effects.They had ancient China for scenery and that would give them leeway for much more spectacular scenery.I wanted more attention to detail in this area given the animation technology available today.Also,they could have made Mulan a little more stronger looking.More of a stronger look and personality could be done for women without compromising their female qualities.There are many amazon/warrior type gorgeous women and a lot  of them,contrary to stereotipical beliefs,are Asian too.How many chances does Disney have to focus a movie on east Asia.They should have been more responsible wih their portrayal of scenery and people of this great land in this regard.But other than this point,and given how many other things could have gone wrong,Disney once again did a bravo job.Not shying away from exotic cultures and taking on women's rights issues are very commendable and really educate the world's children.The little dragon stole the show too and I was laughing so hard!I forgive the producers regarding the music becouse good musical compositions are very very difficult to come by and you do not just create top quality music any time you want.Great music is very precious and people must realise this fact.So we must appreciate what ever great music we got from this movie(like ""Reflection"").Creatng great music is very spur of the moment and pops up unpredictably.Ask pro composers and they will tell you.But other aspects like visual animation can very much be controlled big time.Particularly now when hand drawn art is backed up by computer animation technologies.Peace out......",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

So far, not one person has mentioned that this is based on a Chinese legend from thousands of years ago.

One of Disney's best,"The legend of Mulan can be traced back through the centuries, and there have been several Chinese films honoring the female warrior who disguised herself as a man while battling the Huns. I've seen a couple of them, but to me, nothing compares to the Disney musical. In my opinion, it's one of the best Disney cartoons ever made. It's a fantastic true story, it has action, tears, laughs, romance, great characters, and beautiful music. It's not too silly for the parents in the audience, and it's not too scary for the kids. And it also educates people on certain Chinese customs, managing to teach culture and history through entertainment.Christina Aguilera immortalized ""Reflection"", and while it is a beautiful song, it's not the only one in the movie. ""Honor to Us All"", the first number, reminds me of the fantastic ""Belle"" opening song from Beauty and the Beast. It shows the townspeople bonding together with common beliefs and expectations, and the heroine is an outsider who hasn't yet found herself. ""Honor to Us All"" educates the audience about Chinese customs at that time by showing the different paths men and women take. How to honor the family: ""Our boys by bearing arms, our girls by bearing sons."" Another lyric shows the expectation of how Mulan should mold herself to fit in with society: ""Men like girls with good taste, calm, obedient, who worked fast-paced. With good breeding and a tiny waist, you'll bring honor to us all.""In the incredibly moving sequence, Mulan decides to honor her family in a different way. Her aged father has been drafted, and to save his life, she cuts her hair and dons his uniform. With her grandmother's lucky cricket and a guardian appointed by the ghosts of her ancestors, she has to disguise herself and blend in with the other male soldiers. There are countless jokes that would undoubtedly provoke riots if they were made today (hence the recent non-musical remake) but they're still funny in my book. The wonderful song ""I'll Make a Man Out of You"" has clever lyrics that aren't meant to be offensive but instead completely tie in with the first number about women's expectations.I could probably write another four paragraphs about how wonderful and moving this Disney movie is, but it would take less time to just watch it again instead. With fantastic voice acting from Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy, BD Wong, Miguel Ferrer, Harvey Fierstein, June Foray, James Hong, George Takei, and a few lines of dialogue from James Shigeta and Pat Morita, lovely stylized animation, and a meaningful message, even if you don't like musicals, you'll find plenty of reasons to love this movie.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Mulan gets woken up by the cricket's ""alarm clock"" her POV shows double vision for a few seconds, and it will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dramatic core undermined by comic sidekicks,"Like ""Pocahontas"" before it, ""Mulan"" is a sumptuously animated adventure made wobbly by its heavy-handed message against sex role stereotyping.  Yes, we learn, women can stretch beyond their social roles, even fight in combat. Yet, the men are depicted either as noble egotists or dolts.  Worse, Eddie Murphy's comic sidekick dragon is an annoyance, no doubt written because every Disney animated feature must now have a recognizable cut-up to aid their heroines.  Still, the Disney storytelling strength is there.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A little more historical precision doesn't harm the box office,"The movie stars the Huns as the bad guys. OK then, let's go ahead. Texts from the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) repeatedly refer to one Xiongnu tribe or tribal confederation that caused plenty of headaches to that times' Northern China. The name ""Xiongnu"" might be cognate to the name ""Huns"", but the equation Xiongnu = Huns is highly controversial among sinologists and other historians. Anyway, the Xiongnu quit China's history during the 1st and 2nd centuries AD to never come back. Now, by the time the Xiongnu raided Northern China, the most sophisticated known weapon was the crossbow. However, the movie displays a collection of arms, such as flint muskets, fuse guns, huge howitzers, old heavy mortars, that fits almost perfectly the weaponry available in the first half of the 17th century (AD, of course) so in the West as in the Far East. But, did happen anything important by then in China? Well, yes: a people first known as the Jurchens, and from then on as the Manchus, gradually increased their pressure on northern China's border, until they eventually entered Beijing in 1644 and enthroned the Qing Dynasty, the Manchu Dynasty, the last Dynasty. So our brave Mulan seems rather to fight against those Manchu invaders. And why not? Put aside Chinese popular war legends: for 2000 years they have been calling ""Xiongnu"" any northern invader, even Genghis Khan's Mongols. Then either the fire arms or the name ""Huns"" should have been removed from the screenplay. Suppressing ""modern"" weapons is out of question: along with them, half of the movie would go away. So, did Walt Disney Prductions - Buenavista Productions seriously think that calling ""Manchus"" the Manchus they would make a lesser profit? Did they really think the name ""Huns"" would frighten children more? The answer to both questions should be no. Changing History never improved a movie; it were always directors, characters and writers who achieved it. Oh, and don't fear for Mulans's safety: she sure got back with her family and was happy, for, although it's true that the Manchus won, once settled down in China's throne they became Chinese right away, and didn't treat their new subjects worse than other emperors. That's the magic of China: many times invaded, but never conquered.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Captivating...,"""Mulan"" is an Animation - Comedy movie in which we follow the story of a young Chinese woman who disguises herself as a man to join the army in place of her ailing father, embarking on a journey of bravery and self-discovery.I enjoyed this animated movie because it combined very well action, humor, and heart, offering an empowering message as Mulan defies societal expectations and proves her worth. The animation was vibrant, capturing the beauty of ancient China, while the music added emotional depth to the story. Despite that the plot followed a familiar hero's journey, it did so with such charm and sincerity that it remained engaging throughout. The themes of honor, family, and self-empowerment elevated it above the typical animated fare.

Avoid this film.,"The movie I will admit attempted a good story line.  Mulan was a character that was well developed and she showed courage and strength. The army leader and eventual lover of Mulan was good but he wasn't very military like/Japanese like in his singing.  Would you really expect Donny Osmond to sound like a strong japanese warrior.  This movie was overall OK but there was no musical number that was especially moving even though Lea Salonga's voice showed much potential,  she only sang one small solo). The lizard resembled a pale imitation to Aladdin's genie,  Mulan resembled Pocahontas in her ethnic courage for peace and dignity,  and the military leader seemed like an honorable Pheobus--not very emotional(or loving) but a fairly good performance.  However,  in general the movie's supporting cast was weak,  not very catchy music,  the story line wasn't especially interesting,   there was no funny moments really, and overall Disney's other films are better.   Try The Hunchback for Notre Dame for serious interesting and moving Disney performances,  or Beauty and the Beast.  But Pocahontas and Mulan,   watch them only if you are determined for knowledge about the Disney film genre. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It's no Lion King, but it's a childhood classic that holds up on it's fifteen anniversary","Growing up, I watch another Disney movie that still holds up to this day even as a young adult and this is that film. It may not be as strong as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King, but it's a lot better than some of the later films in the early 2000s (except Treasure Planet, Lilo & Stitch, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, and The Emperor's New Groove).The story is great and the way they made a Disney princess become a hero is what made it work. The comedy is well thought out and Mushu, the dragon, is very funny as the comic relief. The pacing is fine, the dialog is pretty good. The characters are pretty good too and the voice acting is top-notch. Ming-Na did a solid job as the beautiful Mulan who determines to save her father's life by replacing him in an army. Donny Osmond is charming as General Shang, the villain Shan-Yu is a frightening villain and is easily one of the best out there. Like I said before, Mushu is funny thanks to Eddie Murphy's great voice work.The songs may not be as memorable as the other Disney scores, but they're fine enough for me to listen to. Especially ""Reflection"", which is a lovely little tune I will sing forever. The best part is the animation. The look of China, the emperor's palace, and the mountains are great as are the character animation.Overall, Mulan may not be as solid as the three films I've already stated, but it's a childhood classic that has been stuck with me for a while and would be looking forward to watch it again.

I'm China tell you something,"The story of Hua Mulan is probably not that well known outside China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, so most of the world will very likely only know Disney's adaptation.

I suspect that every movie has something that can come across as insensitive. Overall, the movie is enjoyable enough. As usual, I didn't pay much attention to the songs, instead concentrating on the action.The rest of the cast includes B. D.

A learning experience!,"I have never been a huge fan of Disney movies, but this one has made me reconsider.  I've also never taken an interest in the Oriental culture, so when this movie came out, well, I didn't have ANY desire to see it.  Once I finally did see it though, I was impressed.  Yes, it was modernized and Americanized, but so was every other Disney animated, from Hercules to Sword in the Stone.  American children are the primary marketing target, and what child is going to want to sit through an entirely realistic portrayal of an historical figure or fable?  Most fables are based on gruesome truth, and most historical heroes were normal people who were in the right place at the right time.  This film did what it was supposed to do:  It entertained kids, and it gave me the desire to learn more about that culture, which I never thought would happen.

"Enjoyable, time and time again","If the Lion King is the best Disney ever-achieved, they came very close 4 years later with this simple tale set in ancient China. With a extended writing team that looks like a football lineup, the animated retelling of this Chinese legend came up both crisp and fluid. The final 88 minutes cut is well-pace and packed with poignant and witty dialog. Add in the a apropos lyrics that are equally funny or soul-searching deep and you have a movie that has almost as much quotables as people in China for your kids (or you) to try to memorize.Then you have the multi-nominated score and songs themselves, including the cornerstone ""Reflection"" to give the musical aspect a strong supporting presence. The story is heartfelt and Mulan's character easily memorable. Her story and struggle bring us right into the narrative and the scenes and songs are expertly edited to have the desired emotional impact.The voice talent is noteworthy with Eddie Mucrphy stealing the show as the sharp-tongued mini-Dragon, Moshu. He brings such impact to the his clever and laugh-out-loud funny banter that his presence is pivotal to the movie's overall drama-comedy balance. Ming-Na gives a believable, less-assured take on the woman who tries to pass herself of as a man, but clearly has a big gap to overcome (Mulan; not Ming-Na!) The animation is superb from beautiful scenery, captivating action sequences, to nuanced facial expressions. If you doubt that this is one of the best animated pictures ever released just look at the 10 wins it received at the Annie Awards. I would go even further and say that it clearly simply ranks as one of the best movies and still is after half a dozen viewings since I first saw it in theaters ten years ago.Long Live Mulan!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Enjoyable movie, but I have a question...","Mulan is yet another winning animated feature from Disney.  However, there is one question I cannot get out of my head.  Is there any material missing from the DVD that was included in the theatrical release?  I could have SWORN that at one point, Eddie Murphy's character said something like, ""You expect me to believe that this drag queen just happened to need a ride somewhere?!""  Was this omitted from home versions?  Please, someone e-mail me with the answer!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney can do better.,"I was somewhat disappointed when I saw Mulan.  The characters looked deep, the plot engrossing, and the graphics and animation pretty good.  What Mulan turned out to be was a movie filled with crummy Disney songs and a shallow storyline.Probably the most interesting character is that of Mushu, the demoted dragon of the ancestors.  He is voiced by Eddie Murphy, who is an excellent actor and shows it in this movie.The plot is pretty well-thought out, but the execution of the plot is somewhat shallow.  Not too much happens within the main conflict, as they train and then go into only two battles.Mulan is quite a good movie if you can overlook its nasty flaws, which can possibly be disguised by the colorful characters.The music isn't all that great.  Some of the songs aren't bad, but I would have rathered the movie be without those.  The composed music is hardly heard in parts, and the battle music isn't as quick-paced as it should be.The good part about Mulan is its good animation and great acting on everyone's part.  This Disney flick isn't bad, but I wouldn't really suggest it over other Disney movies.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertainment for the whole family!,"What makes Mulan a great movie is not only the story, but the script and terrific songs written by the latest Disney lyricist David Zippel. Inspiring, touching and wonderful. Eddie Murphy steals the show with some of the funniest lines ever written and delivers them perfectly. We were all laughing out loud. And I'd forgotten how much I loved Donny Osmonds singing. (And the villains were so creepy looking too!)

Following your destiny,"""A single grain of rice can tip the scale. One man may be the difference between victory and defeat.""I wish I was as independent and brave as Mulan, I truly do. Her story is not only interesting from start to finish but it also has meaning.Mulan is quite different from the other characters in the Disney universe and she is a positive role model for kids. Instead of being a princess, she is a heroine that's strong, smart, resourceful and independent and she truly displays that each of us can achieve whatever goal we have with hard work and dedication.As I'm still struggling to find myself and what I want to do with my life, this kind of tale tends to remind me about independence and following my own path.

Fun Chinese theme,"Forget the armchair critics.If you're a Disney fan. you'll love this one, about a Chinese girl who joins the army to fight maurading Huns. There's a little dragon friend (Eddie Murphy), a romantic captain of the guard (Donny Osmond provided the singing voice), an evil-looking Hun chieftain, an irritating minister and 3 soldier friends.Despite what others may say, the songs are terrific - not soul (ala Hercules) or jazz (ala Jungle Book), just normal. It's not a kiddies' film - it's for the whole family.Frankly, I'm not really a Disney fan and have little patience to watch most animated films. But this one's worth it.",,Anonymous,Animation

A VERY underrated Disney classic,"This is one of my favorite Disney animated movie! It's not as cutesy as many of the Disney princess movies are - It's about a war of all things and for a change the main heroine is not a princess but a strong female role model. Clever and brave but at the same time clumsy and silly at the moments. The massage is strong and works on many levels, and it has some great dramatic moments (especially the sequence when Mulan escape from home is build pretty powerful, some best music I heard in a Disney movie) however what work best is the comedy. After ""Emperor New Grove"" I find it to be the funny-est of all Disney films. Comedy with Mulan pretending to be a man and all the camp scenes are hilarious and just getting funner and funner. I also enjoy Eddie Murphy who while may look annoying at first he quickly turns into a very lovable and comedic characters. To be honest all characters are great and even those who have few lines are very memorable. The villain lives a impression as well.Plus how great to see a Disney movie that doesn't focus on a love story. There is a romance element to it, but it's quick and handle mostly for comedic effect.And what crime would it be to not mention the animation - it's great as usual!If you haven't seen this one I strongly recommend it to you! Next to ""The Fox and the hound"" the most underrated Disney movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's that good. As far as the movie itself, what a great film. Mulan's heroisim and also that she is a woman is both wonderful and inspiring. Not only is the Osmond song excellent but the film's message is also excellent. We will be watching this movie over and over again and look forward to also watching the sequel. We hope it's as good as the first one! We also see that there is a live action version available. We will also be checking that out.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another strong Disney heroine,"Disney's most recent animated film contains fewer of the crowd-pleasing elements that made ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Lion King"" into box-office bonanzas (although there is a tiny dragon, Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy, and a horrifyingly cute roly-poly dog does make a mercifully brief appearance early on).  Instead, ""Mulan"" tells a surprisingly mature story through beautiful animation in the classic style.  From lush gardens to stark snowscapes to ornate temples, the settings frame and complement the storyline beautifully.  When her father is injured and unable to represent his family in the emperor's army, Mulan disguises herself as a boy and rides forth to take his place and defend her family's honor.  Disney has released a series of animated films with strong heroines (""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Pocahontas""), and ""Mulan"" continues the trend. (One might wonder at Disney's agenda; the only central male character in a recent animated Disney film [""The Lion King""] is not human.)  Mulan's cross-dressing adventures are fascinating enough to engross child and adult alike (in the end, she manages to include her faithful soldier sidekicks in the joke), and Shan-Yu, the leader of the Huns, is as wicked a villain as anyone has a right to hope for.  It all comes to a fine, satisfying conclusion, and the story's emphasis on the value of family relationships makes for a worthwhile shared experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Should have taken itself more seriously.,"I own the video and have watched it numerous times.  I really like this film because mostly because of it's theme and some key scenes that are very moving.What's frustrating about Mulan is that it's a really good movie whose potential greatness is forfeited to the commercial imperative of mass audience appeal.Dramas employ light comic relief release tension.  Comedies employ a smattering of drama to move the story along.  Mulan tries to indulge both to a degree of contrast that is detrimental to its primary genre: drama.The themes of honor and search for one's destiny are very well explored through the adventures of the heroine Mulan.  The greatest moments in this film are when we see the courage of a young woman facing the dangers imposed both by cultural paradigm and warfare.  We admire her more for dealing with both at the same time.The problem is that too many moments are ruined with a comedic tag and the film's dramatic pace is often interrupted by obligatory slapstick comedy. I honestly don't think this was necessary.  Children appreciate the story and don't need to be pandered to with incongruous comedy.Still, the power of the story itself and the crafting of the main characters manage to stand out and hold their own despite the self-imposed comedic distractions.  If the writers had given their own story the respect it deserves, this would have been a great film.",,Anonymous,Animation
It was okay...,"The animation wasn't terribly impressive; at times, it seemed too simplistic, with the quality of shading and attention to detail falling drastically short of say, for example, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.  In addition, I felt that Disney was trying to stereotype and ""play into"" the Chinese culture too much by trying to imitate Chinese music in some of the soundtracks (which, I might add, weren't that great either. Only ""Reflections"" I shall acknowledge as being somewhat enjoyable). Mulan's character design is a stereotype in itself.  Since when do Asians really have eyes that tilt at almost a 45 degree angle?  I realize it might seem like a little thing to get so excited over, but I'm Asian, so I am sensitive to details like that simply because I have been the target of many jokes of that ilk during my adolescence.  I also think that Mulan is the most flat-chested Disney human female I've ever seen.  Pocahontas, who, historically, was 13 when Smith ""discovered"" her, was stacked.  Of course, there's no stereotype about flat-chested Asians, right (which is entirely a grossly incorrect generalization).  Now all I can say is, ""Gee, thanks, Disney.""  I suppose that some credit should be given, because usually a giant corporation will not take risks by exploring a minority group.  Yet in doing so, they have only played upon the American society's expectations of what Asian culture means to them, but doesn't necessarily reflect the truth.At face value, however, Mulan was entertaining enough.  Granted, this film is supposed to be for little kids, so hey, why not give some of the music a Chinesy feel to make it all cute.  Why not paint Mulan's face entirely white (even though that extent of make-up is used, NOT for matchmaking, but most commonly for Chinese opera).  Let's give the public something familiar, but at the same make it seem exotic and make it appear like we really *heh heh* want to explore Chinese tradition for its inherent value, and not to exploit it for our purposes.  Mulan is something I'll watch when I have absolutely nothing better to do.  Even then, I don't think I'd watch it more than two times.  In the words of a previous reviewer, ""Excuse me, I have to go watch some Anime now.""  Go watch Neon Genesis Evangelion.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

In the chain with The Lion King showing us the wild life in Afrika so touchable for the children so close to them. And in the chain with Pocahontas showing the Indian culture and teaching little children about a part of the American history. And every other movie is a story about it self.

second only to Beauty and the Beast,"this film is second only to Beauty and the Beast for Disney.  I first went to the film very reluctantly, because I hated Anastasia and had heard that Mulan was this huge feminist flick, but my girlfriend wanted to go so I had to.  Now don't go thinking I am just some sexist pig, but i didn't want to see a film in which i didn't like the heroine, which happened in Anastasia, and i think most guys share my opinion on that.  but after the first few minutes i was blown away.  i loved the art and Eddie Murphy did a fantastic job as the comic relief.  funny yet not detracting from the story's importance.  sure there were many dumb common sense things that were inconsistent in the film (China has LOTS of people in it, after all, they built that wall with sheer numbers, you think they would be able to come up with a little bigger army...)  but that doesn't matter in the story. overall i think it was beautifully done and truly one of the great Disney films.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Instead of moving the picture and complimenting it, they seemed to be begrudgingly thrown in like tinsel on a Christmas tree- no one likes it, yet many just toss it on in a strange sense of obligation.The art was definitely good and the animation fluid.

His character though does do some funny things so I was able to tolerate it better.  This one has a girl pretending to be a guy in order to help her father who is drafted to serve, but is very old.  Of course, in this type of movie the girl does great in the army and becomes a better soldier than all the guys as is typical with these kinds of movies.

A Very Solid Film,"It's pretty hard to find something about this film that doesn't work, especially with *yet another* terrible remake by Disney that's come out apparently. First the soundtrack is very strong, and only adds to the gravity of the scenes.The animations great, the characters rock, and the humor is uplifting and fun.Mulan tells the tale of a young woman named Mulan who must take her father's place in the army raised to fight a horde of Mongol Invaders in Medieval China. What surprises me is the incredible amount of emotional power told in this simple tale of self determination, responsibility and honor. Even though it's cartoonish, over the top and even a little ridiculous at times, Mulan is a well written film, and Mulan is a protagonist that embodies personal growth in every level. She's resilient, honest, and selfless. It's surprising that a simple children's movie tells very mature and well developed themes of duty, self sacrifice, and emotional zeal. It's power holds up well over 22 years later.The only problems are Eddie Murphy starring Mooshu (who can be annoying and out of place at times), the meh villain, and the Disney standard animal sidekicks of Mulan, who technically is a Disney princess at the end of the day, albeit a great one.She's not this ""girl power"" character because she's strong, she's strong because she fully becomes the individual China needed her to be, not in a subversive way, but in a smart one. At the end of the movie, it's noted that Mulan's arc wasn't about becoming the person she thought she needed to be, but the one other people needed her to be. China needed her to be a warrior, not a wife. Overall, I highly recommend this great movie, to fans of Disney and not. Thank you Disney for this incredible classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Mature Disney Heroine Leading A Film,"Disney's 'Mulan', set in ancient China' is another visual treat from Disney. The animation is stunning and colourful and it does capture the beauty of old China (as seen in paintings). The story has heart and is a lot of fun to watch. I liked that Mulan was written as the typical fairy tale Disney heroine. She's strong, independent, brave, thoughtful and determined. She has more in common with the male Disney characters like Aladdin.All the 'good guy' characters are likable but my favourite one is Eddie Murphy's Mushu. There's quite a resemblance to Murphy's other famous character Donkey (from 'Shrek') and this just proves that he has an energetic voice and flair for comedy which is just what the characters require. The rest of the voice actors that include Ming Na, Pat Morita, Miriam Margolyes, James Hong, Miguel Ferrer and George Takei among others do a splendid job.The jokes work very well as they had me and my family laughing out loud. The songs that were sung by the characters were hilarious and the instrumental tracks were great. Even though 'Mulan' has been criticized by many for its violent content and historical inaccuracy, I think it's one of Disney's great productions. I didn't feel the violence was overdone and where historical accuracy is concerned, it's a Disney movie for goodness sake. That said, I didn't think the film itself was grossly inaccurate even though a few liberties have been taken here and there. Just watch it and enjoy with the family. That's what it's for.",,Anonymous,Animation
A Californian saggy red lantern,"My sweetheart is a big Disney fan. So over the handful of years we've been together I've found my self watching a good deal of animation i would otherwise have ignored. Moana, Coco and Ratatouille left me with an unexpected sense of joy. Stylish stories with a quiet moral woven into the back ground.
Mulan, though set in China, feels like a cheap Chinese restaurant in California. If you are making a film set in a foreign culture? You should do your leg work and get the feel right. Simply putting the family name first on a character and making some assumptions about honour does not cut it for Chinese. This movie felt like a good B grade western with a thin Chinese theme pasted over the top.
Then there's the message. The movie is obviously trying to put a woman up as a heroine. A ""lady triumphs and wins the respect of the men"" happy ending story. But really the only message here, is that if you're a woman and want to be judged as an equal, you need to be as good as three men to even stand a chance.
Add to this some expected cheesy Disney moments and Eddie Murphy being a little over the top and I was left with a passable but hollow feeling.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful and epic,"This movie, about a young maiden who secretly goes in his place and becomes one of China's greatest heroines in the process, is a fantastic coming-of-age movie!Rewatching it after rewatching the adaptation Mulan (2020) without remembering anything from either of them, questions the way the adaptation is made. I think the adaptation is okay as a movie itself, but why on Earth does it exclude so many elements from the original? The original contains so many good elements, and useful, at least, that could elevate adaptation so much more, and additionally, the adaptation takes some directions that are completely different. Anyway, seeing the original after the adaptation strengthened my experience because of their differences.The original has a lot to offer, anything from beautiful and touching to dark and epic moments. The story is beautiful and captivating, creating a nice character development, and it has a good balance of drama and action. Also, the sound and score are good as well.Revisiting this movie highlights its enduring charm, with its compelling story, rich character development, and a perfect blend of drama and action.

A kid flick adults will love... A chick flick guys will love...,"Although I bypassed this film in the theaters, I took a chance and purchased it for my Disney movie collection (a strategy which served me admirably with The Rescuers Down Under and miserably with Pocahontas!).""Mulan"" is the powerful story of a headstrong and ambitious teenage girl in medieval China who, in an effort to save her ailing father, impersonates a man in the Chinese army, repels a Hun invasion, and falls for her commanding officer.  She is aided in her adventures by a comical dragon named Mushu, a lucky (or is it unlucky?) cricket, and three wise-cracking compatriots at arms.The Disney formula works remarkably well here (though the love story angle is a bit of a stretch).  Mulan is a likable and gutsy representation of grrrrrl power in a predominately male society. Her outspoken nature and penchant to think and take action when necessary are in direct contrast to the normal feminine roles in the ancient world. Voluminous supporting players require more-than-average attention span by the viewer, but then this is an epic war story!  And each of these characters is given their moment to shine, while never fully taking the reins from the true heroine.The lessons of tolerance and empowerment for young girls are blatantly obvious, but they do not detract from what is a terrific and moving story. As in any good Disney animated adventure, the music plays a big part, and some of the songs stick with you long after the end credits run. The animation is incredibly fluid and evocative of the oriental setting, and some of the special effects are a wonder to behold. The training sequences and mountain battle scenes are brilliant examples of the craft.The vocal cast is an international potpourri of talent, including Pat Morita, Harvey Fierstein (as a REAL man's man!  Go figure!), June Foray, George Takei, and Eddie Murphy (hilarious as fast-talking dragon, Mushu). The dialog is rapid-fire and intelligent for adults, but easy enough for older children to grasp.  Donny Osmond's song for the training sequence (""I'll Make a Man Out of You"") is a thunderous and inspirational war ballad that still rings in my ears - particularly when I am working out or have a heavy job to accomplish.  Also, listen carefully to the music for the closing of the film: No less talent than 98 Degrees, Stevie Wonder, and Christina Aguilera (before her genie ever came out of its bottle)!There are a few small flaws in logic (i.e., The rescue of Mulan and her horse during the avalanche - While Mulan may be a fierce and powerful warrior, I don't think even HER legs could hold up that horse!), and some of the humor may sail past younger viewers (cross-dressing gags, suggested nudity and jokes about the hygenic habits of men, to name a few...). Still, the multitude of characters, snappy dialog, and various levels of action and adventure make this film as much fun on the twentieth viewing as on the first.""Mulan"" is highly entertaining kids and adults equally (My 3-year-old son requests this one regularly!).  And this is a ""chick flick"" for guys, too! Get some takeout Chinese and make a night of it with the kids... or with that special someone in your life.",,Anonymous,Animation
"War, fighting, misery, & battles","Fighting, swords, war, battles, armies. This is supposed to be a Disney kids cartoon. What in the world were they thinking? This is the second Disney animation I've disliked, the first was the cauldren. There's no cute animals, no sweet songs, it's all about war, fighting, misery, war & more war. The only part I enjoyed was the beginning when the mother & Grandmother were preparing Mulan for a ceremony. That was nice because it was about tradition and family. But that's only about 15 minutes of the beginning of the movie. I would not allow children under 10 to watch this. It's too violent & depressing.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

Brings honor,"Mulan is probably the most underrated movie Disney has ever made and it's also one of the best films Disney has ever made, it's a beautiful film from my childhood that gets even better with rewatches and one that I will love forever.Tied with Lilo and Stitch for Disney's funniest movie, Mulan tells an inspiring story that the next generation can look back on about honor, trust, and proving people wrong, Ming-Na Wen and BD Wong are fantastic in this film and Mulan is an incredible protagonist that we can all get behind, the side characters are all great and Eddie Murphy stole every scene he was in, Mulan is a beautiful, heartbreaking, and truly hilarious animated film that I will be watching for years.And it also has one of the best movie soundtracks of all time, with riveting action and beautiful animation, the story is wonderfully original and it did everything it needed to do, with phenomenal montages and a terrific endingI'm gonna give Mulan an A+",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing!,"I think Mulan is the best cartoon produced by Disney at the moment.

a more complicated Disney animation,"This is a nice Disney movie, but in comparison to other movies of Disney not for the eyes or ears. For instance, Pocahontas 1 was a feast for the eyes as well as ears, but the story is in comparison to Mulan uncomplicated. The music in Mulan is by no means bad, I think partly because the music and songs were in Mulan more driven by the emotions, and I liked that very much. Especially the music in the transformation scene, in which Mulan disguises herself as a boy, I thought, was very well.I like it also that the story was set in ancient China, I don't know very much movies that are set in China. I saw once the Red Lantern and it really made me sick and depressed. I could have of course put the television off, but that time, I was forced to follow a school course about China, and I wanted not only through books and writing papers to learn more about China. This seems not to have helped me: I managed to get from all the students who were following the course too, to get the lowest grade as possible. Some interesting things I have learned from my course was that due to superstition about number 4 (in Western culture it is 13) many buildings do not have 4th floors. The most interesting thing for me was however: China is eternal, but the lives of the Chinese are often hard and short. This kind of feeling is very evident in Mulan, but at the same times this movie, of course in most animated movies, has humour. A tiny dragon takes care of that.The movie did leave me 2 times in almost opposite emotions. I was laughing about the song, which was dealing about women, and the next moment the soldiers stepped in a solitary battlefield. Also when Mulan saved the live of her leader Cheng, and the other moment only a matter of a few minutes later I really thought that (although it is Disney) Cheng would kill her.The ending did not satisfy me. I think it would have been better, if the movie stopped when Mushu hugged Mulan after he has promised that things will be alright, after the army has left Mulan, or when Mulan gets on her horse to ride to home. But then this kind of ending is maybe only suitable for people who value 'joining' more important as 'winning'. But then again, although they were loyal, I did not care about Mulans parents and her great grandmother and especially not the ancestors.",,Anonymous,Animation
Not for me,"I feel that the content was perhaps too adult for a cartoon, too serious for the fun element that Disney usually brings and it makes it easily forgettable. I had only seen it once before and could remember nothing about it and I'm already struggling to recall it after just two days. I certainly couldn't tell you how any of the very forgetful songs go.Perhaps it will work better as a live action version for children who are slightly older? I will have to wait and see that one, but for me it reminded me of 'The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor' (2008), 'The Great Wall' (2016) and basically any other film set in China when the Huns were invading. Certainly nothing special.It just didn't have that Disney magic and seemed like a lesser film made by one of the competing companies. Even the bad guy seemed like something from an after school cartoon in the 80's with his grey skin and orange eyes? I also felt that Mooshoo seemed a bit displaced. Just the style of his character was badly juxtaposed with the oriental setting, you can dress him up as a dragon, but he's still Eddie Murphy. It was good to have some comic relief however, although he might as well have been a donkey?The message of equal rights is important, but gets a bit lost as a silly, frivolous thing. It's almost as though they're not bothered about getting that message across, like it's just a gimmick to make another film.It is easy to watch, but not exactly gripping and the soundtrack is so meh, that I'd never be able to name identify it for a quiz.I do think it's a shame, because these later ""Girl Power"" films including 'Pocahontas' (1995) and 'Moana' (2016) just don't seem to have had the time and money spent on them like those of 'Beauty And The Beast' (1991) and 'The Little Mermaid' (1989), although I know there are plenty that would disagree with me, but I challenge you to write your own top Disney list and see where they land?I think representing everybody is important, so every film should be given it's all regardless of the subject matter.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Who is it really for?,"I just caught Mulan at the cinema on its re-release( I assume to back Tarzan up). I watched it with my 4 year old daughter who loved every second of course (she knows all the songs, names of the characters etc)But then again so do I. I am a Disney fan. No doubt about it. Ever since I was a kid, (I'm a big one now at 27)I've pretty much caught all of the Disney movies and as you get older they obviously change. Not the movies themselves, but your perception of what you are watching. As a movie fan I can appreciate all of Disneys recent movies as an adult( the direction, artwork, character selection and most importantly story selection). I like them all in different ways, Aladdin for X, Notre Dame for Y and it goes on. The point I am making is this: Does it really matter what I think? My daughter loved it. Its for her. Its for all the kids to enjoy the world over. I try not to be critical of Imbd reviews but I think people maybe aren't watching a movie like this in the right frame of mind if they are not at least entertained by its simple (ok predictable) story and the easy to listen to musical score etc. As an Eddie murphy fan I loved mushu, but I can appreciate someone not acquainted with his comedy finding him miscast in this film. But again, so what? Do the kids care? No. As adults we criticize the selection of the comedy relief and we wonder who the comedy relief will be in the next film. I'm not saying you have to have children to enjoy a Disney movie nor am I saying any person young or old, male or female, chinese or arabic etc isn't entitled to an opinion on said movie, but hey  lighten up folks. I think Mulan is another solid performance from Disney and look forward to Tarzan.",,Anonymous,Animation

A Disney Heroine Like No Other.,"I remember first seeing and hearing previews/ads of this Disney animated feature over a decade ago, when it was set for a summer release back in '98. Before then, I hadn't heard of the original Mulan legend, so I would've thought that this was a completely original film by Disney and there was no inspiration for it to take and adapt or remake. I never saw this in theaters, which looking back on it, I wish I had, but I would own it later when it was brought to VHS since my mother bought a copy of it for me from a Wal-Mart and I'm so glad she did.And since seeing this, it has been my most favorite or just one of my most favorite Disney animated movies. One of the reasons why I love it so much and what I love about it is the fact that it has a heroine who appeals to both the male and female genders. The eponymous character seems to be the first to do so and I think that's such a great thing. Another is it's a jam-packed, action-adventure thrill ride that will keep y'all on the edge of your seats. I like the fact it was made at the now defunct Disney Animation Studio in my home-state, Florida.What separates Mulan from the other Disney heroines is when she decides to fill in for her father by joining the army (since she has no brothers and he has no sons). She proves that women can be action heroes too. Evidently as she succeeds in helping defeat the Huns. For me and probably most other males, she's my most favorite Disney heroine and I'd also consider her to be the best. The moments with Mushu and Cri-Kee are great too. I wish the former's musical number could've been possible to make it into the final cut of the movie.Anyway, if no one reading this has already seen it, I recommend to see it for yourselves. It's not to be passed.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not too bad,"This is actually one of the Disney movies I likeed, partly due to the fact that it took place in China, I have a fascination for the Far Eastern countries.The only thing I have to say is that the voice actor for Mushu should've been someone other than Murphy.

A Very Good Character,"I took my kids to this film when it was first released. I had not seen it since. My daughter holds it in high regard. It is quite a nice film. Mulan, the title character, is being groomed to marry, following the various requirements of one in her position. I would be interested to see how Chinese people today would accept or reject her as a character. The empire is being invaded by the Huns and one member of each family must go fight. Since she is an only child, her frail father must again put on his military uniform and go to fight. He can barely walk and it is horrible for Mulan to watch. She cuts her hair, dons the military clothing, and sets out to join the fray. She is accompanied by a dragon that the spirits have given her out of fear for her safety. Unfortunately, he is relatively useless. Played by Eddie Murphy, he is pretty much the same character as Donkey from Shrek. His mouth flaps constantly with no filter. Once she enters the service, she must maintain her boy-ness and perform deeds that make her useful to them. Her successes are often accidental, but she begins to be seen as a force to her fellow warriors. The Huns are enormous and dangerous, and she must eventually face off the with their leader, no easy task. This is all about having no standing in a culture of sexism that has been around for centuries. This would be quite inspiring for young girls.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Most amazing disney movie EVER and first feminist Disney character ever to exist, GIRL POWER!!!","Movie that takes place in ancient China. It follows the story of Mulan, a brave and determined young woman who doesn't quite fit into the traditional roles society expects of her.When China faces a threat from invading forces, the Emperor issues a decree that one man from each family must join the army to defend the country. Mulan's father, being older and injured, is chosen to serve, but Mulan knows he won't survive the harsh conditions of war.

Guilty Pleasure,"This Disney animated has so many terrible flaws that I'm forced to put it in my ""guilty pleasures"" category. I love this movie, but I wince at the laughable (or insulting) Disney view of ancient Chinese culture and the Disney-typical ""cute sidekicks."" The animation is uneven: the waving flags are marvelous and must be computer-generated, but the heads of the characters sometimes visibly change shape as they turn left or right. The charging Hun army looks too reminiscent of other CGI scenes and looks cartoony. The character of Mushu (voice by Eddie Murphy) is hilarious but also hilariously miscast. The designs of some characters (The Emperor and Shan-Yu) are grotesque, while other designs (e.g., settings, Mulan's horse) are marvelous. The face of Mulan herself is a crude blank with vividly expressive eyebrows and mouth. The voices of Mulan and her family are very good, the songs are good and the music is magnificent (Jerry Goldsmith). The action scenes are generally exciting while also being laughably illogical. Fortunately, if you can vigorously suspend your disbelief, Mulan is both very funny and somewhat touching.Alan Nicoll",,Anonymous,Animation
Every girl deserves respect,"The adaptation of the film was quite successful. In the film, Mulan joined the army for her father. Filial piety to her father is the cause of the story, but not the ultimate goal. The significance of joining the army is to find the most real self.

A Strong Heroic Tale.,"Mulan came out towards the end of Disney's peak era of animated musicals, which began in 1989 with The Little Mermaid and ended in 1999 with Tarzan. The company released 9 major feature films of that genre in that period, and I rank Mulan is somewhere about 5th or 6th in that pack; that's no insult given how strong most of the films were. This is a quite entertaining, beautiful film, with very good musical numbers, which only lacks in a few story elements and a central heroine not quite as well-rounded as the likes of Ariel, Belle or Jasmine from past films.Mulan, voiced by Ming-Na Wen, can't seem to act as a ""proper"" Chinese lady and find a husband. She decides to take her physically ailing father's place when every family must give a man for war that has come upon them by the Huns. Dressing and acting like a man she's awkward in the training at first, but she eventually becomes one of the most impressive of all the soldiers, while the man leading her and the squad is one she admires and finds quite dashing as well. Along the way she gets some much needed help from a small but determined dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy.The film has a nice combination of comedy and action, although they are within a story somewhat clunky at times. This is no doubt a gorgeous film, from ancient Chinese villages to snowy mountain peaks to the Forbidden City. The title character is certainly a strong willed female hero, and mostly it is not by chance but by the choices she makes which determines her fate. Unfortunately she just didn't engage me as a person like any number of other Disney leading ladies; as much as I admired her strength her character basically swung in two modes: awkward bumbling girl and super-brave hero woman. It's a good Disney heroine, but not a great one. The songs are nice, with a couple being fairly memorable.On balance the good stuff in this film far outweighs the minor issues I had. Mulan, even if it isn't one of the best Disney animated musicals, is certainly one that should satisfy those of all ages looking for a rousing and inspirational tale.One last thought: What the heck were they thinking with that first song in the ending credits? It doesn't fit movie at all.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Great Disney Classic,"So the 2020 Live Action version of Mulan hits Disney+ at no extra charge tomorrow and because I am cheap I haven't watched it yet so I thought I would watch the original animated film and here is my review for it. The premise of sees a young Woman attempt to save her Father from dying in the military by taking his place secretly by pretending to be a man.Main Character
So obviously Mulan is the main character and for those that criticise Disney's animated films back in the 90s of not portraying strong female characters then go back and watch Mulan as this is a fantastically strong character. It only came to my attention today that the fantastic Ming-Na Wen who I know from Agents Of Shield and The Mandalorian voices Mulan and she is a perfect fit for the role, she is known for her action prowess and she just really fits into the character of Mulan.Supporting Characters
There is a good group of characters that Mulan allies with in the film, the main one being Mushu played by Eddie Murphy and he is great and adds plenty of life and energy to the film. I mean it is funny that his voice role here is basically the same as when he voices Donkey in the Shrek films, but it does work here and as I said adds plenty of life to a film that needs it. BD Wong plays Shang her Captain in the army and I thought he voiced the character well and I thought his character fit well with Mulan's story and I thought their dynamic was a highlight of the film. The characters in the army are fine and are good with Mulan, but you can't help but see the stereotypes and generic nature of them kind of makes them a bit paper thin. But when you get to Paper thin we get to the villain of this film, I mean these animated films have great villains such as Scar, Jafar & Ursula but this guy is just really generic, he is a Hun and just wants to take over China. We are not given any interesting and thought provoking reason, he is just a bad guy for the sake of the film having a bad guy which does hurt the film a bit.Story
The story is good, it does a great job showing its main protagonist in a great light and making you care about Mulan and wanting to see her succeed and it does that in an appropriate way, the story also doesn't shy away from some pretty sexist moments and I think it makes Mulan's story better that the film doesn't hide from that. But I feel like this film maybe has an overly simple story, compared to other Disney films I felt like this film had the potential to have more shades of grey in it, like I said the bad guy is just simply a bad guy and I think there could have been more done there, especially when you consider some of the attitudes of the Chinese empire that are pretty bad in this film.Script
The script is really good, you have to remember that this is meant to be a family film so it has some of that family humour but it feels appropriate and the film knows when to have its dramatic moments and it is effective in doing so.Style
This film looks fantastic, back in the 80's and 90's Disney had great looking animated films but this one is right up there, it looks stunning and the Chinese backdrop really adds to it and the style of the film. For a family film it does have some exciting moments and some darker moments which sells its war like feeling. It is a really short film barely clocking at 90 mins but that is part of its charm, you can turn it on and watch this quickly and feel like a complete story has been told in the time that is given.Overall
Overall, this is a great animated film that maybe is a bit underrated. I feel like when people mention the great Disney animated film Mulan is never mentioned and I am not saying it is as good as The Lion King or anything but I think it is a really great film that deserves to be watched.Rating - 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why cute mascots?  Marketing!,"Mulan was pretty good for a movie from the Evil Empire (although as long as Microsoft is still solvent, Disney is only a distant second as Evil Empires go ;)  There were few songs, which I heartily approved of (I hate the songs) and the story was kinda nice.  I did have two major problem with it:1)  Why oh why does the main character of the story desperately require a 'Wacky' sidekick?  I will admit, the scarecrow riding a panda scene made me laugh, but other than that, Mu-Shu did nothing but make me groan.  Robin William as the Genie was funny, after that, and he was the only sidekick actually called for by the movie.  Every Disney movie thereafter has had to have one, and it is starting to grate on my nerves.2)  It was too dang short.  Nobody said animated movies have to be short! Put another scene in there!  Show Mulan and Gen. Shang getting married! It wouldn't have ruined the story! There is no rule against liberated women liking hunky guys!  And he was smart and enlightened too!

Culturally forced and unengaging,"The live-action Mulan suffers from a lack of soul and feels more like a lecture on Asian principles than an entertaining movie.

There is a long time I haven't find a Disney movie simply ""beautiful"".

"Timeless, Empowering and Touching. Proof that when animation is done right and with care it becomes a fan favorite and classic.","The 90s were known as ""Disney's Renaissance"" where many titles reached critically and commercial success, some of them even breaking records like Mulan(1998). It is not an exaggeration to say that Mulan(1998) is one of the most original, well-crafted and aesthetically innovative animated feature in Disney's repertoire.From the mesmerizing chinese painting-style opening titles to the stunning animation and sharp character designs, the film holds an aesthetically pleasing style and feel very different to what Disney used to do back then and which stand the test of time. Contrary to computer animation, it's hard for traditional animation to become outdated and it will still resonate the same to newer generations as long as it's done right. That's why the moral and themes of the story must be significant in order for it to have a chance to still be relevant in the future.The film succeeds in both aspects, it provides an endearing, touching and well-realised story loosely based in the famous Chinese legend of Mulan; and a riveting emotive and action-filled spectacle with an incredibly well-composed soundtrack and an empowering message for women. The movie has some elements that could have potentially ruined the tone and craftmanship of the tale being told like the character of Mushu. However, thanks to the well-written jokes, impeccable performance by Eddie Murphy and overall relevance to the plot it provides a funny support character meant to help the main lead to express her thoughts at certain crucial parts of the movie.Disney has been known to add common elements to every Princess tale making it a bit formulaic, elements like animal side characters or mascots and a romantic interest. While these are merely irrelevant to the story and mostly add comical moments to it, in this film all the side characters have a reason to be there and have a role within the story. Except perhaps the dog, which only appears in one sequence at the beginning of the movie and it's never seen again.Furthermore, the first 20 minutes are some of the most intense, well fleshed out and heartfelt moments of any animated feature. With little dialogue and the abundance of symbolisms, songs and wise metaphors, the first act of the movie is able to convey to the audience precisely how Mulan feels towards the situation she is living and the overall picture of women in this portrayal of feudal China.While some views and commentaries found in songs may have aged poorly, the film contains uplifting and encouraging calls to action motivated by honor and identity. THere's a sense of comradery as the training the soldiers go through provide a needed bonding that would benefit them not only in defeating the enemy but also would help them open their eyes and heart.Another very important aspect the movie stands out for is the uncensoring of the more tragic and darker moments involving the enemy and the consequences of war without ever taking it too far.IN CONCLUSION, as a take of a very loosely based portrayal of the legend of Mulan the movie doesn't succeed as much, but as a story of a daughter that went to war instead of her wounded father to not only save his life but prove her worth and find her self and eventually suceeding in doing so bringing honor to her family it's a remarkable movie. Great animation, original setting, inspiring scenes and symbolism, soothing and energetic music and incredible themes.

Not One Of Their Best,"The film is enjoyable but can't hold a candle to the truly great Disney films of the decade (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin).

The music also pales in comparison to the great scores of other Disney films. And finally, the villain is almost as forgettable as the songs. Can't even remember his name.

"Good Disney animation, funny in spots, rating seems a bit too high.","I like good animated films. Disney's ""Tarzan"" is one of my favorites.

Everyone knows the story by now - young girl Mulan disguises herself as a young man and reports to fight the Huns instead of her ailing father, and becomes a hero. I felt some of the silly characters, and the ""spirits"", were making fun of the Chinese.  And, while Eddie Murphy's character, the midget dragon, was funny, it was too much like the talking donkey in ""Shrek.""The high points -- the film was only about 75 minutes long, the animation was really good, the picture on DVD is very sharp and colorful, the Dolby 5.1 surround sound is used to good effect.

I love Captain Li too! He's basically the GREATEST of any of the male lead roles in Disney movies! Mushu makes me giggle and I did rewind (yes, my Mulan is on cassette NOT DVD) a few times when he said something funny. HAHAHHA. Like when he shows up for the first time and the horse steps on him.

One of the better Disney cartoons. Same stupid music.,"OK, Disney movie. Nice word play, good emotional story, Eddie Murphy's voice, even Pat Morita is somewhere around there. The same really dumb song and dance routines, though, exactly when the film starts to get interesting. I really really wish they'd stop that.Animation. Disney like. I found it less thorough than many, but still OK. Cannot rival Japanese animation, though.Plot. A bit too shallow for my taste, but after all, this is a cartoon and the audience is children. I am sure battle strategy or good plot continuity were not in the mind of the creators of Mulan.Conclusion: all in all I rate it an 8 for Disney movies, although it's more like 7.5.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good movie, Shame about the songs & the romance.","I enjoyed this feature and liked most of the characters. However I disliked Shang & expected Mulan to despise him too. But this being Disney, she didn't. Grrr. The soundtrack was awful. Mushu, Crikee & the three soldiers were amusing. The gods weren't. The animation has an unique look and the film is interesting.

Amazing work!!!!!,"I must say, I am quite impressed with Disney's 1998 animated classic feature ""Mulan,"" about a Chinese girl who had troubles attempting to bring honor to her family, until one night, her father, a soldier, wasn't feeling well to fight, so she disguised herself as a man so that she could fight in her father's place. She had a dragon, Mushu, who helped her out along the way. In this movie, this movie has nothing but hardcore action!!!!! This isn't your ordinary, everyday, run of the mill girl movie; no, no, no, this is a great one!!!!!This is a boy movie, too; I'm just saying that because there are a whole lot of Disney Princess movies out there!!!!!""Mulan"" is an amazing feat to come to the cinema, and to Disney, too. I've seen this plenty of times and it never grows old on me.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Mulan, setting goals since 1998","Mulan is by far the most kickass Disney character of all time, no contest. Taking on the entire Hun army, getting cast out, and still shows up to the final boss to end things right. Mulan is literal goals. The perfect mix of humor, action, and good old Disney magic. One of my favorites!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"beautiful at times, but far from a classic","Somewhere in 'Mulan' is a great story. In fact you can feel the potential all through the first half of the film. Lush backgrounds, wonderful character design, and a promising premise. Enter Eddie Murphy and everything falls flat. Not to say that it is his fault alone but whenever Mushu appears you can almost see the studio exec memos saying 'more comic relief' or 'more kid appeal'. Yeesh. A friend of mine suggested that the character may have been better silent or as a ghost that Mulan could only see. Something falls flat in the second half of the film that is never quite retrieved which is a real shame. The folks at Disney could use a few lessons in subtlety in storytelling from the Chinese.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Tired, Derivative, Almost Parody of Disney Animated Classics","Seven years after the creative, sparkling animated classic, Beauty and the Beast (1991) Disney appears to have produced a lazy, mostly unoriginal derivative full-featured animation movie. Many of the outdated cliches of comedic parody are interspersed with the typical musical routines and stereotypical gender roles even though Mulan supposedly is a strong feminine character. It's live action update by Disney released in 2020 offers up a much more vibrant and rightfully accomplished successor.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mulan is one of the most culturally significant movies Disney has ever made!,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)2020 brings us yet another Disney's live-action remake. After new versions of The Jungle Book, Aladdin, The Lion King, and many others, now comes the time for Mulan. Therefore, I decided to go back in time and relive one of the latest installments of the Disney Renaissance Era. As a kid, even though I was (and I still am) far from being someone impacted by the Chinese culture, I always enjoyed the movie for its story, characters, and of course, its memorable score. However, for some reason, it never became one of those Disney classics I revisit every year. This might very well be only my 5th time watching this film, which for someone born in the 90s like me, feels weirdly short.This is probably the first time I watch Mulan since I was an innocent young teenager, so I was definitely intrigued to see if my overall opinion would change a lot or not. Well, enough of the suspense, I love it! I appreciate it a lot more than when I was a kid, without a single doubt. In fact, if I could only choose one movie to be remade in the live-action format, Mulan would be my ultimate choice, simply due to its epic and cinematic feel. Not trying to take away from the compelling story and incredible characters, but when it comes to live-action, Mulan has everything to deliver a chill-inducing visual spectacle. This film proves how 2D animation can feel so powerful and emotionally overwhelming.As with every movie from the Disney Renaissance Era, the animation looks gorgeous. Dozens of jaw-dropping shots resemble the epic scope of Lord of the Rings. The action sequences are incredibly riveting and innovative, placing the main character in situations where she needs to act smart. Jerry Goldsmith's music plays a vital part in the narrative. Not only it develops characters in a meaningful way, but it helps the story move forward with fun and entertaining songs. Once again, the action set pieces are also elevated by this score, which offers a whole other cinematic layer. Technically, Mulan is one of Disney's best animated flicks ever.However, as usual, the two pillars of any film are what people end up saving in their hearts and memory: story and characters. With so many writers attached to screenplay credits, I'm genuinely surprised Mulan has such a well-written, well-structured, emotionally resonating narrative. Packed with culturally significant storylines, it's hard not to feel enthralled by Mulan's (Ming-Na Wen) arc. A daughter who goes to war by stealing her old father's spot, protecting him from certain death, while also trying to honor her family. A woman who wants to be more than just a wife to some man. Fighting against the menacing Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army, but also against condescending stereotypes and ancient society rules.Ming-Na Wen gives Mulan a powerful voice worth remembering. After more than twenty years, her journey is still an inspiring tale not only to every woman and young girl on the planet, but to everyone who lays eyes on this movie. Captain Li Shang (BD Wong) also has his own arc of trying to prove himself worthy of being called Captain. Against all the odds, he still trains his troops and honors his own father. Ling (Gedde Watanabe), Yao (Harvey Fierstein), and Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo) are hilarious, but also essential to help save China from the enemy. Shan-Yu works perfectly as an intimidating presence, even though his motivations follow the generic villain formula.Now, prepare yourselves because my only issue with the film might be a hot take. I'm sure that as a kid, I loved Mushu and all of his jokes. He also has a compelling storyline in the same way as other characters. However, watching the film now, I can only hear Eddie Murphy perform a few jokes like a standup routine. When I listen to Mushu, I don't think ""oh, that's Mushu"". I think ""that's Eddie Murphy"". It's a remarkably somber, dark movie to match Disney's trademark humor, so the tone's balance must be perfect for it to work. Mushu might bring the necessary levity with a lighthearted joke here and there, but overall, he's the main reason why sometimes the film loses track of when to take things seriously and when to be funny.All in all, Mulan is one of the most culturally significant animated classics that Disney possesses. Even after two decades, its story inspires every single person who sets eyes in this magnificent piece of cinema. Its emotionally compelling narrative is packed with epic action sequences elevated by a memorable score, which also helps develop characters and carry the story forward. The eponymous character's arc still resonates with many people today: a journey of proving one's self-worth, family, and breaking stereotypes. With a terrific voice cast, almost every character holds a captivating storyline with their own clear motivations. Visually, it has a cinematic feel that no other Disney animated flick owns. Tonally, the balance could be better. The tragic, somber, dark war is present throughout the whole runtime, and while some levity and humor are definitely welcome, some jokes stand out as unnecessary, and Eddie Murphy's Mushu is way too silly during certain moments. Having in mind the target audience, one can't complain too much. It's a little nitpick in an otherwise phenomenal movie, one that I recommend to every reader so that you can all be inspired by it like so many people all around the world.Rating: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It da Man. Sort of.,"When I was like 6 years old I think I bought the VHS with birthday money and I watched it over and over.This is a movie I don't think I'll ever stop rewatching. As good as it is that feminism is getting more and more popular, we unfortunately have too many writers who think they can score brownie points by waving the black and purple flag without anything to say about a struggles of women. Ocean's 8, Brave and that god awful Dracula Adaptation in 2019 just pandered to the audience by telling them what they wanted to hear at the expense of well developed characters and good story telling.Mulan is therefor perhaps even more relevant now than ever as what a good empowered female movie should actually look like, and this is over a decade before #metoo.A lot of this is to do with Mulan herself. She is a good character because she is neither a helpless damsel in distress like Snow White nor the opposite problem of a character that has no personality beyond being practically perfect in every except in having no real personality, like Hermione Granger.She is clearly smart and resourceful from her dog powered chicken feeding device (It's a lot more simple than I make it sound) but when she enlists in the army she is as much out of her depth as anyone but she has the capacity to rise to the challenge in a believable way and they don't spend too much time on it. Mulan is the perfect fusion of relatable underdog and credible hero. While in a lot of comparable movies, the human protagonist is almost one of the blandest with the anthropomorphic help carrying the show, but she has perhaps the most personality of any pre-Tangled ""Princess"".We have not only an internal conflict of a person not knowing where they belong but also a material one in Mulan trying to spare her father military service and the too strands coalesce so elegantly in this story of overcoming the self, of friendships emerging between initially hostile parties and of also of the futility of war in a mature and subtle way (""A girl worth fighting--"" cue reality check). One really gets a vivid sensation of the destruction of armed conflict in a way one typically doesn't see in the ""family"" movie.It ticks all the other boxes you expect it too and more: the music, not just the songs but the intense score, the immersive sense of local color juxtaposed to the austerity of battle, the comedy, the pathos, the impeccable structuring of the story and intense images (Mulan must have worn the most easily removied make-up ever but I don't care), that all come together in a feature that is more of a treat each time.My only real qualm is an unsavoury spitting attempt but that's a small thing.This is what a feminist family movie looks like.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney has gone bananas !,"What a miracle : I didn't need one single Kleenex during a Disney movie. After the already 'different' Hercules, Disney now brings us Mulan, a story based on a Chinese poem. You might have thought that it would turn out to be very serious, but really, this is the funniest Disney-movie I've ever seen. But, technically, I think (to my humble opinion Mr.Disney), the movie is not so good. I know that the studios often change styles the last couple of years (like in Hercules, which was also technically very good), but this style didn't pleased me at all. Maybe they tried to imitate the cheap Chinese/Korean/Japanese productions that we often see on tv. (no, it wasn't THAT bad). I always use 'The Sleeping Beauty' from Disney as a reference to technical perfection, as that is the best Disney movie in my opinion. It is not possible to classify Mulan between the other 'Disneys', but it was superb, with Disney displaying drag queens etc. Is this film banned in Texas ?",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mulan,"This Disney film proves to be a mature take on the ancient Chinese legend as well as being an entertaining watch throughout. The beautiful animation feels inspired through Ancient Chinese drawings giving the film a flair most other Disney films lack. The story and message are also powerful and is perfectly portrayed by its subtleties in visuals alone and characters that are relatable and human. The songs are catchy and further illustrates the characters journeys. Despite the epic and emotional nature of the film, a minor flaw can only be found in a useless love interest subplot and goofy side characters that take away from the seriousness of the story being told. However this film is a triumph in storytelling and animation, crafting a tale that is emotional, epic, and definitely worth a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Mulan,"Mulan is a heart warming story of a young women finding herself, as she goes on a selfless journey to protect her father from getting killed, however doing this she puts her own life in danger. Through the course of the movie Mulan is fighting a formidable foe and against stereotype, if anyone say through her disguise she could be killed on the spot, as women weren't aloud to do this in ancient china. The humor in this Disney movie appeals to all ages, throughout the movie you find yourself laughing, part of this is due to Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy.Additionally, this movie begins with Mulan going to a matchmaker to become married, however when the matchmaker declares that Mulan has brought dishonor on her family tensions run high. Meanwhile, Shan Yu, is going to attack China, the emperor orders that all men fight in the war, unfortunately Mulan is an only child, her dad has already fought in a previous war and is injured. That night Mulan runs away, her family is worried as they know if anyone finds out she is a women she will be killed. In the end Mulan saves China and falls in love.

Thank you Disney for this amazing movie !,"Mulan is a well-known movie in the world nowadays, but for the people who still didn't watch this amazing movie, watch it immediately ! As many people knows, Mulan is an ancient folktale in Chinese history. It tells the story of Mulan, a young chinese woman, who disguised herself as a man and go to war to protect her country instead of her aged father, and then she'll have to hide her true identity !Even thought the story is a bit modified from the original by Disney, that's what makes this movie more accessible for children and more funny. All the small references and jokes all allong the movie makes you laugh in the middle of a war ! Mulan is strong, brave and smart woman who doesn't want to be married and it debunks the idea of the perfect ending for a female character. It's one of the first, if it's not the first, female character who doesn't follow the rules and who fight the villain, here the invaders Huns. The scenario, the musics, the backgrounds, the characters...all in that movie makes you fall for it ! Thank you Ming-Na-Wen for giving Mulan your voice.

Mulan is the perfect film for challenging gender norms. That is why I reviewed it during international women's month.,"I might feel nostalgic for Mulan or A Bug's Life because they premiered the year when I was born, but that could just be a special coincidence, and I really like them because I am moved by their message and realize they do not get enough attention like other Disney or Pixar films around their time. Fa Mulan was terrific for sneaking into the war against Shan Yu and pretending to be a man to prove women can fight equally as well as the men. Ming-Na Wen, BD Wong, Eddie Murphy, James Hong, Miguel Ferrer, June Foray and many others brought their A-game for voice acting. If you liked Fa Mulan, you should check out her daughter Lonnie in the Descendants trilogy, particularly in the second movie. Since the Descendants films are live-action despite being based on animated Disney, and Ming-Na Wen was also a great live actress in Agents of SHIELD, I believe Ming-Na Wen herself would be a much better live-action Mulan than who actually played Mulan in the live-action remake. It really helps more that Ming-Na Wen is old enough to be Dianne Doan's mom, and Dianne views her as a motherly figure because she enjoyed Mulan as a kid. Another big reason why I admire Mulan is because the film writers at Disney did a much better job with Chinese culture here than when The Aristocats had a Chinese cat play a piano with chopsticks.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Mulan (inspiring, brillant, fantastic)","I was wary at first when I first started watching Mulan as back in 1998 when the film was released, there was not much positively said towards women in society so I did not have much hope that this movie would be able to pull off such a powerful women lead back in a time when women were perceived to be lower down in class compared to men.However, this movie starts out to be one of the best female lead movies that I have watched in a long time. Going by the time in which the movie was made Pam Coats did an amazing job for producing the movie and Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft brilliantly directed the movie in a way to focus on Mulan's journey from a small maiden to a warrior of the army in China and receiving praise from the emperor.This film is a fantastic movie to show the power then women can hold and the equality that should be faced towards both men and women.

The Animated Movie Disney Released In My Birth Year!,"My 20th birthday is today, so in honor of the year, I am writing reviews of movies from that year.Disney released this movie, Mulan, 2 months prior. And it's very good.If you have not seen this movie, you must not be near my age. The story, then, if that is the case, follows Mulan, a Chinese girl who is upset that she can't ""honor"" her family, which is proven after failing the expectations of a matchmaker, who is seeking a proper husband for her. So when war is proclaimed, she disguises herself as a man to fight in place of her sickly father.What positives can I say about Mulan? Well, it's a Disney movie. It has a great story, songs, and the animation is great.It has some of the most memorable songs(Roger Ebert would disagree, it lost half a star from him for that.) Such songs include: Reflection, A Girl Worth Fighting For,Honor To Us All,and my personal favorite: Make A Man Out Of You.(Which made me cry as a kid, for some reason.)Most of the cast members you may not not know, Ming-Na Wen(known for The Joy Luck Club) voices Mulan.(Would you have known that had I not told you?)The most famous one stands out, not just for his popularity, but since it's this comedian's only G-rated movie on his resume.

Fun little adventure.,"First take: admittedly not one of my favorite films Disney has done, mostly serviceable, yet also, like with most of their films, there is an easy, watchable likeability to it, and it's never boring, it just didn't live up to other standards I may unrealistically have set.The acting: the main lead is great. She's charming and has a great voice for a kit of the songs. As do the rest. We have to sidekicks and meaning if not a tad over the top villains, and they are playing well, despite a dose of stock.The songs:
All great, all memorable, here we are treated to 3 tracks that are very catchy indeed. They all progress the story and comment on the situation. The standout is easily Make a man out of you.The Animation:
Classic hand drew beauty here. A lot of backgrounds the leap out due to their sheer size, plenty of expressive faces and a nice imperial aesthetic that blends well with the culture however accurate.The story:
Maybe it doesn't hold up as much now or has been done so many more times and better, but a story of female empowerment, especially back then, before it really blew up, should be praised and respected. Also, a character who fights for her family and what's right.Final take:

Plus, it has a female protagonist who isn't just another damsel in distress or another girlish princess. This is the heroine that works on so many levels. Not only that, there's also a wisecracking dragon (voiced by Eddie Murphy, and one of the few films I enjoyed of his) and many Asian-American actors and actresses in the cast (some of them are actually Japanese, but they did well).

"A beautiful, adventurous and fun Disney film!","This is Disney's 36th full-length animated feature, a story about Mulan, a young Chinese maiden who doesn't quite fit in as being the perfect bride and one to bring honor to her family. She also learns that her weakened and limp father is called into the army in order to battle the invading Huns. Fearing for her father's life, Mulan disguises herself as a male soldier and takes his father's place in the army. The spirits of her ancestor want to spare Mulan and inadvertently sends their disgraced former dragon-guardian, Mushu, to bring her back. What follows is a breathtaking adventure where Mulan, trying to prove that she can do things right, attempts to fit in with the other soldiers and train well enough to battle the Huns.The film has the suspense, thrills and somberness of any war-themed movies, but it is counterbalanced with the laugh-out-loud comedy and humor provided by Mushu and Mulan's fellow ragtag soldier-trio team of Yao, Ling and Chien-Po. Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy, gave the same witty, no-nonsense, hilarious and crackpot personality of the actor. Ming-Na voiced Mulan and gave a smoothing and gentle, yet determined portrayal of the character. I especially like Pat Morita's commanding, dignified and wise portrayal of the Emperor and his line, ""No matter how the wind hows, the mountain cannot bow to it,"" was my favorite.The movie is made in beautiful animation and great visual effects, highlighting many characteristics of the Chinese culture like the Great Wall of China, the Forbidden City, a Dragon Dance, traditional Chinese robes, a game of Chinese Chess and a spectacular fireworks show. Directors Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook created a non-stop fun and exciting Disney film along with a fabulous story-writing team. And, Composer Jerry Goldsmith provided a brilliant music score, with his haunting and commanding theme when the Huns come charging down the snowy hill being my favorite.Overall, I believe this is one of Disney's best films and one of my favorite animated films all together - beautiful animation, great music, exciting story and memorable characters, with a very touching emphasis on honor to yourself and your family.Grade A",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

But thats about it. I didn't really like the villan or the love interest very much. But I do like the story. An over all decent, very well made disney film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Disney Film I have seen so far!,"We all have heard of many different Disney princesses. However, this one probably takes the cake. First of all, she is Asian (hooray for Disney being more culturally diverse) and she is like many women who just are not the type who adore being girly and feminine. This story follows Mulan, a girl in ancient China who is having a hard time blossoming into a so called 'woman'. China is freshly at war, and hence are recruiting a man from every single family to fight it. As Mulan's father is old and sick and there are no other males in her family, she decides to take the risk, dress up as a man and take his place. This is one of the first Disney films that addresses gender roles, and how they do not necessarily need to be followed to be a good man or woman. The movie is directed in a light-hearten fashion, with quite a bit of comedy and a lot less romance. It also is a story of personal development, and how rough experiences can teach you things you would never imagine. Great for anyone, even if you are not a fan of Disney!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of Disney's best films and it holds up over time,There's a reason why Mulan has grown I. Popularity over time and it's cause it holds up not like some other Disney films.

One of the best Disney movies of the time period,"PROS:
Incredible music!Incredible story!Incredible characters!Incredible actors/actresses!A bit of violence without showing gore onscreen, which is something you barely ever see, but I love because I can be a sensitive person but still like gory endings for villains and stuff.CONS:
None! This movie, along with the Little Mermaid, are two of the best movies of the late 80s and 90s. And while I know many people will disagree, this is just my opinion. I just think that this Chinese legend turned into one of the most impressive Disney movies ever, with Frozen, The Little Mermaid, and others. Love it and if you haven't watched it WATCH IT I ALMOST GUARNTEE THAT YOU WILL LOVE IT.Thank you for reading my review.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fantastic, thrilling adventure with a great message for kids","Fa Mulan is by far my favourite Disney protagonist. If we're simply talking about Disney heroines, that might be Jasmine from Aladdin or Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but Mulan is far more than a simple heroine. She's the hero of her story. She is the one that causes things to happen. Sure, there have been lots of female protagonists before her, but in their case it was always the case of things happening to them and them reacting to it. Mulan's story is entirely her own doing. She didn't need to go to war for her dad. She chose to, despite all the problems it would bring her. It's a small distinction, but an important one.Furthermore, it's an amazing film even without our badass name-taking, sword-swinging, Hun-defeating, pole-climbing, ancient-bazooka-wielding hero. After a couple of rather flawed Renaissance films, it returns to form with all aspects of the film working beautifully together and with no discernible faults. Sure, some people claim that Shan Yu, the villain, is a tad boring and one-dimensional. And yeah, I can see where they're coming from, but personally I like him. He's menacing and unstoppable, with an intellect to match. He attacks China because it's there, no other reason needed. Having him singing villain songs would water him down.Then there's of course Mushu, the dragon guardian, voiced by Eddie Murphy. And yeah, that is an odd, odd casting choice, which I'm not one hundred percent convinced works. Sure, he is the best source of comedy in the film by far and it's very good comedy. One of Murphy's best roles, in fact. But he is also pretty distracting from time to time, keeping us from fully immersing ourselves. It doesn't really ruin the film, and I'm not convinced that a more traditional voice would have worked any better either, but it is a thing to ponder about.The songs are also great, though perhaps not Disney's best effort either. Though, keeping in mind that this is Disney, that's a pretty high bar to reach, so you cannot really fault the movie for failing. And they are good songs, with I'll Make a Man Out of You being a contender for that elusive best effort status.I love that this movie exists. That Fa Mulan as a character exists. That there is a movie that uncompromisingly tells us an adventure story with a female hero, in this age where we still cannot get any movies with female leads, unless they're romantic comedies or dramas about the difficulties of love. That's thankfully slowly changing and this movie will be remembered as an important milestone on that journey.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the Best of Disney,"I really loved Mulan. It was a great movie that actually had an interesting story that could be enjoyed by adults as well as their children. I think Lion King and Beauty and the Beast might be better films over all but I also appreciate Mulan for other reasons. First of all and most important, I think it's great that the hero of Mulan is not the typical white skinned princess waiting for a prince to rescue her like you get in most Disney movies. There still aren't many of those (Jasmine and Pocahontas are the only other non white Disney heroines I can think of) so it's definitely welcome and a step in the right direction!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Darn Good,"A lot.to like in this movie from the storyline to the simple-yet-beautiful animation to the humor of Eddie Murphy, etc. I take away a couple stars for the following reasons:
(1) Getting hit over the head with the female empowerment message. By the end, Mulan is basically a superhero. The finale at the castle was just ridiculous.(2) The bad choice of music to start the credit roll: Stevie Wonder doing a loud, up-tempo number with harmonic. WTH did that have to do with anything that came before? Totally took me out of the mood.The reason I watched this movie today is that I read a scholarly paper on Disney princesses. The writer argued that Mulan was the genesis of the present era of progressive female leads.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Delight for all Disney fans,","Mulan is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic voice cast. It's a very sweet, beautifully animated film that will surely please all Disney fans, it stands as a classic animated film in the same vein as Aladdin and The Lion King does, it also has some unforgettable songs that you will find yourself humming long after you've watched the movie, such as Reflection and I'll Make a Man Out of You. The only thing I think this movie is missing is a strong factor of Disney animation films, comic relief, I know that Mushu is a fantastic character and brilliantly voiced by Eddie Murphy, but he dosen't have as much scenes as he should have to lighten the tone of the film, it takes itself too seriously at times and it's story can be very heavy for a younger audience, but we have to hand it to Disney for taking a huge risk on openly dealing with war. The film, unlike most of Disney's animated movies, is quite intense, it will keep you at the edge of your seat a lot, and once we get deep in to battle, it becomes very hard to believe that an animation is making you feel so much excitement, with a very powerful story. Beautifully animated with stunning music, I would recommend Mulan to anyone looking for a good family film.A young lady takes her fathers place in the army by disguising herself as a man.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A girl worth fighting for,"MULAN is one of those movies that I don't count among my favorites, but I still enjoy watching it now and then. It's a pleasant movie, a gem from late in the Disney Renaissance that benefits from its mostly understated strengths: Mulan is a great heroine, the art style evokes Chinese watercolor painting, and the songs are lovely. The ""girl power"" theme is presented in a non-preachy manner too, a rarity in current Hollywood movies which feel the need to hammer their points home. Mulan doesn't need to give speeches about why she's badass-- we see it in her actions, courage, and intelligence. About the only element I dislike is Mushu, but even he gets a good line in now and then.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A refreshing Disney heroine...,"Mulan is a very refreshing and entertaining story from Disney it's very loosely based upon chinese legend Mulan.What I enjoyed most was Mulan herself it's such a nice change of pace in terms of the Disney ""princess"" role. Yes she does share some of the same tropes as her counterparts, mainly being the being married off thing. That's been a very depressing theme that connects a lot of these types of characters unfortunately.However Mulan was a capable, strong willed, intelligent and very caring individual who risks her life for her father regardless of the consequences. She is also physically strong and very able to fight with both weapons and her hand to hand.I must admit I wish the villain had been more memorable but I did enjoy how this film focused more on Mulan and her story. It definitely feels one of the more character driven stories we've had from Disney. Eddie Murphy was also good although admittedly I just of Donkey whenever he spoke but still he was good fun nonetheless.Overall a very good character driven story where the Disney princess is more of a hero but still has heart.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Murphy did great job. There were some lines even that were spine chilling (Emperor's). Although the movie was very well paced and intelligently created, it was not perfect.

Struggles to break out of the Disney mold,"There's a lot to recommend about this film. It's animation style is a lot more Eastern-Chinese-than most of the Disney canon. There's a lyrical beauty to much of the vestas and characters. Likewise, the story-being concerned with honor, duty-is quite different from much of the Disney films. The film really tries to escape the Disney mold. The songs have less narrative weight placed on them. And the story is more complex than say Sleeping Beauty.Yet this came out at the tail end of the Disney Renaissance and it has a lot of the same tropes, abet better deployed than most animated films. Mulan has not one but two animals friends in cricket and her horse. Mushu-a wonderful, engaging character generally-is very much in the Genii mold of comedic sidekick.

"Very good, but its flaws keep it from achieving greatness.","Mulan is very well animated, very well written, and very well done. I want so much to give this a 10, but there is a few flaws that take away so much from it. First is the character Mushu. If they had made this without any Mushu this would have been a 10, but he is there. He takes away a lot of drama from the movie. In ""The Hunchback"" there was a comedic gargoyle character that took away a lot of drama, but he didn't take up a lot of screen time. Mushu has a lot of screen time to soak up a very large amount of drama, and he isn't even funny. I really wish they took this a little more seriously. Another flaw is Mulan's man voice that is painfully awkward. Although it isn't in the film as much as Mushu so it isn't very bad. Then there is the romance of Mulan and Shang. With other Disney films the romance is needed for the film. With this film we don't need a romance. This film is supposed to be inspiring girls to be who they want to be not just ""girls"", but Mulan ends up falling in love with someone just like every other Disney female. Despite these flaws I really like this movie. It just had so much going for it, and it fell short of what it could have been.3 and a 1/2 stars out of 4",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mulan is perfect... the movie... maybe?,"It was really hard to decide to go with a 10 or a 9 (also kind of not that important at all, of course), because the things I ""dislike"" or can point out as ""not good"" are very small and not super relevant.For example I would've loved the same movie with actors speaking chinese. I really dislike the first two songs, but both are short and more forgettable than awful. Last thing is Mushu, which is a somewhat funny character thanks to Eddie Murphy's performance, but just doesn't fit the tone of the movie at all.Other than that, I love the story, writing, characters and in particular our protagonist Mulan.

I also like to see more Asian based content as it seems most of the blockbusters today tend to be more Western/European based.

"I just rewatched it after 15 or 20 years,","I just rewatched it after 15 or 20 years, and even though it's not a masterpiece,I really loved it a lot.The animation is visually very attractive, the score is beautiful, and the script is great. I'm not really a fan of musicals, but the song sequences actually make sense in this particular film. And it doesn't feel pointless; those musicals actually contribute a lot to the story and character development. The ""I'll Make a Man Out of You"" sequence is a great example of just how well used every minute is in this movie.It felt a little rushed, but I definitely prefer this to a slow, boring film. It tells a beautiful story, and in such a short time, I was actually really impressed. It's not an easy thing to present so many characters and put that much personality and life into each one of them with so little dialogue and time. The movie is really funny, but it also has its dramatic, sad, and even exciting moments, making it enjoyable for every type of audience. Over all, I believe it was masterfully executed. Finally breaking the Disney princess mold, it definitely deserves more popularity. There are some things that could've been done better, in my opinion, like fewer songs (one more would've been too much for me). I don't really love the Asian accents. I think it's unnecessary since the movie is in English. It would've been nice for them to build more around the villains and have them have a more belivable motif besides just being lawful evil. But it's a movie tought out for little girls and boys, and it made me tear up at 28. I think it would be unfair not to rate this movie at least a well-deserved 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

She is strong, resourceful, and determined, embodying the qualities of a true warrior. Her journey is inspiring as she overcomes numerous challenges and proves that bravery and honor are not limited by gender.The supporting characters, including the comical Mushu and the stoic Captain Li Shang, add depth and humor to the narrative.

A brilliant story that you can't get enough of even if you watch it several times.,"I swear I haven't seen a more beautiful fairy tale than Mulan. You can forget about the second part and the film with actors - they are not worth watching.Mulan is a fairy tale based on a Chinese legend. However, Disney made it have a more positive ending. Mulan is a girl who wants to prove something to everyone - to her family that she is valuable, to her father that she does not harm the family's honor, to men - that she does not need them and is as strong as them, to her ancestors that she is worthy of them. It is a film full of message. It shows how strong a woman can be and how much she can achieve. Mulan is conflicted about the reasons behind her decision. The dragon and the cricket, who are her faithful companions, bring cheerfulness. The ending is touching and shows how to win people over by simply having the will to fight and a good heart. This is not a story about love, but it shows that in due time it will come too. The film also shows that not everyone is destined for the same thing and everyone can follow a different path of their own choosing. Every song in the movie is brilliant. I've watched this cartoon probably about 15 times and whenever I feel bad or sad I come back to it. The power and message that radiate from it are enveloping.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
childhood movie,Mulan was my childhood Disney movie I absolutely loved it as a child and I still very much do. Mulan really stands out among all the great Disney movies for me because of how unique and different it is. the story of a young woman disguising herself as a man in the army in order to save her father dosnt sounds like your typical Disney movie and it isn't which is why its so great. the animation is absolutely stunning the attention to detail is just flawless. the characters are all charming and memorable especially Mulan herself who stands out as easily the best Disney heroine of all time. her sidekick Mushu voiced by the very talented Eddie Murphy is absolutely hilarious and a total scene stealer. the movie has many emotional and powerful scenes that to this day still make me cry every time I watch them. the movie also has many great action scenes that are always fun to watch.

My very involved reasoning on why I liked but didn't love this movie,"It seems what makes this movie stand out to most of its fans is the fact that Mulan is a female action hero and not a rich princess, she's Asian and not white and it shows little girls that they can and should be treated equally as boys. However, I'm not a kid, I don't have kids, I'm not a sexist, or a racist, so none of these things affects me looking at this as anything more than just a cartoon. A cartoon that's the intellectual property of a multibillion-dollar company that had nothing more in mind than making the most money they could by exploiting a market of fans dissatisfied with the status quo that Disney themselves perpetuated with movies that had white women waiting for a rich handsome prince charmings to save them. They did those movies when it served them and stopped when it didn't. I don't say that try and sound like I've found out their big secret, I say that to say this movie is just okay to me, because of MY perspective. However, I do respect and understand that there are other ways of looking at this movie that would elevate it to others. But just not me, Eddie Murphy was funny, the villain was pretty forgettable and the love story was so tacked on that if felt like something done in protest, as if they filmmakers said, this is my movie and if you cut it off here it's done, but let it play a few minutes more and you have the studio mandated ending, but I also could be way off. Not bad, not great, good.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I love Disney,"Disney did it again. With the right blend of humor, romance, action, and most of all, emotion. Watching this now is quite the different experience than when I first saw it as a child. I understand more fully the cultural and familial obstacles presented against Mulan. I noticed some things that I didn't catch the first viewing. Again, Mulan is a tale of identity, about trying to find out and discover who you are. Like Hercules, The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, Frozen, you name it, Disney is all about identity and rising against the norm and what society expects of you. Obviously, as it's a Western commercial production, it makes many cross-cultural flaws -- the characters have too-exaggerated facial features to supposed to look Chinese, for instance.It being Disney, its soundtrack is amazing, we all know ""I'll Make a Man out of You"" and ""Reflection,"" just to name two. It has a great voice acting cast (i.e. Eddie Murphy as Mushu), and it ends very happily for all the good guys. Some things are a little rushed, I thought, towards the end concerning certain characters but still, Mulan is a film you need to see, no matter what your age. It will impel you to strike forth against the societal construct we know as ""normal,"" that is, to be like everybody else. Who gives a damn about what other people think? You only have one life. Make the most of it, carpe diem.Everything taken into account, Mulan I'd say surpasses Hercules, but lies below The Lion King. Worth watching a second (or first) time when you're at least of high school age.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney's Most Underrated Masterpiece.,"Walt Disney created the masterpiece that is Disney Land and in that came some of the most iconic characters in history. One of the most underrated characters in the Disney Universe is Mulan, in my opinion. Mulan is a strong woman trying to find her place in China. Mulan is a fantastic movie with Eddie Murphy as a funny sidekick, before he was Donkey, and one of the creepiest Disney villains. Mulan is one of the better Disney movies but why does it not seem that way? Why it is not considered one of the best? Well, let's get into it.The story behind Mulan is rather basic. The Huns, led by Shan-Yu invade China for no real reason. I think that is a real flaw in the movie itself. The villains don't have a rhyme or reason to what they do. They just do it. They are evil for the sake of being evil. Shan-Yu leads the Huns and his haunting theme music is enough to scare any kid but still he is overlooked. This movie took a lot of risks for a kid's movie. There is a war going on, many people die, you do not see it but its implied, and the main protagonist is a woman. Now that is not a sexist remark but most of the memorable Disney movies has the lead woman be a damsel and not a strong leader like Mulan.I really like Mulan's character. She is incredibly relatable. She is a young girl trying to find where she belongs. She says it in one of the most memorable songs in any Disney movie. ""When will my reflection show who I am inside?"" She eventually goes to war in her father's place. That right there is courageous and foolish. Women are supposed to stay in the house and make babies in China. They are forbidden to fight in war. She does this anyway, and yet she isn't considered one of the greatest characters ever. Mulan is somebody people can look up to and the movie does an amazing job of portraying her.Eddie Murphy has a special talent for voice acting. Mushu is the lovable dragon that kids enjoy. He brings comedy and many memorable moments. From the first time I saw Mushu as a small kid I fell in love with him. He too is looking to find where he belongs with the ancestors of Mulan's family. The obvious similarities between the two main characters are enjoyable. Thankfully Mushu didn't take too much of the spotlight.Disney is known for its lovable characters and evil villains but also for its music. Mulan captures some Chinese culture in the song in this movie and they are most memorable. The first song is a bit odd if you listen to the words. It is catchy and fun to sing along to but is basically about the worth of women in China. Look beautiful for a guy to want you and make babies to defend the Emperor. It is little things like this that could be why Mulan does not get the recognition it deserves but the rest of the songs make up for it. A Girl Worth Fighting for is a personal favorite along with Make a Man Out of You. I think I know every word. The songs are well placed and when one ends it reaches the saddest part of the movie. It goes from a high point to a low point. It is interesting for a Disney movie to have this much emotion.Mulan has many relationships in the movie. The obvious one with her father and Shang but I particularly like the relationship with the three side characters. I'm talking about the bald guy, the thin guy, and the short angry guy. These three are c0molete opposites from each other and bounce off each other perfectly. They are side characters to fall in love with and quote. They have moments that are classic in the movie too.Overall, Mulan is a great movie that is unfortunately overlooked. People may disagree with me but think about it. You ask somebody what their favorite Disney movie is they probably will not say Mulan. Mulan is extremely underrated and I think it is because it has some controversial parts. The movie itself has everything a Disney movie needs and it also got trashed with a sequel. If you ask me I won't say Mulan is my favorite Disney movie, that is a close one between Hercules, but it stands in my top three with ease. And of course it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. I imagine I will get backlash for thinking it is underrated and the reasons I believe so so please respectfully let me know in the comments.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Osamu Tezuka's Ribbon No Kishi/Princess Knight in Disney Princess format,"I don't know why this movie to me feels exactly like that, a Ribbon No Kishi spin on the Disney Princesses storytelling format just with a chinese woman instead of a princess/prince from a magical land as the protagonist. Some scenes are also very reminescent of that series...but hey, we're talking of 1) a character born out of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and 2) of a company who already took the ideas for their multibillionar blockbusters (The Lion King) from Osamu Tezuka's other works, so we're used to that. The animation is good, the themes of searching for your path amongst a world that is against your beliefs are well executed, the only detrimental things I see of this are the absolutely lame main villain and his companions (I get it, this story was not focused on him, but still he's as lame, boring and uninspired as it can get, hands down the worst Disney Princess villain together with Maleficent) and some songs that don't stick to your brain, in particular the ending credits of Christina Aguilera.

Probably in my top 5 animation movies EVER!!!!,"Honestly, Mulan was just so incredible. I mean, it just had everything; pizazz, comedy, romance, great action scenes, and yet this is a Disney movie that doesn't stand out above the others. I loved it so much, and I hope it is seen by a lot more people, because it truly is a masterpiece, full of happiness, laughter, and interest through out the entire movie. I especially loved Mushu and The Grandmother. They were just so hysterical. Oh, and don't even get me started on the amazingly catchy songs!!!! This was wonderful entertainment, and I am glad to see it has such a high rating and so many positive comments. Mulan is yet another brilliant success from your masterminds at Disney.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of Disney's best,This film is a childhood and adult good favourite of mine. It's a beautiful and heart warming film. It's so so good and would highly recommend seeing it.I would be surprised if there are people who haven't seen or even heard of Mulan. especially now that the live action film is coming out from Disney.I think everyone will find something to love about this film.It's Disney magic at its very best!!,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mulan,"A 1998 animated musical adventure film by Walt Disney Studios, is the tale of a young girl named Fa Mulan who poses as a man to replace her ailing father in the Chinese army. With its stunning animation, powerful feminism and heroic ideas, and memorable characters, this film is a true classic and a favorite among Disney fans.One of Mulan's most stunning features is the animation. The gorgeous hand-drawn animation brilliantly brings the scenes and characters of the movie to life. The attention to detail and color are magnificent, from the opening sequence, which is located in a lovely Chinese village, to the dramatic battle scenes against the Hun army. The animation successfully takes the viewer back in time to prehistoric China and offers a timeless quality.A lot of viewers may identify with and look up to Mulan herself as a character. She differs from the standard Disney princess. She is a strong, independent young woman who isn't afraid to challenge social expectations and take chances in order to defend her family and nation. Mulan gains valuable knowledge about determination, bravery, and the true meaning of honor as she goes through the military training process and engages in combat with her fellow soldiers.The movie's themes of feminism and courage are also strong and inspirational. Mulan's quest to establish herself as a soldier is not only about rejecting the expectations put on women in her society, but also about winning the respect of her fellow soldiers. Mulan stands for the notion that gender stereotypes shouldn't limit women's potential because they are capable of anything. Viewers of all ages can be inspired by her bravery in overcoming danger and standing up for what is right.The supporting cast is both entertaining and memorable. Throughout the movie, Mushu, Mulan's dragon companion, offers humor, and his clever one-liners are a highlight. The commander of the soldiers, Captain Li Shang, is a strong, competent person who comes to recognize Mulan's skills and fortitude as a fighter. And Grandmother Fa, Mulan's sensible and encouraging grandma, steals the show with her witty remarks and undying affection for her granddaughter.The soundtrack to the movie is especially noteworthy since it includes timeless songs like ""Reflection"" and ""I'll Make a Man Out of You."" The songs are memorable and catchy, and they go nicely with the topics and tone of the movie. The songs help to develop the plot and provide the audience an emotional connection to the characters.Let's sum up by saying that Mulan is a timeless masterpiece that has delighted and inspired viewers for years. It's no surprise that this movie has remained a fan favorite for so long given its gorgeous animation, strong feminism and daring themes, and lovable characters. Everyone who enjoys Disney movies or is searching for a motivational tale about bravery and tenacity must watch Mulan. The whole family can watch this movie together, and it's guaranteed to make an impact. I really recommend this animated movie of Mulan.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Perfectly crafted, beautiful message, amazing job Disney","I feel like this movie just doesn't really have anything to really complain about. Does it have issues. Yes. I think sometimes the humor doesn't really fit the tone, I SOMETIMES found the side characters to be annoying, but everything else is just perfect. I think the concept of Mulan is just so well realized in this movie. It is so effective about telling how Mulan turned into the hero of China, even though she started out so incapable. She genuinely earned her achievements over the men. It is just a good message for young girls: Effort and hard work will pay off. I think the side characters are funny, and Mushu is great most of the time. The emotions of this movie are felt so well. I did find there to be some filler that I didn't really find interesting, but wasn't that bad. The music is genuinely amazing, the animation is also very well done. I also found the oppression towards woman to be quite realistic. The villain isn't that complex, but he is still threatening and very well designed. Some of the action and ending is a little childish for my taste, but I still enjoy the other parts. I just love this film. It has some minor flubs, but I just simply look past them for the most part. I am going to put this at a 9/10 just because it has some flaws. But, Every movie has flaws. I just found to impact, experience, and craftsmanship to be 10/10. But flaws still exist, my 10/10 movies have problems, but the peaks are simply higher and the valleys aren't as bad, even though this movies flaws are not bad, they just could be better. I just love this movie still, Good job Disney.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Mulan: A Timeless Tale of Honor and Courage,"""Mulan"" is a classic Disney animated film that tells the story of a young woman who takes her father's place in the army to fight against invaders threatening their homeland. The film is both an entertaining and educational adventure that showcases important values such as courage, determination, and honor.One of the standout elements of ""Mulan"" is its excellent animation. From the sweeping landscapes to the intricate details in character designs, every frame is a feast for the eyes. The film's soundtrack, which includes memorable songs such as ""Reflection"" and ""I'll Make a Man Out of You,"" adds to the overall enjoyment of the movie.The voice cast, led by Ming-Na Wen as Mulan and Eddie Murphy as the wisecracking dragon Mushu, delivers strong performances that bring their characters to life. The film's humor, while sometimes cheesy, is still able to elicit a few laughs and provides a welcome break from the intense action scenes.One of the film's biggest strengths is its handling of cultural themes. ""Mulan"" is a tribute to Chinese culture and mythology, and the film's attention to detail in its representation of these elements adds depth and authenticity to the story. The film also has a strong message about the importance of following one's own path and breaking societal expectations, making it a timeless tale that still resonates with audiences today.Overall, ""Mulan"" is a must-watch for fans of Disney animated films and for anyone looking for a fun and inspiring adventure. The film's mix of action, humor, and heart make it a standout entry in the Disney canon.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best animations of all time. A must watch.,"Mulan is one of the films I watched when I was a little girl and also it is one of those films I love to this day. I don't know whether Mulan is just a legend or she really existed in the real world, but she is kind of a hero to me. I love her story of taking his father's place and went to war. It's so touching.I only know the Chinese version. So, I don't know her name really is Hua Mulan, or the surname is something and Mulan, but if it is, I'd say Disney got it wrong. I really don't like the surname Fa. Whenever I hear that surname Fa, it makes me annoyed. So, I prefer Hua.What makes me love Mulan is of course the story. And also it's amazing original score, especially, the tune of that scene where Mulan prepares herself to go to war and takes horse and leaves home. That scene is also one of my favourites.I think the original story doesn't have anything about dragon which is Mushu in this film. Disney put that part by themselves. But that part is also good too. Wherever Mushu appears, I find it quite funny. That's why I love Mushu.All in all, Mulan is an amazing animation which will never get old. Even it is, it's like old but gold. Hence, Mulan is one of those animations that everyone must watch at least once in their lives.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Brilliant movie from Disney,I got this as a present back in 1998 and I'm glad I own it on VHS.The film is about a young maiden who disguises herself as a man in order to save her people in China as her father is unable to fight in the war. Along the way she meets a hilarious dragon(who looks more like a lizard than a dragon)voiced by Eddie Murphy and falls for a handsome captian named Shang.The story isn't your typical fairytale movie as its all about action and adventure. Seriously I have no idea why Mulan is a princess as she isn't royal at all. The whole film was edgy and excellent. The animation is very exquisite and the music is very good. The actress that voices Mulan is very good and this would have sucked big time if it weren't for funny man Eddie Murphy who saved this movie for me.

Underrated!,"Mulan is one of those Disney movies that really slipped through the cracks in the sense that I knew it existed, but there was never any desire to watch it.Until today.Mulan is a fantastic film. It's beautifully animated with some gorgeous action sequences, the voice talent is spectacular, it's got some infectious ear-worms that are guaranteed to stick with you after the film has ended. It serves up comedy and heart in equal measure in true Disney fashion, as well.Mulan, for those who may not know, tells the story of a young woman who disguises herself as a man to fight in a war against the Huns in the place of her elderly father, looking to honor her family. It's not an ""ugly cry"" kind of movie, but it's genuinely heart-warming. You want to see Mulan succeed and honor her family, and it builds to a rewarding conclusion.The only issue the film really has isn't the fault of the film at all, but rather of the lack of versatility in Eddie Murphy's voice and acting talents. It's hard to listen to much of Mushu without hearing Donkey from Shrek, and it ultimately takes away from the viewing experience. Sure, Eddie Murphy does the goofy, big-mouthed sidekick pretty well, but I think this film would've gone over much better for me with someone else in the role. Given what he would go on to do, it's too distracting and, while it's not a direct reflection on the quality of the movie, it is a reflection on the capabilities of the talent hired to do the film.It's disappointing that I'm only just now seeing Mulan, but I have absolutely no regrets in watching this film. It will most definitely be on my re-watch list going forward.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"No ""Lion King"",but not ""Hercules""","Starting in the late eighties, Walt Disney studios produced some entertaining animated pictures. By the mid-nineties, their films had become an assembly line product. ""Mulan"" steers this course, as a young innocent gains an important life lesson within a ninety minute package. Menacing villains, trendy colloquial language, and computer generated animation pervades throughout. There is a cute dragon creature, voiced by Eddie Murphy, traveling with Mulan that provides aid and comic relief. Murphy could have played this role like Robin Williams' genie in ""Aladdin"", but opts for a more humble approach. I admired a battle sequence on a snow covered mountain range and a minimal use of bland, forgettable songs. 2.5 out of 4 stars.",,Anonymous,Animation
Mephisto in Onyx,"Tony Bancroft directs ""Mulan"", an animated musical produced by Walt Disney studios and hailed by its makers as the first ""feminist"" Disney film. The plot? In dynastic China, a young girl named Mulan assumes the identity of a man in order to fight in the Emperor's army against marauding Huns. Mulan is portrayed as a budding feminist, a spunky young woman who abhors rigid gender roles, fights against sexism and believes that women should be celebrated for their brains and brawn rather than their bodies, bodices and/or domestic/sexual duties. In this regard she puts on pants, grabs a sword, slays barbarians and saves the lives of several men, most notably the Emperor of China. Significantly, in her final showdown with a muscular Hun, Mulan (and her male comrades) wears a dress. Her sidekicks are a lucky insect and a pint sized dragon, both creatures who, like Mulan, are underestimated and forced to conform to the rigid preconceptions of others. Like most supposedly ""progressive"" or ""feminist"" films, female empowerment here boils down to women proving that they can be as violent, barbaric, base and hyper-masculinist as men. This is not feminism, as conflict exists where none should.The film's intent and content clash in other ways: Mulan's supposedly ""feminist"" actions ultimately stem out of a duty toward her father (and his duties to the Emperor), idealised male and female bodies discriminate against anything less than ideal (almost everyone other than Mulan and her lover is a buffoon), the film is packed with stereotypes, portrays Mulan's victory as a victory of Western ideals over those thought to be more traditionally Chinese, is resolutely white, in real life the Emperors of China were as brutal as any Hun, and the early dynasties were themselves as sexist to men as they were women (hordes of men were castrated and made eunuchs to fulfil specific ""effeminate"" roles in dynastic politics). The film is less sexist and racially insensitive than is typical of Disney, but still grates.Disney has a history of taking stories from different cultures and sanitising them of anything ""too ethnic"". Here the film is based on the legend or ballad of Hua Mulan. The character has been ascribed to different dynastic periods (Sui, Tang, Ming etc), but Disney instead opted to set their film during the Han Dynasty. This allows the filmmakers to get away with creating a ""nice Emperor"" (China was somewhat progressive during this period) and use a type of ""Han Dynasty iconography"" that resembles more traditionally Japanese iconography (rose petals, samurai attire etc), which perhaps plays well to geographically confused Western audiences. The date of the movie is odd, the film conflating events and invasions that took place in different dynasties (bizzarely, its emperor, Zhou, and chief warrior, Shang, are named after separate dynastic periods).The film banalizes totems which mainstream culture oft associates with ""oriental"" or ""asian"" cultures. So we have lots of bamboo, dragon statues, great walls, plum blossoms, Chinese gardens, kung-fu, Chinese lanterns, Chinese fireworks, chopsticks, ink brushes, Chinese hair combs, pandas etc. It's wonderfully drawn, but all feels like the result of a corporate brainstorming session. As with most Disney films, anything remotely alien, alienating, hostile or strange is made to seem resolutely familiar and/or cleansed of all cultural and racial background.""Mulan"", the first Disney ""princess"" with a body count, would lead to a period in which Disney made a greater effort to target male audience members. She, and the princess of ""Tangled"", seem to mark a change in Disney princess body-types (younger, less ""womanly"", less curvaceous, more spunky and ""teenage""; the new sexual ideal). The film is wonderfully animated, very cool, some of its animation work has a primal quality, reminiscent of Ralph Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings"", only more abstract, and at times resembles minimalist Chinese ink paintings. The film possesses several exciting action sequences, its song-and-dance routines are less grating than usual, our lead has wonderfully expressive eyes, and a strong sexual undercurrent exists, as is typical of Disney.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.",,Anonymous,Animation
the story of mulan,"mulan is not the usually disney story about love and tenderness, no this movie is about honour, and doing what you must for achieving it, and if you fall in love in the middle there's no biggie. this movie tells us the true story of mulan, a chinese daughter that takes her father's place in the army because her father is to old for fighting. but that is not the only reason, she also wants to prove to herself that she is good at something, achieving honour to her and to her familly. once again walt disney scores, turning a truthful story in to a magic and beautiful animated movie. the animated movie is good, but could be better, but who cares, this movie isn't about the animation, is it about the spirit of it, it's about about the honour and achieveness of that honour. and you know what? it works, it works just fine, making mulan one of the greatest animated feature of walt disney",,Anonymous,Animation
A good but extremely uneven feature,"One of the more unique animated features from Disney set in Ancient China during the Han dynasty. When a ruthless tribal confederation breaches the Great Wall, the Emperor has no other choice but to declare conscription in defense of his country. Fearing the safety of her elderly father, the impetuous Mulan embarks on a daring mission to take his place. Well-crafted and interesting in spots, with a recurring theme of sexism, along with some striking animation, but the film revels more in its comedic overtones (specifically Murphy's wisecracking dragon sidekick Mushu who seems suited for another film) taking away from the presumably more serious central theme. With a short running time it's easy enough to sit through, but the overall approach to the material along with some of the casting choices are certainly questionable. **½",,Anonymous,Animation

The shots of the battle in the snow are rather impressive.Negatives:-Music:  The music in this movie is ABOMINABLE.  Boring, slow, un-catchy.  I was begging for the music parts to go by.-Secondary Characters:  Very uninteresting.  Especially the soldier characters.  They had absolutely no personality to them whatsoever.

Mulan made me cry...,"Because it was so horrible.  First and foremost, the animation was horrid. Where was all the detail?  All of the characters seemed to be floating about in a void.  There wasn't any distinctive features on any of the characters. Mulan looks like just another pretty face.  Second, the music was *terrible*.  Here was an opportunity to try out all sorts of esoteric instruments used in the Chinese culture and what do we get?  Classic, but timid, string arrangements, and, worst of all, bubble gum pop by 98 degrees and Donny Osmond to accompany the classic, but timid, plot formula.  And then there were the voices.  The little dragon-thing was annoying and the first Disney supporting character I ever wished would be erased by that goop in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"".  This film is so banal and sanitized without any other mission than to sell their crap szechuan sauce stuff that I cried. When I was ten, I dreamed of working for Disney after ""The Little Mermaid"" (despite the porno, which I wasn't aware of at that time).

It was about as good as Pocahontas, better than Aladdin and Hercules, but not quite as good as The Hunchback, to my opinion. The score was very very poor and not in the least memorable, with the exception of one title, maybe. I really adored the character design (much better than in Hercules), but had the feeling there wasn't very much effort put into creating detailed backgrounds, especially compared to recent non-Disney animated movies like Anastasia. It seems that Disney didn't really think of this film as a grand masterpiece to be remembered for the next few years, but more as a ""Let's do this film, until we can think of something we can REALLY put money into"". I was glad there wasn't that much Americanisation in the film like in Hercules, until I saw the ghosts dancing to disco rhythms... well, you can't have everything, I guess.

Three cheers for Mulan!,"Like most of us have recognized, Disney's animated features became downhill after their remarkable feature, The Lion King. I was pretty disappointed with movies like The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules, which missed the usual joy I got out of animated features from Disney. Mulan is definitely, in my opinion, the best movie since The Lion King. What does Mulan have that all the previous movies don't? For starters, Mulan lacks the Barbie figure from Pocahontas and helpless princess personality from Ariel and Jasmine. Mulan is one tough chick. In the beginning of the movie, we find that Mulan is having trouble becoming a respected bride in order to bring her family honor. It is then that Mulan takes her father's place in the army, going under the name of ""Ping,"" clad in armor with her horse, Khan. In this movie, the heroine's goal is not to win love from a man, but to prove her strength and respect. Along with the movie's breath-taking action, beautiful animation, Chinese scenery, and meaningful plotline, it includes a hilarious and unforgettable cast of characters. There's, of course, Mulan (Ming-na Wen), Mushu (Eddie Murphy), Grandmother Fa (June Foray), Captain Shang (B.D. Wong), Crickee, and Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer). And I couldn't possibly leave out Mulan's ragtag, comical soldier friends, Yao (Harvey Fiersten), Ling (Gedde Watanabe), and Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo), who I just can't get enough of every time I watch Mulan.

could have been great,"Seeing the early previews of ""Mulan,"" I got chills, because I thought we were going to receive Disney's first serious production:  something akin to ""Braveheart"" and ""The Last Emperor,"" with an epic sweep, and without intrusive musical numbers and unnecessary comic relief.Unfortunately, aside from one breathtaking shot of the Huns thundering down a snow-covered mountainside, the ""epic"" part of ""Mulan"" isn't as good as those jokes and musical numbers.  When the action-packed climax arrives, it also is played for laughs (look at those guys in drag, ha ha!), and there's a ridiculous scene where a horse plows through an avalanche as if it were just a bit of dust.  Sorry, Trigger, but it's off to the glue factory for you.The music is great, however, probably the best of any Disney film since ""Beauty and the Beast.""  The comedy is much better than the usual fare; Eddie Murphy is just right as the mini-dragon Mushu, and Mulan's grandmother has the best line, near the end.All said and done, we lost a really awesome epic adventure, and gained a pretty good musical comedy.  Excuse me, I have to go watch some Anime now.",,Anonymous,Animation
Good movie shows well the struggling against man based society,This movie shows a difficult life for women to dwell in. I could see a woman hero who palyed great action better than man. People generally think woman as weak and dependent. But I think woman's basic character is more strong and independent than that of man. Women have been lost their original treat by men's power.Mulan is a movie tells effort for get woman's origin!,,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty good!,"I liked it! Sure, the music was a little weak, Mushu was annoying, and the character of Shang was kind of like a pretty boy, but other than that, it was a really cool movie. Disney's usual best!",,Anonymous,Animation
Disney please stop,"I have to tell you for a little kid mulan is cool for anyone else trying to learn about the culture of this movie, your being suckerd first off i found the way they handled Mulan very unrealistic theyre was only one scene were we see how males of that time view men, and its in a bad song of all things. Mulans father was done well. and Vanessa Maes influence is the only music i liked in this film that and ill make a man out of you and thats not saying much. The villan ruled the film thats pretty much the only salvable character in this film. and they way he was deafeated was very cartoony. But hell who cares kids will love it cause they dont know any better, lets see what other culture or classic can Disney viloate and butcher.",,Anonymous,Animation
Did anyone else find this film irritating?,"""Mulan"" was more of a problem than I anticipated. It's getting good reviews, I told myself, and for once it's a distortion of a story you don't know - just sit back and enjoy it. But the stereotypes got to me. The funny-animal-friends were just intrusive, and it was annoying that she couldn't have done it without them. The pompous bureaucrat got on my wrong side immediately when the first words he spoke betrayed the lack of research behind the film. (A lack that shows up again. And again. And...)On the plus side, casting Asian actors in key roles was a nice touch, even if some of them were Japanese. And there's some really fun sequences, and the score is great. The film's probably great fun for children and people who know nothing about China.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Very funny, but not Disney's best","I thought this was very funny (the little Dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy is just hilarious), but I thought the story was a bit weak. I know it's just a cartoon, but 30 people against the whole of the Hun army? Riding a horse through an avalanche? Come on....I also thought the handling of the gender issues in the film were dodgy. It's good to see a strong woman as the heroine, but much less good to see her come home and start deferring to her father again, and falling at the feet of her hunky male commanding officer.Still though, I enjoyed it a lot more than most of the Hollywood films I've seen this year.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Mulan is mildly diverting for adults and cynically appropriate for kids, but it desperately needs a jollier tune.","""The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.""Yep, it's that old animated chestnut. This time it's 12th century China and wild-eyed loon Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer), the ruthless leader of the Huns, has started to invade all and sundry. The Emperor (Pat Morita) makes a law stating that one man from each family in China must serve in the Imperial Army, and dispatches his snarky assistant Chi Fu (James Hong) with the words: ""One man may be the difference between victory and defeat.""Cue our heroine. Her pa, an old war veteran, can't quite cut it against evil Shan-You and his ugly cronies. So, enter clumsy daughter, Mulan (Ming-Na Wen), who takes up arms, pretends to be a geezer, changes her name to Ping (better than Pong), falls for a dashing captain and wins the hearts of the nation. All, as Phil Collins would wail, against the odds.Mulan has more than a passing similarity to the animated Magic Sword released this summer, but it's not as witty and the songs are even worse. We are spared the statutory farmyard animals, hens, pigs et al singing along with the pretty heroine a la Beauty and The Beast. However, we are subjected to some of the dreariest array of saccharine-coated drivel this side of Boyzone. Beginning with the mournful I Will Never Pass For A Perfect Bride, a quasi Circle of Life lament that even Sir John would balk at, matters descend so rapidly that even Donny Osmond (who last featured in the turgid 1982 TV movie The Wild Women of Chastity Gulch) turns up warbling for the one-dimensional hero, Shang (B.D. Wong).So, what are we left with? Well, plenty of cowboy references. Mulan seems to have been brought up in what appears to be a Chinese Dodge City, where grandma utters, ""who spit in HER beancurd."" Disney has also thrown in every stock Chinese emblem/symbol they could muster without ever really achieving any notable depth.The characters are extremely familiar. The idiotic soldiers led by gruff Yao (Fierstein) are reminiscent of the Roman legionnaires in Asterix and work reasonably well. However, the comic moments come courtesy of Eddie Murphy's dragon, Mushu. Reeking of Robin Williams' genie in Aladdin, Murphy obviously receives the best lines: ""Look at those Huns they popped out of the snow like daisies."" Disney will no doubt make a pretty bob out of the marketing of this creature, but it still falls disappointingly short.What about the actual animation? Well, there's some creepy, mystic, computer generated imagery and magical gimmickry going on, but ultimately there's only one avalanche scene that truly dominates.Mulan is mildly diverting for adults and cynically appropriate for kids, but it desperately needs a jollier tune. Perhaps, Monty Python's I Like Chinese. Then again, maybe not.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Mulan is the Walt Disney product of 1998, directed by Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook.","Mulan is an Chinese Legendary about a young girl and her voluntarily- facing adventures. Mulan is the story of the love of the land and sacrifices people do for defending their own national identity.Its genre looks adventure but at the same time comic and romance. The story has a happy start and of course a happy end but in very different settings. The start is the time Mulan gets ready to take part in a contest to be the perfect bride(daughter). The scenes are happy and colorful.It's comic when she is cheating to memorize the motto of the perfect bride and gets the help of a puppy to the house chores. These scenes accompanies with happy nice songs. While at the end the setting is very formal, all the country celebrates the countries victory against invaders and even the emperor bows against Mulan, followed by all other people. The story of Mulan takes place in a small Chinese town where people are living at peace her great ancestors and father as an old warrior makes them an honored family, but her failures, for instance in the perfect bride contest, make all except her father believe she is a black spot for the family and never can bring honor for the family. The time when the war begins is the climax, when the emperor orders all the families to sacrifice a man for defense of the Chinese Empire. Mulan's father who already gave service in the emperor army and was injured is the only male in the family who should fight and since Mulan knows his hard situation, joins the army, leaving home at night in his father's graceful helmet and sword. Since there are no women in the army she should pretend to be his father's son.That's a burden for her because he should also practice hard to be as strong as men, however none of the amateur soldiers are so brilliant. The commander, Shang, tries hard to make these ordinary sometime stupid and comic men a professional loyal army of the emperor. When the Army begins the war, the Emperor's army is defeated hard by Shan Yu's great number of soldiers, but this is Mulan who sacrifices and makes the situation vice versa. The perspective I'm looking at Mulan is something different. My stand point is on the cultural studies point of view. First let's don't forget that Mulan a crystal clear Chinese name is not a Chinese but an American cartoon. It is an American cartoon, but first let's extract the Chinese features which looks dominant in this cartoon. Mulan's story is an old Chinese legend which is the source of Chinese settings, characters, names and even themes. The cast and crew is listed on background that is an old hide on which many Chinese scripts were written during the ancient times. You see also the traditional Chinese designs being drawn in ink, so the start point is Chinese however its music is something between American and Chinese. The setting of Mulan's house is a Chinese house in spring and in one corner there is a Buddhist temple where the ancestors are buried. The faith in ancestor's spirits is distinctly perceptible. Another Chinese myth is the dragon which is the symbol of Emperor of China. His sculpture is in the yard and in next stage the ancestors ask him to protect Mulan in the war. The dragon in Chinese culture is the source of water and rain, so it is a holy feature that many refer their ancestors to dragon.3When Mulan practices for the contest she gives you notions depicting an ideal traditional woman in China. She should be able to pour tea well and she should have the sense of dignity and refinement. The perfect Chinese girl should be quiet, demure, grateful polite and delegate. The question she asks after her failure in the contest is planned in the song whose refrain is ""Who I am inside?"". Even the time Mulan can save the commander's life, showing great courage, she sings ""I can prove I can do things right"". The third point that is clear to be heard is the time they discover Mulan is a girl and Chi-Fu, the emperor's consultant, sentences her to death. She asks them about the difference between Mulan and Pinn(her male name). All these suggest that the women in Chinese societies suffer from the misunderstanding about their actual abilities.Another main concept of Chinese culture is the Family honor. Mulan failure in the contest makes her and her family believe that she can not brings the family honor. The lack of males is inferiority for the family because when old men called to war their sons as their representatives answer, but Mulan, who is more courageous than men, has to pretend to be a man to fight.Loyalty to the emperor and Chinese values are very significant,but the American concepts and signs are also crystalized in Mulan. Mulan has a potential satire about Chinese culture when it's indicated with superstitious and not very pragmatic beliefs like faith in ancestors spirits and Chinese dragon.The figures totally look Chinese but they actually look white and the heroine herself is dressed up, to look more beautiful and appealing,using thick make up.The beauty,as Americans are well-known to value, is outstanding for the girls to be accepted in the society high ranks. The very influential parts of the cartoon are the songs which are not in Chinese or in complete Chinese music and the English language with a thick American accent is sure dominant.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Lacked consistency, but otherwise not bad.","I approached Mulan with some trepidation. Disney had become fairly heavy-handed with the political correctness and I feared that Mulan would take it a step further. But the PC Police kept their nightsticks tucked in their belts on this one. Although there is quite a bit of disrespect for Chinese culture (why is our preference for strong-willed women superior to the ancient Chinese preference for demure women?), it's done with remarkable restraint considering the source.Mulan is a likable character, and Wen's voice brings tears to your eyes. She, like Belle, risks all to save her father. She isn't simply a brainless, helpless Barbie doll awaiting rescue. Mulan's svelte physique was refreshing as well, after the wasp-waisted Pocahontas and her predecessors.My biggest complaint was the jarring lack of a coherent tone. Characters switch from highly formalized speech to modern slang from sentence to sentence. The soldiers would be warriors one moment and dunderheads the next. We are taken in a twinkling from admiring Mulan's ingenuity in aiming the rocket to cause an avalanche and bury the barbarian hoards to rolling our eyes as a horse laden with a grown woman, a burly man, and a dragon bungee-jump by virtue of a piece of rope tied to an arrow one of them is grasping.Considering how some animated ""classics"" (All Dogs Go To Heaven comes to mind) are utterly stultifying, Mulan stands out as being watchable. It's no match for Beauty and the Beast, but you don't need to cringe when your kid pops it in the VCR.",,Anonymous,Animation
G.I. Jane,"By this point in Disney's post-'Mermaid' history, they felt they had a grip on culture with their colorful-yet-pointless musicals.  Remember, it's because we accepted all this lard that we now love 'Shrek'.  If society had rejected this at its roots, our green ogre friend would never have existed (or spawned a sequel).So, once again, Disney does its usual work in the design and marketing phases and lets our minds do the rest.  Interestingly enough, this is  a bridge between Phases III and IV for the studio.  Pixar recovered from 'Bug's Life' with 'Toy Story 2' and within two yearsDisney loves itself and lovingly sticks to its prefabricated formulas. Think of it, when was the last time a Disney cartoon tried taking risks? The last one that comes to mind would have to be 'The Black Cauldron'.  Too bad that same attitude doesn't translate here, nothing remotely objectionable can be shown.  In some respects, George Lucas should be running Disney since the two of them think alike (look at the extended version of 'Jedi' and the 'Star Wars' prequels if you don't believe me).So what do we have here?  Militarism, snobby chauvinism, holier-than-thou sexism, and a frozen camera.  That's why Disney hired Jerry Goldsmith to do the music, he caught on to the 'Rambo' course this movie was taking, so he inserted some of those cues into his score.  Just listen.  The same thing happened with Klaus and Zimmer on 'Pirates', they used their 'Gladiator' work again.Look elsewhere for an interesting Disney ride, you won't find it here.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",,Anonymous,Animation
East meets west mentality.,Eastern version of Joan of Arc.  If girls want to dress up like boys and go to war let them.  I just don't want to be around at that time of the month. Its good to have female heroes (heiroins).  Its true in the past all the role models have been male because men are wrote down all the storys while women did everything else.  Finally Disney has subscribed to this as well.,,Anonymous,Animation
a sleeper,"I groaned when my daughter picked this out: another saccharine love story. NOT !It seems like the intent of the long ""establish the setting"" scenes of medieval china and its social limits, is to lull the (older) audience into thinking this is another princess story. There are light-hearted slapstick antics that will make the kids laugh and a foolish song. Then it turns dark and I became slack-jaw, at the scenes of a village massacre aftermath and a fierce battle, with surprises. The eye-popping battle never gets old.Mulan is a tough, quick-thinking fighter, a genuine hero. Her heroism is something every parent wants from their daughter.This movie is the answer to and atonement for the many second-tier Cinderella movies from Disney. (BTW, there should be no feminist apologies for the original Cinderella. She was also resourceful and tough.)",,Anonymous,Animation
Wretched Music and Plot,"Two of the key ingredients of a good Disney movie are a good musical score and villain.  Both are completely lacking here.  Most songs are painful to listen to and don't work together to create a cohesive sound for the film (ie. the tribal beats of Lion King or the more tropical feel of The Little Mermaid).  Only Reflection lives up to the Disney standard.  In fact, the only song that has a distinctly Asian flavor is the worst of the bunch. And then we have our villain - who does nothing but glare and grunt.  Not quite as appealing as Scar or Ursula or Maleficent or any of the wonderful Disney villains.  Sure the film has a great message but I've seen better films with the very same one.  It certainly isn't better than The Lion King.  Maybe if they played it straight without the cheesy songs it may have been better or at least better-written ones with a more exotic sound befitting the locale.",,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best Disney films I've seen...,"This is one of the best Disney films I have ever seen because it had the story, the perfect voices and the beautiful scenery.

However, it did seem out of place for the voice of his character to be in China.",,Anonymous,Animation
A Sign Of Things To Come For Murphy,"Continuing my Plan to watch every Eddie Murphy movie in order, I come to Mulan (1998)Plot In A Paragraph: To save her father from certain death in the army, Mulan, a young maiden, secretly goes in his place and becomes one of China's greatest heroines in the process.To get in the mood, I watched this with my girlfriends daughter. This is a forgotten Disney movie. For whatever reason, most of Disney's releases in the 90's post Lion King have faded into obscurity. 20 years ahead of its time!! A brave heroine, funny, loyal animal sidekicks and the whole message here is standard feminist empowerment. Release the same movie today, and it would probably be amongst the highest grossers of the year.Like Robin Williams in Aladdin Murphy is second billed as the the comedy sidekick. He is Muchu, a dragon so small, he is confused for a lizard. And like Williams, he is the only recognisable voice, and is the best thing in the movie. I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would, and I actually got chills at one point. I especially liked that it didn't follow the traditional Disney ending.Murphy was hit by a scandal just before this movie's release, He was stopped by police for picking up a transvestite prostitute in a bad part of Hollywood. But that didn't effect the movie at all as Mulan was amongst the highest grossers of Murphy's career at that point. It was a sign of things to come for him.Mulan Grossed $120 million at the domestic box office to end 1998 as the 13th highest grossing movie of the year.",,Anonymous,Animation
