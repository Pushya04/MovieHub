An acting buffet of Will Smith,"If I could sum this movie up in one sentence, it would be this: Go Will. Will Smith is the driving force of I Am Legend. His performance as Dr. Robert Neville is impeccable. Living in a deserted NY city, his acting is reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away, but instead of a volleyball, he has mannequins and a faithful German Shepard named Sam. His basement, a retro-fitted, high-tech lab to find a cure for the disease that has turned the population of the entire planet into mutant, zombie-like, hive mind, blood-thirsty monsters, and, for some reason, Robert is immune. His days, spent hunting. His nights, sleeping with a high-powered rifle and hoping that the mutants don't find him. Keeping the movie flowing are well placed flashbacks that show what happened to Robert's family and why he is there. The movie falters a bit at the end, maybe at the last 5 minutes, but it doesn't ruin the plot or acting put forth. Containing wonderful cinematography and CG, I Am Legend is a spectacular film that I will be seeing again! PS - Shout out to my NY National Guardsmen in this film! Great job!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Should have been better,"The 1954 sci-fi/vampire novel ""I Am Legend"" by Richard Matheson has now been filmed three times: as ""The Last Man On Earth"" in 1964 originally scripted by Matheson himself (which I have never seen), as ""The Omega Man"" in 1971 without the vampire elements (which I have viewed three times), and now with the original title and expensive sets and special effects. This time the seemingly sole survivor of the worldwide pandemic Robert Neville is played by Will Smith who is an actor with real charisma and charm and considerable box office appeal who has beefed himself up for the role.The main strength of this version is the location shots in a deserted New York City (a move from the Los Angeles of the book and earlier films) and, although the filming of these scenes apparently caused traffic chaos and much anger for local residents, they chillingly set the tone for this dystopian thriller. To see the silent streets around Times Square or South Street Seaport or the lone scientist fishing in the Metropolitan Museum of Art or playing golf on the ""USS Intrepid"" is to view this heaving metropolis as we have never experienced it before. The German shepherd dog who is Neville's sole companion deserves an honourable mention for showing greater thespian skills than most of the extras and stunt men.The principal weakness of the movie, however, is the realisation of the surviving victims of the virus. The CGI characters are almost as silly as they are scary but, above all, they are presented as more animalistic than human. ""The Omega Man"" handled these characters much better presenting them as sad as well as scary. The other serious fault is the lack of clarity in the narrative - at times, it is simply unclear what is happening and why and a longer director's cut would be welcome. Finally the references to Ground Zero and God may play well with American audiences but will not be so resonant to audiences elsewhere in the world.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Could have been a corker, but...","Two thirds of this film is wonderful entertainment, both in scope and story telling, and in Will Smith we have a cracking central performance that carries the film with consummate ease, sadly the final third undoes all the great promise and tension building that had gone before it.After a genetic engineered cancer curing virus wipes out practically all of mankind, Robert Neville {Will Smith} appears to be the sole surviving human on earth, the only company he has is the family dog and an army of virus infected mutants that can only come out in the dark. That Neville is a former scientist who is immune to the deadly strain is a bonus as it means he can work on a potential cure.Yes it's daft, and yes it's contrived, but there sure is a lot of good stuff to enjoy before the films major failing surfaces. Firstly is Will Smith's performance, there is no doubting he is a major star these days, but here he also cements his standing as a bona fide A lister of note. He layers the performance so well, his character not only has to deal with the heavy threat of being killed by the mutants at night, he also has to fight his own isolation, mans inherent need for companionship is a tortured thing when you appear to be the sole beneficiary of gods green earth.Secondly the setting of a barren desolate New York is eerily staggering, overgrown with foliage and stalked by lions searching for food, it really is a big screen must to embrace the scope of it. Thirdly the mutants themselves are scary enough, but they honestly would have been better served being played by human actors rather than the CGI used that brings very mixed results, and fourthly the tension building is pitch perfect, the makers manage to have you on the edge of your seat gasping for a solution to this cracking story unfolding, but then...They throw it all away by a rushed ending that had me positively seething, a quick turn of events should be a prelude to a fully fleshed out finale but instead we get a quick wham bam, oh The End. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth on leaving the cinema and frankly the audience deserves better, and in fact so does Will Smith, did they run out of money? Well that I don't know, but what I do know is that we so nearly had a genre classic to look fondly on for years to come, shame that. 6.5/10Footnote: Having just watched the alternate version that is readily available on disc formats, I have to say that as weak and as frustrating as the theatrical ending is, the alternate ending is far worse, trite and totally misplaced, they chose the better ending of the two for sure.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Gut-wrenching movie full of adventure and heart,"I just saw this movie today, the day it opened here. And was deeply, deeply moved.I've got to start with the scenes of a deserted New York City post-apocalypse. These were so very, very moving; and very, very convincing. The clips in the trailers for the movie were good, but you really have to see the full panoply of close-up shots, distance shots, etc to really appreciate the sheer scale of what this movie is depicting. There's something of On the Beach and Resident Evil and of any number of disaster movies and zombie movies here. But none of them do justice to the New York depicted here. This is a New York City we see large-scale and micro-scale in order to show us the environment in which the main character is acting.And Will Smith is simply brilliant as the sole survivor, Robert Neville. Will delivers movingly and convincingly on a script that really focuses on giving us a picture of ""what it would be like"" ... to be the last man on earth, living off the land in NYC. This is the real strength of this movie: there's really not a lot of blood or gore or zombie scenes at all. Yet I was riveted as Robert goes through his ""typical days"" in NYC. Every moment was full of pathos and full of menace, too. And occasionally we got some relief from Smith's trademark humor that blended seamlessly with the rest of his performance to give us ""what it would be like"" with a powerful delivery that just leaves me almost breathless.There's an effective use of flashbacks that partly tell us the story of how we got to where we're at in this grim New York City; and the flashbacks also serve to give us an overwhelming contrast between Life Before and Life After the apocalyptic disaster wiped out the city. Yet use of flashback was sparing, which I found all the more effective.Cinematography was excellent throughout, the storyline and script are brilliant, the use of a dog, Samantha, as a key actor was perfect to show us both Robert as companion and Robert as lonely, isolated survivor.I won't give away the ending, but think it was satisfying as far as it goes, but not nearly as appealing, from my angle, as the foregoing material. That brings up my one complaint: the title. By the end of the movie, we have some sense of the meaning of the title. Yet it still seems to me to feel cheesy and really unworthy of the movie.But that's a minor plaint. If you haven't seen this movie, and would enjoy seeing a really powerful story about a survivor in post-apocalypse New York City, hey, go check out this flick. It's really worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Has its share of thrills and poignancy,"I am aware of the fact that this 2007 blockbuster is a remake of a remake. It's a remake of ""The Omega Man"", which is a remake of ""The Last Man on Earth"". All three films are adaptations of the novel, ""I Am Legend"", by Richard Matheson. I haven't seen the previous two versions, but definitely intend to. However, for now, since I've just seen this 2007 version of ""I Am Legend"", and haven't seen the rest, I'll just have to judge it strictly as a movie, not how it compares to the previous two, or the book. So, while this particular version of the story seems to be polarizing, I was definitely impressed.In 2012, three years after a genetically modified virus which was supposed to cure cancer ended up wiping out most of the world's population, a scientist named Robert Neville, immune to this virus, appears to be the only uninfected human left in New York City, maybe even the world, and his only companion is his dog, Sam! Neville does research in his basement laboratory to try and find a cure for the virus, and regularly sends out radio messages, calling for other survivors to come and meet him, if there are any out there, but so far, this has not worked. Eventually, the scientist discovers people in New York who have not been killed by the virus, but have been mutated by it, and as a result, they have become dangerous monsters! Worse still, there are many of them in the city, and Neville is still waiting to see another uninfected human, so he is grossly outnumbered!This film is slow-paced around the beginning, but this works well, starting with the introduction to the virus which was yet to fail, and going from there to views of a deserted New York, which are reasonably intriguing. Some scenes may be a bit tedious, such as Robert Neville looking through the dark building before finding the mutants, and the camera is sometimes a bit unsteady, but to make up for the flaws, there's quite a bit of tension (which includes scenes with the mutated, zombie-like humans and they're chases and attacks, even though I'm sure we've seen scenes like that before in movies), as well as some poignant moments, with Neville and his loneliness. Also, for Bob Marley fans, the main character is a big fan of his, and at one point, he talks about Marley and his philosophies. As someone who listens to his music and has read a lot about his short life, this part definitely touched me, and it obviously isn't featured in the previous two adaptations, as they were both made before Marley became an international superstar.Yes, this film has its flaws, and seems to have gotten a lot of positive feedback as well as negative, but personally, I have to give it a positive review. While not quite a masterpiece, I still found it to be a memorable sci-fi/horror film, with a fair amount of suspense, action, and poignancy. Once again, I don't know how it compares to the book or the previous two adaptations of it, and clearly, it seems to be widely considered inferior to those, but while that may be true, I cannot join the naysayers on this one. If you see this version of ""I Am Legend"", I guess you could easily end up on either side, but if you want to see a combination of sci-fi, horror, and drama, and you're a Will Smith fan, I think it's worth a try, and yes, it just MIGHT help a BIT if you're a Bob Marley fan.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Breathtaking remake in big budget with great production design , adequate cinematography and and top-notch performance by Will Smith","In 2o12, New York post-holocaust caused by a virus, Robert Neville (Will Smith) is only survivor along with his dog . He's accompanied by wife's (Sally Richardson) records and his son, developing by means of various flashbacks. Neville is immune to the effects of a biologically engineered plague and while fighting an army of blood-suckers bent on destroying what's left of the world and constantly harassing him . The pale-skinned mutants are led by a sneering and creepy leader , they want to eradicate what is left of mankind , but they feel Men are responsible for the disaster and this , of course , includes Neville. But Neville isn't only survivor , there early appear a few survivors, a woman (Alice Braga) and his son. The last man on earth is not alone. Welcome to earth. Population 1. Before Logan... There was... I Am Legend.Strong intrigue and suspense with considerable violence based on novel by Richard Matheson , which is also the basis for the film ¨The last Man on Earth¨ directed by Sidney Salkow and starred by Vincent Price . Furthermore, the classic version(1971) with Charlton Heston and directed by Boris Sagal .This is a blockbuster production manages to convey an eerie atmosphere to dismay . The film packs chills , noisy action , tension , thrills , terror and results to be quite entertaining . Exceptional performance by Will Smith , usual player of spectacular Sci-fi movies (Men in black , Independence day , I robot). Here appears uncredited in special cameo as a Doctor , Emma Thomson . Interesting screenplay by Akiva Goldsman based on script written for ¨Omega man¨. Atmospheric , adequate musical score fitting to action and suspense by James Newton Howard . The motion picture was professionally directed by Francis Lawrence in his second film , as he's usually video-clips director (for Britney Spears , Jennifer Lopez , among others) and occasionally filmmaker (Constantine) . Rating : Above average and well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A really great performance by Wil Smith,"The way that they created the look of Manhattan in this movie was just wonderful and Will Smith pulls off one of his best acting turns as Robert Neville. The way he has his days planned out and still attempting the research to find a cure for the virus is a key part to the development of both character and plot.Samantha (Sam) plays a strong part in the movie and is a great companion, friend and protector figure for Smith. The way he holds conversations with Sam is very touching indeed and makes you really feel that Sam is integral part of his survival and sanity.Just a great movie, and I will not offer any of the things that will give the ending away. I can watch this movie many more times as it is that interesting and each time, it seems to reveal something that I missed in the original viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Quite frankly the worst movie I can recall seeing,"Totally unrealistic. Horribly written and acted. Desperate Pandering to generate emotion from the audience. Pathetically predictable. Craptastic ending. This movie has everything, as long as you can leave logic out of the equation. There were at least four occasions I rose to walk out of this movie, but decided to stay ONLY out of consideration for the people I came to the movie with, who all hated it too. I wish I could have those two hours back.Perhaps the most annoying part of this movie for me was the complete disregard for the intelligence of the audience. Granted, it has been said that one can never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator in America, but this was too much. Either the director/writer thinks so low of the average American to think people couldn't notice the glaring plot holes in the script, or the writers are total idiots themselves.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Outstanding, disturbingly well crafted film","When I first saw the trailer for I Am Legend, all i could think of was, ""I have to see this movie!"". Luckily i got to see an early screening of the film with a friend and I have to say that this is a disturbingly realistic film that depicts a post-apocalyptic New York being overrun by the mutated victims of a widespread virus. Overall, this movie delivers great action sequences and a great story, along with a shocking ending. Will Smith's performance is outstanding and makes a great Robert Neville. There are a lot of sequences in the film that are disturbing but along with that, takes you to the edge of your seat! I would have to say that this is one of the best films out this year. It's nice to see an original, amazing movie released before the end of the year. You don't really get a lot of those these days in general. Although there are some things in this film which are left unexplained, the intensity of the creatures and the thickness of the plot makes up for it. All in all, you will not be disappointed.

I Am Legend (2007): A Gripping Post-Apocalyptic Tale with a Few Missed Opportunities,"I Am Legend (2007) presents a haunting post-apocalyptic world where Will Smith's character, Dr. Robert Neville, is the last known survivor in a deserted New York City, fighting to find a cure for a virus that has wiped out most of humanity. The film excels in creating a tense and isolated atmosphere, with Smith delivering a compelling, emotional performance.While the premise is intriguing, the film's pacing occasionally falters, and some of the CGI effects haven't aged well. The movie takes risks with its ending, though it may feel abrupt or unsatisfying to some. Despite its flaws, I Am Legend is a thrilling, thought-provoking exploration of loneliness, survival, and sacrifice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Will Smith Tries to Save the World from CGI... He Fails,"Never mind the remake of the science-gone-wrong, vampire/zombie apocalypse scenario; ""I Am Legend"" seems of more, if still only slight, interest to me as reflecting its own making as a contest between man and computer-generated images. This seems all the more blatant today because the CGI tends not to hold up very well--if it ever did. The deer look especially unrealistic to me. So, in the movie, people and other living animals are turned into largely-CGI-created monsters. They look a bit like living creatures but not quite. Like the mannequins, an especially apt comparison within the movie. The irony is that this junk is supposed to be the attraction of these blockbusters, but this thing is completely carried by the human performance of Will Smith, the hero--plus his dog.As great as Smith is in these popcorn flicks, though, even his heroics are no match for the havoc the CGI virus continues to wreak upon Hollywood. They even made that Batman v. Superman movie seen on a billboard within this movie. This was back in 2007... how prescient.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Will Smith's Best Performance In This Sci-fi Thriller Classic. Pretty Much Masterpiece,"WILL SMITH is a BRILLIANT actor FACT.I Am Legend has climbers its way up to be my favourite Will Smith movie before it was always i, Robot but I Am Legend has become my number one Smith movie & has earned it's place as on my top 10 movies list.Smith gives a powerful & fantastic performance as the lonely last man survivor in the world,he's Robert Neville & he's surviving in New York City with just his dog but there are others but they are infected zombie types that only come out at night. I am legend is a BRILLIANTLY made sci-fi Horror Thriller that's intense & scary & emotional & that is solely because of WILL SMITH!!! His performance is BRILLIANT,his emotional eyes say it all & Will is totally convincing.Now i love the movie it's a massively budget apocalyptic Horror Thriller but it's not perfect as the infected Dark seekers are all c.g.i & that is never a good thing as i always prefer the practical make up fx & rubber suits it looks more real & grimy & gritty just look at how terrifying the infected zombies was in 28 days later & they was actors in scary as hell make-up no cheap looking c.g.i so THAT was the one problem i had with an otherwise fantastic movie. With that being said the dark seekers are still impressive as they movie extra quickly & are seriously violent.The Dark seekers though do look good & are very frantic & scary but you can see they're computer images & that does take a little of the suspense away but the design/look of them is very well done & they are scary.The mood & atmosphere is very well done with this movie it has a loneliness to it & the music score is very sad with a sense of loss.Will Smith is truly OUTSTANDING as Robert Neville & shows why he's the greatest movie star on the planet.This is the closest i will ever get to will smith being in a zombie movie or even a Horror movie & as Horror is my favourite genre & smith is my favourite actor, this movie means alot to me.I am legend is an excellent movie & the performance by smith is outstanding so this is an instant CLASSIC in my opinion & yes the infected are well done but c.g.i of course, now imagine if they looked like they do but was played by actors like in that excellent 28 days later!!! Would've been AMAZING.I've been a huge Smith fan since the fresh Prince days & have grown up loving him as my idol as an icon & as my childhood hero.Now ""I Am Legend"" is a MASTERPIECE!!! Years have passed & i now think this is definitely a true Masterpiece of Cinema & has one of the greatest performances from the legendary Will Smith, if not his best!!!A 10/10 sci-fi thriller that's full of suspense & excitement.Masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A great post apocalyptic movie 7/10,I think movie thriller starring will Smith is one of those movies that is the closest to reality.

Simply Brilliant,"This movie has one of Will Smith's best performances with the right emotions and never ruining a moment with inappropriate comedy. The whole film is a good balance of drama, suspense and action, not to mention terror. The film can be heartbreaking at times, to the point I myself was drawn to tears. I can't say much about this movie without spoiling it for those who may have not seen it, but the score by James newton Howard is saddening and one of his best.The atmosphere is full of a silent tension. Despite it's short length, the film is an escapade that must be seen to be believed. Over all great film and I definitely recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Nice Update of a Classic Sci Fi Piece,"Will Smith gives I Am Legend a powerful performance built upon an excellent script with strong psychological realism and boosted by great art direction and solid directing.Smith plays Robert Neville, a military biologist who may be the last truly human member of Homo sapiens sapiens left on earth. A genetically engineered virus which cured cancer has mutated into a pathogen which has turned 99% of the earth's human population into hyper-aggressive murderous cannibals with no social habits and no mercy. These viral zombies own the world and, from his generator-powered lab in the Big Apple, Lt. Col. Neville struggles to retain his sanity with the help of his German Shepard while almost hopelessly searching for a cure. Each night at sun-down, his patients come out and seek to infect anybody they can find.It's an old story by Richard Matheson, which has been made into three somewhat different films - The Last Man on Earth (1964), Omega Man (1971) and now this. Each of these films is a product of its time, and has a different flavor. The 1964 version, starring Vincent Price, is more of a standard horror flick than the other two, and focuses on creating mood, atmosphere, and tension, then paying off with a modest amount of gore and action. 1971's Charlton Heston more sci-fi film, Omega Man, is heavy, philosophical and more than a little angry and scary.I am Legend loses a bit of the philosophy and anger, retains but reorganizes the action, and adds better characterization, special effects (especially in set design - the abandoned Manhattan is mesmerizing), and writing. But, as if I haven't already made this point, the final key ingredient here is Smith's incredible performance. It is no mean feat filling the shoes of Charlton Heston in one of his most memorable roles, but Smith goes well beyond this and creates a character that is very much his own.I am Legend is on the best post-apocalyptic films recently released, and one of the ten best Zombified horror films I have ever seen. Highly recommended for sci-fi and zombie film fans. Weakly recommended for horror fans - this is a very non-traditional horror film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Watch this for Will Smith,"Am Legend is an action thriller movie directed by Francis Lawrence and stars Will Smith, Alice Braga, Charlie Tahan and Dash Mihok in the lead roles.The movie is based on a scientist Robert Neville played by Will Smith who is the last human survivor after majority of mankind is wiped dur to a lethal virus.The movie should be remembered as one of the best acting by Will Smith as he was alone character in majority of the movie. He has played the role of a scientist with perfection.Screenplay is good but gets little slow and boring in between. Plot is fresh and has executed nicely. Location setup is nice.

"the tale of Robert Neville, five years in the future...","Another post-apocalyptic flick? And this time with Will ""gettin jiggy with it"" Smith. And from the director of Constantine. But I liked it. Or at least relative to what are much better films of this ilk (28 Days... movies, where they don't rely on CGI for every single infected) and lesser (30 Days of Night, if the comparison stands. Director Francis Lawrence deals with the tragic nature of the ""last man is not alone"" idea seriously, and with little touches of humor (some of it, of course, relying on Smith's charm, which in a weird way makes his small-talk to mannequins he has set up in a video store as the sad continuation of social mental stability). It's also amplified by his companion, a dog, who becomes like the quasi-Wilson of the picture- only, arguably, with more sympathy going out to a dog than a volleyball. Their scenes are the most heartfelt, but without having to try or cloy too much.I liked the dark atmosphere for many of the scenes, particularly dark in the sense of it being literal (Robert Neville going around in the building to find Samantha). And I also like how the writers, taking off of Matheson's great source of a novel, at the path of professional and mental well-being, in the face of absolute (and calculable) doom. Even some bits of rational vs irrationalism between Ana and Neville work pretty well. And it goes without saying the impressive scope of the special effects - meaning almost all of the location scenes out and about in Manhattan where telling CGI or green screen or what is very difficult.For everything that is impressive, and for a big-big studio movie (probably the most expensive ""zombie"" movie ever made), there are some liabilities. Some may differ, but the infected as shown are all complete CGI creations, and look as such. There are some legitimate scares (the bit with the girl on the operating table that jets up after what looks like death is a good one), especially in the old-fashioned ""dont-go-there"" kind where things crawl in the unknown spaces. But the design of the infected is never very compelling, they look like monsters and despite the difference from a 28 Days kind of movie the lack of a recognizable human feature (past the obvious fact that as mutants they're meant to look a little skewed) it's never too compelling an example. They look, as many suggest, out of a run-of-the-mill Playstation game.But nevertheless it's worth a full admission price; I Am Legend is creepy entertainment that works well for the multiplexes. Smith as the (would-be) lone hero Robert Neville is in near perfect form; it might even be his best dramatic performance to date, where he calls on all of his resources to make this a guy we want on our side. He makes Neville much more human than Charlton Heston did in The Omega Man, and believable when he should be at his most pathetic. Even through monologing about Bob Marley Smith's interesting- a true leading man, and well worth this respectable treatment of a once-again adaptation of a classic science fiction/horror piece. Whether it's a great film or not you be the judge.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A New Genre,"After seeing SOOO much hype for this movie, I decided it would OBVIOUSLY be worth my time going and seeing. I mean...I've heard good things about it, it seems like Will Smith's character Detective Spooner is coming back for a remake, and it just looks cool.Oh man, let me tell you, did I EVER underestimate this film's potential.First of all, this movie has one of the biggest budgets of this year's films (oh, and btw, Pirates 3 came out this year as well), and they spent that money AMAZINGLY. From the style of the creatures to the plants on the ground to the ""plot devices"" themselves, if you understand my drift(no spoilers today, kids!).Secondly, this is easily Will Smith's greatest performance. Not counting Bad Boys II (joke, people). Let me tell you 2 movies that contribute to his character, Neville: Pursuit of Happiness, and I, ROBOT. seriously, he's that good.and lastly, and most importantly, this movie created a new genre all-together. This movie was not only drama, horror, investigative, action, and ""romantic"" (through it's plot character's and their fates...tears!!!), but it also did it in an all-inclusive manner.

You either love them or hate them.With this one I loved it.Come on what more could you want about the last reminding guy on earth in the apocalypse!?Some nice humanity touches in this with the Bob Marley references, I think the movie wants you to appreciate the life we have. We can see that more and more now with the coming Corvid 19 pandemic currently shaking our world.I like the premise of the movie and you will too if you like post apocalyptic movies. I like the fact Will Smith is generally quite careful in the decisions he makes understanding and letting the viewer understand the dangers that any wrong decision will cost you your life. Stakes are high in this world now in terms of survival and it realism to the movie.Great CGI although a couple of scenes a little sketchy.

Solid popcorn flick - but should have been soooo much better.,"I can't explain just why the finale of I Am Legend sucks without major spoilers, so search for it on oneguyrambling.com and see exactly why this film is so frustrating to me.When the initial teasers for this hit the cinema I looked into it, I knew nothing about the book but was still really, really looking forward to it. I wanted it to be ""All-Time"" good.So it was disappointing when I finally caught it and saw how they managed to still mess it up.Will.I.Am-Legend Smith, plays Robert Neville, the only apparent survivor of the latest cinematic pandemic. This time a botched cure for cancer backfires, killing a large proportion of the planet and turning most of the rest into enraged zombies by night, and hibernating spooky guys by day.It is three years since the virus hit, and NYC, the source of the initial outbreak is long since quarantined. Neville walks the deserted streets by day, now overrun by wildlife (Lions?) and vegetation, and hides in his home by night along with the family dog and only buddy Sam. The family and their destiny are introduced and explained piece by piece in Neville's dream sequences.As Neville was part of the cause of the initial outbreak, (just how responsible is never exactly explained), he feels it is his duty to find a cure, and he runs around the clock experiments in his basement on rats. To date none are successful, though Neville carefully documents all tests and file notes results, and his diary events on camera.In between experiments and hiding, Neville and Sam roam the streets, hunting, shopping and foraging for supplies and things of use. Scenes were Neville visits the video shop show both how long he has been alone and just how Castaway bored and frazzled he has become.So where have they gone wrong? Well so far, so good, in fact even though nothing really happens in the first 30 odd minutes we feel like it is building, and we get an idea of Neville's circumstances and feelings of isolation.In fact around 25-30 minutes in the best scene in the film occurs, in chasing a deer Sam runs into a dark building, despite Neville's cries of stop. Given the choice between running and losing his best friend Neville opts to save his lone amigo and heads in. We don't really know by this time what the bad guys are and what they do, so as Neville creeps carefully through the rooms whispering for Sam we feel genuine tension, even when he finally comes across the huddled, shivering baddies.In the ensuing escape Neville catches an infected (it is apparent that he has set traps at various places), and takes her back to run further tests.Things come to a head when Neville falls into one of his own traps, and the subsequent escape doesn't go well.In my opinion it all goes wrong from here.Neville decides ""enough"" and takes his death wish to the streets at night, even though he kills many infected he inevitably loses through sheer weight of numbers Except - and without giving the game away - Neville himself says that it has been over 1,000 days since he saw other survivors, and the events that follow are simply too ludicrous to be coincidence, even when they feebly try to explain them away as such.The bottom line: Stoopid Hollywood.The ending is over the top and deeply flawed, totally ignoring the source material on which the film is based in favour of BOOM BANG CRASH crapulence.I've watched this twice now, and each time I enjoyed the build up and let down in a major way by the compromises and short-cuts taken in the second half, even when I know it's coming now.Final Rating – 6 / 10. A golden opportunity to make a big budget zombie movie (with credibility) wasted by a short cut ending.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Like watching a K-Tel commercial,"Another terrible Hollywood remake of a remake of a remake. An old story that scared in the naive 50's with the Cold War and the first understanding of biological warfare terrifying the world for real. It just doesn't have the same bite or intensity in today's world. Not to mention the existence of any number of identical-topic movies with minor variations in theme, and audiences will readily experience a tired deja vu. Praying for something new after having plunked down $15 will, however, be a waste of time.Will Smith's performance? No better than a copy of the hackneyed portrayal of the same character by Charlton Heston in the last remake - one-dimensional and shallow. Shame on Smith for doing this low-grade movie. I expect to next see Smith doing 30-minute TV commercials for KTel or the next incarnation of the ""Thigh Master"".While still not the best, the Heston remake - ""The Omega Man"" - at least had a compelling story that gave pause for thought. Save yourself a lot of grief and money, and rent ""The Omega Man"" instead.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
What? No zombie penguins?,"Let's see. Take plenty of deer, a pride of lions, mix with a pack of ""trained"" mutant dogs and lightning fast zombies that can scamper vertically, jump 14 feet in a single bound and overturn Range Rovers with a touch of a finger and what do you get? Uhh..the stupidest movie of the year!! Ironically, the best zombie in the movie was Will Smith, who obviously realized nothing could be as bad as Wild Wild West and decided to cash his check pronto. Surprisingly, there are more idiot points in this fiasco than even Jerry Bruckheimer could conceive (well, maybe not, in light of the moronic National Turds 1&2).How 'bout that huge rack on the 56 pound chick zombie in Smith's basement? I mean, her jumbly's were huge. And perky! No sag at all. Probably the first zombie chick in history with a boob job!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Nope!,"You're gonna hate me. Oh yes you will.*SPOILERS AHEAD*Wil Smith: good actor, fine actor. This movie: hard to say. The script was not very good. I guess he did an adequate job with the material, as well as the physical part of his role. If anything, it looked like an exercise in ""see how well I can act."" I'll take Ali, Men in Black, Independence Day, thank you.Special Effects- Disaster: half-and-half. The cityscapes were well-done, evoking that ache which is desirable for this type of apocalyptic theme. However, details! Why are there lions roaming Manhattan? Did someone let out the zoo? And why are there ""herds"" of deer. First place: deer don't congregate like that. Second place: where did they come from? Manhattan's sealed off, remember? A further bone of contention: the deer have *what* to do with the plot?Special Effects- Zombie/Vampires: terrible. ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964) did it right. The returned should be weak, feeble, and feeble-minded. It just makes sense. Also, why do all the creatures look alike? Are they albino? What's with the razor teeth? And how come they can howl like a banshee? Furthermore, the CGI hordes were just ridiculous, regardless of how much work that took. They can climb buildings like Spider-Man? And since when do NYC brownstones crumble like dust? Those buildings are built like tanks.Logic- As many have pointed out, what's the story with the lack of guns and ammo? How much sense does it make to have autos rigged with explosives right outside your house? Seriously, an electric fence makes much more sense. And how do all the lights in the area work? They shouldn't, since he needs a generator or three to keep his place going. On that, where are these generators?- it seems awful quiet in that house! And how did the vampires cut off power to all the lights at once? I could go on all day about logic.How did Anna's presence cause the vampires to disperse? Did she have halogen lights? So what if she did? How did she get Wil Smith to the car? They should have showed her strength.Who is Ethan? We get no background, and ultimately end up not caring about him. How can such a kid survive, one who doesn't know enough to keep his trap shut when a ceiling-hanging zombie is nearby? Oy.Here's another thought: the grenade at the end. What is it packing, a mini H-bomb? And if the blast is that powerful, shouldn't Anna and Ethan be trapped in the chimney? I want logic!So, a nice visual movie, with great sound, pleasing to the senses. But it makes very little sense.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Unique heart-wrenching dystopian tale of a man that stayed behind with his dog to find a cure to a man-made disease. Original and overlooked,"A movie with subtle themes of loneliness, coping with death and a human-dog companionship that's as heartwarming as it is heartbreaking.It's hard to believe the average reviews this movie received then and is currently receiving. I saw this movie when it came out and was too young for the more horrific aspects of it but remember liking and understanding it. When rewatching it, it now holds a special place in my heart thanks to its incredibly well-crafted setting and heartfelt companionship of the main characters.Certainly the movie could use more backstory information that the actual showed in the movie but that just might be the reason why this movie stands out. Through little clips of TV news broadcasts, flashbacks and a few smart interactions we are fed backstory details of the status quo of the world and the infected after the spread of the virus.When recounting the events and ""action scenes"" there are not many to consider althought the third act is filled with them. Nevertheless, this movie's first act that sets up the story, characters and setting is so well realised that a gigantic zombie stand-off Zombieland-style would have not fit the tone that the movie is building up. Themes of loneliness, coping with death and survival. Without spoiling anything, there are several events that impact the human-animal companionship that heavily suggest heart-wrenching themes and callbacks to the horrors of the virus. A companionship that represents the core of a story that's meant to tell and show us they are the last rational creatures left on earth.The movie relies heavily in the ""show don't tell"" rule generally. It prefers to unravel the backstory of the infection and the character of Will Smith through flashbacks and video recordings in specific and suiting moments in the story. They don't feel out of place as they try to expand the information to push the story forward or show an emotional turmoil the main character is suffering at a given time; and not simply to have an exposition dump in the middle of the story.Also, it realies in symbolism from which certain subtle themes can be identified like a religious sense of fate and destiny or simple callback symbolisms like butterflies or a certain public figure; add an extra layer to an overall generic post-apocalyptic zombie movie. It provides themes through which to learn the different personalities and traits of our characters.One of the bigger downsides the movie may show is the sense of rivalry given to Will Smith's character and another I suppose ""character"" of the story. Should the alternative and therefore deleted scene in the end would be considered part of the story that rivalry would have been better developed. However, in the final theatrical version it isn't present leaving the movie with a story that is meant to romanticise the aforementioned animosity. It feels too personal in an otherwise gently developed setting without a ""chosen one"" trope to lead it. The best post-apocalyptic stories are the ones that feature a main character that wasn't chosen by god or destiny, is the everyday man/woman/child with flaws as anybody could have survive the apocalypse and there is no destiny only coincidences. Having the movie find a conclusion to ALL the current stroy problems in a span of days it's highly unusual and too fantastic for this sort of setting. Nevertheless, the reason for the present rivalry and romanticised aspects of this particular tale could be attributed to the homage payed to the original 1950s book which actually featured the last man on earth facing the leader of the vampiric zombies creatures... So yeah, I'd say this movie shouldn't be looked as an adaptation of that novel but only paying homage with names and the title itself.IN CONCLUSION, this is an entertaining, at times thrilling, interestingly-crafted virus infecting tale lead by a man and his dog looking for a cure to an infection. It has some of the most heart breaking moments ever put to cinema only enhanced one of Will Smith's best performances. THe CGI is decent years later given the time the movie came out and isn't as bad as some put it. It was never meant to be a big blockbuster zombie apocalyptic movie filled with action and gory scenes but rather a video essay that could easily be a student film on the lonely survivor of the city of New York. The footage of the first act can easily be used in any sort of post-apocalyptic setting as it is well-realised and shot. If you disassociate it from the novel of its own name it is an original and unique take at the zombie genre. Subtle in its messages but you can still hear them loud and clear, we must let the light in to get rid of the darkness.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

An average movie that could have been great.,"This fairly average movie has nothing in common with Richard Matheson's novel other than a title and a basic premise. It is much more like an American version of 28 Days Later. Basically they have taken all the interesting elements from the novel and replaced them with standard Hollywood fare. It has all the usual jumpy scenes and the requisite dose of action. The plot is fairly clichéd and simplistic, hubris in the form of a modified virus destroys civilisation and so forth. Certainly not an exceptional film and disappointing seeing as a straight adaption of the source material would have been infinitely more interesting. It has it's good points though. Some nice post apocalyptic New York City imagery and a surprisingly decent performance by Will Smith shore it up. These factors set it apart from the average B movie. The cinematography and sound are overall quite good however the CG is overdone and quite plastic looking.

The right dose of Flashbacks and ""Present"" day action keeps the story going.The first 3/4s of the movie is headed down a good line, different from the book, but almost seems to improve upon the original. The last fourth is where it loses touch with the viewer.

This  film isn't legendary,"It isn't a terrible film,it just could have been so much better.It went through the motions instead of actually doing the real work of being a good spellbinding movie.This is at least the 4th movie made from the awesome book ""I Am Legend"" by Richard Matheson.In this movie Will Smith is a lone survivor of a virus that wipes out mankind.He is an Army scientist or was before mankind all died.He ,along with his dog,lives in New York City.By day he has the run of the city by night he must hide from the night creatures that seek food.The movie is killed by the slow pacing in the first 3/4 of the film.It just takes forever to get going and about the time it does Will Smith's character has a flashback or a dream about his family.We watch Will eat breakfast and run on his treadmill and go to the rental store to browse the DVDs.Then he'll have another flashback and then back to present day picking corn or some other mundane thing.With the PG-13 rating the scares and gore are pretty tame.I'd like the film to have been grittier and less glossy if you know what I mean.It doesn't have the look of the end of civilization really.I mean Will still has electricity and water,we are never told how,and he somehow has a state of the art lab in his apartment in which he does research to try and figure out what happened.And I found it completely silly that one of the scientists who was working to contain the spread of the virus would be the sole survivor.I mean what are the odds on that?And since the virus killed over 5 billion people there is a total lack of bodies anywhere around.Just a lot of things like that were glossed over and not explained.Spend more time on the gritty details and stop trying to impress me with big expensive computer hocus-pocus.The special effects are run of the mill explosions and stuff like that.The night creatures were hugely disappointing...the same pale skinned blue veined weirdos we've seen in a least a dozen recent films like ""The Messengers"" and ""Silent Hill"".I mean come on at least give me an original monster.Will Smith is a good enough actor but a weak script and turtle like pacing of this film dooms it to being just another run of the mill horror/sci-fi movie.I was hoping this film would be great.The title of the Matheson book has always been one of the coolest titles ever,""I AM LEGEND"",I mean that is just great.This movie is worth the admission price but not one to add to your home collection.Instead take your money and get a copy of ""The Omega Man"" with Charleton Heston or better yet watch Vincent Price in ""The Last Man on Earth"" or better still find a copy of the book by Matheson.He has written some very cool stuff.Another of his books ""TheShrinking Man"" is one of the best books I've ever read.Even if this movie isn't perfect it at least has a cool title.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A 9 for the alternate ending,"I want to make it very clear that this high note is only for the alternate movie: the ending that was intended by the makers.
When I watched the movie when it first came out I thought it had an amazing built up, a great story with so much potential. And then the last 10 minutes came. What looked like an award winning movie was destroyed in just a few minutes. Besides the fact I personally didn't like the ending, the ending didn't fit in the movie. It felt rushed.
And then I found out that this wasn't the ending the makers intended. They changed it after negative reactions of the test audience.
Today I rewatched the movie and without knowing it, I put on the alternate ending movie. And then it just fit. The movie became so great, the ending fitted way better and I personally liked this ending so much more.
So for people having the same issues as me with the original movie I would advice to watch the alternate movie instead. The alternate movie ending is way more true to the book and the rest of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A half baked story ruins the film's chances of being legendary,"In a few years time, a cure for cancer has been discovered. It works perfectly at first, but then a virus emerges that begins to wipe out the human population. Fast forward a few years later, and scientist Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the only living human in New York City. Along with his dog Sam, he searches and prays to encounter other survivors. But while day time presents only the challenge of outgunning wild animals, the nights bring mutant zombies just trying to stay fed.I never saw The Omega Man or The Last Man on Earth, but I am very curious if they were anywhere near as disheartening as this film. I did not go in with the highest of expectations, but after sitting through at least an hour of this movie, I began to actually think I was going to leave surprised in how great it was. Sadly, that did not end up being the case.The story, as unoriginal as it sounds, starts off intriguing and genuinely nerve-wracking. We see Neville and his dog going about their day-to-day routines, and we begin to realize the loneliness and terror that he is going through. He nostalgically watches old news programs from before the virus hit, keeps pictures of his family laying around the house, and frequently dreams about the last night he saw his family. These moments provide just the right amount of pathos needed to feel for this character, and as an audience, we grow dependant on wondering if he will achieve his dream of interaction and end the frightening isolation he faces. Much the same as Tom Hanks in Cast Away, we learn to appreciate what is basically one character interacting with another who cannot speak back.But this is about all we get from his character by way of development. He spends much of the film searching for a cure for the epidemic, and we learn early on that it was his job to do so before the population was wiped out. But never once are we told why it was him chosen, or even how the epidemic started in the first place. We see articles and cut-outs littered around apartments, but never once does Neville stop and mention anything. Even worse, why is he the only one left? Just what exactly happened to everyone else? Unfortunately, obvious questions like these (and many, not so subtle others) are never answered. One can possibly leave it to the imagination, but with as perplexing an idea as this film presents, you would assume that the filmmakers would try and cover every angle of personality of this character. Instead, he is a few steps above being a one-dimensional card board cut out. The last third of the film does not help much either.There are also a few annoying gaps of logic in reference to the zombie characters. Besides appearing at night, emitting horrible howls at any given moment and running like Olympic marathoners, none of them are given much else to do as characters. We are introduced early on to what one would assume is the leader (played by Dash Mihok), but never get a sense of why he leads. We just get terrifying yelps and near horrifying visuals. It does not help either that the makeup and special effects used for these creatures seems like they were just thrown together, instead of being molded into perfection.Smith, as the lead and only real intelligible character for the majority of the movie, is a mixed bag. This is not his best performance, but it is not nearly his worst either. He seems to be throwing his whole heart into the role, but its demand just does not seem to be wearing off on him. Even though we are meant to believe that he is slowly going crazy from a lack of social interaction, Smith never truly shows this trait. He pokes and nudges at it, but there is something off in his calculations. Hell, his most emotionally packed sequences are almost laughable compared to some of the material in last year's The Pursuit of Happiness (and that movie was only watchable because of him). His dedication to the role wears off far too easy, and never do we get even a remotely close attempt at emulating the brilliant performance Hanks made on that island years ago. Smith is good, but just not good enough.What the film loses out on in the story and in Smith, is completely different with the visuals. They are simply awestriking. Looking at the ravaged New York, it is almost too scary to think of it ever looking anything as dystopic and plant-friendly as this. These sets were created with precision and care. While the zombies look a little haphazard, these backgrounds are just stunning. Even his apartment, where much of the film takes place, looks simply amazing. There is nothing simplistic about them, and they end up working great for the film. The colours conveyed throughout the film are also very interesting, and are well captured by the camera.The special effects on the other hand, are a little shifty. The monsters do not look that great, but some of the animals look photorealistic, and some of the sequencing (including a nighttime scene on a dock) are very well thought-out and put together. It is visually pleasing, and when they are actually on, the graphics look astounding.Plagued with problems, I Am Legend could have probably done with a solid rewrite to pack in a few more answers. Leaving it to the audience's own devices is simply uncalled for. I realize they wanted something fast paced, and the film delivers on that ideal for the most part, but only because it sacrifices too much of the all important story. More work here would have only made the film stronger, and Smith's performance potentially legendary.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I Am Legend (2007)  **1/2,"I'm a huge fan of the two earlier film versions of this story - certainly of THE OMEGA MAN and, to a lesser extent, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH. Being a sucker for most end-of-the-world science fiction movies in general, I was game enough to see what could be done at this late date for Richard Matheson's classic 1954 novel I AM LEGEND. To start off with, I'm relieved that this third adaption has its own title to keep it separate from the other two. After all, in this day of remakes run amuck, we need to be thankful for small favors.If this had been several years ago I would surely have moaned even at the thought of Will Smith taking on this lead role; but fortunately he has proved himself a pretty decent actor and movie hero in recent times. Here he takes the crucial role of Robert Neville, a scientist left alive in New York City after the rest of the world has died off from the effects of a wonder drug which promised to cure cancer but actually wound up rendering mankind virtually extinct. Neville spends his days searching out other possible survivors along with his lovable canine companion, a faithful German shepherd named Sam (short for Samantha). At night he must bolt his doors to seal himself off from a mob of rabid Computer Simulated maniacs who are what now remains of his past civilization.On the positive side, I thought Will Smith was VERY good, and there were some gripping emotional moments from him. He was quite believable as the last desperate man left alive on Earth, and the touching moments spent along with his lone friend Sam are very strong. The chilling effect of a desolate New York City left in turmoil was nicely realized. On the negative side, the film comes crashing down like lead every time we are subjected to the fake-looking hairless night monsters on the prowl who are ""the infected"". Tragically, we are subjected to that awful and overused modern day trend of needlessly depending on CGI renderings instead of using real actors. Why is it considered necessary to have these cartoon-like ravenous creatures zipping and zooming and ricocheting all about at lightning speed, loudly roaring with their extra-wide mouthes agape a la Stephen Sommers' THE MUMMY? This is a damn shame because it completely trashed what was otherwise shaping up to be a fine film indeed. Also missing from this movie is a strong sense of motivation, something which both THE LAST MAN ON EARTH and THE OMEGA MAN each had. There is no interaction with the crazed mutations, for example; they seem to exist here solely because it's what's expected in the story, and not for any solid plot point.If you've either already seen the past two incarnations of Matheson's book, or been into horror and science fiction movies for any length of time, or at least have seen either the 2004 DAWN OF THE DEAD remake or 28 DAYS LATER, you're bound to feel that I AM LEGEND gives you a sense of aimless deja vu. **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
This could have been the pinnacle survival horror movie,"Thumbs up for presenting a totally deserted New York City. It's really a wonder how the movie production managed to film something like that. It's not the usual apocalyptic scenario wherein it's devastated, dark and gloomy. It's just that the dead silence of the most populated city on Earth makes it all the more moving and realistic.Will Smith portrayal of Robert Neville, as a sole survivor of a global virus epidemic, is topnotch. And as the sole actor in the movie, he'd better be. Optimism and loneliness, laced with Smith's trademark humor and you can really relate to his character. Of course, no disaster movie is complete without an endearing pet dog.Given the family-friendly PG-13 rating, horror buffs should expect to be disappointed. For one I'm disappointed with the zombie/vampire/mutant-like Infected. They looked so CGI generic, so reminiscent of Gollum. Who'll get scared of that? Lots of ridiculous moments when he encounters the overwhelmingly numerous Infected. It's ""I, Robot"" all over again.Excellent buildup during 2/3 of the movie but it falters near the end. Lots of plot holes you'll feel the third act was rushed. I won't spoil it but the ending was unexpected, in a bad way. The movie just squandered the foregoing events and character development.This could have been the pinnacle survival horror movie. What a waste of potential.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Cast Away meets 28 Days Later,"An excellent movie that keeps you on your toes. Like the summary says, it's Tom Hanks in Cast Away meets the zombie movie 28 Days Later.

There was a perfect blend of horror, suspense, drama and action. Though not one genre overtakes the others, it blends perfectly to combine into an entertaining movie.

Has nothing on The Last Man on Earth,"In a time where just about everything is getting remade, the announcement of an updating of Richard Matheson's classic novel ""I Am Legend"" (which previously spawned the Vincent Price classic 'The Last Man on Earth' as well as 'The Omega Man') didn't exactly make me excited. The film is directed by Francis Lawrence; an ex-music video director whose previous effort was the muddled Constantine. This is a better film, but again it doesn't function as a complete whole; on the one hand, we have the desolate situation that the lead character finds himself, which is well done; but then we have masses of poor CGI and a rather boring personal story surrounding the leading man, and that just isn't good. Unlike previous adaptation of this story, this one takes the original novel's title; though I can't comment on whether or not it's closer to the source material, having not read it. The story is simple enough anyway - after a scientist discovers a cure for cancer, things go terribly awry for mankind as the cure turns deadly and becomes airborne, turning most people into nocturnal vampires and making most of the survivors their lunch. Scientist Robert Neville finds himself as the last man in Manhattan...As mentioned, director Francis Lawrence does a good job of imposing the hopelessness of the situation on the audience. The streets of Manhattan are eerily deserted, while there is a constant sense of dread emanating from the fact that we know that there are always devolved humans lurking in the shadows. This hopelessness also comes through with the leading character; who has devolved himself from a happy family man to someone unable to function properly with other people. Will Smith may not be Vincent Price, but the great thing about this actor is the fact that he is charismatic enough to hold an audience's attention; something that is definitely needed in a film like this where he is on screen at almost all times. However, all this good stuff is undermined somewhat by the film's bad points. As mentioned, the CGI looks awful and unfortunately there is rather a lot of it. The story itself is strong for the first half of the film, but after a tragic twist and the introduction of a couple of new characters, it takes a sharp downturn. There's plenty of action thrown in, and I'm by no means saying that this is a 'bad' film; but I'm surprised at the reaction it's getting, and overall I did find the whole experience rather underwhelming.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
This movie is boring and insulting to the viewer's intelligence.,"A truly terrible movie.

A potentially quality film that was simply cut too short,"My biggest problem with this film is that the whole protagonist-antagonist relationship was simplified to the point of ""de-constructing"" the movie back to the drawing board/outline stages. The book gave both sides a much more complex twist, and really made the reader question the true ""hero"" and ""villain"" of the story, whereas the film did not. Neville was pure good, and the Dark Seekers were pure evil. If this story had been an epic, then it might have worked, but in this case... not very fun in my opinion.With that said, I am convinced that Will Smith is one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood right now. I've always viewed him as the doofus from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, but in recent years, he's really diversified his roles so kudos to him. As for the movie, the first 80% of it was great, but the whole film was just a long (albeit great) build-up that never got paid off. There was no sense of closure - instead we get a rushed ending because the producer probably wanted to keep the running time down so as to squeeze out an extra showing or two per day to make more cash. I am pretty sure that the writer had nothing to do with this, as the quality of the beginning drastically contrasted that of the ending - a telltale sign of production constraints and not bad storytelling.I give it a solid 6.5/10, but it could have done so much better given the budget and the star power.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
He Is The Omega Man,"This movie is a remake of ""The Omega Man"" rather than an adaption of the book ""I Am Legend"". Francis Lawrence's movie doesn't share much more with Richard Matheson's classic novel than the title.It still could have turned out to be an entertaining popcorn flick, but ""I Am Legend"" isn't even that. The pacing is incredibly slow at times, and the story is directionless for the most part. Watching Will Smith wander through an abandoned New York is cool at first, but after a while you notice that it's not enough to keep you interested.The creatures are another disappointed. Bad CGI-work plus some rather conventional voice effects by Mike Patton just don't make for very frightening zombies.And finally, the ending is so unexciting and dull one leaves the theatre (or turns out the TV or whatever) feeling pretty vacant.Here's an idea: if Hollywood can't make a good movie out of it, why not leave Matheson's novel alone already? Seriously, three failed attempts at adapting it appropriately are enough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Very good movie, but watch both endings","No spoilers, but the ending is apparently very polarizing. Maybe that's why they made an Alternate Ending version, which pleases more people. The very strange thing for me is that I find the Alternate version to be a lot better and make a lot more sense BUT I tend to like the overall vibe of the regular ending. So I'd recommend watching both versions of the ending and be the judge. That said, regardless of the ending the move is very well worth the watch: great story, cinematography and performance from Will Smith. Special effects are still holding up 13 years later. Watching now during the 2020 quarantine gives an extra eerie feel to the experience as well... really hope this comment if read in the future will be seen as amusingly outdated (fingers crossed!).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Two films in one; one is an interesting and intelligent thriller, the second is CGI-filled dreck","I enjoyed this movie for the most part. Well, the first half at least. The first half was a neat little apocalyptic thriller. The shots of a deserted New York were effective and purveyed a sense of isolation for the main character. Will Smith was excellent as Robert Neville, one of the only people alive thanks to a virus which has wiped out the world and turned everyone into vicious, animal-like creatures who are out for blood. Smith's character is obviously losing his mind and having trouble coping with total isolation (well, apart from his dog friend). There are some tense scenes littered throughout which help keep you one the edge.Then we enter the second half, a crappy horror cartoon with no scares and some incredibly lame CGI monsters and a clichéd ending. When the monsters finally come out I sunk in my seat, not only were they pure CGI, they were pure, BAD CGI. It was almost as if they ripped them straight from a cartoon or video game and dropped into the movie. It was embarrassing and it killed what could have been an excellent movie. Not only that, the second half felt incredibly rushed, some extended scenes would have been nice and would have helped keep up the tension. And when the end comes it is a ""depressingly happy"" ending that feels a bit too clichéd and comes as a disappointment.The first half is a four star psychological thriller with a fine performance from Smith and some well shot scenes. The second half is a two star horror cartoon with appalling SFX. That averages the rating to a: 3/5",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Been there - Seen that!,"This movie barely makes it over the bar of acceptability and overall is a big disappointment given the promising concept. Will smith is his usual character (think - Independence Day, I Robot, Hitch, etc.) Really, you have seen all this before (SPOILER ALERT). The world population has been decimated by a virus (Resident Evil) and now mutated humans are all thats left and attacking the survivor (Mr Smith) - again - Resident Evil, All the Night, Dawn, Day ____ of the Dead, movies etc. Mr Smith does okay but there are some curious plot lines - this senior Military officer who is cool under pressure and apparently watched his family die along with most of the rest of the earth's population systematically tries to find a cure but when his dog is infected he apparently can't take any more and goes suicidal. The CGI created besties are overkill (pardon the pun) and are also cinematic retreads with insatiable appetites and Spiderman-like capabilities to scale walls, the speed and agility of a cheetah and strength enough to break down steel walls - again think Jason, Michael Meyers, Resident Evil, etc. Even the Zombie dogs are a big knockoff - Resident Evil. Blame the script, there is nothing new or original here and even some of the pacing is uneven with a slow start then a overly rapid (and undramatic) ending. if you really like this type of movie do yourself a favor and go look up the original - The Omega Man - although dated it is more more developed effort at dealing with these themes.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Good, but not as great as it could have been.","I liked the beginning of the movie and felt the same effect that the book created. I liked the main character development and the sense of emptiness that the was created.However, chalk me up with the group that just hated the vampires being depicted in CGI. It was comical and way too over the top. Further, there was almost zero character development with them, which is in stark contract to the book. This would have made the story much more interesting and compelling, had they spent a few minutes showing Neville interacting with them and helped to understand the sub-society that was developing.I do not think the monsters needed to be so fast, strong, and LOUD to be scary. I also thought the end of the movie was wrapped up way too conveniently. It was just a cop out Hollywood ending.Overall, this is a decent movie that could have been great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Excellent - definitely would watch it anytime,"Will Smith stars in this latest of the several film imaginings of the 1950's novel by Richard Matheson. Smith plays a man who believes that he is the last person left alive after a biological apocalypse that has killed most everyone, and made all those left into zombie or vampire-like monsters who can not survive sunlight.The monsters seem driven to constant violence and cannibalism, and incapable of anything resembling intellect or humanity. Worse, the apocalypse was man-made, the result of viral genetic engineering done in an attempt to cure cancer. Smith, in turn, a scientist, is driven to find the cure to reverse this civilization-ending catastrophe. His own family was killed by the chaos that resulted from the outbreak of the epidemic.Will Smith has made more than enough films to convince me that he is excellent in comedy, as an action hero, and as a dramatic actor. This film is perhaps his best dramatic performance yet.I fondly remember ""The Omega Man"" released in 1971, based on the same book, starring Charlton Heston, one of the most popular actors of his day. Heston was handsome, charming, strong, rugged, fearless... everything movie-goers at the time wanted in a superstar. And he played his part that way. He was heroic in almost every way.Smith plays the role in a way more fallible and believable. He treats his only companion, Sam (short for Samantha) his dog, as if she were his child. He talks to himself and store manikins as if the world were still full of other humans. At the same time, he exhibits the same self-destructive actions as Heston, understandable in a world with so little to live for. His efforts to find a cure have yielded no results, but he remains determined.When he finally comes across other survivors, events happen to bring to a head the contrast of his carefully protected and hidden environment, and the reality surrounding him. And then there are the alternative endings...If you see this movie, definitely watch both endings. Watch the original theatrical release ending first. It seems the most consistent with the book.But don't miss the alternative. I will not reveal anything, but watch for the butterflies... the butterfly Smith's kid forms with her hands, the one Sam chases, the one on the sign Smith passes, the shape in the cracks of the plexiglas when the alpha male hurls himself against it, the one the alpha male smears in his blood onto the plexiglas with his hand, and the one on the neck of the alpha female. What Smith suddenly realizes is nothing short of stunning. What he does is fearless. What happens next is positively memorable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Worn out,"One can't stop thinking what could've come out as a movie/result, if Alex Proyas would have directed this movie? See his Dark City, if you haven't, to understand where I'm going with this (there's also a Directors Cut coming this year). It's kind of the same feeling many had when Resident Evil came out and were yearning for the George A. Romero version of it.But behold, I am Legend never goes completely off tracks, as Resident Evil did (that's of course in my humble opinion). While the director and the star (Will Smith) here try to make a decent (dark) horror drama, they don't really live up to the task. The movie has it's weird moments and some nice scary ... scares, but in the end, some plot holes, the not entirely convincing ""bad guys"", a real bad turn in the third act, all add up to undermine what the movie had achieved previous to that point. The end is then a big disappointment, not because it's not clear (I did get the hints/signs, without seeing the Directors cut or alternate ending stuff), but because you came to expect more from it.I haven't seen any of the other adaptations nor did I read the book, but I can safely say that while Will Smith plays it straight, he's character is undermined by many script flaws. So he is flirting with puppets/mannequin(s), but only comes back as a boomerang at the end (if you watch the movie you know what I mean). It's a shame then, that it hasn't succeeded in walking the thin line between entertainment and dark horror drama/study ....",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
poor result,"i have waited for this film for a long time, actually since Will Smith placed it on hold to shoot Bad Boys 2.unfortunately i was disappointed to find that it was poorly directed and failed to properly address one of the most vital components of a good motion picture......a good ending.However i will give respect where its due, that is to Will Smith for constantly trying to pick up the slack where the script has failed, however he's not superman.the movie developed too quickly without a strong climax/twist, which left me disappointed. i did however enjoy the premise (first 45 min)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Trailer spoilers, a cocktail movie","I have just seen this movie and what I can say is that it was a mix of other movies, a cocktail. The whole idea was looking like ""12 monkeys"" with this living animal jungle idea, ""28 days"" and ""resident evil"" with the killing virus idea, ""pitch black"" and ""land of the dead"" because of the light terror creatures and the sense of community that have seemed to have. Of course none of the above are spoilers, you all can see them in the official trailers of this movie. The reason I gave 6of 10 is because its seems to me as if they have started to make this film based in all these ideas but somewhere in the middle they have changed their minds and the script as well and gave us something else that was not original. So although it was interesting during watching,I believe that there is a hole in the plot that didn't satisfy me at the end at all. Everything else, direction, photography, computer effects where fine and of course Will Smith gave his best as always.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I should've paid extra,"I'm on top of what movies to see and not to see based off of reviews on yahoo ""I am Legend"" was something that I wanted to see but not bad enough to give up 8+ dollars of my money.Thing of it is I'd have paid thirty dollars to see it if I knew what I was actually getting into.The use of silence was perfect with just a simple piano interlude in a few select spots. The plot wasn't all told at the beginning or in one big part of the movie: what ACTUALLY happened in detail, the family ties, what's with his connection to the dog? It made me want to know what was going to happen little by little. It was also extremely emotionally wrenching; I'm a woman and I don't cry during movies but every once in a while I tear up. Very scary as well, I was in my fiancé's lap the entire time.All people (except kids) should see this.

Impressive Non-Creature Driven Creature Feature,"When I had first heard about I am Legend I had mixed feelings about it. We've all seen a post-apocalyptic world before, and to me everyone being transformed into nocturnal, cannibalistic beasts by an airborne virus made me think about zombie vampires, but Will Smith always does a good job so I was interested in seeing him in action on this one.So I decide to go see this movie on Friday not expecting too much more than a pop-corn flick with some Will Smith Character development who fights off vampire Zombies with a sweet rifle and his canine pal. I got more than that, much more surprisingly. Besides the actual special effects, the movie looks very good with It's crystal clear picture and the action sequences are great. The Infected look CGI but they really show their transformed humanoid state as they scurry across the city and in the dark. You can really see why Smith's character wants to desperately fix what he in inadvertently caused. Which brings me to my next part of my review.Will Smith is the only real character in the entire movie, and he pulls it off. Like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, Will Smith really makes you feel like he is completely isolated and alone. He does however have his Canine pal which gives him some sanity. Smith's character explores the city during the day for food, and just plain fun. During this time we see the empty and desolate state of New York, and it's effectively eerie. Which gives this movie it's Psychological aspect of constantly being alone. Then Night time falls and Smith's character is visited at his home by some of his infected neighbors. Which gives the movie it's creature aspect respectfully.Although not the best movie out there, this will be a movie I'll purchase due to it's creative approach and brilliantly acted single lead role.8 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
breath-taking,"Extraordinarily suspenseful movie. There are quite a few scenes when the excitement almost becomes too much to bear - I was sweating and my stomach began to get irritated! - Definitely not a movie for weak nerves. As indicated, the movie ""contains elements"" of ""The Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston. However, it really looks like a very well done remake of the sci-fi classic, improving to an astonishing level the weak parts of the older movie, for example the time before the vampire attacks and the accompanying suspense, and making the main character a lot more positive and easy to identify with. Very nice as well the incorporation of the dog. All in all maybe one of the best ""no-future"" Hollywood movies of the past few years (I'm not telling the ending). Brilliant performance of Will Smith.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Amazing first 3/4 of the movie...,"I came into this movie expecting something decent, not the greatest, but most certainly not the worst. I was pleasantly surprised. Throughout the whole film, there must have been about 100 rises and falls of emotion. I swear, I almost came to tears at a couple points, and the next second I'd be laughing at some corny, yet pleasant, joke. It was just amazing.At least, up until about the last 1/4 of the movie.The producers just cheesed this ending way too much. Without giving too much away, I must say, I was very disappointed in the end. I think Will Smith did an incredible job as Robert Neville. He did justice to the character, and I could really feel for him. Like I said before, I almost shed a tear during the lowest parts of the movie. That has never happened in any other movie.

must see movie,The movie was full of suspense throughout. It is the type of movies that you would give anything in order to know the end when you are barely half way through the movie. It was sad yet kind of scary at times. This is something that we do not get from movies. I loved it even though I did not like the end. I was hoping for a better ending. This movie is not good for very young kids because it can scare them. After the first scary part my 5 year old started to cry hysterically. I really recommend this movie for those who are over 8 years old. This is the best movie after the summer blockbusters.

I have seen the two earlier version of this film. I personally feel this is the best of the three and everyone really should see it. I went to the first preview at 11:59 pm and the show was crowded.

This is much better than Hollywood's first stab at the fantastic book I Am Legend but still misses the mark in a lot of areas,"I Am Legend (2007) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on Netflix. The storyline follows the fall of mankind after the cure for cancer has unknown side effects and a virus breaks out killing most of civilization. One man, a scientist who hopes to cure and save mankind, still lives and walks the planet trying to survive, avoid the infected and find a cure for the virus.This movie is directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games) and stars Will Smith (Men in Black), Alice Braga (Predators), Salli Richardson-Whitfield (Black Dynamite), Charlie Tahan (Ozark) and Willow Smith (Neo Yokio).The film is closer to the feel of the book than Charlton Heston's Omega Man; however, this still misses the mark of him being teased and harassed at his home by the vampires every night, which was by far my favorite part of the book. This also has its own unique ending that deviated heavily from the book. However, the hunt opening scene and modernization of the film was well done. I did like the flashbacks to pre infection times to develop the main character's inner demons. The special effects initially were okay but as the film went on felt like The Mummy CGI. Will Smith was a solid main character and his dire circumstances are well felt like a black cloud hanging over the entire movie. I did love the use of the dog in this which was such a vital character in the book too.Overall this is much better than Hollywood's first stab at the fantastic book I Am Legend but still misses the mark in a lot of areas. I would score this a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Very moving and well directed,"I was really looking forward to seeing ""I Am Legend"", from the moment I found out earlier this year. In preparation to seeing the movie, I watched Vincent Price in ""The Last Man on Earth"" and Charlton Heston in ""The Omega Man"". Even though the main ideas of the two prior versions were the same (last man, virus, night creatures, etc.), the delivery varied for their particular time. So I was intrigued to see how the storyline would be adapted to our time.Boy, the first thing that struck me was the set. Being born and growing up in New York City, it really hit me hard to see the devastation and isolation of the city that ""Never Sleeps"". The streets, the abandoned cars, the bridges, the U.N.,etc. It really hit home. Then we see a much slender, leaner Will Smith trying to cope with the fact that he was alone. His portrayal of Robert Neville is Oscar worthy. Very moving. I find the origin of the virus quite interesting as it comes as a side effect for a cure for cancer. The prior two movies used a plague (The Last Man on Earth) and germ warfare (The Omega Man) to explain the virus. The use of a cure that transforms into a virus gives it an ironic twist.The movie runs for about an hour and forty minutes, but is very fast paced and well directed. The creatures, even though they are CGI, were creepy and mixed well into the movie. I'm not sure they could have gotten the same effect from live actors. I will refrain from giving any more details to avoid spoiling the movie.Very entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"A great movie, that keeps your heart rate up.","I did not know what to expect. But it delivered. What? I am still not sure. It was intense, and I think that it may have been a little much for PG-13. I looked at the ratings after the show, and R might have been a better choice, even NC-17. It was good to see our hero in a new role. But that is all I can say. It was a horror movie for sure. But it had an effect on the whole crowd who walked out of the early SF showing. Stunned and dazed. Many clapped, some sat for a while, and all came out feeling like we were glad that it was not real. It made me realize how lonely you could be if you were different from the rest of the population. New York can be that way, as it is. It is worth watching but don't go thinking it is Will taking on the world in a stereotypical kind of way. It makes him more real than he has been in any blown out of perspective action movie. He's Human! Maybe that was the point! I think I will look at my friendships a little closer as well. As one reviewer said, ""It may disappoint some of his fans"". About time. Life ain't all fun and games. His comments and the plot could be put towards many issues, that we have in our everyday lives, and I hope people can see that. Otherwise it has action that can get the biggest tough guy to wonder what is going to happen next, and will he be able to control his flinch reaction. Man I hope my friends can sleep after I took them out for this movie. But I wish I had a girl at the movie, can you say get a little closer. Hope you see it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"No Resolution, But Still A Decent Film","As I viewed this film, it quickly become clear to me that two very different themes are being explored by director Francis Lawrence in this film, one that works and one that does not:The first, more wide-reaching theme, is the fate of the human race, which Robert Neville (Will Smith) is working desperately to save throughout the movie. I can't tell you the state of humanity at the end of the film without spoiling some things, but suffice it to say that there is a good chance you will feel a bit let down by the lack of resolution to this theme.The theme that works quite well, however, is how Neville copes with being the ""last man on Earth"". His internal struggles and outward devices (such as talking to mannequins, for instance) that he uses to keep some semblance of his sanity are intriguing, and Smith is a well-rounded enough actor to portray the wide variety of emotions his character must express.Overall, then, this is a decent enough film (worth a rent), but lacks enough of a payoff in the end to be considered a real classic. I found this film to be much in the vein of J.J. Abram's recent hit ""Cloverfield"", where little to nothing is explained or expanded on...viewers are just supposed to live in the moment. Yet, with the way that Neville's family is developed in this film (unlike the anonymous characters of Cloverfield), I think that the lack of a conclusive ending was more apparent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One Man Show !!,"This is easily Will Smith's best performance till date, forget ""Ali"" forget ""legend of bagger Vance"", his face will haunt you for days to come even after you finish watching this amazing film.

But once you start watching the film you will forget all these notions and just go with the ride. Right from the opening scene till the credits, it gripped me and never let go.

"Scary, yet Entertaining","Okay. First to say, I think this is Smith's first time to play a role in a horror genre movie. And I have to admit, he did a good job here. And secondly, don't expect any gunshooting spree or car chase. And if you're looking for this kind, I guarantee, you will be disappointed.For the movie itself, I'm very satisfied with how the director manage to direct this movie with all it's atmosphere in it. You can almost sense the creepy, quiet atmosphere, and fear around the already abandoned New York City like you are really inside the movie. It's very thrilling from the start, and touchy along the way, while sad along the way too.And aside of that, Smith shows what quality he got in him. He can portrayed himself as someone who is being left alone, and try to act as normal as he can in the already abandoned environment, and only got a dog to accompany him.If you wish to enjoy this movie, and you want to enjoy this movie to it's fullest, try to think and imagine yourself as Smith. If you can manage to do that, than I'm sure you will feel satisfied, and you will understand, why people say it's a good movie and Smith is doing very good in this movie.I rate it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I Am Legend?....,"""I Am Legend"" is probably one of the most important books in the genre, I doubt there'd be a Night of the Living Dead, no Dawn, No omega man, no 28 days later and none of the films inspired by those films. So that stated you realise how enthusiastic I was about I Am Legend ""Hey there using the actual title this time it must be a lot closer to the original story now..right?"" I thought Will Smith was good as Neville, It wasn't the Will Smith from Bad Boys and Indapendance Day (I think a lot of people thought it might be) He made it feel so reel watching him going through loneliness and insanity. I feel they should have gone one way or the other with the action though, seems like they where trying to dance on two lines at once. Did they wanna make an action packed Omega Man or a character study horror film? If they had gone all action (Yet sticking to the basic storyline) I'd have enjoyed it. I think the Schwarzenegger/Ridley Scott version might have gone that route.(And yes I would have enjoyed that too) The CGI was seriously dodgy, I actually though some of the animals had escaped from Jamngi, well It's not really the fact the CGI was bad it's the fact it was used too much and most of the time when a far more economic and realistic alternative could be used.Think about good cgi in films, Jurassic Park, T2. partly the reason there was the CGI was for things we have never seen; liquid metal men and dinosaurs. If you use it for humanoid creatures or animals (especielly furry ones) we'll spot its fake as we are so used to seeing them. But also because they where designed to work with well made practical effects.Actors in make-up and actual REAL animals, you are not really trying to make me believe they don't have trained animals for films any more. CGI would of coarse still be used for animals attacking and the creatures doing un natural things but thats all it should be used for.Look at the reapers from Blade II they where far more convincing and scary, thats another point as soon as a Close Up of a bad CGI vampire appeared it lost a realism all the great character build up with Smith was lost in an instant. It's almost as if the film itself was affected by night, by day a smart character study into the horror of isolation by night a bad cgi filled action film I feel the whole point of the book was missed like not having the other infected intelligent people who Neville had killed and thus became a ""Legend"" by doing so. I thought that Anna was going to be one of them and that the place she was trying to lead him too was there society.I really wished some of them could talk I remember how creepy it seemed in the Vincent Price version when his partner would torment him every night I mean every night for 3 years its outside not letting you get some sleep ""we're gonna get you"".If it where just BASED on the book and not an adaption they shouldn't have used the title, Title should be kept for adaptations. Movies based on books that differ I don't mind e.g ""Total Recall"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Die Hard"" but could you imagine ""Lord of the Rings"" reception if they had decided to change the plot? I have to say the expansion of the dog relationship was better and made the dogs death even sadder when you realise just how important that relationship was the Neville, although perhaps showing him capture the dog like in the book would have been better. The whole film seemed to go by so quick, 1 hour 40 mins? feels like there was no 3rd act at all. Plus it seemed to only take a period of a few days, I'd have preferred to watch Nevile over months like Tom Hanks in Castaway.In actuality it was the same basic premise used many times by Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later etc (I Know they where all inspired by the book) but if your going to do a new film the most original thing they could have done is actually stick to the ""Basic"" storyline.I'm not saying it's terrible but a lot of things let it down.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Great Movie despite it's flaws,"As I read other reviews here on IMDb I can say that I started thinking and criticizing Legend more and more to where I considered dropping my score. Then I thought back. What is the point of my review? It's how much I ENJOYED the movie. It isn't how much I can pick it apart later after the fact. When I left the theater I couldn't have been much happier with I Am Legend. Will Smith's acting was first rate in my opinion. Sure, this isn't Pursuit of Happiness we are dealing with here so it isn't as deep as that but for the material in Legend I think many will agree that Will Smith did a fantastic job. Of course there are those who don't like Will and I've seen plenty of those reviews. I thought his spiraling break down in Legend was more than just believable. You could feel the emotions. The story in this movie was great but this is a rare time that I have to agree with the people who wished for MORE. This day in age I am getting used to complaining about movie length of many films but with all that Legend had to work with they could have easily made it 30 minutes or even an hour longer. I, like others, would have enjoyed seeing how this event got out of control and had the whole story fleshed out a bit more. While this is a complaint it should also show as an applause that this movie is good enough that you just want to see more. That is the way I look at it. My other complaint that others have pointed out is the CGI zombie like Seekers (believe that is what they are called). For CGI they looked awesome but I still long for at least a good blend of old style special effects makeup and CGI. I wish Hollywood would realize that the audience hasn't fallen in love with this cheaper way of doing special effects. CGI is good if it is used appropriately. Anyway, even with this complaint I will say that what was used in Legend was among the best I've seen. So, back to the story. Yes, it is similar to 28 Days/Weeks but where 28 went for the extra gore and action (especially 28 Weeks) Legend focuses more on giving us an in depth look at the main character and how he deals with feeling like he is the last man on earth. No matter what, viewers should be aware that Legend may be a good blend of genres but overall it feels like a horror movie. If you don't like horror then I caution you to stay away from Legend as you will undoubtedly be disappointed. If you are ready to see a horror movie that is above the norm then Legend should be a nice treat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Masterclass in acting - Typical Hollywood book turned movie,"Let me start by saying I wish I never read the book beforehand. If I never read the book, my review would be higher for this movie. Will Smith turns in an acting performance for the ages. Will would show up to set with nobody to act alongside except a dog. Think about that for a second, you can't build off another person's energy. Will was completely alone in camera with a dog and CGI things(vampires, if you can call them that).Let's get into the 6/10. I read I am Legend, the book, 3 years before the movie released. When I heard I am Legend was becoming a movie I couldn't contain my excitement. That excitement was short lived by what we got in the movie. For those that never read the book, are you curious why the title is called, I am Legend?

The story of this film is about a deadly, highly-infectious virus that wiped out most of New York City and perhaps the world. The only survivor in NYC, played brilliantly by Will Smith, is the virologist Robert Neville. He must find a cure with his immune blood to help the infected zombie-like creatures while avoiding them. The acting mostly by Will Smith is excellent. He did a great job playing a lone figure. The zombies were hideous looking and scary, but they could've done better with them. The scenery especially the abandoned NYC is spectacular. I don't know how they did the NYC scenes without any people. Overall this is a great film, but a bit scary for younger children. I rate this film a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"I Am Legend is a rare treat, so enjoy it!!!","Will Smith does not disappoint as the last man on earth, Robert Neville, in the incredible third film adaptation of the 1954 novel by Richard Matheson, I Am Legend.Smith sticks to his winning formula of choosing blockbusters that hinge on impressive special effects, which serve as the perfect backdrop to his always well-received performances. Smith has a rare quality of being so likable he can sustain audience interest even when he is alone for most of the movie (the gratuitous shot of him doing chin-ups is a nice bonus). His earnest delivery of both thrills and laughs makes him v. special.This commitment is shared by his very able co-star Abby, who simply must win best supporting actress. She plays Sam, Neville's German Shepherd and companion. Her eyes are very expressive for a non-mutt (purebreds' faces usually fail to have character), and she holds her own against a star like Smith (haha).The part where Neville loses Sam in a darkened building had a Blair Witch-feel, and you can't help but be as paranoid and always on the look out as Neville each time something out of the ordinary happens. Lots of other interesting details also appear in the eerie city that are worth pointing out as you vicariously accompany Neville in the lonely, future Manhattan .I Am Legend is a rare treat, so enjoy it; you will surely get emotionally tangled with the highs and lows of this action-suspense-sci-fi thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One of the best zombie movies ever! ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10,"I really enjoyed this movie. It held my attention the entire time and kept one guessing what might happen next. It was nice to see a convincing depiction, by Will Smiths character, about how deep and dark loneliness can be and if your not satisfied with the ending there is an alternate ending that is pretty good. I would definitely suggest this movie for a watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Excited for the sequel. Hoping it gets made! [+63%],"With the long-awaited announcement of the sequel, there's no better time than now to re-watch this Will Smith flick. The CGI doesn't age well, but the plot - though rushed - holds considerable potential for a sequel. Akiva Goldsman's screenplay makes the relationship between Neville (Smith) and his dog (Oscarworthy) Sam work, while the characters introduced in the second hour, played by Alice Braga and Charlie Tahan, fail to register. Even when the first hour is just Neville and Sam doing routine stuff, it's a lot more interesting because that's where we witness the artistic brilliance in creating a post-apocalyptic New York City. The wide shots are particularly remarkable, with the fragmented flashback portions adding to the emotional front. When I (re)watched the theatrical ending and the alternate ending back-to-back, I realize it's the latter that lands better and is closer in spirit to the original text.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Inconsitent,"This movie has some very good moments scattered throughout. Unfortunately, the rest is just so-so. Smith's acting is great while he's trying to maintain his sanity but he slips up at times as his sanity crumbles. The CGI was distracting at times. Some elements that could have easily been accomplished with real objects were needlessly replaced with odd-looking CGI models. The infected were only really scary for their startle factor. As the film neared the end it dwindled out and tried to make up for it with some generic action. Very anticlimactic and predictable.The better moments are while Neville tries to recreate his normal life during the day by interacting with dummies and his dog. There is more chemistry between him and inanimate objects than in most dramas. Telling the story through flashback was effective but felt a little unnecessary as the story has mostly been revealed through trailers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Smith carries script with ease,"I was worried when I saw the previews for this movie. That isn't to say I didn't think the movie looked to be awesome, but I was worried about a one man script. Would Will Smith be able to handle being almost the only character for most of the movie? Would he deliver solo lines convincingly without another actor to play off of? YES!!! He completely exceeded my expectations like I wouldn't have imagined. He portrayed multiple emotions in one go with no trouble at all, putting this performance up there with the likes of Tom Hanks in Castaway. His one real relationship in the movie with his dog, Sam, was touching. He managed to portray a possibly cheesy aspect of this film with real heart. He treated Sam as an actress, not an animal, which made all the difference. Amazing job!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
All recent zombie movies + Cast Away = I Am Legend,"I saw the first showing of this film at 11:59 PM. I have never read the book and do not know the premise of the book, so my review is going to circle completely around the movie. First of all the acting was pretty good, Will Smith did a great job (But I gotta say the dog was better). When I watched the previews I did not know what to expect from this film, was it a suspense film, horror, science fiction? The film revolves around a military scientist, who just so happens to be the only living immune person in it in all of New York City. He tries to live a normal life, renting films, talking to statues he set up, and his most important thing is his dog. He is working on a cure for this mutated virus in his basement.There is something lurking in the shadows, this virus has created zombie-vampires. They cannot go into sun or their flesh will melt (Anyone seen Buffy lately?) There jaws are able to open very wide to consume flesh. And the virus is transmitted by blood.Some people find him and he has a hard time with communication. Yeah that is the movie. I expected a little more. To be completely honest 28 Months later was a much better film with a much better premise. Much more believable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Excellent movie, but  not for everyone.","This movie takes Richard Matheson's Book ""I Am Legend"" and adds in the missing pieces to make it a complete story. The acting, visuals, and sound bring everything together to make this a truly immersive experience that will leave you on the edge of your seat (and occasionally jumping off of it).This movie is not for everyone however. It may leave you with feelings that you are not comfortable with, especially during the Christmas holidays when there is a risk of depression for some people.I must also admit that while I found Matheson's short story interesting, there was just something missing from it that kept it from being complete.

Refreshing Movie,"It seems that nowadays, every time I go see a movie I end up leaving saying ""Geez, I just wasted money and time I will never get back."" This time, I left in a decently satisfied mood. Will Smith delivers a terrific performance as Dr. Robert Neville, the last man on Earth. Whenever I see a zombie movie trailer I have the assumption that it is just widespread chaos, fires, bodies, destruction, all of that sort. Not this time. It is good to take a somewhat realistic but far-fetched approach to a zombie-survival movie with a great plot line built into it. New York in the near future empty looks phenomenal. The only flaws I can really point out are that the action sequences were short and few, but ultimately satisfying.

Hauntingly beautiful solitude,"Hauntingly beautiful deserted New York City landscapes are one of the main visuals of ""I am Legend"". Will Smith plays the sole survivor of New York City after an virus has decimated 95% of the world population. The remaining 5% are zombies feeding on anything that breathes. Struggling to find a cure against the virus Will Smith roams the streets of New York City in complete solitude.The visuals are stunning! To see one of the most busy and well know centres of the world look completely deserted and overgrown with plants is just amazing. I am flabbergasted and in awe of the visual effects of this movie. That alone would make this movie worth watching. The acting is as good as it gets with Will Smith, who doesnt play his usual cheery self. It is pain, fear and determination that is written all over Will Smith's face throughout this movie.The suspense is thrilling from beginning to end. Although there are no humans left alive, there are still masses of zombies who will tear anyone apart. The constant looming danger of being attacked by zombies is very thrilling.There could have been an alternate more original ending, then I would have given this overwhelming visual thriller an 8. Now I lower my appreciation to a well deserved 7. Not a typical cheerful Will Smith actionmovie. This is serious stuff, brilliantly produced and visualized.

Legendary,"When the cure for cancer ends up being a much worse virus called the Krypton Virus, it killed more people than cancer ever had. With a 90% mortality rate, billions of people were killed.

Dr. Robert Neville (Will Smith) was a lone survivor in New York City, and he was also the world's best option for finding a cure.""I Am Legend"" was a scary good look at a dystopian world and how a single man might go about surviving day-to-day.

I Am Legend,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerDirector Francis Lawrence has a way with suspense; jumping out of your seat is almost a requirement here. Onscreen, Manhattan transforms into a true island, isolated, removed, and falling apart. Weeds grow on the streets, Times Square is deserted, the Flatiron Building sits neglected, and an eerie hush has fallen. Bravo to the special effects crew, who have created a New York never seen before (except, perhaps, in Escape to New York). The results are nothing short of amazing.But the story ultimately disappoints. It starts out strong, hooking viewers in, but it sputters in the end. It's as if the screenwriters (or director, or producer) ran out of ways to wrap it up. Or perhaps the film simply doesn't have the same nuances as the Richard Matheson book on which it's based. Still, you can't fault I Am Legend for trying to be different from the typical action thriller. Taking on such themes as mankind's need for companionship, the fight for survival, and the existence of God, it at least succeeds in making us think.Overall Rating: 6.0",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

7.4/10 is inaccurate.,"As my summary states, 7/10 might be pushing it. I had quite a few problems with this movie.1) Overpriced, but that's not entirely the movie's fault. Mostly my own problem, as I could have spent my 5$ for ticket and 15$ on food on something entirely different than this. My bad.2) The acting was fine. Really, it wasn't too far fetched or anything. But that's really the only thing that saved this movie from being a 4/10 for me.3) And now to my main problem, was the story itself. There were entirely too many irrelevant(Sp?) scenes that didn't need to be included while the actual ""background"" of the 94% population dieing off was explained in unorganized flashbacks. Instead of shoving 30 minutes of ""filler-up"" scenes watching Will Smith's character stalk, walk, and jump through the barren streets of Manhatten (or NYC itself? I got confused), more relevancy to the story could have been plugged in.4) The ""horror"" of this movie was pathetically achieved with the ""quiet.... quiet... BOO!"" horror style that should have died off years ago.What I'm trying to say is the movie was dragged too much. A lot of it just pointless, they could have added more to the movie.

Picture of the Year?,I Am Legend came in third at the box office in it's first week . It was a great drama but it had some flaws. It started off good with actor Will Smith chasing deers in the middle of the city that some how got turned in to the jungle. You really would't know what happened.New York Times gave it 2 thumbs up they also gave Will Smith 2 thumbs up for a great performance. He is dedicated to a role that was very believable. The movie would have been better if they showed how exactly did the cure that made a out come it did. Such as making lions and other jungle like animals appear in the city. Still this is a great film.In my eyes this could be one of the best pictures of the year.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Excellent performance from smith,intense, raw and a unique insight.","I had high expectations for this movie since there's quite the hype, plus Smith's in it. Its not as gory, or like such films as 28 weeks later nor any other in its genre. But the interest and rawness is from the observatory and moving portrayal of Smith. It feels through out the movie the feeling of reality gone horribly wrong and how such impossibility is dealt with and dealt with very well, through a well acted character. You feel for him, you follow and anticipate what he does and observe closely as your hooked from the start.His reactions and ways to keep himself sane is reminiscent of cast away. Though in this his relationship with the dog is inspirational as it is sad. Its a moving movie an imaginative one. Great performance from Smith. It is intense through out keeping you at the edge of your seat. The downsides are the infected monsters appearance while it is alright, it wasn't as scary as i anticipated. Through seeing transformers and 300 the level of cgi really went up and I felt as if it could have been more lifelike. It could have been longer too, a hour more would have made it even more perfect.

The Last Man On Earth...Is Not Alone.,"I'll get right to it, Will Smith is great in this film, he shows a great deal of vulnerability as a battle harden soldier/army doctor trying to cope with fear, uncertainty and loneliness.This story, I know is loosely based on the book of the same name, which has been adapted twice before as, The Last Man on Earth and The Omega Man.In this story , with only his dog for company Dr. Robert Neivelle, lives in a desolated New York City for the past three years with no human contact,but lurk-inking in the shadows are mutant plague victims watching his every move,struggling to find survivors and desperately trying to find a cure using his own immune blood.I first seen this with a buddy the opening weekend back in 2007, we both very much enjoyed it, we both enjoy Will Smith and thought the story was good.A year later, I decided to look up the book and I was surprised that it was adapted into two other films which I've seen, more on that for another review.Overall, I liked this film, I own it on DVD and I think this should be seen by more people if it hasn't already. Now I know there are some novel purists out there who feel that this movie isn't close to the source, but I think this is the closest where going to get to the book with a PG-13 rating.I give it a 7/10.

The way in which it gradually reveals the information is seamless and elegant. The zombies/vampires are probably the most interesting of any movie in the genre.I will probably keep watching this every so often but there are some shortcomings, the movie is too short, the last half hour is weirdly paced.

No depth,"As someone old enough to have seen the original version of this movie (Omega Man) I was a little disappointed.The special effects were allowed to overcome the plot and the story, but this has become the norm for Hollywood. The computer generated dogs and even the human mutants were styled more along the line of non-humans and even had a somewhat alien essence to them. They were portrayed more as monsters rather than as human victims.There was glimpse of what would have been a interesting relationship between Will Smiths character and the mutant leader, but just as it was starting to develop the movie abandoned it.The relationship between Dr. Neville and the woman and boy he meet is also never developed, or even real. He meets the first non-mutant people for the first time in three years, and yet he's casual and even aloof. He basically treats them like you do the clerk at 7-11. The relationship between Will Smith and this woman does start to develop later on, but once again the movie departs from it for more computer generated battle scenes.I did like Will Smiths portrayal. I now have a new found respect for him as an actor, and he reveals a depth and a new level of his abilities.

The direction which was made by Francis Lawrence it was very good and I found very interesting the way he presented his main character and his dependence on the evolution of the research on finding the cure. In addition to this, Sam (the dog) played a major role on the movie and he used that role very well too. The interpretation of Will Smith who played as Robert Neville is simply amazing and I believe that he made one of his best interpretations.

A failed attempt at a very interesting idea,"It's a very interesting idea for a story--something worth putting thought into. However, perhaps more thought should have been spent. Theatrically, this was a decent movie. We all know that Will Smith can act. The sets were pretty sweet. These elements mean nothing, unfortunately, if the story which they attempt to tell is littered with holes and problems. For instance, a lack of exposition and character development made it impossible to sympathize with any of the characters. If the theme of the story truly was about God's place in tragedies such as that described in the movie, then the writers absolutely failed to deliver the most important part of the story.In a nutshell: Kudos for coming up with a good idea, but I'm sorry that it really didn't work out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

This film is legend,"Years after a plague kills most of humanity and transforms the rest into monsters, the sole survivor in New York City (Will Smith) struggles valiantly to find a cure.Will Smith plays Robert Neville, an ex military virologist, the last human alive in New York city, living in a fortified house and working tirelessly to find a cure for the disease that has turned most people in the world into zombies. Tp achieve this he regularly goes out in the city to capture zombies, in order to use them to test his work, accompanied by his beloved dog Sam. Will Smith has a convincing and powerful portfolio of films, and this is in the top five. I've watched it several times now and it never gets old. It not only treats zombies as virus ridden humans, but tries to imagine what living under those conditions must be like, locked into a solitary life of dedication to humanity but at risk every day. There's only 3 main characters in the body of the film: Robert Neville, his dog Sam and Anna (Alice Braga) who turns up in New York city on a quest to find a mythical safe zone. It's at times a very tense film, with Smith and Braga utterly convincing, and a plot and storyline that is believable despite the unbelievable situation.

It's painfully obvious every single time an animal or humanoid is computer generated. The sets ARE astounding tho.As for the storyline... it's interesting and goes strong for most of the movie, and then suddenly turns to manure. the ending is an abominable splicing of the finale for a michael bay movie and one of M Night Shymalan's putrid plot lines.

Entertaining but misses the point.,"If you are fan of Matheson's book prepare to be disappointed as the film entirely misses the point, especially when it comes to the title itself. Having said that, taken on it's own merits the film is not all that bad. The opening half hour is well constructed and the lingering shots of a deserted NYC are quite effective. Will Smith reigns in his usual on-screen persona to deliver a good performance as Robert Neville, although at times it does seem as though he's playing to an audience which is at odds with the permeating sense of isolation (problems with the script rather than Smith himself). Aside from it's deviation from the book, the film's most glaring problem are the dark seekers themselves. They are entirely rendered in by today's standards unconvincing cgi and therefore never quite achieve the feeling of menace we're supposed to feel. Real actors in make-up with perhaps a little cgi augmentation would've been far better. Also the attempt to create an antagonist for Neville falls a little flat, as he comes across as nothing more than a slighter smarter creature with a grudge. What does work though is Neville's relationship with his dog, Sam. Considering they spend the majority of their screen time together it was important it felt like they had a genuine bond and they do. Also Neville's flashbacks to a time shortly before the worst of the outbreak are well-implemented, never interrupting the pace of the narrative. Ultimately it's the last predictable half hour of the film that falls flat and undoes most of the good work. It's worth seeing but for all Richard Matheson fans it will be frustrating at best. In fact, for anyone who read Mark Protosevich's script that leaked online a few years back you'll probably wish they made that film instead.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Could have used more back story,"I enjoyed this film but I feel like a lot of the story was left out. There could have been a lot more back story added, such as how the virus was developed & spread, Neville's dealing with trying to keep it contained, and later how he found himself being the lone inhabitant of New York City. I know it would be hard to tell the whole story in flashbacks, but this movie could have used it.There are also some things left unexplained, such as how Neville got all that electricity (3 years after just about everybody died off, I'm sure nobody would be manning the power plants feeding the city), and how Anna & Ethan got onto Manhattan Island after all the bridges were knocked down.This movie could have been so much longer and in-depth, but as it was I thought it was good & entertaining. If some more of the story had been added, I'd probably have rated it higher.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"A movie with potential, let down by comical CGI","This was Will Smith before the slap, he was a very bankable actor and we have here a post apocalyptic movie with not quite zombies - but infected nonetheless, taken I believe from a novel. A virus is taken from nature and tinkered with, but it inadvertently destroys civilization (sounds familiar..) and that's where the movie starts. The infected become slightly deformed and violent/fast, similar to 28 Days Later. The movie stars Will Smith as a military scientist (likely virologist) in NYC, the sole survivor with his dog.Movies like this with one good actor (or two in this case) and a lot of atmosphere/visual storytelling can be excellent. The viewer's attention is less divided and they can be even more immersed. The award winning Kostner movie 'Dances With Wolves' is a prime example.The setting in this movie is done well too and really gives the feeling that society has fallen, and nature reclaimed what was once it's territory. Also the horror-esque moments can be tense.Where does it go wrong? Put simply, the infected look comical and ridiculous. This isn't good CGI for 2007, Smith is up against angry stretchy mouth people - which is just hard to take seriously. It immediately dispels any tension and pulls you out of the immersion. Were these real actors with makeup/prosthetics, this movie could've been much better, and the tense moments before and after the infected are revealed - both holding weight rather than becoming comical. Otherwise the CGI needed a lot more work to both look more realistic and be more intimidating/gripping.6/10 - still worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Last Man Standing,"Inspired by the same source material as 'The Last Man on Earth' and 'The Omega Man', this third big screen adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel sits somewhere between its predecessors in quality. The positives include graphic special effects, a touching relationship between the protagonist and his dog, which he has come to see as a surrogate child in lieu of his own deceased one, and some genuinely creepy moments (following his dog into a dark building). The film also provides an impressive portrait of a desolate metropolis in ruins, with overgrown grass and escaped zoo animals wandering the streets. There is additionally quite a bit to like in how much time elapses (around half an hour) before we even glimpse the zombie/vampire creatures. The second half of the film is nowhere near as effective as the build-up to it though. There are some particular dull moments as two new characters are introduced that allow the protagonist to reflect on his existence. His flashbacks are also less haunting here than those in 'The Last Man on Earth' and the film abandons the memorable ending of the 60s version for something far more sentimental if not necessarily upbeat. All things considered though, Will Smith is quite effective in the lead role, and it would have been interesting to see an entire film dedicated to his friendship with his canine companion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Impressive story, emotional acting. The only flaw is the CGI","I will not repeat what many here have already said bofore, but I would like to underline how impressively this movie was shot, the ambience and the city is just perfect. I was wondering whether they used studios and entirely rebuilt the city or managed to get the city swept ouf of people to shoot these scenes :)
Will Smith does a great acting job, I could not imagine anyone else at his place. The bond he created with the dog was not only fictional, by the way, as he tried to adopt her after the shooting and they developed a marvellous and beliavable relationship. However, he did not succeed as the owner didn´t want to give up the dog.With that being said, we can assume this is a great post-apocalyptic movie that suits greatly also the current pandemic situation. Like - just imagine what happens after people transform with all those vaccine shots... hypothetically obviously.The only flaw I couldn´t omit are the CGI effects. I mean - we have movies shot much longer before the year 2007 and they did a better computer graphic job than this movie, like Matrix for example. The fact that the infected / zombies looked all the same, moved in the same way and most importantly had all the same dress made me laugh and say that the CGI experts could do a bit more effort for God´s sake. Running through the streets in the same green trousers and shirts, like really? Who gave it to them? Wouldn´t they be naked or rather in the same dress they dad from the day they transformed?I loved the movie and it is not a case that I use to watch it once a year, I need it somehow. This movie is great and the soundtrack only underlines the story. Definitely recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Too Depressing a Story,"Doctor/Scientist Robert Neville (Smith) in New York City is a lone survivor of an escaped man-made virus that killed most of the earth's population and turned many into mutants and he is determined to find a way to reverse the trend. He is immune to the virus.This movie is one of the reasons I do not watch horror movies. I knew it wouldn't be so bad, but it did have some moments. Will Smith is a terrific actor and he provided a believable scenario of a man fighting to find a cure among the mutants who constantly watch him. His scenes with Samantha provided the levity we needed to go further into this very depressing story. I guess somewhere at some time, someone would make this kind of a movie. Yea! Let's all hear it for. When Hollywood wants to make a depressing movie it really knows how to do it.Something I didn't understand. Neville has all this electronic equipment yet he has no contact with anyone outside NYC? None. One would think that they would be calling in to see how things are progressing with the cure. No contact at all so he talks to Samantha because he believes there is no one out there so he doesn't bother and doesn't' try. He believes he is alone.Also, we see many dead people in the last act they will ever commit. Some are standing, some bent over. You would think the ones standing or bent over would let gravity have it's way. But, no. They are now like statues. Very spooky.Oh, in flashbacks, when Samantha was a puppy, she was of a different coloring than the adult Samantha. I guess they couldn't find the right puppy. Probably thought we wouldn't notice. HA!So the movie is just Neville working on a cure in his lab and escaping from the mutants from time to time until Anna (Braga) comes on the scene. However, good action scenes keep you riveted to your seat and you keep hoping this will all turn out good.The CGI was okay, the stunts were good, the dialogue was good, the cinematography was excellent, but it was all too depressing to have any real entertainment value for me.Violence: Yes Sex: No Nudity: No Language No",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Legendary this movie is not,"Once again Will Smith is called upon to save the world. Only this time there isn't much of a world left to be saved. A virus has killed off pretty much everyone on the planet. Those who didn't die mutated into soulless bloodthirsty zombies. A lucky few were immune to the virus...but it seems they've all been killed by the zombies. Not so lucky after all I guess. In a deserted New York City where deer and lions roam free during the day and the zombies rule the night one man survives. That man is of course Will Smith. Well no, actually that man is military doctor Robert Neville, played by Smith. Because if the last man alive on planet Earth was actually Will Smith that would just be silly. But I digress. Anyhow Smith, er, Neville forages for food during the day and retreats to his heavily fortified home at night lest the zombies get him. Oh, and in his spare time, he tries to find a cure for the disease. A little late now one thinks but OK. If he can find some magic potion to turn hairless, mindless bloodsucking zombies back into ordinary human beings well then color me suitably impressed. So the movie slogs along with Neville and his dog wandering around Manhattan, having a few encounters with the zombie types and then going home. And then there are a few twists and all of a sudden the movie's over. Yeah, there's not a whole lot going on here.This is by no means a lousy movie but you get the sense it could have been a lot better. There are certainly some nice pieces. The shots of a deserted, overgrown Manhattan are spectacular. Smith does a highly admirable job in essentially carrying the movie all by himself. There are a few brief flashback sequences thrown in but basically the whole movie is Smith and his dog. Really, we could have used some more of those flashbacks to flesh out the story which really is bare-bones. OK, we get the general idea of what happened but it would have probably helped the film if we saw more of what went on as the planet's population was dwindling from six billion people to one Will Smith. As it is we're thrown right into the post-apocalyptic aftermath and we never really get to know enough about Smith's character. Which is kind of important considering his character is essentially the movie's only character.Another problem with the film is the look of the zombies. The filmmakers went overboard with the CGI and the creatures often come off looking more silly than menacing. And with their CGI-generated superhuman speed and strength it is hard to believe that these things were once ordinary people. And how is it that all these zombies come out looking exactly alike? Last I checked human beings don't all look alike and these things were human beings remember? That's one strange virus.In the end this ends up being a reasonably entertaining but somewhat disappointing movie. All too often there's just nothing going on. The one character the movie has is barely developed at all and the story is sorely lacking some background information to flesh it out. But the movie does have its moments. And you stick with it expecting that one big moment at the end but in that regard you may be left feeling a little let down. The ending confuses more than it inspires. All of a sudden the movie's over and you're left saying, ""That's it? Really?"" Yeah, that's it. Kudos to Smith for pretty much singlehandedly dragging this movie to respectability but he can't quite bring it home. At least not as powerfully as you might like. Better luck in your next effort to save the world Will.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Pretty good let down,"With what I'm going to say most of you will line me up against a wall and shoot me, but the film let me down, it's been some time since I've left the cinema wishing I had gone to see any other film. I had been waiting for ages to see this film and finally got the chance to have some time on my own and get cozy in my seat at sit back and enjoy it, I love vampire movies and have great respect for Mr Smith. It started of great, the sensation of the empty NYC was great, the nothingness that accompanied the survivor and his dog was terrifying, the story line incredible and the FX pretty good, but that was it, I had a feeling that I was watching a mixture of movies all joined in one, the base line to ""28 days"", ""the Reapers"" from ""Blade 2"", the Alpha Male screamed just like the ""High Pries Imhotep"" from ""The Mummy"" before taking his human form, and a long line of etc's. It was entertaining but by no means stood up to what I was expecting. I was pleased that it wasn't the typical vampire blaster movie, just blood and guts...but I think they over did the humanity message. During most of the film Will Smith was sublime, as always, I must admit he is one of my favorite actors, he saved the movie, it's thanks to him that I've given it a 6/10.

Decent but nothing Special,"I Am Legend seemed like it was going to be awesome in the beginning, we open with Will Smith driving around and shooting animals for food in a deserted New York City, but the movie slowly drops in quality. There are tons of action scenes that seem to be important to the plot but they never pays off in the end. The Zombies were pretty cool but I definitely think they could have been done better; I do have to say that the action scenes with the zombies were amazing though. One part in the movie really caught my attention; Will Smith is walking through the city with his dog win he sees a mannequin in the street, he passes this occurrence off as nothing but all of the sudden the mannequin moves. This scene was freaking awesome, but it never pays off, the only thing that happens is Will Smith freaks out and shoots the mannequin up with a machine gun. The entire movie seems to be building up to something but in the end builds up to nothing. As I said before I Am Legend has some amazing special effects, the deserted New York is a modern day special effects masterpiece, but some of the CG in this movie is really questionable, like a CGI rat?! Since by the time this review comes out I Am Legend will be out on DVD I guess I will have to give you a recommendation about whether or not to go rent it or buy it or see it at all, and I guess I would say to go rent it from ITunes, or Netflix to see if you like it yourself but to me I Am Legend was a major disappointment, and only because of some stellar action scenes, I'll give it a 75 out of 100.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Very Disappointing.,"Some good moments but on the whole Hollywoods this carbon copy of 28 days later proved a inadequate, over elaborate and unrealistic take on the doomsday scenario. Far to much CGI with the infected syringed away the realism that the picture needed to prove credible. The production was to closely related to its basis 28 days later, offering little more than a thin New Yorkian veneer. The classic Hollywood plot blueprint was clichey thus predictable. Will smith proved a rare highlight of the film performing well especially in tandem with his canine companion. Also the personal juxtaposition with the family and the global event that was unfolding induced a intriguing sense of empathy.

I Am Legend is not a typical sci-fi action thriller but an excellent deeper story that focuses on a lonely man and the price he pays to try to save humanity.,"I Am Legend follows the story of an isolated survivor still trying to find a cure to a pandemic that turned the world into crazed mutants. The movie's scale and cinematography are impressive, with large wide shots of nature slowly reclaiming the city of New York. Will Smith's performance carries the film (and kind of has to since he is alone for most of it). His emotion and conviction brilliantly convey the cost of his isolation and the toll years of suffering have taken on him. Long before John Wick had his dog, Robert Neville (Will Smith) had his dog in I Am Legend, and their relationship tugs on the heartstrings throughout the film. I Am Legend gives moments of suspense and horror, great action scenes, and psychological drama. I also enjoyed the religious references in the movie. There are really only two flaws I see in this film:1. The CGI is dated and disappointing by today's standards, but it wasn't all that bad when the movie was first released.2. The theatrical ending was decent, but if you can watch the alternate ending, do it! It is significantly better and helps fill some plot holes from earlier in the film (I believe the alternate ending was probably the original ending).I Am Legend is an excellent story of survival and the effects of loneliness and obsession. Will Smith's incredible performance makes this movie one of the better survival post-apocalyptic films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Not enough substance, but it was still very entertaining.","""I Am Legend"" runs at about 90 minutes without credits, and with very little background information or talking from Will Smith, we have no reason to support Will Smith on his conquest to survive.Will Smith plays Roger Neville, a scientist who tried to develop a cure for cancer, and ended up turning the people into vampire like creatures. He now is what appears to be the last living man on Earth, and he and his dog Sam try to keep on living life. Will Smith gave a good performance, but the character is so one dimensional. For most of the movie he seems very angry and serious, and then he has the occasional joke, that usually caused a light chuckle in the audience. He was still somehow likable, but he could've been a much better character, considering this whole movie is practically a one man show for him. Any other characters in the story don't have enough screen time for the audience to care about them, and they are very underdeveloped (even more so than him).A lot of action-horror movies are missing heart, and that's a big positive for this one. It has a heart, and it has some touching moments. This layered the movie and made it more than just a bunch of special effects and jump scenes right after each other.In the end, this was a good movie, but I preferred the Omega Man over this.My rating: *** out of ****. 90 mins.

I am Legend,"Based on the 1954 novel by Richard Matheson, this is the third adaptation of the story. The earlier two were The Last Man on earth (1964) and The Omega Man (1971). With its Christmas release, huge budget and production costs and general hype created around it  obviously, it was a tempting offering during Christmas holidays.Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the only man to survive the worldwide apocalypse due to a viral disease that has killed most of the human race and left the remaining humans as flesh eating zombies  who cannot come out in the light and can only come out in the dark to search their food. Robert and his dog Sam roam around deserted New York streets every day to search / hunt for food and waiting for some other survivors to contact them or works in his lab to find a viral cure. Robert encounters his own despairs and memories of his lovely wife and daughter, and battles with zombies. In one encounter with zombies, his dog is infected and dies, which leaves Robert desperate to take revenge and commit a suicidal attack on zombies. Anna (Alice Braga) - another survivor, rescues Robert. In the end, Robert dies in an effort to save Anna, but not before finding the cure for the disease.Those who have not read the original novel  might find the movie entertaining to some extend. But be aware, that except the theme, this movie does not have any close resemblance with the original story, which is many times more interesting in its content, events and story telling.This is a more ultra Americanized (American saving the worldnot again!) effort by the first time movie director Francis Lawrence, who until now only directed videos  mainly music videos for singers like Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez.The budget is big and the production values enormous, which is seen on the cinema canvas and those visuals of deserted New York City are fascinating to say the least.The movie belongs to Will Smith all the way. He carries each scene with great maturity and presence. He is the sole recognizable character in the whole movie until the last 30 minutes when Anna enters the scene. Will Smith has done great job in acting out the emotions and range of it. He looks great with his newly built muscular physique.With good entertainment value, but poor adaptation (a lost opportunity  both for Francis and Will Smith) makes it movie an average viewing.

Sometimes studios need to get out of the way....,"I will get it out of the way right up front. The studio mandated ending absolutely stunk. No two ways about it, even if the original ending wasn't really any better, I can understand how the ending can completely ruin or at least compliment a film. This is really the only complaint I have about this film because in all honesty, this entire project was pretty interesting.Now for those that liked Richard Matheson's original novella, yes I know this is not a true adaptation and therefore won't consider the original book as the source material. What we did get was a rather engaging and sometimes realistic look at what could happen when a world ravaged by a virus leaves just a select few behind. We get Robert Neville, a well respected scientist, stuck in New York as he struggles to maintain his life and his sanity in the aftermath of the world pretty much being killed off. By day, he hopes for someone to answer his distress signal as he maintains a rigid schedule of foraging, hunting and watching movies. Until a fateful moment changes everything and he comes into actual contact with other people, his world is shaped by the idea he is the last man standing.What this story really does well is illustrate how traumatized Neville is in this world. He watched his family die in front of him and witnessed the end of society as we know it. He creates little narratives with mannequins and hoards special items in hopes of being rescued. His reaction to Anna and her son eating his bacon is pretty spot on. Just about every little detail within the film is perfect...up until that studio forced ending.Even though the fixed ending where it is revealed the Dark Seekers have some form of intelligence, it would have been far closer to the intent of the original. A creature, alien to all of the other beings around him, is stealing your kind. You never see that being ever again. So who is really the monster in this instance? Needless to say, I hope the next person that tries to adapt this story can give it a much more apt ending.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Great Special Effects & Premise - Mediocre Delivery.,"After a so called cure for cancer mutates the host into a vampire like creature, 90% of earth's population ends up dead. One man, who is immune to the virus, stays in New York to find a cure.I Am Legend is the third film to be made from the book with the same name. The first two, The Last Man On Earth and The Omega Man, I have not seen. After viewing Legend, I can only hope they both have a stronger second half and conclusion, because Legend fails to capture it's audience in the third act.The idea behind Legend is great and the in the right hands, the possibilities are endless. After viewing Legend I found myself wondering why it feels like two different films. Years prior Smith starred in a film about Robots taking over the city. In I, Robot the machines climb building walls, crash through glass and will not stop until they kill everyone. The third act of Legend follows the same structure. I couldn't help but picture the vampires as the robots as the climbed buildings and ripped through ceilings. The vampires themselves aren't too impressive on the technical scale. Seeing them attack wasn't as impressive as it should have been. They looked way too fake and it took me out of the reality of the film.The whole film lands on Smith's shoulders and he pulls it off. The isolation in such a big city takes its course and slowly he begins to lose his mind. He interacts with his dog Sam and mannequins at the video store so he can have some kind of interaction. Tom Hanks did a similar thing in Cast Away. The film starts 3 years after the virus hits and it's a marvel to see the city in the state it's in. The technology we've created is what killed us. The technology we created is what outlived us. Seeing the tall buildings stands still while there is no live around it was astounding. The grass creeping through the streets, the abandoned cars and live animals roaming the city of New York. The special effects for this film is the highlight. It creates an atmosphere that no other post apocalyptic film has ever created. It makes one wonder if this will be our future. If we all die, will the things we created live on.While the film does try and get us to connect with the lead character at the beginning, it doesn't try to keep that connection. It moves into an action film and I suddenly couldn't really care if Smith lived or died. I felt more of a connection with the dog Sam then I did with Smith. The film works up until one point, then it seems to go downhill and never catches back up with itself. When two new characters suddenly appear on the island.There are bits and pieces of the film that don't really make sense. Like how all the creature look exactly alike, but those small things aside Legend is an enjoyable flick. It has moments of intense scenes, but then it has moments that make you question why. Such as why there appears to be a leader in the vampire pack. The flashbacks that are used to tell what happened to his family during the contamination of the city aren't that effective. It would have been more useful to have the flashbacks told with different days, instead of one night. Seeing Smith learning new ways to cope with his surroundings, meeting the infected for the first time, anything would have really worked. But they never took that advantage. It would have worked to connect us with Smith's character.While Legend does have the performances or the conclusion one would hope, but it is worth a look at for it's special effects alone. It has it's fair share of problems, it stars of slow and ends fast. It's a mixed bag, the story is great, but presented on an average form. The special effects are astounding, but some of it look fake, like the vampires. In the end I did enjoy myself and that's what people look for at the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Decent Zombie Flick,"Well I took a day off from studying for my finals last night and went to see I Am Legend with the girlfriend. I guess I will go with the good before what I thought could have been better.Will Smith as always was superb. His acting was great and you could really feel his pain at various points in the movie. Furthermore, the CGI and scenes of an abandonded New York were amazing. It really gave you an insight to what a city might look like if it became completely uninhabited. The plot development was pretty good, with a tiny bit of holes here and there that left me unsatisfied. The ending was rather abrupt as well. Also, I for the life of me, cannot understand how zombies, who were humans at one point, have superhuman strength.

If you want to see an insight into what the world would be like if a massive portion of the population was killed. Go see it.

"No Award-Winner, But Definitely Entertaining","Well, this certainly was entertaining. It's no award winner, but it's involving. The hour-and-a-half goes by pretty fast, and gets you into the plight of the main character, so I give it eight stars for that.I can't say the story is anything special, or particularly intelligent. The theme of few people left on the planet, a kind of ""Planet Of The Ape"" type tale, is nothing new. This one just has a few different twists to it and, film-wise, is different in that it features computerized special-effects. As one who normally enjoys those visual treats, I would rate this aspect ""fair,"" too, like the story. Early on, the animals racing down New York City streets looked very fake. Later, the effects were a little better with the zombies, but nothing that would make you drop your jaw in amazement.Like the story and FX, Will Smith as the lead character was okay: good, but not Oscar material. Actually, I thought the German Shepherd did the best job of acting in the film!If you are looking for suspense, some scary scenes and a good diversion in your life for 91 minutes, I'd recommend this movie. Just know what you're getting: this is very horror-like in many spots. It's a tense story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"It could have been great. Instead, it's just good.","In 2009, a doctor named Alice Krippin (an unbilled Emma Thompson) develops what is supposedly a miracle cure for cancer. However, this so called ""cure"" leads to an outbreak of a new disease that turns victims into photosensitive ghouls. Three years later, a lone military doctor named Robert Neville (Will Smith) seems to be the last human standing in a devastated, post apocalyptic NYC. His only companion is his faithful dog Sam (played by ""Abbey"" and ""Kona""), while he avoids the creatures known as ""the dark seekers"" and determinedly tries to find a cure for this plague.The third official screen adaptation of Richard Mathesons' novel ""I am Legend"" is the first one to use that title, after ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964) and ""The Omega Man"" (1971). Also drawing inspiration from the screenplay for ""The Omega Man"", it's an acceptable horror- action mash up that works quite well for about two thirds of the running time. When it's mostly just Will and the dog(s), it's rather moving in its depiction of loneliness as well as devotion to mans' best friend. (There's also a theme here of rediscovering ones' faith.) The production design (by Naomi Shohan) and cinematography (by Andrew Lesnie) are first rate, in addition to the pretty convincing creation of an utterly desolate NYC. There's one powerful suspense sequence that sees Neville and Sam trapped inside a dark building. It also draws a lot from the screen presence and believability of Smith, who delivers a very affecting performance. Those dogs are wonderful, too.However, as it starts turning into a much more conventional action flick, it becomes decidedly less interesting. The dark seekers themselves are standard CGI / motion capture monsters, and while some people may enjoy the visceral thrills of various lively moments, there's simply not that much threat to be had from these things, except for an ""Alpha Male"" (Dash Mihok), who's more aggressive than most of them. Overall, they're a pretty mindless horde.Reasonably entertaining, but it sure doesn't reach its full potential. Say what you will about ""The Omega Man"" - at least the antagonists there had some personality.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Wow!!,"""I Am Legend"" delivered on many more levels than I expected. It was surprisingly poignant and emotional, with topical and thematic value I didn't expect. The film's overall success for me was due to the strong performance of Will Smith. There's been a lot of talk about this being a make or break film solely on the star power of Will Smith. For me, his star power isn't in question. His track record at domestic and global box office has proved that he can open a movie. Yes, he is often supported by other elements like a big director, producer, co-star and/or more commercial fare drawing a broader demographic. But this really shows how much he commits himself to his performance as an actor. His ability to internalize his experience and share it authentically is astounding. He shared the screen primarily with his canine friend, Sam, various mannequins, and blood-thirsty zombies but he manages to convey his emotions with such a layered performance, I couldn't help but be drawn into the story and his presence.I'm sure most people are familiar with the story by now. I won't reveal any of the film's surprises or twists but essentially, an experimental cure for cancer ends up mutating, goes airborne and kills over 90% of the world's population. Of the remaining 10%, over 9% turn into light-sensitive, blood-hunger zombies which kill most of the remaining 1%, the people who are immune to the disease. Will Smith's character, Robert Nevelle, believes he is the sole survivor of the human race. He's also a scientist with a close relationship to the virus and is doing clinical trials on animals and ""dark seekers"" (the zombies) that he cleverly captures. There are some nice twists to the story, some great scares and pulse-pounding action, special effects and stunt work. Director Francis Lawrence did an exemplary job creating an isolated and eerie feel to a barren New York City while evoking a powerful and layered performance out of his star.""I Am Legend"" really proves the power of a performance, the imagination of creative storytelling, and the innovative use of many popular storytelling devices. Andrew Lesnie's camera work and cinematography is stunning and creepy. There's great art design and the special efforts use in the city and with the zombies is very effective and helps tell a great story with great moments of awe, suspense and wonder.Personally, I'd love to see Warner Bros. really push for an Oscar campaign for Will Smith for best actor. He's in every scene of the film, the film works largely because of him and he brings a vulnerability to his character that really shows his risking nature as an actor. It's the type of performance and film that doesn't usually get the recognition of the Academy in acting consideration but for me it's reminiscence of Johnny Depp in ""Pirates"" 1. The film had an unexpectedly strong and original performance from Depp that supported and contributed to a lot of the film's success. And both films have many other visual elements that make them great entertainment. It's an unlikely film to win Will his Oscar but I'd like to see an attempt at it. And it really is inevitable for Will to win. He's too talented, powerful, beloved and committed to his craft not to. Go see this film if you want to have a great time at the movies and really experience the power of an actor's performance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"but not an urban legend, says I","Many's the day that we've heard of cures, medicines, drugs, etc., having unintended consequences. So there had to be a movie like ""I Am Legend"". It portrays a future in which a miracle cure wipes out cancer but turns the cured people rabid. New York City is now empty except for Robert Neville (Will Smith). He and his dog Sam spend the days driving throughout the city looking for things to shoot. But every night, the mutated people come out of hiding...and you don't want to get bitten by them.This is a remake of the Charlton Heston movie ""The Omega Man"", which was itself a remake of the Vincent Price movie ""The Last Man on Earth"" (what do you call a remake of a remake?). As I haven't seen the other two, I can only focus on this one. Much of the movie was certainly intense enough, and the issue of a miracle cure having a disastrous outcome is a relevant one. But truth be told, the movie mostly seems a little sensationalistic. While I mostly think that Will Smith has so far been a good actor, it seems as if the movie is just trying to show him off.But I do recommend the movie. It really does create a sense of intensity like I rarely see in movies, and it does seem as if the overall plot could really happen. Worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Excellent adaptation proving there is still heart and soul(s?) in the big movie business.,"After skimming the book, and having watched the previous two attempts at I Am Legend, I went in hoping for the best, but expecting mediocrity, (or something like the two recent Resident Evil films)... But I was quite surprised and entertained by what I experienced. Though it's true that most of the CG in this film is not very good, it's apparent to me that CG isn't the film's selling point, or what it leans on for merit. It's a well acted, well paced, well directed, and well adapted piece. Honestly, the 'monster' aspect never needed to be front-and-center visually for it to be effective. I thought it was implemented very well (largely in the dark and ultra fast moving scenes where the imagination can assist).I was hoping for a departure from ""The Omega Man"", which I thought was an incredibly silly film of what I consider to be the ""A-Team variety"". But, for the first 30 minutes or so, there were just so many analogs to Charlton Heston's performance that it was getting predictable (though the Will Smith version is hardly as pompous as Heston's). Very quickly, though, I forgot all about that concern and the movie really came into it's own. Smith's character, the environment, and the adversary were all quite different and very well conceived.I was also expecting vampires (a genre that I'm no big fan of), and was pleasantly surprised at what I found in this film's antagonist to be (which is 28 times more endearing to me than vampires).The third and probably most detracting thing I was expecting from this film was for it to suffer from the standard droll devices of a big-budget blockbuster: the requisite love story, Rambo shoot-em-up action, and a dialog-over-story plot basis. Oh, and not to mention headlining a traditionally ""feel-good"" star actor that could probably run for president one day. Fortunately, none of these normally ever-present problems intruded to ruin this film. And though it was indeed an uncharacteristically dark role for Smith in several ways, he pulled it off brilliantly.Maybe it could have been a little longer, answering more questions and allowing more of the psychodrama to filter in, but it's possible that would have spoiled the excellent balance of jump-in-your seat action vs. the plot/tension building interstital scenes. The theater I saw this in was packed with plenty viewers from the younger crowd (it's hard to believe this film is only PG-13 in the US). However, the entire theater was completely silent and caught in the grip of the films action, story line, and excellent pacing.I noticed a lot of people taking advantage of what could be considered the 'comic relief' of this film. However, I found some of the 'humorous' parts less than laughable, and more disturbing than anything. When you see this, really try to understand this man's environment and then you will probably better understand his psyche.I will look forward to more from this relatively unknown writer/director team.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"It starts off pretty well, but then hobbles itself with its cliché baddies","The latest cinematic adaptation of the Richard Matheson novel, and the first one to use its real name. The other two are The Last Man on Earth, starring Vincent Price, and The Omega Man, starring Charlton Heston. Haven't seen the Price version yet, but The Omega Man is a sentimental favorite of mine. Cheesy and fun, loaded with the trappings of its time (1971). Lawrence's version is more serious-minded. He wants to make the audience feel what New York City would be like if you were the only person there. And he succeeds very well. It looks brilliant. Will Smith is capable as the only survivor in NYC. This is more of a horror flick than The Omega Man, and it works well as that. My biggest complaint, though, is that this film really rips off 28 Days Later. The mutants of I Am Legend are pretty much exactly the same as the rage infected people of that film, mostly mindless zombies who roar a lot and hunger for human blood (The Descent also came to mind a lot, especially with the aversion to light the baddies have). With the monsters seeming so much like they did in that one, and with the post-apocalyptic setting being pretty much exactly the same, it feels more like a remake of that than it does of The Omega Man. And frankly, 28 Days Later didn't need to be remade. Not so soon, anyway. Heck, the sequel to 28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later, did a much better job differentiating itself from its predecessor than this film does. Still, the film is quite entertaining, and one of the better blockbusters of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

From Omega To Will,"I was delighted when I heard they were taking another stab at Richard Matheson's classic tale ""I Am Legend."" The last time it was filmed was in 1971 with Charlton Heston in ""The Omega Man"" (Omega being the last letter in the Greek alphabet), but that flick has become quite dated now with its hippie kids and blaxploitation heroine, so a remake seemed necessary.About ten years back, it was going to be remade with the Ridley Scott/Arnold Schwarzenegger dream team and a massive budget. What a pity we will never see that version, it will always remain one of the great unmade sci-fi movies.Instead of Arnie, we have Will Smith in the lead who can be a good actor when he pushes himself. Sure he's buffed up and carries a gun everywhere (so far, so Arnie), but he tones down his usual hip-hop mannerisms and actually displays some vulnerability for once and does well in the role.Director Frances Lawrence did a good job on ""Constantine"" and, for the most part, he acquits himself well here too, particularly in the daytime scenes. The scene where Will Smith has to go after his dog in a dark, underground space where ""The Dark Seekers"" might be hiding is as tense a scene as any movie had in 2007. Brilliantly done.Virtually every review of ""I Am Legend"" complained about the cheesy special effects. The dark seekers look a lot like Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"" which is probably because Andrew Lesnie was the cameraman on both movies. The difference is that ""Lord of the Rings"" had a massive effects budget (which is why Gollum looked so photo-realistic), while ""I Am Legend"" seems to have had very little. The creatures look like graphics from a PlayStation game. Although they are much scarier than the ghouls in ""The Omega Man."" Charlton Heston could reason and converse with them, the dark seekers in Will Smith's movie are fierce, primal beings whose only instinct is to drink the blood of humans. They don't even seem to have the power of speech, they just roar (A great early scene has Will Smith hiding in a bath with his dog as he listens to a chorus of blood-curdling howls coming from the masses of ravenous dark seekers in the streets outside).I did enjoy ""I Am Legend"" and I will be getting it on DVD, but I will always pine for the Schwarzenegger/Scott version that almost made it. Oh well, you can't have everything!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Adequate movie, but lacking something vital...","""I Am Legend"" is interesting enough in itself, because of the plot line. Humanity is all but extinct, and a lone survivor in New York is desperately trying to reach out to other survivors, while he is also working to find a cure against a cure for cancer that turned out to be a blessing in disguise as it turned people into ravenous maniacs.The storyline is good and captivating, and it is helped nicely along by the cinematography and visually impressive scenes throughout the movie. And the acting in the movie, despite it mostly being only Will Smith, was adequate and appropriate to the movie.However, everything is not grand and great in ""I Am Legend"". The CGI effects for the infected people was laughable and horrible. They looked really awful and fake, and that severely cut the movie short. So if you were infected with the KV infection you turn into a poorly animated person that is capable of lowering your jaw to inhumanly proportions? It was just ridiculous.While running at about 101 minutes, then the movie passes by quickly. A bit too fast actually, and the movie feels very short, especially because it also leaves too many unfinished ends and unanswered questions. And director Francis Lawrence brushed over the events that occurred with Neville's family too quick and without offering any proper insight into the events. That was a shame, because it would have added a more detailed dimension to the movie.If you sit down to watch ""I Am Legend"" and hoping it will be a zombie movie, then you are in for a sore surprise. The infected in this movie are fast, agile, and capable of scaling the side of a building with no problem, but like vampires they are hurt by the UV rays of sunlight. Yeah, it was just a little bit too out there.But if you want a movie that is nicely shot, nicely directed and does have a good storyline (if you can look past the horrible CGI creatures), then ""I Am Legend"" does deliver. While the movie is entertaining, it offers nothing challenging for anyone with a working mind in the audience. Just unhook your brain and sit back for a fun ride and try not to laugh too hard at the horribly animated CGI creatures.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Will Grows as Actor + A ""Different"" Zombie Movie","In much the same way that Tom Hanks had to carry the movie ""Cast Away"", Will had to do the same with this movie. In so doing, Will showed me that he has really grown as an actor over the years. That was great to see, and I believe it will open even more doors for him moving forward.Equally as wonderful was to see a VERY different zombie movie. Honestly, this movie is more about themes like the human spirit, redemption, deep loneliness, dealing with regret/loss and a surprising theme that I will leave unnamed as not to spoil it for folks. The zombie part is actually secondary, though well done and prominent throughout the movie.I had the same reaction to this movie as I did to ""The Mist"". Both are movies with familiar backdrops that we've seen a million times. However, they explore and expose a totally different element of the story. That makes them unique, and Will Smith makes this entertaining, engaging and exciting. Very well done. One of my most enjoyable movie experiences of the year. Total surprise.

I Am Thrilled,"I Am Legend is a very well made film for a post apocalyptic thriller. Before I saw it I was wondering that how are the filmmakers going to keep the audience riveted to their seats? But it has many events and surprises that keeps you entertained and very enlighten. The best way to enjoy this movie is to watch it as the last man on earth trying to save mankind by finding an antidote using his own immune blood to cure the Dark Seekers. If you want nothing but brainless action then its best avoided.The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense right from start to end and had a great vision beyond our imagination of the desolated New York. Will Smith is undoubtedly a really good actor but this was his best performance to date and he should get an Oscar for his role because it is really difficult to act like the last man on earth and I can't think of any other actor that could've replaced his role.You can see every penny spent from the $150 million budget. Most people accused the film for the SFX of the Dark Seekers but I don't think they were that bad. The best thing about the movie is that you can actually feel that what is it like being the last person, so it is a very important film. I never thought that life will be extremely difficult e.g. you cannot interact with anyone, No meat will be available & food will be out of date and if you get hurt or sick then no medical treatment can be given.Overall I Am Legend is a magnificent and my favourite film of the year It is Will Smith's best movie since I, Robot and gets better the more times you see it. There are many films that are a time pass and you forget about them after about 30 minutes you seen them but I Am Legend is not one of those, it will always stick to you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Continuing improvement from Smith, but the film fails to fully exploit its potential","Will Smith is quite the man. It seems like every movie he stars in is destined to reap enormous financial rewards in the US and outside the US, regardless of whether it's good or not. As such, I imagine that he has the luxury to pick and choose his projects. When I heard that this film would be made yet again. A previous incarnation, The Omega Man, with which this film shares more than the original novel exists. I've also heard that there an even older film adaptation, but know little of it, except that The Omega Man has taken some cues from it.As it stands in this film, the story was clearly made more shiny for the clean-scrubbed character that Smith usually plays. Not that Neville in this film doesn't have issues, but that he's not nearly as complex as the novel, or even previous incarnations. Most of the film plays as a Cast Away meets 28 Days Later.... In fact, in some ways, Legend is more an American successor to 28 Days Later, just with less humans and zombies.Thanks to the overall simplification of the story, I Am Legend actually turns out to be quite a different piece from the novel it's based on, focusing more on what happens to people that are stuck alone, as well as with disillusionment from years of failure and loss. Sometimes this simplification comes at the cost of believability, as some of Neville's flashbacks to before the loss suffer from contrived melodrama in order to keep some it's ""cleanness"".Although this weakens the story considerably, the movie still provides Smith a place to show the growth of his acting, as he's been slowly, but steadily, improving since his big box office debut in Bad Boys (and his oft-forgotten work in Six Degrees of Separation). Although he still plays a version of Will Smith, he's grown the ability to convey contrary messages and personal irony just through variations in his charisma, swagger and vulnerability. The rest of the film is technically sound, although the ""infected"" fail to impress as they appear like a poor cross between the titular character from The Mummy and the maddened rage zombies from 28 Days Later... It's unfortunate that the science-fiction vampires from the book never made it out.I Am Legend is essentially another Will Smith blockbuster film, with much in common with Smith's previous I, Robot in that it stands a watered down adaptation of a complex work, fit into Smith's image and with complexity removed for easy consumption by the masses. While it might be entertaining enough for an in theater romp, it fails to deliver the substance that the source material contains and remains a passing affair. I don't think anyone will really hate this movie except fanboys (and fangirls) of the novel. Most will be temporally entertained and move on (although the film does have something to say, albeit how little a voice it speaks with, about the role of hope in sustaining humanity). Not essential. Not necessary. At the same time, not bad either. Here's to hoping that Hancock is better. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Wow!  A book-movie!,"I am glad to see that the initial voting gives this a high rating (anything on IMDb above a 7 is usually worth watching), but I'll be surprised if this does big long-term Box Office. Expect a resurgence on DVD, however, since this is great weekend afternoon fare (I watched it at a Saturday matinée, which, by the way, was 90% empty. This reminded me (no spoilers here) of one of my favorite sci-fi epics, ""The Postman"" (with Kevin Costner, 1998), also based on science fiction literature from 40 years ago. These movies have the hold-over paranoia that grew out of the 1920-50's. I actually liked Postman better for the story, since anyone who has seen Heston's version of this, ""Omega Man"", will remember a two-line plot. But Will Smith adds so much heart to his character, sort of Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away"", that the movie goes by almost too quickly. I will definitely watch it again on DVD, and unlike Postman which requires more pre-planning due to its bookish plotting, this has a good balance of action and reflection.

Heartfelt but Plot Failure,"I went and saw this movie absolutely excited as it was a remake of Omega Man(1971). I thought will smith would do a great job with the character as he seems to in all of his roles. I started off generally impressed by the displays of the empty city and the scenes of him living for his own. I thought the way he rationalized his singular existence with the use of the mannequins allowed for several of the loneliest scenes in the movie. His relationship with the dog was beautiful and i thought his world was something we could relate to in spite of us never knowing his realm of existence.My problem came from the second half of the movie. All of the cinematography was excellent and will smith does a good job of acting but I felt his performance was weaker in the second half. He seems to lose his edge and becomes a weaker character- as if not the same person and i found no correlation between his change in character and the direction of the plot. Thus, i was forced to believe his change was a failure by smith, and not an eloquent piece of cinematic work. The movie seemed to be going in a normal direction until his late night scene on the pier and from that point on the plot nose-dives. In not looking up the time of the movie i expected a bit over two hours and was genuinely surprised by the brevity of it. I felt the ending came too soon and was unnecessary. The movie lives up to its name to a degree but the way in which it gets its name derives from a weak attempt at an existential statement. The movie had to follow the book to an extent but here was a case where the director needed to step back, think, and realize that the original may not be the best.I wish the second half could have lived up to my expectations like the first half did. Still a decent movie in terms of message- not so much in terms of the actually story and plot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

I'll be sure to read the novel it was based on when I can.The acting was great by both Will Smith and the dog . Will Smith was a great choice for Dr. Neville. His portrayal of the last man on earth is awesome and we see how that man copes with being alone for 3 years except for the company of his dog. The emotional parts are done right as it doesn't make you laugh, as some people will certainly do (none in my theater), but it actually makes you feel for the character. As always, there are a few jokes but they're used sparingly so it works. This won't earn him a Oscar nomination but as I said before, it was fine work.The CGI was awesome. The empty city, the effects, the fight scenes. I have a little quarrel with the look of the ""vampire"" like creatures. They were menacing looking and it worked but I was just expecting more as the rest of the CGI was awesome.I will admit that I jumped in my seat a few times and they were timed appropriately (they especially worked with the Dolby sound in the theater).

Vermont is for survivors.,"Hollywood's latest stab at Richard Matheson's classic vampire opus, I Am Legend, is restrained, competent and (at times) thrilling film-making. With that all said, it will not, however, be landing in any cult movie palace near you anytime soon. There are no memorable bits of movie dialogue to savor and repeat. The film's score is pedestrian. The other two survivors--a boy and a young female--are afterthoughts, injected into the movie so Will Smith's character, Robert Neville, can have someone to sound off against. Both late arrivals are tired clichés. The boy is mute. The woman, although adept with a needle and thread, is lifeless and daffy. I don't believe for a New York Minute they have survived the way she claims they have. And in one of the best examples of our culture being dumbed down that I've ever seen, Neville recites dialog he has memorized from the movie Shrek. Ugh. This is a blatant nod to its predecessor: In The Omega Man, Neville, alone in an abandoned theater, watches and repeats back to the movie screen, relevant thoughts of one of the Woodstock Generation's heavy thinkers. The ""The Dark Seekers"" are present to entertain the teenagers in the audience, who, lately, have been fed a steady diet of CGI terrors and video games. The ending is ludicrous. Robert Neville's death is anything but heroic. He even tries one last time to reason with the rabid, psychotic creatures. It's beneath him. And us. Laughable. A short time later, on the road to Vermont, the final epilogue ventures into familiar territory with little pay off. The woman gets the final word. Typical.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

This gives the ""we are so much in trouble and helpless"" feeling, if this happened to us..which makes it frightening. This was a different kind of movie, with great cg, and good story in my opinion. The ending wasn't that bad either *cough*. He was legend for sure though! Its just that the ending comes so fast. Not enough time to put more stuff in to make it longer i guess. I guess if i had to put a microscope on it, it could have had more content and story to the movie itself. Its obvious they didn't have the space to put everything in it though, to make it a perfect movie. A solid 9 though no matter what.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Great possibilities, but poor execution.","I am Legend stars Will Smith as Dr. Robert Neville, a military virologist living in New York City in 2012, who is the last known survivor of a worldwide viral epidemic called KV that has infected or killed nearly all of earth's population. KV, originally developed as a cure for cancer, caused severe side effects in test patients which resulted in mutations as well as physiological and biological changes in the human body structure. Humans infected with KV have become nonsensical, irrational, and bloodthirsty nocturnal monsters that will hunt, mutilate, and devour any living thing that is not also infected. KV proved to be highly contagious and became airborne at its epicenter in New York City. For some reason, Neville is one of the small percent of humans which is immune to KV and this allows him to traverse the empty streets and buildings of NYC without worrying about contracting the disease.The film focuses heavily on Neville's methods of survival and his noticeably deteriorating psyche. When he is not preoccupied with seeking basic necessities, Neville works in his basement lab attempting to develop a vaccine for the disease. Will Smith does a superb job of portraying Neville's solitary character, who everyday is searching for solutions to the problems in his future as well as the future of mankind. Smith's acting is the highlight of the film and is really the driving force that could have actually made this film legendary.Now for the bad stuff.I am Legend is severely hindered by its sub-par screenplay. The first 1/3 to 1/2 of the film is a joy to watch, but suddenly holes and diversions become extremely visible.The climax of the film is very rushed and the ending was typical clichéd nonsense. Pointless religious and philosophical overtones and dialogue are added to try and create a moral- based story, but just turn into fodder that is annoying to have to listen to. Certain important questions are never even answered like why certain people like Neville are immune or why KV drives its victims insane. Finally, the infected humans look more like sci-fi monsters than actual mutated and deranged beings and are not present nearly enough until the end of the film.Final Verdict: 5/10. Pretty much only worth seeing for the first half of the film and for Willy's powerhouse acting. Such a shame really. The post-apocalyptic genre is very interesting to me and I love films like 28 Days Later, Mad Max, or Escape from New York, but Legend's poor narrative pulls it down.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Smith assures his ""Legend""ary status","Think about if you were producing a movie about the last man on earth. You *have* to cast one actor. Who do you cast? The answer is clearly Will Smith, ""I Am Legend"" aside. If the human race was 99.9% wiped out or turned evil by a mutating virus that was initially a cure for cancer, I would personally volunteer Will Smith as the last man alive. He could have my place.Smith plays Robert Neville, a former military officer that before the virus outbreak was the leading figure on a defense plan in case something happened, and afterward is humanity's only hope for a cure. By day Smith and his dog hunt and wait at one spot for any survivors and by night they must remain confined to their home as the infected ""super"" humans have violent tendencies. Basically he has to survive long enough to find a cure and maybe he can fix the human race. The part just begs for Smith's resume (Independence Day, I-Robot)With the film focusing on almost nothing but Smith, he has to be interesting or the film fails. Director Francis Lawrence (Constantine) helps Smith succeed by using suspense and a writing team of Mark Protosevich and the acclaimed Akiva Goldsman keeps the facts unraveling at the perfect pace for keeping up interest level in mere background alone. The audience is intrigued in Smith's every endeavor.The visuals of this post-apocalyptic Manhattan are astounding and Smith takes command of it brilliantly, yet his character is portrayed as very emotional and unstable, unlike many previous films in which he is in the business of being ""the man."" It's believable and bad ass.Any actor who can take a film like this that's so basic and make it any bit good and successful financially clearly is a legend. If this doesn't cement Smith's status as one of the greatest stars of this generation (right next to if not above Tom Cruise) then it will just take another box-office shattering action flick to prove it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Excellent,"this movie was far better than i expected it to beits not a particularly terrifying movie more suspenseful. i never thought a movie with only 1 character would be good but will smith pulled it off flawlessly.the movie mainly is about one mans search for a cure while slowly going into madness from the isolation even going as far as hitting on a mannequin at a blockbuster. the movie takes place in the year 2012 three years after a miracle cure of cancer wiped out 91 percent of the population leaving 8 percent of the population infected turning them into hairless ultra aggressive fiends that have an unneeded attraction to blood feeding off of it and very sensitive to light causing them to only come out at night and to sleep in dark shaded buildings during the day. the 2 main characters are Robert Nevill a government scientist searching for a cure to the disease even though he believes himself to be the sole survivor he still believes that he can some how save the world and stop the disease from happening.the other main character,i never thought i would say this is Sam his daughters dog that over the three years has trained to hunt and protect him it is also his only companion so there are quiet a few conversations with him talking to his dog. this is a excellent movie but don't go if you are looking only for a good scare because this movie isn't as much as a horror as it is a suspense/drama10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Great film!,"I have to say that ever since I first saw the preview for this movie back in the summer I have been anxiously awaiting its release. Well, my husband and I went to see it the day after it came out and my expectations were met. The one thing that people need to understand about this movie is that it was not made to be an action filled movie. Sure, there are scenes in it that get your heart racing and even make it stop. But I think the main idea was for the viewer to understand what Will Smith's character was feeling and even to feel how he was feeling throughout the movie. In my opinion they did a great job of doing that because we were frustrated when he was, angry and scared when he was, but worst of all sad and lonely when he was. I'm not going to spoil anything about the movie, but I will say that there was actually more than one scene that made me cry.

This movie actually puts you in that situation and allows you to see how humans act in desperate and life threatening days.

A missed opportunity,"Let's get the obvious stuff out of the way - Will Smith is excellent, as usual. The scenes of an abandoned New York are amazing, in much the same way as the shots of a deserted London in 28 Days Later.Now on to the disappointing stuff - the CGI work throughout the film is terrible. 14 years after Jurassic Park, and this is seriously the best they could do? I could live with the CGI animals, but the CGI 'infected' are just beyond belief. They all look the same, they all behave in ways that are clearly opposed to the laws of physics, and they all look as though they've stepped out of a cartoon or a computer game.It's hard to overstate just how unconvincing the CGI work is; about half-way through the film stops being 'real' and turns into an absurd mix of the real world and sub-par animation. It's more 'Mary Poppins' than '28 Days Later'.Real people with prosthetics would have made a much greater impact, and may have added some genuine thrills into what is otherwise a fairly dull film.The ending - and I won't use any spoilers - is very weak. Ultimately, 'I Am Legend' is a wasted opportunity; worth watching, but only just.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Fairly enjoyable but really just a glossier Hollywood version of 28 Days Later,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningScientist Dr Robert Neville (Will Smith) is seemingly the only human survivor of a deadly virus that has wiped out the whole of civilization. But every day he still sends a message over radio frequencies for other survivors, if there are any, to meet him at the highest sunset point in New York City at midday, as well as still desperately trying to find a cure. But when he loses his only companion he goes mad and tries to kill himself and any zombie he can see...only to be drawn into contact with two other survivors, Anna (Alice Braga) and her young son Ethan (Charlie Tahan) and a final, apocalyptic showdown to save mankind.You thought a deserted London looked impressive in 28 Days Later (the film this will inevitably be compared to?) Try a deserted New York city for size. This certainly catches your eye in the opening scenes as some overshots eerily show the Big Apple with no people in total silence which really makes you think. And though I'm sure Smith enjoyed being able to zoom around the city as fast as he liked, I'm planning my first ever trip there next year and I didn't appreciate the surprise of what it had to offer being sort of ruined for me. But I'm sure that was the last thing the producers of the film were thinking about when they made it.Since he's the only thing in it (for the first half of the film, anyway), it might be a good idea to focus on Smith's performance in the film. This is the type of film he does, but this isn't your typical 'blockbuster' film. It isn't driven by special effects, more on eerie silence and imminent threat. And the 15 certificate (which, being a zombie film, it must have got by the skin of it's teeth) bars it being one that will draw in the whole family. He shows his development as an actor here, with a more mature role that requires him to be less showy than he may have used to be. He struggles with some of the more emotional scenes, but a far worse actor could have been doing it. Midway through the film, he's joined by Braga and Tahan as the mother and son pair and this provides a chance for some more tense emotional scenes. Sometimes Smith does wonder into a DVD rental store to talk to some mannequins but it has to be said they are a bit, well, wooden.The zombies themselves do the usual leap out of nowhere/make you jump kind of thing and they're certainly quite loud but they're not that scary when you see 'em up close and personal. The film also suffers some contrived moments in the script that require some huge suspension of disbelief. It's a slick and glossy film that gets by on a neat use of silence and air of threat but, even being a big Hollywood film, it basques in the shadow of homegrown effort 28 Days Later. That film's great style, look and feel sadly make this one, despite not being bad, look half the film it wants to be. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Solid film-making... but a shame about the ending.,"*MILD SPOILERS. NO PLOT TWISTS, JUST SCENE-SPECIFIC EXPLANATIONS.* Just came back from the movie, and I figured I'd write my 2-cents' here before I forget everything.It was surprisingly good. For a major Hollywood movie of this budget, the film-making can be described as minimalistic, for lack of a better word. The director shows exactly what needed to be shown, and that's it. Only the bare minimum is explained, just enough for you to get the gist of what happened. The core of this movie is about Robert Neville's attempt to have some semblance of a life in a world that has run out of it. The scenes where he 'talks' to the mannequins are funny, but it quickly became disturbing when it became apparent that he's struggling against a sense of isolation an paranoia.The musical score follows the same vein as the film-making. It enhances the isolation even more, and scenes of Times Square in a state of abandon, with weeds growing everywhere is definitely a sight to behold. Some scenes just plain creeped me out. Scary or not, I cannot fathom what Neville had to go through for 1,001 days of complete nothingness.Yes, the CGI is slightly dodgy, but it's effective as-is, and when we're shown the mutants for the first time, it can definitely get under your skin. It's a pity that the third act starts to come apart, and the ending was a bit too... sudden. This is one movie that I wished had a longer runtime. 101 minutes is just way too short. We could have seen a longer and more fleshed-out back story, and a more satisfying ending. By that, I don't mean a happy ending (that would just be insulting), but something that was more befitting of the character of Robert Neville. As I said earlier, the ending is too sudden. Just when I was enjoying the thrill of this film's world, the ending came out of nowhere. It's as if the film-makers decided that they should probably wind it down. I have no idea why they came up with such a decision, and I would agree that it hurt the pacing of the movie. A pity, as it was the only thing keeping the movie from becoming a modern classic.It's an post-apocalyptic epic, but not in a traditional sense. And that's what makes it stand out. I've heard about the changes made from the original novel, but I think it doesn't matter. If I had to summarize it in a sentence, I'd say that this is a story of redemption. Did he get it? Well, it'd be better if you find out yourself. Except for the dodgy ending, it's a well-crafted movie with some pretty interesting artistic decisions taken by the director, and I salute him for that. Will Smith's acting is phenomenal, and I don't think it'd be far-fetching that Robert Neville is one of his career-defining roles. I'd have absolutely no problems recommending this to people.A definite watch.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Are filmmakers running out of ideas?,"Can movie-making genres become stale? Are filmmakers running out of new methods to scare people, to thrill audiences? I Am Legend is a movie that prophesizes a grim future for two genres that are becoming defined by the enigmatic multiplicity of the Saw franchise.I Am Legend should be called I Am a Really Desperate Lonely Dude Who Plays Golf On Airplanes and Likes Long Walks in Central Park Cornfields; My Ad is on EHarmony.com. The ""legend"" is Robert Neville, who is immune to a virus that has infested the entire human civilization with vampire-like symptoms. He is unable to make contact with anyone who has retained his humanity, so he assumes 99.9% of homo sapiens are dead. Despite the pain and mental duress these creatures have caused, apparently a Hippocratic oath taken by colonels prevents him from wanting to obliterate the entire vampiric race; instead he uses them for study because he believes his immunity means he is supposed to find a way to cure the vampires.The vampires themselves...I won't spoil it. But you've seen creatures like them in about 500 other fantasy/horror/thriller movies that already exist. Makeup is becoming a dead art yet creates more realism than any CGI effect I've seen (except for maybe Transformers). It is the filmmakers' reliance on these artificial ways to scare audiences that make this movie--which is fueled by real feelings and real people and real terror--so...lacking.The terror comes from amplified noises of objects and long, drawn out moments of hunting with Neville. This kind of scaring process has been experienced before in countless other films. Can't directors and writers find other ways to scare people besides this cycle: tense moment, scary monster crashes through something, monster chases hero, hero thankfully escapes and looks amazing while doing it, repeat? Why are scary movies scary when they're only showing human torture? Why are thrillers and horrors not as innovative as they used to be? Last comment: I read the novel, and was disappointed. The bastardization of books by filmmakers because they're too afraid to portray uncomfortable topics on screen has reached the point where they're ignoring a novel's most appealing aspects because they don't want to shatter the mental status quo of the movie-going public. Something was ""too perfect"" regarding the final moments of the film; and the tone of the movie (consistent throughout the entire novel) drastically changed. The last twenty minutes almost felt forced, as if Hollywood was looking for a way to compensate for making the first hour and a half more human than it should have been--but that was the most compelling part of the film.P.S. The scene where Will Smith does his pullups is the high point of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Great Will Smith Performance!,Will Smith gives the acting performance of his lifetime. There is not enough that can be said about the way in which Smith single handedly carries the whole movie by himself. It was very much reminiscent of the job done by Tom Hanks in Cast Away. The movie also focuses on a very prevalent issue which is finding the cure to certain diseases that grip our nation. I love the way in which the film shows how a great thing can end up being a nightmare; it makes the viewer aware of the unknown. The bond between Will Smith and his dog is superb. It is a film where a animal is very much a central character throughout the film. If you are looking for a relatively content clean film that provides endless action and adventure I would strongly recommend this film.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Consistently good, but with a bitter aftertaste","I have not read the novel, though I am growing increasingly interested in doing so. This does a fairly solid job of creating a post-apocalyptic world, as well as building up a convincing atmosphere of isolation. The plot is engaging, and if you ignore the couple of hiccups in it, this has a thing or two(and not terribly much more) to say, and does so well. This is well-paced, and never loses the audience, in spite of twists that changes it all in unexpected ways. It's exciting, scary, and the psychology is credible and this almost dares to have something as rare as an unstable character in the lead of a Hollywood movie. Smith gives one of his best performances to date. So what about this bothers me? The effects that do not at any time cease to look fake? Not really. Taking what I understand is an excellent and smart book and, to an extent, turning it into a somewhat simplistic Summer blockbuster? Well, we're getting closer. No, the reason is that they discarded the brilliant and poignant moral of the author, Richard Matheson's original text. They replaced it with a bland, clichéd ending of the sort we've seen since the concept of storytelling was first thought up by our species. Yes, I know. Test audience reaction holds part of the blame. Here's the thing; this didn't have to take that title. They could have called this any number of things, and people would, perhaps rightly so, accuse it of being a rip-off, as opposed to, as we are now, saying how poor an ""adaptation"" it is. If the ideas are not communicated properly in a version of a previously released work, isn't it merely ""inspired by""? Shouldn't it be? I have not watched either of the other two films based on it, however, it is entirely possible that I will do so. There is a little moderate language. This also has bloody, if not overly graphic, violence. The DVD contains four animated comics that I will review on their individual pages here on the site. I recommend this to fans of the genres of science fiction and thriller, and/or fiction involving dystopian settings. And I suggest making the choice if you want to enjoy this for what it is, or find out what the writer meant for it to be. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The best version of the novel... ya gotta love the dog.,"From Vincent Price in ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964) to Charleton Heston in ""The Omega Man"" (1971) to Will Smith in ""I Am Legend"" (2007), each version has had its strengths in telling the age old story of the human race being wiped out. But for my money, this was the best. Here's why.In all three versions, the focus is on the last man on earth--in particular, his psyche in dealing with the crushing emptiness of being the last of an extinct race. Vincent Price's character is focused primarily on survival with only momentary episodes of deep reflection. Heston takes it a step further and displays the subtle yet poignant degradation of a plagued mind, more in line with the cryptic meaning of the book's title ""I Am Legend"" which we only realize after contemplating the ending. Here, Will Smith knocks it out of the park with a tremendous performance, making this version as much a psychological thriller as it is an action story.In particular, we watch with deep empathy as he creates a world of imaginary people, having emotional conversations with inanimate objects. Smith plays a scene with a wax dummy that may bring you to tears... can't say I've ever seen an actor do that before (barring maybe Erich von Stroheim in the 1929 classic ""The Great Gabbo"").Even better, the filmmakers saw fit to make one small but significant addition to the cast of characters: a dog. Smith's connection with his canine co-star is by far one of the most powerful displays of the human-animal bond that I've seen in any movie. If you're a dog lover, you should watch it for that bit alone. Beyond that, it demonstrates our hero's critical need for companionship, something that all humans would require just as much as food or water. And that's why this version is particularly affecting.This film also goes further into the meaning of the title ""I Am Legend"", although it's still a challenge to figure it out. There is an alternate ending which, I think, explains this theme a little more clearly. I'm torn on which ending I like best. Just be sure to check out both if you see the movie, since they are very different.In all, I don't see this as a straightforward action flick. To me, it's a great psychological character study augmented with lots of action. And like I said, the acting is absolutely 1st class. If you like movies that pack a little more substance beneath the surface, don't miss this one.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

You will feel with him and for him. He has a steady desperate look in his face expression and eyes, which is very appropriate.+ The directing is good. It is not considerably amazing, but at least it does not fail its job.+ Sounds are accurate, too. i.e. Sometimes you can hear heartbeats, adding tension to the movie.+ The Plot is very interesting, and the atmosphere feels right. The movie makes you like the light much more than you might imagine.sounds brilliant so far. but there are a few issues: - I was missing more incidents, or character development and maybe a bit more on the disease spread. An additional flashback and incident would have done the job. Basically what I try to say is: the movie is too short.Since Neville is alone in NYC for already a VERY long time, Will Smith could act with a more hopeless, desperate face. more than he puts on.The basic idea of the plot ending is okay, but its American signature is a cliché that I personally don't want to see in any movie. Especially in the way it comes over in this one. (it is hard to literally say what I mean, without offending other people's beliefs, so I just stop it here, about the ending.)Conclusion: Strong points of the movie overweight the weak one's, but not enough to make this movie a very, very good one. Although, I can easily recommend it to everyone, for me it was worth watching, even though the ending was, not bad, but, a weak one.

Is this the best they could do?,"The plot of this film had great potential and the story could have been oh so richly and fully developed but sadly it falls very short of being the great film it could have been.Will Smith's acting is fine, he is of course more than familiar with the Hollywood Sci-Fi genre (Men In Black, Independence Day, I-Robot) so no one should have any complaints about him.New York deserted looks very striking and the visuals and the CGI are very good, fantastic even and if you examine them on their own you have to say a great job was done, there are some good edge of your seat moments involving the zombies or whatever they were.HOWEVER while you experience the above you spend the whole time wondering 'Why is this happening?' There is not enough context given to the story, during the film we learn how Will Smith ended up in a deserted New York due to this world destroying virus, but we see only New York and small snippets from his personal life that just leave an empty feeling really.There is not enough depth to the story and little character development. There is no setting of the scene in the early parts of the film to help you relate to the character you are watching who has only a dog for company.

Here are the positives: the acting was excellent, the set was brilliant, the story idea was compelling. The negatives: there isn't enough development of the storyline and all of the characters, the film ends too quickly, and the product placement is WAY to obvious and distracting. Everyone knows the basic story line I assume, Will Smith is the lone human left in NY following man-made disaster involving a cancer treatment. The setting allows for awesome sets and sparks your imagination - which it did with ease. The main character is tough, brilliant and organized, which makes it believable that he's still alive and thriving. The zombies are scary and suitable villains for Will Smith to battle, but that's where the story development ends. The film introduces a whole bunch of interesting mental health issues with Will Smith's character (to be expected after 3 years of solitude), but then abandons these thoughts. When two new humans appear, I was interested about their story, which was only discussed in 60 seconds over breakfast. And then, suddenly, God is introduced as a theme...then the movie ends.

"Good movie, but man I was depressed afterwords.","Yes, this movie has a bit of ""the Omega Man"" and ""The last man on Earth"" in it, but for the most part it is its own movie.

You are also introduced to Sam his faithful German Shepard, which struck a chord with me as I used to own one of those myself and love that particular breed. You get to see how he spends a typical day in his life and you also are introduced to those things that lurk in the darkness and only come out at night. However, at this stage those that come out at night seem to be targeting our hero. So we have some good chase scenes, and some good action, but you also have a couple of scenes that are really depressing especially if you like dogs. Our hero is not alone for the entire picture, however, as he comes across a lady and her son, well they kind of come across him. There are also flashbacks detailing the beginning of the end of civilization.

"Good concept, bad casting","Plot: action-packed, high on uncertainty, carries out previous notions of scary-zombies (as given by resident evil, 28 days later, etc.) very well. It IS predictable; however, if you love thrillers, I think you'll find it an OK way to spend 2 hours of your life.Characters: My opinion is that the original written version identified quite an intriguing, mysterious main protagonist. However, since the decision to cast Will Smith, it turned into a more obnoxious obsession of grandeur - somehow, again, it becomes a 'The Will Smith Show' episode, in under 5 minutes. I can hardly identify the need to see Smith exercise in the front of the camera for over 5 minutes or his severe advertising campaigns (or intent to thrust an image of contemporary-retro to viewers), for example. Also, would've been nice to have given some depth to 'Ana' and 'Ethan'!Filmography: Mostly good. Despite the 'subliminal' advertising, most shots are set in a correct atmosphere, and the music (or, lack of) adds to this well.

"Three Times A ""Legend""","Richard Matheson's 1954 novel ""I Am Legend"" is universally considered a touchstone in modern horror and science fiction literature. Its story of the last known living man on Earth trying to survive an onslaught of mutants bought on by a terrible plague has been the stuff of many cinematic variations (including NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD), plus two loose adaptations--1964's THE LAST MAN ON EARTH (with Vincent Price); and 1971's THE OMEGA MAN (with Charlton Heston). And in our time, it is now Will Smith who has the burden of being that Last Man in this third version of ""I Am Legend"", using the novel's title this time around.Smith takes up the role of Robert Neville, who had been a virologist in 2009, trying to contain a once-promising cure for cancer that instead became a violent plague and killed off practically the entire Earth's population. Now, in the year 2012, he roams around New York City (the novel has this set in Los Angeles), foraging for supplies during the day with his German shepherd Samantha, trying to contact anyone who might still be alive, and making it back to his townhouse before dark--because that's when other survivors come out, and they are the Infected, or ""Dark Seekers."" His main business is to try and find an antidote for the virus, which is the only way he keeps sane. And then his world takes a turn when an uninfected survivor (Alice Braga) finds him, and he sees some ray of hope.As with the previous two films based on Matheson's novel, I AM LEGEND does follow certain aspects of its source material: a plague killing off the population; flashbacks to the start of the horror; mutant survivors hounding for Smith's blood; and the appearance of uninfected people in Neville's world. On other points, unsurprisingly, this version of ""I Am Legend"" really isn't any closer to its source than the other two were. In one sense, this version, directed by Francis Lawrence and scripted by Mark Protosevitch and Akiva Goldsman, reworks aspects of the John and Joyce Corrington script of THE OMEGA MAN in making Smith a scientist trying desperately to find a cure while maintaining his sanity in the same way Heston had done in that film.Obviously, die-hard fanatics of Matheson's claustrophobic and brilliant novel are not going to have warm and fuzzy feelings by the way I AM LEGEND has been amped up, even in contrast to the '71 version (let alone the Poverty-Row '64 LAST MAN ON EARTH). But Smith's performance, as he's on screen for better than three-fourths of the time, is every bit as credible (if in different ways) as Price's and Heston's in the earlier versions; and the sense of desolation in New York City creates a great deal of tension.It may be that Matheson's book, with posited the vampire myth in scientific terms, can't really be filmed the way it should by Hollywood; these days, vampires seem to be the stuff of B-movies. That said, however, this I AM LEGEND does work well enough just the same.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An Original and Creative Edge-of-Your-Seat Thriller,"I am Legend is about a survivor of an infectious disease that has wiped out what seems like the entire human population. We look at the world from the eyes of Robert Neville (Will Smith) a virologist who has to cope with loneliness as he hunts for food and works on finding a cure in his underground laboratory. The symptoms of this infectious disease is aggressive, monster-like behavior.I am Legend is a very anxious and suspenseful movie. This can be good or bad depending on what your preferences are. I was not happy with the number of times this film resorted to sudden bursts of sound. It may be an effective way to induce a reaction in the audience but it is cheap and manipulative. The MPAA gave this movie a PG-13, but I would caution parents about sending in little children because at times the movie is frightening. There is violence, loud gun fights, and blood. Many reviewers say the ending is poor, but I happen to think the ending is very creative and satisfying. All in all, a very good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
CGI Disaster!,"Add another one to the list of movies ruined by the computer. Actually I think this one deserves spot number 1 because there was no need at all of CGI. Imagine if 'Dawn of the dead' or '28 days later' had some plastic computer generated puppets instead of realistic zombie characters. That can give you an idea of how bad this film looks as soon as CGI pops up! What in the world were the producer thinking?? I really wanted to like this movie having read the book and I also don't mind the changes they made in the story. The actors did a good job , the adaptation is alright, and everything else is well done. So that's it, this is officially the ultimate cgi disaster movie.

Very Good,"I Am Legend (2007)*** (out of 4)First there was The Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price, then Charlton Heston was The Omega Man and now we have Will Smith as the last man on Earth who soon realizes that he's not alone and something deadly is out there after him. This third version of the story is without question the best and what was most shocking is how dark, bleak and at times depressing this film is. The screenplay is incredibly smart and tries a lot and accomplishes most of what it sets out to do. the film goes down someone during the final act when it turns into an all out action film but everything leading up to that point is rather suspenseful, intelligent and very well made. The opening shots of New York city deserted are haunting and this is something really missing from the earlier versions. This version really gives you the sense that Smith really is the last man on Earth. There's a haunting tone running throughout the movie about being alone in this world and it's quite brilliantly done. A lot of the credit has to go to the screenplay and director Lawrence but the real key here is Will Smith who gives the best performance of his career. I found Smith's performance here a lot better than his two Oscar nominated roles in Ali and The Pursuit of Happiness. Smith is downright terrific in the scenes where he's trying to cope with being alone and his relationship with his dog is very touching. The scenes of him talking to the mannequins are also very well done. I'm not a fan of CGI but I think the effects here are very good and that includes the creatures. I'm sure more human monsters would have had its benefits but I enjoyed what they did with them here none the less. As I said, I think the film runs out of gas in the end when the brains get pushed aside for the muscle but this is still a highly enjoyable film with a lot going for it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Yes You Are Will Smith,","I Am Legend is a brilliant movie with an incredible story line,a great cast and characters.Will Smiths performance in this movie was amazing,he was completely in to his character from start to finish,and hes the main reason this movie is so great,because hes such a good actor.The movie is rated PG-13 but I would say if your a parent thinking about letting your young son or daughter watch this,don't,there are some very creepy seens that have a very real feel to it,that a young kid would be sensitive to.Robert Neville (Will Smith) struggles to find a cure for a plague that killed most of the world and turned the rest in to horrible mutants,it is just him left alone,with his dog Sam in New York City.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Stops short when it needs to get going,"This is one sad movie, but not because it deals with the end of the world, not in the least. It's practically tragic because for every good thing it gives, it takes in kind, and then some.Look at the setup, which even starts off with a convincing visit by Emma Thompson. Apparently in this remake of the original novel a cure for cancer goes haywire, killing most of the world's population, leaving almost no survivors and turning most of the few that don't die off reduced to freakish zombie-like creatures that lurk in the dark and have a severe case of the angst.Enter Colonel Neville, done by Will Smith. This guy's not exactly the everyman, but Smith's powerful depiction of him makes forgiving his all-capable bio a breeze. Neville, a military doctor and scientist, was part of the team possibly working on an antidote, but it is suggested he was also originally part of the problem.Anyway, three years post-apocalypse, and Neville has Manhattan all to himself and his likable dog Sam (keep your eyes peeled for a canine twist later in the movie). The two roam about and even get DVD's at the local video store as viewers are introduced with care to the routine the pair have, based around Neville's impressive fortress.Excellent setup overall as we said, made all the better thanks to Francis Lawrence's competent direction. There's some nice touches like Neville watching recorded TV to keep in touch with reality, a huge Superman/Batman poster basically telling us a crossover movie's coming for Xmas 2009 (when the world ended in this film), and Smith's overall very strong narration. He's not a reliable recounter, though, suffering from isolation fatigue and gradually losing his grip on what's real. Plus, backstory is given via well made flashbacks, although some of those are overly sentimental.All of these are good points to keep in mind, as is the one really scary scene, but they're all gone when the bad starts rolling in.First off, this flick has the worst CGI ever in a big budget production. I mean, projects with a tenth the money have done a hundred times better. We've seen original Xbox games with better graphics. The people responsible for drawing and animating I Am Legend's action visuals need to take a moment.This applies mostly to Neville's protagonists, what used to be the brotherhood in the Heston incarnation. These guys are now brainless, raging hostiles straight out of 2004 Dawn of the Dead, only the older movie used actual extras whereas this one opts for painfully fake and amateurish pixilated varieties. This could have so easily been avoided: what's so hard about finding a couple hundred people to run around screaming? It's not like they didn't have the moola.Certainly, most of the backdrops look good, in this area the graphics artists did well working their magic on depicting a de-populated NYC. But the pathetic action bits are simply inexcusable since by this juncture EVERYONE knows better.Additionally, I Am Legend, for all its great setup and good direction work, falters towards the end with an overly rushed conclusion and a too-convenient ending, albeit one that's nice to believe possible.This is why it's all so sad. Smith likely feels the same, having obviously given this project his best, which is quite good indeed. I Am Legend should be remade, which is probably exactly what's going to happen. In fact, you can almost tell where they cut out the juicy bits to warrant an R rated home video release later on, this time hopefully with real action extras rather than lame ""virtual actors"".For I Am Legend a commercial rehash won't necessarily be a bad thing, as it stands it still has lots of story to tell.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A great Family friendly Scary movie.,"Unfortunately, a lot of 'scary' movies have 'evil' as the plot point. Like demons etc. They also usually contain foul language or nudity. If you have to use foul language to make a point, you're an uneducated idiot. Anything can be said without swearing. Nudity is never necessary. There is no reason to have it in a film. If you want to see a nude woman, look at your wife. Now, with all that being said, this is simply a great movie. Will Smith is a great actor. I took my teenage girls to see the movie, they were nice and freaked out by it. The way a good scary movie should be. Plenty of jumpy moments to keep you on your seat.

I love it so much that I almost don't regret the ending,"I must say these type of films definitely fit Will Smith, he certainly knows hot to fit in his role, yet to be honest I was expecting more of the side he showed in ""I Robot"". First half to two-thirds of the film is ""unreal"" as some people refer to it. Besides seeming completely isolated, it keeps in your seat and will cause a few screams round the hall. Yet I can't help to mention that the ending was rushed, plot unravels too quickly and it is somehow regretting to have such an end to a brilliant movie. Besides the rush, and the dislike of some of the audience, it shows the true part of humanity - we never give up!As a conclusion I'll say it's a brilliant film, a must see and please stay for the credits to listen to the marvelous Bob Marley!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Entertaining in all the right places,"""Nothin' happened the way it was supposed to happen."" The amazing thing about this film, is that that quote sums up a lot about how this film came to be. Based on the 1954 novel by Richard Matheson, Warner Brothers took hold of the rights in 1970 and produced ""The Omega Man"" in 1971 with Charlton Heston in the lead role. ""I am Legend"" was then attempted by director Ridley Scott (American Gangster, Gladiator) and was due to star Arnold Schwarzenneger but fell through when the budget blew out. Michael Bay (Transformers, Bad Boys) then tried to make it in 2002 with Will Smith playing the lead, but then decided to do Bad Boys II instead. Finally, Director Francis Lawrence (Constantine) picked it up and ran with it, also with Will Smith, this time finally coming to the big screen.The film is set in a post-cataclysmic New York where Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the sole survivor of a cancer cure which turned everyone into blood-thirsty, zombie-like creatures of the night. Neville tries to find a cure for 'the cure' while trying to find anyone else who may have survived like himself. Filled with 'flashbacks' to let us catch up to the present story, I found this method to be effective and while they occurred often throughout the film, didn't appear to be overdone.Will Smith took the role of Robert Neville, and while he was portrayed as a tough warrior, Smith also brought to it an extremely emotionally damaged side, brought on by the fact that his character had been alone for over three years - a pleasant relief considering the usually generic characters in this genre of film.I suspect that Will Smith and supporting cast member Alice Braga probably brought their own talent as actors and required minimal direction - but I feel that Francis Lawrence's direction lacked somewhat when it came to the two children's roles who tended to look very much staged and ""non-natural"". This could primarily be to Lawrence's relative newness to movie direction.The set designers did a fantastic job, transposing the real New York city into a life-less, big city wasteland. No detail was overlooked, from the hundreds of weeds growing through the main roads in New York, down to the houses and apartments left in disarray as the victims of the 'cure' died.Screenwriters Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman did a great job, bringing some comic-relief to break up the suspense. Both are familiar with the disaster-film genre having been associated with the 2006 production of ""Poseidon"".The CG effects were pretty good, but at times, slightly too ""computerised"", especially with respect to the zombie-type characters, who seemed too computer generated. At times, I found myself thinking of them more like orcs from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, rather than humans who had deteriorated into sub-human form.I wasn't and expecting Academy Award winning effort - after all, it is a disaster film. However, it kept me on the edge of my seat at times, made me feel upset and annoyed at others, made me laugh every now and then, and over all, kept me thoroughly entertained - just as a movie should. I really enjoyed I Am Legend, and will no doubt watch it again and again in future.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Definitely not a legend...,"I'm not a big fan of Will Smith, but i know if anyone can carry a whole movie on his shoulders its him. That being said i had still had my doubts about this movie because i heard very contrasting reviews about this movie, and i wasn't sure of what to expect from this movie.As expected this movie is all about Will Smith, hes nothing less than superman, immune to the disease, built like tank, fit as hell, and a brilliant scientist to boot,not to mention hunts for his own food in the best cars.This movie basically has it all, loads of drama, special effects, action, a bunch of tense scenes, a decent story albeit very rehashed story, and one huge star, yet you get the feeling that lots is missing.No matter how big a star will smith is, seeing him and and his dog for hours at length is not exactly pleasurable.The drama would have been decent in small doses but here it gets overbearing, especially the scenes towards the end concerning god among others. Some of the dialogues seem straight out of a B-movie.The special effects are actually ordinary even pedestrian, scenes that come to mind are the lions and antelopes, and the often sub-standard rendering of the creatures and New York, im wondering how much will smith was paid that the film makers couldn't afford special effects that were at least 5 -7 years old.The cinematography was good,but the shoddy special effects made a big dent on them, the camera was the grainy type that is very popular nowadays, but you have to see movies like 28 days later, to see what what real desolation is about and how a post-apocalyptic future looks like.The tense were good, but far to predictable, the fact that there's one protagonist in the entire film had almost everything to do with, predictability was a major issue with this film right till the end.The story is as old as the mountains and there was nothing new here, each and every aspect of this movie has been suggested before either in films or in print, ORIGINALITY IF NOT SOMETHING THIS FILM SCORES ANY POINTS ON.The end to is very abrupt,fifteen minutes more would have been much appreciated, the end itself left a lot to be desired, some smart editing would have cut lots of the beginning and added more to the end, if there were issues with the length.Despite all this you cant take away that many points from this film mainly because- 1)Will Smith has done a fine job regardless of just being there too much.2)Many scenes although predictable do send your pulse racing.3)Some of the drama is actually quite endearing although again predictable.4)The action is decent and realistic, he may be like superman but he fights like a real person.5)The movie is short and sweet and although the end feels very abrupt you appreciate the small feature length.In all a decent movie thats far from being a legend for a variety of reasons.Watch with low expectations and you will come out satisfied, definitely doesn't have the blockbuster potential of say a transformers or Die Hard 4.0, please don't give into the Will Smith hype and the inflated ratings.-s ending, SPECIAL EFFECTS, ORIGINALITY, PREDICTABILITY.+/-s too much Will Smith??.+s lots of tense scenes, fine acting, decent cinematography, small length.Total 6/10 (met my confused but definitely lower expectations but didn't factor it in because of the already inflated ratings).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

It was very very good from start to finish. There were no weak points in it for me and no ridiculous or 'America saves the world' moments which and it was as realistic as it could be. The only criticism if any would be that that I felt the virus infected looked a bit computer generated at times, however this was obviously done for shock and awe purposes. I though that Big Willy was very very good and put in as good a performance as I've seen from him. Overall this movie takes you through highs and lows and a range of emotions whilst still keeping you guessing and entertained.

The Quiet Earth meets 28 Days Later,"Will Smith is the only American left alive in Manhattan. Traffic jams and Wall Street are a thing of the past. It wasn't even the terrorists, it was a genetically engineered virus that ran amok. What it does is kill all people, unless it turns them into super strength and super speed zombies.The guy is also a doctor, trying to research a cure for the virus. It starts exactly like The Quiet Earth and at first I thought it was a remake. Then the zombies from 28 Days Later decide to mate with the ones in Resident Evil and ruin what could have been a beautiful ending to the human race. But then something horrible happens: the zombies kill Will Smith's dog! It all goes downhill from there and, unfortunately, the human race survives. But would you really want to survive a world without Will Smith?Bottom line: great special effects, Will Smith plays great, but the story doesn't really say anything. And taking into consideration that a sequel is planned in 2010 and about three video games in between, it all seems more like a money franchise than an honest attempt to make a movie that does say anything.

"""I Am Legend"" may not be for the kiddies","Will Smith is an amazing actor. Seeing him in his other movies, I was curious to see how he would act being the last man on earth. He does a good job convincing the audience that what happened was serious and not too pleasant. However, when I saw this movie, I was expecting few ""pop-up"" scenes. That is exactly what we got. Seeing this movie, I wouldn't think that any kids under the age of 12 should see this film. Personally, I believe the film should have been rayed PG-13 for some intense frightening scenes. I found this movie to be very unsettling throughout. There's not a lot of happy things that occur in this film. Some scenes are very emotional while other scenes are very frightening, suspenseful, and intense. However, this is a good film to see if you're bored and in the mood to go out.

Just don't expect Shakespeare people..,"The 7 I'm giving to Will Smith's latest entry should be regarded a relative voting considering this genre of films.

Yet when one would simply switch of the mind, maybe drink a few beers prior to watching it, one could have a good time.

This is not a remake,"This movie is not, technically, a remake. It is based off of the book ""I Am Legend"" by Robert Matheson.

It to, has a nearly identical plot. ""Omega Man"" is quite different though, as in it the creatures are radioactive, and in all the other versions of the story, they are vapiristic infected people. Do not base your fore-thoughts on ""Omega Man"", as the storyline is highly altered. ""Last Man on Earth"" is better than ""Omega Man"", and is more accurate to the story.

pretty much an empty shell,"I am Legend tells the story of Robert Neville (Will Smith) the last known survivor of a deadly plague that was created by a cancer cure that ended up killing of the world's population and turning a small portion of it into light phobic man eating zombies.It has ups and downs like a lot of films these days, Will Smith plays his role very convincingly, and an empty New York makes for an ideal setting and tone for the film.The down part about it is the second half and the cgi, the zombies (or whatever you want to call them) are completely done with cgi, which ended up looking rather silly than scary, the cgi was actually very pointless, using live actors with make up effects would have created more realistic creatures instead of the cartoon like zombies you get, and the second half of the story strayed a lot from character development to a pointless storyline that becomes very uninteresting, the very few action scenes in the film did very little to generate much excitement at all.I have not read the original book by Richard Matheson or seen the other two film adaptations but this film, aside from the performance by Will Smith and having the ideal setting and tone, is really nothing to be overly excited about, its pretty much an empty shell.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Solid, But Really Awkward At Times","Oh joy, another last man on earth movie with zombies, that's the next thing this world needs! Putting sarcasm about the film's plot aside, I Am Legend is really an interesting movie to sum up. Will Smith plays a lone doctor in the middle of a barren New York City during the year 2012, the year that gas prices-according to the film-will be $68 a gallon. Apparently, three years earlier a medication was discovered that could supposedly cure disease, but it slowly turned into zombie-like infesting epidemic. As you might expect, Smith's character is immune to this infestation and he's off fending for himself trying to find a cure with only his canine friend.The set up for the film isn't the most original in the world, but there's enough in the film to at least carry it all the way through. But what's really neat about the set design is how New York looks as a deserted wasteland; it's downright mesmerizing. Now, based on the trailers for this film it's easy to look at it as an almost completely action-filled flick with Smith tearing the infected humans apart. Do be warned: this really isn't the case with the film and it's easy to be mislead by a few reports and trailers. For instance, with a name like I Am Legend it would only make sense for one to think it's another way for Will Smith to say ""I am a bad man"" (or something along those lines). But again, this isn't the case; he's a doctor merely trying to find a cure in the city. Speaking of Will Smith's character, he does an excellent job carrying out his role, even if he doesn't have that much to really work with he manages to make the best of it.With that in-mind, don't be surprised when you find the bulk of the film's faster parts to be merely incidental. While the movie does go for multiple genre styles, ranging from horror to drama, a good bit of the film's relatively short screen time is dedicated to dialogue and monologue parts. As a result, I Am Legend winds up being a rather slow film with the action scenes breaking up the monotony very sparingly. And do note that the film has a PG-13 rating, so the amount of action a movie like this could go without hitting the R rating is so far. If this were a straight-up balls-to-the-wall action extravaganza it's likely the film would've walked away with an R-rating.A good majority of the film has Will Smith carrying his role all by himself, with the occasional flashback also trying to break up the repetition. And really, the film needs as many of these parts as it can get, because it's only so long before a movie following one lone character begins to lose its touch. These parts do tend to work pretty well since it offers some background to Smith's character and the state New York City is in during the film. There are also a fair number of moments used to provide comic relief in the film, which do usually work. But there are a few that are clearly unintentional and at times extremely awkward. I won't spoil every one, but do be prepared for Smith to start impersonating a scene from Shrek and yell at a mannequin.The ending does at least wrap things up well enough to where it doesn't feel like a sequel is so obvious. However, it isn't exactly the most satisfying of endings and it really pushed the meaning of ""morality"" too far. Not to mention it's not even the most believable ending that could've been picked out of a good load of options. And by this I mean believable in resolving everything, not in whether it's actually possible or not. So again, be prepared for some awkward and on a couple occasions nonsensical moments. Will Smith fans will do well to give this film a shot, but keep an open mind when heading into the theater.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
...Will Smith's da man............,"Will Smith is very good in this movie and he really knows how to pick his projects. It's mostly just HIM this time around and he does a fine job as the (nearly) sole survivor of a cataclysmic biological event, who is beginning to succumb to his inescapable loneliness. He has really grown in his craft. The stark New York City setting is great as is the back story, told in flash back form. The unfolding of the story was pretty much what I had expected, remembering the Charlton Heston version, and it has been updated with modern CGI effects. Over all I think it was pretty good, however, NOT worth the regular $8.50 admission price, but I would highly RECOMMEND it as a decent DVD rental, or budget theater outing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Absolutely Drastic,"This movie was nothing more than an American rip-off of twenty eight days later. It was terrible. Don't be fooled into thinking this film was even decent because of a few good action sequences. The acting was horrid. Please do not waste your time and money on this garbage. I am upset with Will Smith's performance to say the least. It is hard to believe he would endorse a title such as this. I have never before been even remotely upset with a performance by Will. I have to say that now, I would rather eat a bullet than watch that filth again. Please consider that a good film must include at least two of these things: 1. good acting 2. good suspense 3. good cinematography 4. good music 5. good script 6. entertainment I pity the soul of any person that enjoys such trash.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Maybe a Better Short Film,"I Am Legend terrified me as a young teenager. I remember the first time seeing this movie and openly saying that I would never watch it again. That wasn't because I thought the movie was bad, but because I am an absolute wuss.Now it's 17 years later and I decided it was time to give it another go. I think that it is a decent post-apocalyptic film and a good entry in the zombie genre.On the positive side, Will Smith is fantastic in this role. His emotion is raw, the connection with the dog (Sam) is beautiful and I felt his pain throughout. Along the same lines, there is a vulnerability to the film that is captivating. I love the alone-ness that Robert Neville feels and it's evident throughout the entire movie.On the negative side, the film moves at a snail's pace. Setting the stage about the disease, the cause and the possible cure is interesting, but the plot dragged more often than not. Honestly, I think the concept is better suited for a short-film or you need to have more happen.Best Character: Sam

"Smith may be legendary, but not the film","A variation on recent zombie films like Resident Evil and 28 Weeks Later. But it's more isolated/disconnected than either, a lot more. If you can imagine either of those zombie films combined with Vanilla Sky, you'll get a very good feel for how the film comes off. As good as that may sound, it doesn't actually come out as well as either. Like Resident Evil and Vanilla Sky, it's centered all around a single character (acted by Will Smith). Unlike either, the film takes this a step further and Smith is literally the only character, unless you count a dog, for 90% of the film.In terms of the opening setup and overall story, it's very impressive. There are some annoying product placement moments involving cars and promoting a very bad film that get in the way of what is otherwise a very impressive performance by Smith to make the story feel real. But the story, or the directing, doesn't fill out what Smith filled in, and the result is interesting but not legendary.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
While everyone is trashing Will Smith... after his Oscars slap,"Let me ad my two cents.First I think that was scripted to bring attention to the waining attention on that awards show. I saw videos that broke down the sound of the slap compared to the monet the hand supposedly hit the face and his wife don't have no Alopecia. My mom does and trust me, Jada having a surgical scar on her head is not Alopecia. I suspect its for religious reasons. So on that note, I will say I like this Will Smith Movie, it reminds me of tom hanks movie where he is shipwrecked and they both go mental in the same way. I love the Zombies in this movie, actually some of the best zombies compared to other movies.

legendary,"this movie has to be one of the best in 2007. will smith portrays the character of Robert Neville perfectly; no other actor would have been able to seem slightly crazy without overdoing it and appearing as insane as the 'infected'. i'll admit, that even though the movie deviates significantly from the original book and past movies, it in no way ruins the theme of a deserted planet.i especially like the way that it really builds up to the realization of what has happened. i only read the book after i saw the movie, and thought the book was a great inspiration for a great movie. seeing as i had no idea the movie was about a planet ruled by infected mutants, it really kept me guessing for quite a bit of the first half, effectively using flashbacks, recorded news programs, and, of course, the newspaper clippings we see on the wall.Although the ending may seem weak to some, i thought it was a good way of bringing a bit of closure to the movie, as Robert Neville has lost everything.all in all, a great movie",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Starts with the script,"I saw Omega Man, with Charlton Heston in the title role, in the 70s and enjoyed it, as an interpretation of human self destruction and based, a also, on the novel, I Am Legend. The new film's script has a depth in characters and culture with writing that presents a real possible result of human developed catastrophe. Francis Lawrence's direction was very good and the editing was fantastic, keeping me on the edge of my seat through the film. The settings and special effects made one, almost believe, that an actual city was used to film the movie after an intensive makeover. The performance of Will Smith, in a mostly solo performance, is very Oscar worthy. The additional characters were great, falling into place as comfortable pieces in a wonderful sci-fi puzzle.In summary, a most enjoyable afternoon viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"A Superior Remake of ""The Last Man on Earth"" and ""The Omega Man""","This movie begins with a scientist announcing a cure for cancer on television for all the world to see. Unfortunately, three years later the cure mutates into a deadly plague and kills almost everyone left on earth. And those who aren't killed are turned into creatures similar to zombies-only very fast and agile. However, as luck would have it, an Army doctor named ""Robert Neville"" (Will Smith) finds that he is one of the few people who is immune and as a result drives through the desolated city of New York with a dog named ""Sam"" as his only companion. Naturally, being a doctor he keeps himself busy trying to find a cure for those who have become infected while at the same time looking for others who might have escaped the plague all together. Then one day events soon begin to overtake him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film is the second remake of ""The Last Man on Earth"" which was filmed in 1964 and remade as ""The Omega Man"" in 1971. Although these two films were pretty good in their own right, I have to say that this particular movie was definitely the best of them all. For starters, as might be expected for a motion picture in this day and age, the CGI was clearly far superior. More importantly however was the acting of Will Smith which carried the day and subsequently resulted in his winning a Saturn Award for ""Best Actor"". Likewise, the movie itself was nominated by that same awards committee for ""Best Science Fiction Film"" as well. In short, this was an extremely good movie and I have rated it accordingly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Far Better than The Omega Man and the last man on earth,"Next year will mark 65 years since the novel ""I Am Legend"" came out.

Fun fact, there is a fake poster advertising a batman v superman movie that would come to be a reality almost a decade later.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
what separates scary from slasher,"You don't know its scary until the end so you spend the whole time waiting for the scary to begin. They cheated using Will smith instead of a bunch of horny teenagers or obscure British actors. like ""OmegaMan"" with Charlton Heston you like the main character you feel for the main character, you'd invite him over for x-mas and thanksgiving diner. If Will Smith asked for your car keys you'd give it to him. If any of the characters in ""Resident Evil"" or ""Dawn of the dead"" or ""28 whatever"" did you'd say no you like and trust ""Will Smith"" thats why you fear for him! my dad stood up and screamed during the few scary parts. I thought he was going to get shot with everyone screaming ""Down in front bitch down in front!!"" i took one of my sisters friends who likes to smoke that ganja before movies. i asked her if she was happy she smoked happy she was high?

An okay film....,"I Am Legend was an entertaining piece of work, but sadly wasn't enough to reach my full satisfaction. Throughout the film I couldn't help but feel as if the plot wasn't going anywhere. The storyline was similar to 28 Days Later and stole the fear and devastation of the ""deadly virus"". The problem with this film was that they casted Will Smith. Will is an amazing actor but this role belongs to an upcoming actor who has talent but not fame. While watching this film sometimes you can't take his role seriously because of the entertainment he has done previously. Another problem i had with the film was the infected zombies. They just weren't realistic. You couldn't take the infected seriously because of the CGI. The CGI ruined the whole concept of the infected. However a few scenes did have me concerned and frightened. I also did enjoy the scenes that showed how being isolated can really make you start recreating your life. This movie was an okay movie, but I doubt I will ever be in the mood to see it again. If I am ever in the mood for an apocalypse film, I might as well just watch 28 Days Later and use this as a back up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

I really hope there is a sequel or prequel.Will Smith is amazing, the friendship between him and his dog allowed Will to fully show his acting ability.If the ending is a bit better, i think this can be the next matrix.The scene where the infected gather together breathing is amazing, I wish there more scenes like that.

"Not awful, but not great","Sitting down in the theater to watch what is basically another zombie-movie didn't feel all that appealing. But ""I Am Legend"" seemed to have a few things going for it. Like a being based on an actual novel, like having nice cinematography and a style that seemed appealing. In the end though, i found that this movie had serious trouble rising above mediocrity.We can start with the good. This movie has a few things really going for it. It looks gorgeous to begin with. The empty and partly overgrown streets of New York are awesome. The visual style is generally very nice and atmospheric. Second the music is great. Both the score and the very well-picked songs add to the mood of the movie. The third thing i liked was actually Will Smith. I'm not one of his biggest fans, although i do think he has some talent, not least in comedy roles. Here though he carries the first half of the movie quite admirably. After that, the whole thing degenerates in a way that not even the best actor could save.The actually brings me to the bad points. In general, people have been saying that the first two thirds of the movie were great, the last third awful. In most parts i can agree, although i would say that the first two thirds were good, and the ending disappointing. Honestly i can't say that this would have become a favorite of mine even with a good ending. But the ending they chose for this movie must have been one of the worst choices they could have. Since they didn't seem to follow the book that closely, they could easily have remodeled the ending to something a lot better. One of the other things that bothered me were the zombies (or ""Dark Seekers"" as they call them) themselves. They are a mess of decent quality CGI that somehow turns quite awful in a few scenes. This is not the first time that movies have shown fluctuating quality in it's CGI, but i'm wondering where it comes from. If you have a big budget it shouldn't be that difficult to make the quality decent through the whole movie.In the end this movie didn't really appeal to me that much. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either. I almost always have a problem with movies that are basically one-man shows. I loathed ""Cast Away"" for instance due to the fact that Hanks is far from good enough to carry a whole movie. It worked better in this movie due to the fact that Will Smith had more things to interact with, but it's still a problem. Also the whole ""zombie-virus"" thing feels explored already. We have 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later which are both better movies on basically the same theme. I think it's time that Hollywood left the zombie-theme alone for a while and started on something else. This is getting repetitive.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Better than I expected.........,"""I am Legend"" is actually (I really hate to say this being a HUGE Vincent Price fan) better than ""Last Man On Earth.'Legend' is very reminisent of 28 Weeks Later & ""The Descent"" in regards to the appearance & mannerisms of the sub-human beings who dwell in the darkness. The air-born plague in Legend is also very similar to 'The Rage Virus' of the 28 Days/Weeks films in that these sub-humanoids are as violent & unrelenting. They are NOT the shambling weaklings of director Ubaldo Ragona's 1964 film (which in turn asks the question; why aren't they given their present situation?). I am Legend does contain a fair amount of suspense with very little to no blood or gore. And I fear that will be it's undoing at the box office because Legend's two recent predecessors ""28 Weeks Later"" & ""The Descent"" had more than their fair share of the crimson goo. Irregardless, I am Legend is still a very good (albeit not an original) film, with a very solid performance by Will Smith who plays Colonel Dr. Robert Neville (this is what now, the 3rd time Will Smith cinematically tries to save the world). However, I wouldn't be surprised if Will Smith doesn't pick up his second Oscar nomination for his performance in this film. *Note; I have not read the novel by author Richard Mattheson so I do not know how the film compares to its' literary counterpart.BloodStone's Recommendation: I am Legend is a good film & one worth buying a ticket for.BloodStone's Rating: 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Fascinating and terrifying,"What happens when in modern times, a revolutionary, almost too-good-to-be-true solution to a life threatening, scary problem appears and seems to be the cure for everything that goes wrong? As if someone walked up to you one day and said ""Oh, hi, here's a magical box that if you keep it with you all the time, you will never be sick, never have problems, and have a long lasting life."" Would you still feel the same about your life and the people in it? And would you rely on this so much...that it would destroy you? What if that solution was the cure for cancer? ""I Am Legend"" is a fascinating, new post-apocalyptic thriller starring veteran actor Will Smith. When the cure for cancer is brought upon humanity, and the drug is administered to patients, hell breaks loose. A virus is created, that starts as side effects to the drug. One day in New York, the virus mutates and ends infecting everyone on the planet, with a 90% kill rate. The virus takes these people and transforms them into possessive zombie-like creatures that are deathly afraid of the light and come out at night to hunt for survivors of the virus.Robert Neville, a brilliant scientist, is apparently the only survivor of this pandemic, being somehow completely immune to the mutated virus. He lives alone with his dog Samantha who is also immune to the air-borne strain of the virus only in New York City, which has been completely deserted. He sends out radio signals to search for other survivors while trying to maintain his sanity and test samples of the virus in his lab he has in his basement. Everything seems OK for him, from strolling the disturbingly empty, weed-ridden streets of Manhattan, driving golf balls from rooftops, and taking unrestricted tours of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Until the night comes. At his watch's beep, Neville bolts himself into his house to protect him and Samantha from what's out there--the remaining 90% of the world's population who want to infect Neville and Samantha. He mustn't be seen in the darkness to avoid the zombie/human creatures who watch his every move, waiting for him to slip up. As if this wasn't enough, Neville is plagued with dreams of the final moments of human civilization, when the aggressive decision is made to quarantine New York City, and the horrific death of his wife and daughter.I know what you're thinking--that I Am Legend sounds like a corny, cheesy, over-used, washed up, unoriginal B-movie Hollywood pile of crap. I can assure you, it is far from that. The film is scientifically fascinating (even from a person who despises the thought of science class) and is like a window onto our own current society that where we're headed, trying to fix everything, can end in horrific situations. The images of post-day New York are extremely disturbing and horrifying, especially if you're familiar with the city as I am, from living in its metro area. Images of a blowing, dusty Times Square, complete with its usual screens and advertisements, except with cracks in the street, weeds growing out, and no people--something that anyone who's ever been to New York will tell you is simply impossible.The movie seems to be two-faced. There is a dire, extremely thought provoking sense of caution and tensity throughout the film, even in the calm scenes, that inspires otherworldly levels of suspense. You can do anything you like in the Big Apple that is now 100% deserted--except go out at night. This makes the film both extremely entertaining, very fascinating to watch, and utterly terrifying.Apart from all of that, ""I Am Legend"" is the scariest film I've seen all year. By far. And it's not everyday a PG-13 receives that reward. Not only the premise of being totally alone in a disturbingly deserted huge city that used to be home to over eight million, but in other ways as well. Unlike other zombie movies, which may you leave you laughing, ""I Am Legend"" has got the stuff to leave you shielding your eyes and shaking in fear. I know it had me scared out of my mind. Some of the scenes are extremely intense, grotesque, and the movie is jam-packed with utterly horrifying jump scenes that had my completely packed theater jumping out of their seats (and no, it wasn't just me). I could say that this movie is scarier than all four ""Saw"" films combined. Therefore--unless you can take a very scary movie, it might be a good idea to pass this one up. I feel sorry for those who saw it in IMAX. But if you can take the horror, get your tickets. If one movie this season deserves your ticket money, make it ""Legend."" The film is extremely well crafted and executed. Francis Lawrence delivers incredibly good direction and the editing is very well done, with horrifying flashbacks to a panicked New York, and makes the film that much more fascinating to watch. There is a strange sense of realism in the movie, something that'll make you think, ""Could this be where we're headed?"" Not in the sense of zombies, of course, but in other disasters. The only complaints I have with this film is the ending was much less than satisfactory, and in my taste, was a bit too clichéd. The second half of the film is still very good, but fails to deliver the tensity, horror, and strange fascination that the first half brings.So, if you're looking for a way out of a bunch of dumb laughable zombie movies, and searching for one that actually scares the crap out of you, check out ""I Am Legend."" You may find yourself pleasantly surprised.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Excellent movie, but...","This is a great movie, don't get me wrong! Will Smith was perfect for this role, the story was strong and the street scenes were great. It's a very intense movie that will absolutely stay with us for years to come. Or longer. But it could have been better, so much better, richer and more memorable! Where are the scenes with the protagonist walking down the aisles of a supermarket or a Walmart, say, looking for food and supplies? Or browsing the shelves of some library, or a museum maybe or looking out over the city through a tall skyscraper window at sunset? How about picking out a new car or window shopping on the lonely streets? In other words, all the things people think of when they think of The Last Man On Earth. Because, as scary and lonely as it could be, there is still a part in every one of us that has thought about that kind of simplicity which draws us to these types of movies, especially as our lives grow ever more restrictive and frenetic. The kind of things that the best book of this genre, Earth Abides by George R. Stewart, supposes. True, this book was not based on that novel, and someone will likely point out that this isn't a pastoral story, but wouldn't moments like these, those we all think about when we imagine that kind of scenario, have been just as relevant in I Am Legend?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Should haven been better script let it down,"I really like the premise and these kinds of movies in general but right from the start here the script was bad imo.

Directing seemed fine, acting to me was just okay, again I think we can blame the script here for what Smith had to work with.

Will Smith carries the movie,"In 2009, Dr. Krippen finds a cure for cancer by mutating a measles virus. Unfortunately, the virus, mutated to attack only cancerous cells, gains a life of its own. It spreads rapidly around the globe, and within three years, 90% of human life is wiped out.Will Smith plays Robert Neville, a military scientist who is one of 12 million people who were naturally immune to KV. Dr. Neville is the sole survivor in the City of New York. So far as he knows, he and his dog Sam are all that is left of civilization. But he is not alone. The rest of the survivors became zombies, feeding off the healthy survivors.To ease his loneliness, he sets up a few mannequins across the city so that he has someone to greet as he makes his daily rounds (like Tom Hanks and Wilson in ""Cast Away""). He also turned his basement into a lab in which he experiments with rats, trying to find a cure for the virus.One of the unique aspects of ""I Am Legend,"" compared to other post-apocalypse movies, is the zombies had personalities. The Alpha Male is not only strong and tough, he is also very smart, able to set a trap for Neville and rally hundreds of zombies to fight with him. He was also smart enough to search all parts of Neville's townhouse.The movie is not without its flaws, but it is much better than the Omega Man.

Be very afraid of things that go bump in the dark.,"I've seen 'I am Legend' many times, but never in the same light as I did when I watched it now. It seems all the more relevant now during the Covid-19 pandemic. But let's forget about the pandemic for now and view the film pre-Covid-19.Will Smith stars as Robert Neville, a doctor who is immune to a virus which wiped out most of humanity. Robert is pretty much the only character in the film. Other characters are introduced through flashbacks, and later in the film Anna along with her son Ethan makes their appearance. But for most of the film, it is just Robert and his dog.Despite the small cast the film is surprisingly captivating and there really never is a dull moment, thanks to clever storytelling and pacing. The initial mystery and post-apocalyptic scenes of Manhattan keeps the viewer glued to the screen as we wonder what the hell happened here. It's like eating popcorn: once you start, you can't stop!As the story unfolds, we learn of a Dr Alice Kippen, who designed a virus to treat cancer. A great success at first, the virus then started infecting people, eventually becoming airborne and killing more than 6 billion people. Some of the infected now live in the shadows, and only come out at night. They've transformed into vampire-like creatures - referred to as Darkseekers - now hunting for food. The visual effects are astounding, and so realistic the film is entirely believable.It is never really explained why Robert is immune to the virus, but being a virologist, one can assume he experimented with drugs, or he is just lucky. He is trying to use his immunity to create a serum that would cure the infected. Will Smith delivers a fantastic performance as Robert.There's great suspense, and also some amazing action sequences.

I am recommending this to anyone who is ready for excitement and to be thrilled because it is amazing at doing just that. I do not recommend it for children under 13 because this like some other pg-13 movies has a great chance of having been rated R a few years ago.

Even though there is just one character throughout most of the movie, it keeps you interested. Great scenes of a desolated New York. In some scenes the zombies don't look that real but it has good special effects overall. His daughter did a good enough job although she doesn't have that many scenes. It was worth what I paid to see it and I would definitely recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""ok"" is the name","It's the best movie made by will smith so far, the rest of the movies he made were purely commercial. The action is intense and keeps u pined to your chair. there are some minor mistakes in the script but the movie it's OK. the only major fault i can find is that its too short and the action does not have time to develop like it should.the creatures appear too little in the film. And the appearance of the mysterious savior is timed by ""god"". In one scene will appears prepared to sleep in the bathtub an in the next shot he wakes up from his bed, all this are minor things and do not ruin the action an the line of events. As an ending line the movie is a major hit for will s. and its a 8 out of 10 for me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Semi-satisfied,"First of all I didn't read the book so I can't comment on that but knowing the trend, this movie probably butchered it.On to the Review...Robert Neville(Will Smith) and Sam(the dog) are all alone in a world where a virus has turned humans into zombies. These creatures are afraid of sunlight which forces Robert to live during the day and survive during the night as he tries to find a cure that will save humanity.I've always had a thing for apocalyptic movies, my favorite being Children of Men. The strength of these type of movies lie in the atmosphere. It has to suck you into this world of fear and tragedy and never let go, not even after the credits roll. It should let you ponder the meaning of existence and perhaps shed light to present issues. I am Legend contains some elements of a great movie, but ultimately feels neither chaotically fun, nor intellectually stimulating.Will Smith as Robert Neville is great as usual and his interaction with Sam is probably the best thing about the movie. You feel that their grateful companionship is the only thing keeping them alive which leads to some great scenes of hope and despair. The first 3/4 of the movie is actually pretty good with the emptiness of NYC and the constant feeling of looming danger. This buildup is ruined by the weak ending. I won't spoil it for you but you'll be disappointed given the quality of the rest of the movie (minus the zombies which look totally fake and not scary). Some movies seek to be intellectually stimulating while others choose to be mindless fun. This movie seeks to do both which doesn't work too well. You'll probably like it. Just don't expect too much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Nutshell Review: I Am Legend,"Out of curiosity I went to look up Will Smith's filmography, and realized that since Michael Bay's Bad Boys in 1995, he had averaged just one movie a year, most of them being box office successes save for blips like Wild Wild West, and in films spanning a wide genre from biopics to romantic comedy to action and drama. Today his name alone on the marquee can open a movie, and I Am Legend is probably a true test of that drawing power, because for the most parts, his Robert Neville is the last man on Earth.This film is the third to have been produced for the big screen, based on the novel of the same name by Richard Matheson. I haven't watched The Omega Man which starred Charlton Heston, but from what I've read, it's a somewhat wide departure from the source material. The Last Man on Earth, starring Vincent Price, was entertaining (available at the Internet Archive) and given that we're looking at it in retrospect, was told in a rather straightforward and simple manner. Will Smith's vehicle, will no doubt be updated with plenty of special effects, and getting those road closures for down town Manhattan is by no means an easy feat in itself.I've no idea why the tagline had to say ""the last man on earth is not alone"", and in the poster had Smith slinging a mean rifle over a shoulder, with a German shepherd at his heel. With man's best friend as company, how can any man be alone? Technically yes, but then his pet dog provides an avenue to keep one's sanity - any interaction that provides feedback of sorts, doesn't put you in isolation ala Tom Hanks in Castaway. And being stuck in a big city in Manhattan does have its perks, in terms of food, shelter and of course, entertainment.Of late, monster movies with the likes of the recent 28 Days/Weeks series, and in 30 Days of Night, point to an interesting observation - that we like our monsters smart, vicious and fast. In The Last Man on Earth, Vincent Price had to do battle with plodding creatures of low IQ, which formed the basis of George A Romero's walking undead. Here, the creatures bring forth a few same-old concepts, from being created by a virus (Resident Evil series, 28 Days/Weeks probably taken a leaf from I Am Legend the book), filled them with crazed rage, move fast and are incredibly smart - they adapt and learn. However they fail to interest in creature designs, having look like leftovers from The Mummy franchise.Action sequences are few and far between, which ringed back to an earlier Smith movie I, Robot, but credit has got to go to I Am Legend for deftly crafting moments of intense fear and dreadful anticipation, like the sequence in the warehouse. But everything else was a chip off something else, like The Hulk's raging doggies, and with Robert Neville taking a leaf out of Sylvester Stallone's The Specialist in tactical defending, which I liked to believe his character had learned from one of his routine DVD rentals. There's even one more reference that I will choose not to quote, as it's too close to revealing how the ending turned out to be, which I felt was a little of a cop out, as the filmmakers probably had a problem in deciding how best to end this, in an honourable way befitting an A-List Hollywood star.The backstory to Neville's predicament, as an update to the original movie's explanation on the situation, brings forth a warning to those wanting to play god. Sometimes the intentions are good, but like all potential miracle cures, these have to be tested thoroughly rather than be excited over them, or worse, having those with side effects covered up. Don't expect too much of those flashbacks, like The Last Man on Earth's, they're kept short and succinct, and most of it is unfortunately in the trailer. An added plus into this version, is the lack of a dreadful need to repeat its stuff to remind audiences of Neville's routine of eat-play-send signals-find cure-find food etc, and juxtaposed time quite nicely so that it's not simply just a dawn-to-dusk day-in-the-life-of account.Directed by Francis Lawrence who brought us the big screen adaptation of Constantine, I Am Legend continues to serve as a staple for that year end big budgeted blockbuster, and in most counts, I Am Legend works, plainly because of Will Smith's charisma, and that German shepherd's company.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Goodie,"A solid piece of the post-apocalyptic genre. Good production, some fine action and a great dystopian setting make this a fine one. Will Smith is good too. The movie is based on the novel I Am Legend (Richard Matheson, 1954), and like the two other movie adaptions I know - The Last Man on Earth (Vincent Price, 1964) and The Omega Man (Charlton Heston, 1971) - I like this one too and watched them all more than just one or two times. It looks like that it is impossible or at least difficult to make a bad movie based on that story (to all producers on this planet, read the sentence again).

will smith was excellent,"This was without a doubt one of the movies of the year, the special effects were top notch and the acting from will smith was Oscar worthy, even though he will never get an Oscar for this type of film because it is a blockbuster.

It is like Will smith is the last man on earth, the way they made new york look like a ghost town was spectacular, empty streets with lions and other wildlife roaming it.

Just another one of the bunch.,"Ehhh, I expected a fun pack of action and gore but the truth is that ""I Am Legend"" is just an ordinary, regular post-apocalyptic flick that tries too hard to be considered as action horror.The f/x are surprisingly bad for being a super Hollywood production staring Will Smith! The CGI monsters were truly a let down and worst of all, the action sequences were pretty lame.The positive thing about the movie is Will Smiths' performance and the dark, sad feeling surrounding of the post-Apocalyptic settings.My theory is that the movie tried to be a new post-apocalyptic masterpiece or a huge blockbuster flick. The truth is that the ideas are very good but the execution is just regular. This is an action flick you will soon forget.Nice try, but it didn't work.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
It could be better,"I was very curious about this movie after all the talk about it. After watching it I must say I expected a little more that it is.It's first half is quite boring just like the book which it is based. The second half it has more action but the ending of the movie is very, very different from the book and I prefer the book's ending instead.Will Smith play very well his movies. When I watched him years ago in Fresh Prince of Bell Air I would never expected him playing such a dense characters like the one in this movie so well. He did a really good job.Special Effects and scenarios is very nice. All the vampires are CGI (computer generated images) of course but it's very good.The ending is a little frustrating and I think it compromised the general result of the movie. It's ending is something like Independence Day's ending ... quite happy and full of hope. The ending of the book have intelligent vampires creating a new society and than contaminating the characters too for becoming part of their new society.Well, I think this movies worth the price of the ticket and I recommend it.

Excellent!!,"This is a modernization of the 1964 Ubaldo B. Ragona classic horror/sci-fi/drama, ""The Last Man On Earth,"" starring Vincent Price. This features Will Smith in the lead (no, this isn't like the mistake that was Wild, Wild West) and his strongest co-star is a beautiful German Shepherd named ""Abby"" who are both brilliant, by the way.Frankly, after the Pursuit of Happiness (even the title gets on my nerves), I was afraid Will Smith was about to head down the dark and dreadful path which has led Eddie Murphy into obscurity, but I'm happy to see this is not the case.The pacing, story, and execution are beautifully done, leaving behind no second thoughts or misgivings, in this reviewer's opinion. This version of the tale is properly constructed and executed. It is beautiful, witty, clever, and artfully suspenseful, with a most excellent execution of a much older story.Neville's descent into insanity is nothing graceful, and there is no attempt made to make it appear candy-coated. This came off as ""real,"" due to the quality performances by Smith and Abby, the slick but still solid production style, and the quality CGI.All in all, this is definitely good for a Friday/Saturday night's viewing, though not one for the kiddies.

What could have been...,"I went into this film thinking it would be awful. Plug Will Smith in Action Movie Will Smith mode into just about anything, and I'm bound to dislike it. What I found, for the first half of this film, instead, was a beautifully photographed and very well acted piece. Smith, a solid actor when he chooses material that suits his gifts, carries the weight of being the film's only character for about an hour in an effortless, engaging manner. It's one of his best performances. The film, which slowly reveals its (and its character's) history in flashbacks, is engaging for this hour. Then...the plot thickens.I won't give away the ending except to say that the film deviates DEEPLY from the novel's second act. In doing so, it not only loses me by going for a safe, semi-happy ending, but it perverts the author's very meaning of the title of the novel.Matheson (is he still alive?) should be pretty displeased. I am.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A good sci-fi thriller.,"This sci-fi thriller at first seems to be a perfect copy of 28 Days Later; you can draw striking similarities with it. 28 Days... was based in UK, this is US hence this is visually more appealing and also the special effects are top class. It almost impossible to imagine Manhattan with a single soul, but here we get to see Manhattan where wild animals roam free.The story of the movie is pretty straight and simple, a virus break out in human race which converts them into monsters and these infected kill tries to kill every human around. Our hero Will Smith, is somehow immune to this virus, also an army guy and researcher, stays in New York City and tries to find a cure.'I am legend' also highlights the friendship between human and his pet, which is really good to watch, they also try to show the state of the mind of a person, who for years have stayed alone, and the only one to talk to, is his pet.The monsters in the movie are visually top notch, as the SFX is of very high level. Specially the sequence where Will Smith driving a Ford Mustang, tries to chase down a wild animal in downtown Manhattan.The end of the movie is pretty much predictable, and no prizes for guessing whether he is able to develop the cure or not. The movie is at least a one time watch, for its special effects and for the man canine friendship.http://moviesopinion.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Watchable, but not great.","It's not a great movie but it's a good movie. The premise is simple (thank goodness), somewhat far-fetched (hey, it's Hollywood), and Will Smith is no Tom Hanks (the movie is kind of a take off on Castaway). However, except for a brief lull about two-thirds of the way through the movie where the Neville character is trying to make a point using the music of Bob Marley (which I'm sure will create a surge in people wanting to buy reggae music), the movie is watchable. As usual with most Hollywood movies, special effects are way overblown and after awhile are almost laughable. The dark seekers are frightening, at first, but what's somebody supposed to do when a bunch of them infest your house? This movie shows that if you get sick but lose your mind and regress into something resembling the cross between a screaming banshee and a housefly, you will not only survive but will flourish. Also, Will Smith was miscast for this movie's central role and his character's behavior and overall good mental and physical shape is completely inconsistent with his circumstances which are dire and life-threatening at best. Despite these shortcomings, the movie tells a story and for that reason is worth watching. But Will Smith is not Laurence Olivier and this movie is not Shakespeare. So if you're expecting something with a deep philosophical message, move on to something else.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Good Version Of A Familiar Story,"I've seen Vincent Price in 1964's ""The Last Man On Earth"" but not Charlton Heston's ""The Omega Man."" Along with ""I Am Legend"" all three are versions of the same sci-fi story. I liked the Price movie, although I thought there were a number of holes in the story which made it difficult to accept. For the most part, ""I Am Legend"" avoids those holes (although it does leave some unanswered questions - probably deliberately, since the disease and its effects are supposed to be mysteries.) Will Smith was excellent as Robert Neville, a military scientist who is one of the last survivors of a deadly disease that spread rapidly around the world. The disease started as a miracle cure for cancer until the side effects - described in the movie as being like the beginning of rabies - started to develop. Eventually, the disease causes mutations and even physical changes which leave the afflicted living a sort of wild-animal like existence, hunting after dark for victims to kill and devour. Neville for some reason is immune to the disease and fights both to find a cure for it and to survive.Compared to the '64 version, I thought this was by far the superior movie. Neville's psychological deterioration struck me as more realistic than anything portrayed by Price, the afflicted humans are more believable than the zombie-like vampires come back from the dead in the '64 movie, and overall this movie is far more frightening (and yet not particularly bloody). Smith was often putting on a virtual one man show, and he did so quite successfully. One could say that Neville's ultimate fate was a bit too cliché for a Hollywood action movie, and while I appreciated the extremely hopeful end of the movie, things at that ""survivors colony"" in Vermont did seem far too ""normal."" (And, if that colony could survive because the virus couldn't survive the cold, then one assumes that we in Canada must have been quite fine, so I'll stop dreaming about the South Pacific and rejoice in the cold and snowy winters!) Overall, though, this was a pretty enjoyable ride. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I am a let down?,"One man who is immune against a deadly virus that has wiped out humanity tries to survive and find any remnants of humanity with his trusty canine pal Sam.Will Smith who plays Robert Neville does his part.

A slight nutty character.What a glorious first half of a film which spirals off into a boring pointless depressing mess.A few scenes which were intriguing and provided scary atmospheric suspense were impressive. Reminiscent of silent hill or Pulse. The night creatures look menacing although they could be something out of Harry Potter(Dementors) the way they do the lighting.Effect wise it wasn't too bad but i feel i'm being kind as it wasn't perfect.

Fine effort though there's some problems overall,"After finding himself the lone survivor of a disastrous world-wide plague, a man interrupts his struggle to battle a swarm of bloodthirsty mutants to save the few isolated pockets of humanity left.This one wasn't all too bad but really had a couple points going for it. One of the main issues here is the fact that far too much of screen-time is devoted to areas that aren't that thrilling or exciting, really tending to drag out the first half here. From the daily routine and interacting with the dog to him scouting the city with the mannequins spread out in the different stores and just driving around not doing anything, it all leaves this one with large amounts of time where not a lot happens. Bounding it all with the plague research and scientific investigation into the virus which is pretty much all that occurs here, it doesn't feature much of anything with any real interest that features just very little action or exciting moments to drive this along, and the lack of action really throughout this makes this one limp along so lamely there's very few times where anything actually happens. It's also hard to tell whether or not we're dealing with vampires or zombies here, as the hunting behavior and origins of the virus and how to stop it are straight-zombiedom, while the nocturnal-ness and bloodsucking are vampiric activities, so it's a little confusing as well. There's still the pretty problematic fact that the CGI for the creatures is a misstep by making them look completely ridiculous and fake for the entirety of their screen-time. The last half is a lot better, as while the hunting techniques at the abandoned apartments derive a few scares and the creature's assaults on the fortified house are great action scenes that have some nice gore here and there so it does build to a fine finish, there's enough action to make more of an overall impression though it's still got way too many issues that work against it to overcome them.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and violence-against-animals.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
finally will smith is perfect.,"Years ago, THE OMEGA MAN scared the bejeezus out of me, then again, I was young and even seeing somewhat dated visions of an empty world and rather badly done shots of people collapsing from a viral attack, still scared me. I AM LEGEND, which is the third movie based on the Matheson book, I Am Legend, really is scary for the here and now and thanks to some inventive photography and CG effects, we see a grim but fascinating vision of a completely abandoned New York City from the get-go. A well intentioned virologist Dr Krippen(played uncredited by Emma Thompson) in a news clip as the film's opening production tags play, shows a quick ""human interest"" story as a TV host talks innocently(and somewhat disbelievingly) with her, about her success with ""curing cancer with a genetically engineered 'friendly' Measles virus"" and that this was administered to over 10,000 cancer patients who are now ""Cancer free"". Cut to three years later and a dead, overgrown NYC with Will Smith speeding around it in a new Mustang(In THE OMEGA MAN, Chuck Heston sped around LA in a new 1972 Mustang, one of the film's many homages to it's predecessor) we see the extent of Krippen's horrible mistake to mess with and trust the nature of viruses-which can do mutate without prediction. Will Smith is Robert Neville, military virologist who witnessed the end of mankind-he's watching a tape of news as the illness begins to mutate and media is becoming alarmed. Krippen's Virus had a bizarre side effect-it mutated and became a contagious, airborne rabies-like illness that either kills outright or drives it's victims to become rage-filled, blood/fluid drinking mutants who hide in the shadows and only come out at night. (In THE OMEGA MAN it turned them into psychotic hippies called ""The Family"" styled after Charles Manson who was still hot news at the time-films are products of their own time) The virus spread very fast as we see in quick flashbacks(Omega Man was told in several flashbacks as effective). Mannequins play a role in THE OMEGA MAN, and they do in I AM LEGEND.It is Smith's amazing acting talent that holds one riveted. It did me. The ""mutants"" are styled after the running infected in 28 DAYS LATER the only difference-and the film's drawback-is that too much CGI is used here and we're now so used to seeing CG in movies, that it appears that is what it is. In 28 DAYS LATER and it's sequel 28 WEEKS LATER, dancers were used as the running, screaming rage infected victims to much better effect. The CG FX shine in the visions of a ruined NYC, with grass and weeds everywhere, wildlife roaming, and destroyed bridges thanks to the military quarantine of the city. Obviously, it did little good as we overhear in a flashback, the President saying that ""every major world city has taken the same action"". Smith reminds us later, in dialog, ""nothing was supposed to happen the way it did"" It's a frightening vision, and I think the point being made was if, in reality, the Bird Flu hit and became easy to transmit, such scenes of sheer pandemonium, in larger cities would not be so much fiction.

This film had all the makings of a very atmospheric flick, the city scenes were great, even Will Smith looked fine in the middle of it all, then the story nosed dived and left me feeling no better off than the pop corn in the bottom of the carton.

I am just trying to say that this movie was brilliant and should be at least checked out by anyone. Unless you are afraid of movies about the world ending. People should see this movie just to see a fictional view of the world ending. Im sure that their will be a lot of talk about this being bad and not enough action, but that didn't matter it was more to show you what one man does on his own. This movie did have some sad parts in it as well. I thought that Will Smith should play in more movies like this. This wasn't very scary but some scenes were pretty frightening.

The keyword is ""atmosphere"" with a lot of tension, the more it can be built up without it looking ridiculous the better. It is important that you ""are alone"" with the main character, that you feel lost with him. I'm thinking that the dog shouldn't even be in the new film. So I have mentioned the old and the new one. My point is that I saw them both and even though Will Smith is one of my favorites and one of the most devoted actors imo the 2007 movie fails to build the atmosphere as good as in The Omega Man. As other people have said, we have seen so many computer generated images that we can tell easily when we see one. It kills it a bit for me having to look at too many cgi's.All in all its a good movie BUT it was a remake that wasn't better, even though it was made 30 years later and had one the leading actors on this planet.

I think i want this disease the humans get,"Not a bad movie... however one thing that really bugs me... why is it when writer/directors decide to go with CGI bad guys, that they decide to give them superhuman powers??? I'm not going into any spoilers i don't believe, i'm just talking general behavior of the bad guys. OK so there's a big virus that spreads, and the pre-movie-release Press/Media calls them zombies because zombies are big now, and ""World War Z"" is on the horizon, so i think people want traditional zombies... Well, we discover that these aren't traditional zombies.... OK, a bit disappointed, but i can handle it.However, once they start running 100 miles per hour, climbing up light poles like a lizard, jumping from the top of said pole 30 feet to the wall (i won't even mention those that could climb vertical walls faster than most 'real' humans can walk).... well, i have to say it was absurd... How do i get this disease? sounds like i'd be better off if i could do crap like that. All i really need to do is stay out of the sun. It's clear the 'zombies/monsters/whatever' are organizing, experience love of sorts, and have a leader, even pets, so why is Will Smith fighting it so much? Wouldn't you like to be able to climb up a light pole in about 3 seconds? it'd probably take me a good 20 minutes, if i didn't slip and break my legs in the attempt which would more likely be the result.This could have been a great movie but for some reason the Hollywood writers now insist on absurd CGI action to impress the audience. Maybe they should go back on strike. I'm tired of all of these 'blockbuster' movies being so ridiculously absurd that even when you're willing to suspend some disbelief for the sake of a movie, it completely transcends your limit.I guess all i'm saying is did we REALLY need to see these 'monsters' shimmying up poles and walls? wouldn't it have been spookier with a horde of them ripping down the door/first floor windows slowly and methodically????",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The story has changed little and in essence remains the tale of a dedicated doctor Robert Neville (Will Smith) who is challenged by a world destroying virus. Having eliminated 90% of the humans on the planet Earth, what little remains of the human species are little more than sun-fearing ghouls. While the rabies infected enemy seeks his lab and base of operations, Neville seeks their nest where he hopes to destroy the last of their monstrous race. In the 1964 version, Price seemed to acknowledge his lonely fate, in 1971, Heston took solace with an African American who became his partner. In this final version, Alice Braga plays Anna who tries to convince Neville of a 'survivor' colony which he finds hard to believe. It makes for a good follow-up to the earlier versions and all three should belong to those who enjoy a good scary story. ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Wonderful Will Smith,Who doesn't love a good Will Smith movie? This one no exception! Will gives another outstanding performance in this dystopian drama. It is a sci-fi horror - more horror really with quite a bit of action.I have yet to read the book but I am a fan of the film adaptations: The Last Man on Earth (1964) & The Omega Man (1971) - Now I Am Legend is added to that. I need to read the book!!No need to rehash this story -- if you haven't seen this film yet then you should!9/10,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Had it all,"I wasn't sure I was gonna like this movie (yet another zombie flick), but I decided to take my son and go watch it anyway. I was glad to find that it had everything, including: fear, sorrow for his lost, madness from being alone, even laughter at times. There was only one slight fault with it, it wasn't long enough! Maybe they could have had a longer introduction into the start of the virus, and how it started to grip the city. There were two main stars in this film, Will Smith of course, but also his only friend left in the world, his loyal loving dog. A partnership that was the only sane thing left in an insane world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"All of you who crave new films in the apocalyptic category, you must see this one!","A major scientist (Emma Thompson) goes on television to announce that a cure for cancer has been discovered. Although it involves fighting the virus with a designer virus, it is working magnificently. Flash forward three years. Dr. Robert (Will Smith) and his most loyal dog, Samantha are out on the streets of New York City. It soon becomes clear that they are the only ones walking the by-ways, as their sole encounters are with a herd of deer and, surprisingly, a lion and her cubs. Wait, in New York City, home to 8 million people? That is correct. It seems that the designer virus mutated and caused the death of nearly every human being on the planet. Only Dr. Robert is alive and immune in the Big Apple. When he makes his way back home, however, he does two surprising things. One, he heads for his lab, where there are some extremely agitated rats in cages. Looking them over, Robert makes note of the fact that one of the rats appears calmer and more like a typical rodent. This please the doctor, as he has been struggling to find a vaccine that would bring all of the rats back to normalcy from their present, rabid-like state. The second noteworthy action of the doctor is that, at sunset, he pulls steel curtains in front of all of the glass windows, and sleeps with a loaded gun in his hands, with Sam resting nearby. Strange. Even stranger noises, like bat voices, emanate from the outside. Yet, the next day, Dr. Robert is back on the streets, communicating via radio that he is alive and hoping to contact any other survivors out in the world. Unfortunately, an accident renders him out on the streets as the sun starts to disappear over the horizon. The strange, horrific voices return. Are Dr. Robert and Sam really alone in the city? Maybe not! This is another entry into the glorious repertoire of apocalyptic cinema. In the tradition of The Road Warrior, Strange Days, The Terminator and company, Legend is a fine, but not exceptional, film. It has an interesting story, although one that is not without its flaws. For example, how is it that a noted doctor and scientist happens to be the one survivor in Manhattan, instead of, let's say, a member of the garbage crew? Even so, the tale has some merit, as the man-playing-God strategy in the world of science is bound to cause problems from time to time. Also, as evidenced by the bird flu, viruses are the bane of human existence, as fighting them is a huge problem. As the main character, Smith is great, for he exhibits courage and intelligence in a big way. Other actors appear in the film, in flashback, mostly, and most worthily, too, although they are primarily a group of unknown thespians. The sets are amazing, for here is a New York City, with all of its buildings, but without a human being in sight. The settings, along with the remarkable cinematography, contribute heavily to the film's success. As for the direction, it is a bit uneven, as there are moments when the film lags into brief interludes of boredom for the viewer. However, when the action heats up, it is powerful. All in all, after a showing, most viewers will leave the theater a bit spent, emotionally. Do you adore futuristic films where civilization has degenerated into chaos and despair, only to have a hero or heroine emerge to ""save the world""? Then, don't miss I Am Legend, as you will be enthralled with its take on the fall of humankind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Intense and Intense.,"My stomach muscles were tight as I waited with dread until the viral mutants were revealed. Then I was even more overwhelmed. No chain saw mock killers here. The upbeat ending to the end result of mass vaccinations to 'prevent' a disease that the majority of us will not get was to be expected.This movie took me immediately to the theme of a book I just read - The Black Bug: The Genetic Bomb - which deals with the same theme of viral doom after mass vaccinations, this time Of Black Africans. I thought though that the suspenseful ending of The Black Bug was more horrifying and I still recoil from the ending. No pollyanna there. The vaccines for young girls - I have two - to prevent the low incidence of cervical cancer is also foodfor much thought especially after seeing this movie.I Legend is a scary sucker of a movie without the comic blood splatter of the 'horror' movie.

Entertainment only,"A vary popular actor, a big commercial campaign and not much more. The movie is okay, the special effects are art of state of art, the emotions and shock effects well portioned and placed. As far as the acting is concerned there is no complain, and if you are a Will Smith fan you will love watching it since he is the center of the movie.The bad side of the movie is that a realistic sounding story is mixed with implausible components. The story is used to provide some actions and some emotional scenes but there is no fascination, no message, no passion. My mayor criticism is, that the main person is a stereotypical hero with some flaws as we have seen already in hundreds of movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Flawed Popcorn Fun,"I AM LEGEND (M) Directed by Francis Lawrence Reviewed by Matthew GunnRobert Neville (Will Smith) is the last human in New York City, maybe the world. This is, if you don't count thousands of bloodthirsty mutant-zombies as humans.In 2009 a supposed ""miracle cure for cancer"" went disastrously wrong, infecting all humans with a deadly virus. Those who didn't die (around 10 percent of the world's population according to Robert's statistics) morphed into crazed monster killing machines. The exception to this rule is, of course, Robert Neville who (quite conveniently) is immune to the virus. Robert is faced with the task of developing a cure for the virus and to save mankind from being wiped from existence.OK, so it all sounds a bit ridiculous, but I Am Legend may not be all that you expect it to be. There isn't a lot of cliché zombie gore here, nor is Robert Neville your cliché popcorn movie action-hero. The film is all about brain before blood, delving into Neville's psyche as isolation takes a toll on his insanity. Will Smith does a superb job of filling the screen as, for the majority of the film, he is the only actor present.Besides Smith, I Am Legend's strongest point is its suspense. Director Francis Lawrence intricately fuses light (or lack of light), sound and camera-work to create this edge-of-your-seat tension. At times the on screen action makes you feel as though you are playing a first person shooter video game, and these sequences are not for the faint of heart.Unfortunately I Am Legend does suffer from a plot that is not only far fetched but predictable plot. Smith is the only thing driving the story towards its inevitable and under whelming ending and although his performance is admirable it fails to distract the viewer from the fact that I Am Legend's storyline is underdeveloped and one dimensional. Oh, and the CGI zombies look dreadful, you would have thought the film's monstrous budget (somewhere in the ballpark of 150 US million) could have taken care of this aspect at least.Although it has its downfalls I Am Legend is regardless an exciting action-thriller that is as fun is it is unbelievable. My verdict? Rent it out, get some mates around, and you'll surely have a blast.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Dramatically Powerful,"Pardon the pun, but I usually avoid remakes like the Plague.They always seem so cynically predictable: every 20 or 30 years (or less) a studio decides to milk a cash cow again. Never mind that the original was perfectly good, and stands up to the test of time.""The Omega Man"" way back in 1971 was a perfectly good take on Richard Matheson's novel. Indeed, this film is partially based on both the book, and the Omega Man screenplay. But, scriptwriter Akiva Goldsman (""A Beautiful Mind"") elevates the material, as it were, and delivers a screenplay to Will Smith and director Francis Lawrence of searing dramatic intensity and believability.This is Will Smith's finest work to date. He brings an emotional range to his acting that I thought only Russel Crowe could deliver. And Will carries this movie for a full three quarters with only a dog and CG animation to react against. An astounding performance, but one that likely won't get recognized, because this is nominally ""science fiction"".As Ron Moore's Battlestar Galactica has shown us, SF can deliver the best drama there is, and ""Legend"" joins that elite club.I also want to comment on the ending, the finale, the point where most films, especially American films, fail to deliver. Not ""Legend"": the climax is satisfying and dramatically appropriate.Directors like Steven Spielberg, who's ""War of the Worlds"" was just the sort of mindless, paint by numbers film that I abhor, should look at this film and see how important it is for the creators to care about what they are doing, rather than cynically engaging in cinema as market survey.""I Am Legend"" is one of the best films of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Good but it's missing something.,"This is simply a good quality movie to watch but it nevertheless leaves you hungry for more, since the movie its potential and concept screamed for a better and more exciting execution. After all, this movie is about the last man living in New York City, battling a whole bunch of mutant zombie, while trying to find a cure to the virus that almost entirely wiped out mankind. It's basically its potential that still makes this such a fine movie to watch but the movie however is just not as action packed or tense/scary as you would expect beforehand. It does make the movie perhaps a bit of a missed opportunity and it does has some wasted potential in it, which does give you the feeling that the movie is missing something but it fortunately doesn't make this movie any less pleasant to watch.First of it all, it's absolutely something great to see New York City entirely being overgrown by plants and wild life. It's above all very good and convincing looking and basically this alone is already enough to make ""I Am Legend"" a real recommendable movie. They did a real good job with it, although this effort apparently went at the expense of some of the movie its other effects. It's a mixed bag really. The one moment the effects are great looking, while the other its totally apparently too fake looking, especially for 2007 standards really.It's also really a tough movie for Will Smith, since well basically he has no one to play against, except for a dog. Still he knows to carry the movie brilliantly. Leave it up to Will Smith to make a successful blockbuster, which ""I Am Legend"" really was at its time of release.It's story gets obviously a bit restrained because, well how much stuff can you come up with for a movie that is being completely set in a large deserted city. They tried to give the story something extra by putting in an occasional flashback sequence but I don't think they were really in the right places and completely necessary for the movie. It probably would had worked out better if there were more and constant flashback sequences in the movie, completely explaining and showing how mankind got almost completely exterminated and everything involving around that. It still sort of gives you the feeling that they could had worked out the script better, also since the movie its ending really isn't completely satisfying (and yes, if seen both different versions of the ending.)It's one fine big budget quality movie. It's just missing this tiny bit of extra to make this movie a true tense, action packed or completely memorable movie to watch you'll talk about for years to come. Appereantly a sequel is currently in the making, lets hope it will include this extra elements required to make it a real great movie to watch.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Huge impact on the real world!!!!!!!,"I was sort of dragged into the cinema by my dad to watch this movie before my holidays were over.At first i thought is was just another ""Resident evil"" ripoff. As i watched the opening scene, i was became interested. It seems that Colonel Robert(Will Smith) is the last man in the city. His only companion is, Sam his dog. As the story unfolds we find out that the city had been infected with a virus and why Robert is the only man there.(Watch it to find out why) So Robert and his companion stays in the city as he finds a cure and other surviving people, if there were.As almost everyone is a living flesh eater.Will Smith delivers a top-notched performance in this film, as he survives in this lonely city. He drives emotion in the hearts of the audience and I love it.Though the movie a little short but it gives us a huge impact, whether this may happen to the real world in the future.

I Am Disappointed,"Starting on a promising note, losing its way in the middle, and collapsing entirely in the final act, I Am Legend is at its finest when it finds Will Smith steering through the windswept emptiness of the post-apocalyptic New York City but several shortcomings in the script and extremely shoddy work in the CGI department only end up nullifying the terror & sense of foreboding it had built-up within the first act. Neither chilling nor thrilling, this post-apocalyptic sci-fi horror had potential but not the required talent at helm to effectively translate it from script to screen.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"It's a film, it's NOT the book","Outstanding film with Will Smith giving a tour-de-force performance seldom seen in modern film-making: it's no spoiler to say that he IS the movie for about 97% of screen time and he never disappoints. THAT'S an actor at the top of his form. Sadly the combination of a Science Fiction theme & the word 'God' immediately disqualified him from a well-deserved Oscar Best Actor nomination owing to the minutiae various self-styled intelligentsia dredged up to justify slamming the film.After reading 'I Am Legend' & seeing 'Omega Man' both when released and more recently, Smith's 'Legend' makes a statement all its own & it's a statement that some worked to dismiss out-of-hand (such as those who nominate for Academy Awards & Popular Mechanics(!), the latter not exactly a Top Ten arbiter for excellence in film).The biggest complaints are absurd: ""this isn't the book"". Of course not, it's a film *based* on the book. The ""retrovirus is impossible"". Not a retrovirus, pay attention: it's mutated Paramyxovirus & could indeed spread just that quickly (Ebola, anyone?). Last, someone claimed 'God' spoke to them bringing the three letter word into an *SF film* - heresy!! - even though Neville's response is an interesting comment about Science & 'God'.Smith's performance elevates this film to a Must See - I *believed* it from the start. Neville is a man who makes mistakes, who by this point is hanging on to his sanity & his will to persist by his fingernails: far more than a science fiction action flick this is a film about humanity & a man driven to not give up on it.How odd that some SF fans want to trash this film because it mentions the God word. Einstein be damned, film S/F has turned into the art form where science *must* ignore any aspect of faith, unless to it is stand in arrogant denial of any philosophical statement that doesn't have a formula for proof even if those disdaining such have only a Discovery Channel appreciation for any of the sciences.

The storyline was well-written and well-explained, even though it was simple and easy to understand. The main character was very interesting and kinda likeable, but he wasn't well-developed. The casting choices were nice and their performances were great, especially Will Smith's acting was 10/10. I have to admit, it was a very intense movie and there were many action-filled moments. Also, it was a very scary movie and there were many jumpscares. By the way, the zombie's appearance was absolutely terrifying, even though the CGI effects weren't well edited, but it's okay! The opening scene was unpredictable, fast-paced and promising. The 2nd act was creepy and intense from start to finish. The ending scene was kinda predictable, but there weren't any insane twists during the movie.

Wayne meets Harry Potter,"I confess i had put some expectations on this. I haven't seen the old films that supposedly this one references, but still i have a great sympathy for films constrained in space and characters. This one had a great set up: New York, completely abandoned, regained by Nature after the collapse of mankind, and used by one single man! The visual possibilities of this are great, and the dramatic arc as well, even though here the success would depend greatly on what the actor did. Will Smith is a craftsman, not an artist, and what might be done with such a character is way out of his league. It was also out of Tom Hanks possibilities, and even Nicholson only came close to doing it right.I admit, the visual result was satisfying, they resisted the temptation of exaggerating in the special effects and creating a wilder city than it deserved. Some pieces of city were really nicely imagined. But than again, they might just have done that, show us in an exhibition, and they needn't wrap it around the crap plot, story, so on...The major problem is the goofiness of a half-crazy character, who starts alone, and ends up the hero of all mankind. In they way he (1)finds out the cure for the virus, all alone! and (2)physically saves that discovery so that the remaining humanity might live on and learn from his example. What a hero! He suffers, he survives, he has moral, he is a scientist, he is a martyr. I think this might sound a little bit exaggerated if placed in a pre-Leone western, but right here, right now, it aches. It is a kind of straight forwardness that i may put up with in old films that have other qualities, but i just won't take here.So, the virus not only kills, but in reduced percentages turns humans into vampires, so that we can have the city free during the day, and so that we can have scary faces and physical challenges for Smith, as well as exploding numbers. It's just too forced, and out of focus.Mike Patton sounds for the vampires are nice (i read somewhere he made their sounds).My opinion: 1/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"For all signs, ""I am a legend"" is not a terrible film","For all signs, ""I am a legend"" is not a terrible film, but this is a movie that could be much better. The concept is absolutely gorgeous (it says a man who knows very little about the book), and the film really begins brilliantly, with a large number of emotional impact and enough convincing chemistry between Will Smith and a dog, which is very sweet and plausible. The film also looks great, landscapes and photos are excellent, and, with the exception of strange mistakes in CGI, special effects are also very good. The film also has a tense and gloomy soundtrack, good director and brilliant, charismatic main role Will Smith.However, where ""I am a legend"" is not as successful, so this is that under this surface his heart is in the right place, but there are moments in the second half of the film, which at first glance seem hollow. Speaking of the second half, it is here that the film is descended in an attempt to be too ambitious, as a result of which the situation is not well-developed, and the characters fall into the clichés territory, and you do not feel enough emotional support for them. The film seems tightened, the ending develops longer than it would be, and the pace in an attempt to explain everything becomes very sluggish. And with explanations there is a problem, some of them do not seem not worked enough. The script is also uneven, in the first half he was piercing and plausible, but, like the characters, it becomes more and more temporable.In general, the film is worth seeing, but I can not get rid of the thought that he might be more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Less Then Legendary,"The trailer for this show was definitely enticing. It pulled me out of my house to watch this movie, which is rare, considering i rent DVDs. The show, however, was a tad slow in pace. This is to be expected, as there is only one actor. Will Smith's performance in the show was fantastic. He managed to show natural human emotions, and connected with me, the audience. The show was a little short, and the ending was rather abrupt. The appearance of certain characters were a little strange. The storyline, however, appealed to me, and i personally felt that the show was pretty good. If the show was faster paced, and had a better ending, it would have been great. This is much unlike other Will Smith movies, where his shows are normally pretty fast and exciting.

Not As Scary As Hoped; Best Part - Will Smith,"""I Am Legend"" reminded me of several other movies.It wasn't as jarring and disturbing as ""Planet of the Apes,"" also about a dystopic future in which one heroic man battles a world driven mad by an evil synergy of human, scientific hubris hand in hand with natural selection, a world whose bizarre features render him a freak.It wasn't as nightmare scary as ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" Making the mutants cgi special effects rather than actual human beings rendered them less frightening and disturbing.""I Am Legend"" wasn't as deep or detailed a depiction of a man alone in a hostile environment that he fashions to his own needs as was ""Castaway."" But, it was pretty good. Nice special effects of Manhattan without humans. I wish there had been a scene of Smith entering a candy store and eating all the candy he wanted, and another of Smith entering a clothing store and trying on expensive suits. Haven't we all harbored such fantasies since childhood? The best part of ""I Am Legend"": Will Smith's star power.Will Smith really is a movie star, in the old fashioned sense.

Consider the fact that ""The Mummy"" came out in 1999 and that leaves them sorely lacking. Will Smith does a fine job as the lonely Dr., running the range of emotions quite well. All in all though I blame poor writing and CGI for sinking this. Watch ""The Last Man on Earth"" or ""28 Days Later"" for a far better doomsday/""everyone else is dead...but not really"" flick.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Watch the movie first, then read the book, it is possible to enjoy both!","I watched this movie years ago, and very deliberately avoided the book until i had.I am Legend the movie is a tense, sometimes creepy, sometimes heart breaking movie of substance and quality. Will Smith does an outstanding job and I found the story and the message of the this movie compelling and powerful.Then there is Matterson's novel. It is completely different and is seeded purely in the horror with a very different meaning to the 'I am Legend' title.I get people hating this movie for what the filmaker's did to the story in relation to the book. But this movie is great in it's own right and I personally love the movie and the book, I just see them as completely different stories.Great film 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
So Much To Do About Nothing............,"After seeing Will Smith in such hits as Independence Day and the Bad Boys movies, you get use to a certain level of action and acting. I have never been so disappointed in one of his movies as much as this one. This title and plot line had so much potential to be so very much more. I felt that certain scenes were just put in at random spots.... It was like the director said ""OK the audience might be getting board here , KILL THE DOG!"" or ""OK lets put some lions in the scene so we can have some really cool effects and make the crowd oooo and awww"" Like I said the plot line was very good, but too much was spent on him really doing nothing, and by the time he starts doing something besides driving around the movie is over. The plot never really developed into anything. Maybe they should have started at the beginning and explained how things spread, show some action or something! It almost seamed like for needed some pub so they had a 2 hour commercial. I was a big fan of 28 days and 28 weeks later because they took the zombie movie a little further in my opinion, but this one hardly broached the subject. Sadly.... Damn, Will go do another Bad Boys movie so you can save some face!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Thought provoking,"The film is a unique mix of action and horror. If you enjoy a film that makes you think about our future and where our planet is going, the film is definitely for you.Will Smith is a unique actor that can take on any role and obviously in this film he does to. You can see him change through out the movie and his emotions are so great that you feel them too. The film has a great ending, it is very realistic and makes you think that the same could maybe happen to us.Unfortunately the film has poor background. You don't know why Will Smith is chosen to ""fix"" the problem, you know very little about him. And another thing that bothers me is the length of the movie, it could have been longer, but that also has its pluses.All in all the film is great and definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
DARK KNIGHT did it for me... this didn't,"The dark knight trailer at the beginning was better than this whole film combined. it just was slow and had about 3 or 4 good thrilling spots in the film that i enjoyed but everything else was dull and questionable. it left me with a whole lot of questions that didn't get answered and i don't like that if i am more confused to end the movie than before. I'm just glad it was only like 1hour and 40 mins. Will smith did well for basically being the only star in the movie, but there is still more things missing that he cant fix by just taking off his shirt and working out for all the women to see!! like i said before, i could of walked out after the dark knight trailer and been happy. this just didn't do it for me, for all the hype it got.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
some genuine chills and excitement early on but falters as it reaches its conclusion,"In the year 2009, Earth's scientists made a major breakthrough when they thought they discovered a cure for cancer. Unfortunately they were wrong and it mutated, morphing the entire population of citizens into horrific zombies just three years later. Dr. Robert Neville is a former military scientist and the last remaining survivor of the outbreak. Alone in New York City and accompanied by his faithful canine, he conducts extensive research to find a possible cure for the disease during the day, but at night he must go into hiding to avoid the threat of being infected. Well-made apocalyptic thriller is unavoidably reminiscent of the eerie 28 Days Later, at times even feels like a horror take on Cast Away, but it builds plenty of suspense, features superior special effects, exciting action scenes, and goes a long way on the strength of Smith who creates genuine pathos as a lone and resourceful survivor. Only letdown: the third act, which leaves one too many questions unanswered and settles for a conventional finale. A decent way to pass the time, though not recommended for anyone who isn't a fan of the lead actor. **½",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Despair,"After reading many of the other reviews, it seems that the majority of viewers feel the same way, and I have to agree. The build up of the movie is fantastic, the film paints a beautiful picture of loneliness and despair while giving an excellent glimpse of a man desperately trying to maintain his humanity. Then it flops.The monsters are comical. With the flood of zombie movies as of late you can tell the director wanted something new and original, and what came out was a cross between the lying figures of silent hill and the mummy, giant vibrating jowls and all. They can leap through the air, scale buildings, and perform ridiculous aerobatic maneuvers. It's cartoonist and converts what was a chilling and somber film into a laugh fest.Smith makes a quote that all human characteristics are gone, yet one of the zombies show leadership, intelligence, and problem solving abilities, only made worse by one creatures unexplained vendetta against Smith.A directors cut could still save this movie, and to give them the benefit of the doubt I will assume all the much needed back story and character development was cut for running time and to clear the pg13 rating. But that's just pipe dreams The first half of the movie scores a 9 and the second a 3 which explains the 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Haunting Tale of Loneliness and Its Relevance in Today's World,"I Am Legend is a poignant exploration of loneliness, survival, and perseverance in the face of overwhelming adversity. Robert Neville, the last human survivor in a post-apocalyptic world, captures the profound isolation of a man struggling to maintain his humanity amidst a desolate and dangerous environment. The film delves deeply into Neville's emotional and psychological challenges, highlighting his relentless determination to find a cure for humanity while enduring the crushing weight of solitude. His perseverance, even in the darkest moments, serves as a testament to the strength of the human spirit when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. In today's world, where social isolation and mental health struggles are increasingly prevalent, the film resonates deeply, serving as a stark reminder of how essential human interaction is for survival and the human spirit. I Am Legend underscores the profound impact of loneliness and how it shapes our lives, making it incredibly relevant in modern times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Not that bad,I heard a lot of bad things about this movie but after watching it I am quite impressed. Okay so it's not an Oscar winner but it is solid entertainment and fairly gripping to the end. Will Smith once again demonstrates his acting ability portraying a psychologically vulnerable ex army Colonel with great compassion.I Am Legend could have been a little more ambitious as it seems to short and comes to an abrupt conclusion.The photography of a desolate and neglected New York is a special treat for those who like this sort camera work although I am sure there is a fair amount of CGI manipulation here but it still looks eerie. - PCL,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Not the Stuff That Legends Are Made Of,"I wholeheartedly agree with many other reviewers that as pure entertainment goes, I Am Legend is fine - just fine to be more accurate. It is compelling enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, the CGI and visuals are impressive, Will Smith is Will Smith, and the story generates just enough of a comparison with the great apocalyptic novel I Am Legend by Richard Matheson to be engaging. It is very short for a movie that could have been much more in depth. Character depth is missing. Story depth is missing. Thematic depth is missing. Yes, we get the action scenes. Yes, we get Smith being charming and glib. Yes, we get high tech gadgetry and big box office sensibilities. Yawn. This film could COULD have been so much more than what it is. As it is it is marginal entertainment, but had it really taken Matheson's novel and based its screenplay in a more committed manner to it - the film could have been entertaining and profound. Why so short? Why the dog in the beginning of the film? Why the high-tech crap - to cover up the glaring weaknesses in plot and character depth no doubt. Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed the film enough so that I would definitely see it again. But having read the book and knowing what could have been done is the most supreme disappointment. The book could be easily transformed to film page by page. Of course you would forfeit action chase sequences and big budget gloss. But the book had a theme of one man against the undying void of loneliness that comes with being the very last man on Earth. That never happens here as we have a dog with Robert Neville immediately and soon...well, you'll see. The story was done twice before with Vincent Price in The Last Man on Earth and Charlton Heston in The Omega Man. This one is about as good as those two - though as far as story integrity goes - I'll take The Last Man on Earth as a better realization of what Matheson achieved in prose.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Solid Will Smith Performance. I Don't Get The Hate.,"Continue my plan to watch every Will Smith movie in order, I come to I Am Legend (2007)Plot In A Paragraph: Three years after a man made cure for cancer evolves, causing all infected to either die or turn into bloodthirsty monsters, Dr. Robert Neville (Smith) alongside his dog, Samantha, are the last survivors in New York City, and possibly the world. Neville, in the meantime, struggles to find a cure.I know the movie gets a lot of hate, but I really like it. We get some decent acting from Will Smith, especially when he is talking to the mannequin in the video store, after THAT death. Which I still hate to watch.It's not perfect, some of the cgi isn't great, it has a few plot holes and I don't care how far in the future this is set, I don't believe anybody would never have heard of Bob Marley, yet knows his son Damian Marley (whom I'd never heard of) but that's just a minor gripe.Overall it's well acted, well paced and has a good sense of atmosphere. I like it.I Am Legend grossed $256 million at the domestic Box Office (his third movie of $250 million and 7th $100 million grossed in a row) to end the year, the 7th highest grossing movie of 2007. His best performing movie since Men In Black 10 years earlier.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Decent but disappointing,"A deadly virus has decimated life on Earth. Robert Neville (played by Will Smith) is the last living person in New York. We see his daily routine and his attempts to develop a cure for the virus.Decent, but could have been a whole lot better. For the first hour or so was a well-crafted, well-paced, intriguing movie. Then all the build-up and suspense was wasted on a rush-to-the-finish, simplistic, fairly formulaic ending.Still a reasonably good movie in the end though, just expect to be disappointed, ultimately.Great acting by Will Smith's dog, I must add.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Good acting, good camera-work, too much recycling.","This movie should have it all... Great camera-runs, awesome landscapes and good acting from Will Smith. And, after everything is said and done, the whole story falls flat on it's face.I find it slightly disturbing that I can't find a particular reason for my sentiment. One thing that occurred to me though, was that there are a few subtle (and not so subtle) references to movies like ""The Road Warrior (Mad Max 2)"", ""The Night of the Living Dead"", ""28 Days Later"", ""Resident Evil"" and ""The Stand"" (mini TV-series). Combine these, add a sprinkle of ""Castaway"" and you get the picture. And this, I think is the problem. The story told is just a mish-mash of themes from other movies without bringing much of its' own material.The picture just lacks the fizz and surprise this kind of movie should have. And it really isn't Smith's fault. Thus, 6 stars of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
New perspective on the last human,"I was quite convinced, ""I Am Legend"" would be a pretty bad movie, before I went to see it.I knew ""The Omega Man"" and I really liked it. So I thought, why does Hollywood produce just another remake of a beautiful film? And I think, there are definitely too many remakes and far too many part two's. And most remakes do not match the originals, for e.g. ""The Time Machine"".But ""I am Legend"" IS different. It focuses on the main characters emotions. And these emotions are rather credible. Will Smith's play is just outstanding. He makes the audience like Neville, and suffer with him.OK, they use all storyboard-tricks to achieve this effect. To have a dog as second main character, a dog as only and true friend of Neville, well, that captures the viewer's heart. If such is done well, it is fine, and it is done well in this film.The fight against the virus victims, the ""vampires"", is not the main theme. These monsters are adding the fear and despair to the story. But this Neville is not running through the city (as did the Omega Man), shooting creatures wherever he meets them. No, this Neville is afraid. He captures them, but he fears them.Up to the end ""I Am Legend"" is great entertainment. It has strong emotional moments, even some very quite moments. And all this is convincing.Does it have flaws? Oh yes. The cgi is not very good. And the ""vampires"" are a disaster! If the vampires had been actors, humans, it would have been just fine. But no, nowadays one has to use computers. But if you use cgi, you got to be good at it. The creatures in ""I Am Legend"" suck! Costs it a star. And the movie ignores the confrontation between Neville and the ""leader"" of the vampires. It is there, but the personal dimension of this fight is just depicted rudimentary.Overall, very entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The first maybe 75 minutes was entertaining in the way most movies should be.After that as the story unfolded i began to be saddened by the lack of character development and appreciation for the audiences feelings.I don't understand why certain events HAD to happen.The flashbacks were out of place being seen throughout the course of the movie. All of this lead to a horrific ending that made the entire movie bad.The actual title wont make sense until the end.

Fantastic Revamping of a Familiar Story...,"I had heard a lot of hype about this film before I was finally able to watch it. I didn't catch it in theatres; I had to wait and purchase it on DVD. I wouldn't say it lived up to all the talk I'd heard, but it was still an awesome movie. The film is based on the 1954 book by Richard Matheson; in the year 2012, the world's entire population has been driven to near extinct by the Krippin Virus. The majority of the remaining population have been turned into Darkseekers, mutated into primitive creatures with a weakness to UV light. Will Smith plays Robert Neville, the last survivor in New York City who lives alone with his dog and struggles to find a cure.Will Smith has been one of my favorite, most-respected actors in recent years and he does a great job in this role, considering the man is alone for the majority of the film. His only interactions occur with his dog or the mannequins he has placed around the city to give it some semblance of a civilization; I can think of few other actors that would've been able to give the same performance with so little. My favorite scenes in the movie all involve his conversations with the ""locals"", particularly a scene with Fred.My only real complaint with the movie is the CGI. The Darkseekers were all done with CGI and probably some motion-capture. Unfortunately, most instances where you see the Darkseekers, it's very apparent that they're computer-generated. It's never obvious enough that it pulls the audience out of the movie experience but it does detract from the film a bit.Overall, the movie is a totally positive experience. If you get a chance, make sure to check out the alternate ending on the special edition DVD. I found that I actually prefer the ""controversial"" alternate ending versus the theatrical ending. While the theatrical ending provides more closure, I almost felt it was pointless. Whereas the alternate ending provides the filmmakers for further exploration of the story in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Will Smith Is A Legend,"A lot of people have been saying that they needed more back story etc. However you must realize this is a book turned movie, there were a lot of questions leftover after J.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. The movie simply cannot put more information into the movie without making it too long, or too confusing.The acting done by Will Smith far surpasses any other I have seen this year, and I can really see him getting an Oscar for his performance. It is hard to act when you cannot re-act, Will really showed the human instincts put into a very harsh situation. I do not think anyone else could really cover this role, the way that Will Smith did.The Effects however not insanely amazing, are still a step forward from your average effects, the brought you into the environment and made you feel like you were there with Will.The great thing about this movie is it touches on many of the average fears and emotions, Love, Loss, and Fear of the unknown. I think including all of the past apocalypse films, and most action films this year, I Am Legend will go down as a classic.The movie was very intense, and kept you watching, it touched on realism in many different levels, not only that this is plausible, but the emotions of Neville were very human.This movie is a must-see by all people.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A daily comment from Midget Emma: I Am Legend (2007),"One of Will smith's best performance, laughs, scares, tears.... what more could you want?This is without a doubt one of Will Smith's best performance ever. I am legend had me laughing, jumping out of my skin and i had tears in my eyes throughout this great movie. It made me think of a ghost town I robot with monsters instead of robots and no future look.Three years after a plague kills nearly everyone a immune survivor called Robert Neville tries to find a cure for the virus so he can save the humans-turned zombies/vampires. Also while doing this he is trying to make contact with any survivors out there.This is the saddest movie i have seen in a very long time. The tragic story of Robert Neville will have you thinking about his story long after the movie is finished. Some will look at him as a hero and some will look at him as a monster.The laughs come later in the movie but i will not spoil the laughs for you.This movie was much scarier then i thought it would be. I was jumping in my seat at least every few minutes. I recommend not to take young kids because it may have them up all night. But thats your decision whether or not to take kids.The CGI is not what you would expect from what todays CGI can deliver. So don't go in expecting amazing CGI. The environments look amazing but the monsters seem to be lacking the amazing CGI today offers. IMO they should have use real people with make up on for the monsters.I recommend this to everyone.

"Good, but mildly disappointing","I actually went out and read the book this is based on (Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"") after seeing the trailer for this movie for the first time. It looked *that* good. The book was interesting and fairly well written, but had quite possibly one of the most depressing endings in the world.The movie had its good points and its rough ones (CGI for characters isn't quite what it needs to be, though I'm sure it will be there in ten or fifteen years).Will Smith does an excellent acting job, but he's not quite lost in the role, in the sense that at times, on screen, you realize you're watching Will Smith.The director didn't quite have the chops to do this movie as well as it could have been done, I fear, as he's only got one other major film under his belt and the rest are music videos.The film didn't really convey the horror of being the last person on earth as well as it could of. Sure, it hinted at it, but it was hardly pervading like it really should have been. The story's strongest point is it's psychological aspect and that didn't rule the day in this film. Far too many ""It's A Big Budget Major Hollywood Movie!"" moments kind of killed the effectiveness of that feeling. (Massive product placement at the beginning, happy deer hunting scenes, an overall light emotional tone for the first half of the movie).All that said, it is a fairly solid movie and well worth renting, though paying to see it in theaters is a 50/50 thing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

It may be based on a pretty good read and some other films, but it gives hope where maybe it shouldn't in the last reel (although let's get real Mr. Smith is good at playing the hero).

Really disappointed,"I really liked this movie. I was pretty mad when it ended because it was so good so far and when I realized that its about to end I couldn't believe it because it was.. the story wasn't over at all. In stead of making a 200 minute long movie and get to the top250 in IMDb, they decided to stop there and just everything else important said in the last 5 minutes. After seeing this, I really was stunned. Didn't expect that huge of a fail and tore down my ratings of this movie. After realizing that this movie was no more than a regular zombie movie, I can't rate this highly because of Wills performance, which was unbelievable. Hes performance can turn Manos into The Godfather.Also, what was the point of the flashbacks. The flashback was total of 10 minutes long in this movie and just showed the obvious - the spread. It character information or its background which is usually the point of flashbacks.The movie had a 150 million dollar budget and was so short and really, really poor CGI. I mean, there was NOTHING there. I think that CGI is a mistake to make models like humans, dogs etc. Its easier, less expensive and MUCH better and realistic to just use costumes and makeup. In the case of like ""Transformes"" yes, you cant use make-up to make the transformers, but all the best horror movies have costumes like Silent Hill and Jeepers Creepers(although there is a huge movie mistake in JC where you can see the zip of the costume).This movie is nothing more than an above-average action film.

Thoughtfully implemented popcorn cruncher,"Surprisingly adept action film benefits heavily from Francis Lawrence's keen, at times stunningly fluid direction, powerfully high-concept production, and Will Smith's appealing, improving charisma. The former Fresh Prince and dance-happy, child-friendly rapper continues to buck the norm to further establish and nearly redefine his distinguishable leading man qualities in a performance noteworthy not for it's inherent skill but for the skill inherent inside the actor involving his largest anticipated audience.Of course it is flawed; whether one wishes to soak in this atmospheric counterpart to 28 Days Later on a completely visceral or metaphorical level, problems within the script halt Zoo York from being fully realized all too often. Without concentrating too hard on some dopey liberties taken and a questionable climax at best, I Am Legend still offers some of the most convincing post-apocalyptic, big budget renderings to date.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Myth and Legend,"Will Smith is the last man on Earth (probably?), living in a New York city turned wild. We know there's more from the trailers - ""Nighttime: survive."" So who or what is this mysterious force that opposes Robert Neville as he ekes out a lonely life from society's dusty leftovers? I Am Legend artfully ropes you in with the premise, but it's like a clumsy teenager trying to make love from that point on. Some people will be disappointed by the way things wrap up, but I appreciated the sentiment and obvious affection for how the film was crafted.This is one of those films where the setting is its own character, it's so well-developed and omnipresent. The movie's appeal lies mostly there, and with Will Smith being almost impossible to dislike. Plus there's a dog. Who doesn't love smart dogs in movies? I enjoy survival stories that don't highlight any serious physical pain. Robinson Crusoe, Lost, the Boxcar Children from my youth. You get to see everyone revert to a much simpler life as hunter/gatherers. I Am Legend is full of tiny, well-thought out details for how man might survive in a post-apocalyptic city. Neville keeps a hydroponic garden in his kitchen and harvests corn in the park. Even with a fancy rifle, hunting deer is difficult and best done on foot. Drugs, TVs, and money are useless, but bacon is priceless. Robert is strong, but painfully lonely, and talks to mannequins to maintain some sort of social normalcy. Daily exercise must be rigorous if Robert wishes to compete with the wild and survive the monsters.And the monsters are where I start to get lost. It wouldn't be enough to have Robert Neville wandering around for two hours, so there must be a direct conflict. That's well built up when we see Neville revert to hysterics when Sam the dog runs off, or when his daily routine is timed to sunset. Why does Robert freak out when the dog disappears into darkness? Why is it important that Robert returns to his home by sunset? Why must he bar the windows and doors to his own home and pour some unknown liquid over his tracks on the doorstep? The monsters, of course, are us. By playing God and finding a viral cure for cancer, the punishment handed down was death and vampirism to all. Neville is immune to the vampire virus, but still has to worry about surviving their mindless aggression. This could have been very poignant if we'd never seen a monster, or if the monsters had retained at least some of their humanity.Halfway through the movie, it stops becoming a survival story and starts morphing into a survival of the fittest story. Neville gets into violent battles with hordes of CGI vampires. It's not very realistic, though the irony of being immune to a virus and dying from the secondary effects anyway is not lost on me. As with Signs and nearly every survival horror story before it, the suspense vanishes completely when the horror stops being psychological and starts being primal. It's appealing to a lot of people - enough that survival horror is its own genre - but I seem to loose my connection to the hero as soon as he enters a dark hallway. I'd never do that, after all! And the monsters never frighten me when I can see them. Pyramid Head is a pushover.The movie ends abruptly and unnecessarily, and for that, a lot of people won't like it. But I enjoyed the ride. I Am Legend really delivers through the first half of the movie, where the build is immensely interesting and suspenseful. But the conflict and resolution just isn't scary or satisfying.PS: leave the children at home, please. CGI vampires are not for younglings (usually).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A study of  loss,"I rarely feel the need to share my feelings on a film with people outside of my circle of friends, however having seen 'I Am Legend' I now am compelled to. Having read the excellent source novel it would be easy to criticise the film for missing out some key points. The interpretation of the 'vampires', the explanation of the books/films title, etc. but to do so ignores the central performance in the film. Will Smith's examination of loneliness in an empty world is deeply moving. The subtle madness of a man desperate for company is portrayed in a way that is neither caricatured or unbelievable. The relationship between Neville and his dog is stronger than most films can generate between two human leads, and this relationship leads to a scene that I personally found heartbreaking. The trailer did not do justice to the film and I was expecting an empty, if enjoyable, apocalyptic movie. What you actually get is a thoughtful film with a very human heart.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Well made film, but un-original","When i first saw the trailer for ""I am Legend"", i was intrigued by the mysteriousness of the story. Although the beginning was rather slow-moving, it still made me watch quite intently, with light humour. However, the more i watched, the more it turned into another one of those monster movies...with a similar story-line of ""28 weeks later"" where humans turn into monsters with super-strength and kill other humans and the hero tries to save everyone, or run away.Although with the un-original movie story line, it does have a slower moving story than the other plain horrors and we really get to know and connect with the main character (Smith).But i'm still let down by this movie, as i did not know it was based on a book. So i guess i was just hoping for something special...but i was sadly mistaken...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"9 out of  10 movie, why?","OK to give you a very quick summary of the movie without giving away to much i will say this, It's a Post-apocalyptic movie, under the horror/action group, there is more action than horror, Starring Will Smithas DR. Neivell. He is an ex-military personal who is Luckilly also a scientist living in New York city. a lot happens (dont want to spoil it) then a couple years later it seems that he is the only ""human"" alive. along with his only companion a dog named Sue, he must race and find find a cure and survive, its post-apocalyptic war against the ""dark-seekers"". If you read the book, you ca leave it at home, because this movie takes a new twist on the story and i strongly believe is better than the other three adaptations, including the so very wrong blatant attempt to cash in using the I am Legend trend movie called ""I am Omega"" which sucked a lot LOL. Very good movie, powerful, emotional, realistic, action-packed, and very suspenseful. Execellent MOVIE! IMHO: it will scare you (as in make you jump), not as in the bloody zombie scary way, no, but as in it will startled you and surprise you way, lots of people screamed in my theater HAHAHAHAHA. people often like to criticize movies and nit-pick at then and if you do you make any movie look bad, people argue stupid things like, how can he drive the car if gasoline is only stable for 6 months and goes bad after that, Its completely stupid to argue that since its just a movie. But it still doesn't take away of how amazing its story line is, people will always say the book is batter than the adaptation, but i say the movies are just as good, the only reason people say the book is better is because the movie is usually not interpreted how they personally would interpreted thats all, over all its a very powerful movie, some people cried. And its a very realistic movie, its not some mutant zombie flick, the virus is a mutated variant of the measles that scientists made to fight cancer, talk about ironic. So its a "" this could happen"" kind of feeling through out the movie, which makes it so much more interesting. Overall i am 90% sure that you will absolutely LOVE this film or 10% you will like it, a lot. There is really not much wrong with it and definitely have you thinking about your mortality and morals. Will smith puts on an amazing show, his acting is superb! if you like i robot, MIB, or others, this movie is about 50 times better. other characters are not developed as much, but there is no need to, because the the main story is focused on the DR.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I am Will Smith,"I Am Legend is an adaptation of a novel with the same title, written by Richard Mathesen. However, the only similarities between the novel and the movie are the title and the basic story premise. Other than that, this movie is entirely different than the novel. So, in order to truly enjoy this movie, one has to grasp the idea that it has little to do with the novel, and to enjoy the movie without comparing between the two.Anyway, as long as one can grasp the concept of the movie not being like the novel, the movie is actually pretty good. Although at times it feels like a cross between ""Castaway"" and ""28 Days Later"", it is an engaging watch. This is due to the fact that it has some well-filmed action sequences, a few genuinely scary moments, and awesome acting from Will Smith (and his dog).Fans of Will Smith would be glad to know the movie is full of Will Smith-y goodness. In fact, his presence is so overwhelming that one reckons that instead of pretending it is an adaptation of I Am Legend, it should be called I Am Will Smith. Now that would have been some legend indeed.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Excellent Film,"This is an excellent horror film with chilling characterizations especially from Will Smith himself. Leading the cast and telling the story, Will Smith does an excellent job of taking us on a tour of a devastated New York destroyed by a vision of hope gone bad. The story unfolds in atypical fashion letting us glimpse in parts just how the problem with the 'mutants' manifested. We care about the plight of Dr. Robert Neville in his bid to save his family, his friends, and especially the human species itself. The media of film is one of legal hypnosis, and this film certainly takes advantage of some seriously lifelike visuals, both living and nonliving, in order to convey a sense of nature gone wrong at the hands of well meaning human beings.As a composition, Legend is a well put together orchestration of acting, setting, and direction that more than entertains the horror story buff. Legend is everything that a horror film is designed to be: nail biting entertainment done well. Typical horror films either fall short in terms of action, acting, story, or special effects/setting. An imbalance in any of these factors typically results in boredom. However the story of Legend Robert Neville is certainly filled to the core with excitement. Excellently done. :D GLEE.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Should of been called, Are you Serious?","Francis Lawrence, the director of Constantine brings us the futuristic, science-fiction thriller I Am Legend starring Academy Award nominee Will Smith. Smith plays Dr. Robert Neville, a scientist living in a dissolute New York City trying to develop the cure to the virus that wiped out the entire world population and left him immune.There isn't much that can be said about the picture rather than Will Smith gives his most brave portrayal to date and places him as one of the most talented actors working today. As the film will gain much comparisons to Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away starring Tom Hanks, this film holds no measure. As Neville tries to develop this cure by day, at night he must flee and hide from something dark and demented hiding in the shadows. These ""creatures"" are a little cheesy and even more corny as the special effects seem rushed and unrewarding.The first ¾ of the picture are engaging as we follow Smith around the jungle-like New York City and brought into flash backs of the end of days over three years ago. The ending is very sour in taste and unrealistic in actions. I have an imagination as much as the next person but some things just bother the viewer when we're watching an event unfold that seems witless.Consequently, it's Will Smith the is the revelation and fantastic to watch. He gives us range, humor, dramatic elements, and something to awe at. The storyline is interesting in concept but wrong choices are made in execution.

Great movie but...,"...there was far more potential to make use of.Short summary:A plague kills almost every human on earth only one man, as far as we know, has survived: Robert Neville. Some others had the ""luck"" to be transformed into some kind of vampires, the so-called ""Dark Seekers"". They are not able to act during the day because the sun would burn them alive. Robert Neville and his dog Sam are living in the deserted New York. Every day at midday he sends out a radio message. But nobody responds. His daily routine consists of hunting, talking to his dog or to dummies. Due to his immunity he tries to cure the Darkseekers but has not succeeded so far. Until that day the Darkseekers have been acting like animals and so no real brainpower however suddenly they seem to get organized and start hunting Robert down...Acting:There is a certain lack of actors due to the movies theme. Will Smith is acting brilliant. His performance is superb and I even liked him better than in ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". Remarkable is also the dog. Great how animals can ""perform"" nowadays;-)Special effects:Although some of my friend criticized the Darkseekers' presentation I was quite fond of it. It somehow reminded me of the mummy in ""The Mummy"".Summary:A great film although it had more potential.

will smith is brilliant!,"I was very taken with this movie, when it first started, i couldn't take my eyes off the screen! Smith's acting is brilliant in this movie and you cant help but feel for him. also Sam (the dog) is just as good and is (strangely) a real asset to the movie. The loneliness is so abundant in the movie, and you can see how this takes its toll on the 'Neville'. This film is possibly one of the most touching films I have seen in a long time, and is original in comparison to other zombie genre films.Unfortunately, as we begin to get nearer to the end of the movie, I was let down. Important aspects of the film seemed to be ignored, and i found myself getting frustrated about how these weren't explained fully. If you are going to watch a 'gore fest' I don't think this is really your thing - it is a much more emotional style of horror. Shame about the zombies in it also, as they are incredibly poorly done - terribly fake loloh and on a last note - any real fans of will smith will be pleasantly surprised in the early moments of the film as we see him work out and get all hot and sweaty lol *drool*",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A movie that didn't fulfill my expectations,"It was a good movie, it has very good action, the suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat. It has a lot of similarities with 28 Days Later. The effects are good but the cgi for the infected was a little poor, I mean why do all of them have the same appearance. The story about a man who supposedly is the only survivor of a deadly virus that left a deserted New York City, tries to find a cure for those who survived and are infected and transformed to a strange kind of zombies, is good and interesting, although it left me some doubts. Will Smith's performance is very good, he has a lot of mood changes, he can be funny one moment and immediately he turns serious and then he turns sad, he is a very versatile actor. To conclude, it is enjoyable and entertaining. This movie has everything to become a blockbuster although it isn't the greatest movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Strange Adaptation,"Will Smith plays a scientist who appears to be the sole survivor man-made plague that turned the vast bulk of humanity into vicious, inhuman zombies in this strange adaptation of the novel by Richard Matheson. I say strange adaptation because, although it retains some of the original storyline, it is a mirror opposite of the themes of the book. The book was a dark meditation on a rational man left alone to battle a world of vampires. Being unwilling to accept a supernatural explanation for the events, he slowly finds the rational explanation and comes to the realization that he could one day be the source of another legend himself. In this film, Will Smith must abandon his rational worldview and accept the supernatural. Perhaps the filmmakers thought the mass audience wouldn't accept a film with the original viewpoint, but if that were true, why bother making the film at all?Still, Will Smith gave a great performance, and the film had enough thrills for a summer blockbuster. There is simply nothing in this film with the power that novel ends with when Neville says ""I Am Legend.""The Vincent Price version was the closest to the novel. The Charlton Heston version displayed the most campy fun. This version isn't bad. It just isn't the novel.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An isolated thriller,"Being a huge Will Smith fan (Fresh Prince, Ali) I was really looking forward to this film. Smith stars as Robert Neville, a scientist who is the last man left alive in New York City after a virus wipes out human life, leaving horrible creatures to roam around in the dark.Will Smith is wildly known for his roles in action films such as Independence Day, Bad Boys 1 and 2. Here however he is challenging a new genre in this scary horror film. I'm personally not a huge fan of horror films but I enjoyed this particular one because mainly of Smith, the direction and the plot.Smith is on top form as the central protagonist Neville, who is a very quiet soul, who lives his life on the edge every day with his dog Sam, trying to find a way out of the city. He is well suited for the role, occasionally throwing in the odd joke now and then, (watch for the Shrek scene), and an interesting look on Neville's character.The direction is marvellous. As Neville is the last person alive, Lawrence creates a wonderful atmosphere to portray this with heavy use of long shots and the dialogue with Sam the dog create sadness and wonder of life alone.The plot is well written, giving us a brief introduction of how Neville came to be the last alive to slowly engaging the audience into how Neville goes about staying alive. As the film progresses, we are given flashbacks to understand what happened on the night it all changed for Neville, a heart warming story in itself. I found the use of flashbacks very dramatic and portrayed the loneliness of the character.It's scary with the creatures of darkness very quiet at the beginning but being more threatening during the latter parts.As good as the film is I couldn't help but make comparisons with Danny Boyle's 28 days later. That film has the same ideology of a virus escaping and taking over human life.Both films are equally as good. I Am Legend perhaps has a bit more character in but both are scary and are must watches for any horror film fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"First two acts great, the third OK, and the very end a disaster","It was definitely different than I expected. I AM LEGEND is the story about Colonel Robert Neville living in a post-apocalyptic NYC that has been cleared of humanity everywhere, all over the globe. He spends his days hunting food and gathering supplies with his only family, his beloved dog Sam. He tries making contact with any survivors at noon. At night, though, he locks himself up and listens as the vampires overrun the city.However, the movie is not about the vampires. The movie is really about Robert Neville, a man desperately hoping for contact with the outside world. Its about his character, the way he copes with everyday, and his strong-willed mission to find a cure for the vampires. But things aren't so easy for Neville; accidents happen, and Robert Neville does encounter them on several occasions, and these encounters are rather intense.A common criticism of the movie is the look of the vampires. I'll admit, they aren't scary and don't have the best special effects, but the main focus with them is suspense and surprise, which is done really good. Although the surprise is a little overdone; the movie is filled with pop-up moments, which to me, is not real suspense. I don't mind an occasional pop-up, but there are many in this film. However, these are my only complaints for the first and second act, and these are minor. My main problem is the third act.The third act is where it really strays from the book (I never read the book but already know the ending). The third act includes a lot more humor (which is funny, but a bit out of place), less humanization, and a showdown that isn't very climatic. It culminates in disappointment, and suddenly ends. The entire resolution is done in a 30-second voice over, and this movie deserved a much better ending. It feels like its not supposed to be over yet, and my friend and I both agreed that it was like we were just watching the movie and someone pulled the plug and says ""Ok, the movie is over. Bye."" It was extremely disappointing. I didn't even know it was going to end until the voice over came.This movie could've been great had the third act stuck to the book (I like the book's ending better), and the ending wouldn't have disappointed. Will Smith does a great job of adding elements of sadness where it is needed and really fleshes out the character, Robert Neville. I even have to say the dog was great; it seemed human because it was really the only other character, and I like their interpretation of Sam rather than the books. But that doesn't excuse the decaying third act. 7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Smith is Legend,"The curiously titled I am Legend is a surprising breath of fresh air in an otherwise bland lineup of recent, similar titles. This is down to both the excellent performance from Smith and also the genuinely atmospheric post apocalyptic setting.Expanding on that, Smith really shines as Dr. Robert Neville, portraying a man pushed to the brink of insanity with just the right amount of Smith's trademark humour. Witnessing the good Doctors' day to day life, with his only living companion a dog named Sam, in the empty streets of New York is one of the films greatest highlights.In its opening scenes Legend is reminiscent of 28 Days Later and Cast Away, although there is some real doses of claustrophobic terror as Smith comes closer to the ghouls lurking in the shadows, and at points could be likened to the original Alien. However, the film does perhaps lose an element of this genuinely intense atmosphere as the ghastly 'Dark Seekers' are revealed in all their polygonal glory. As is the case in most scary flicks, the 'monster' is always most effective when you never quite see it.This is a minor gripe, however I feel the main drawback of Legend is that it is quite frankly, too short! I can only assume that the reason for this movie just about reaching the 100 mins mark is due to doubts that a movie containing primarily one human character wouldn't captivate a modern audience for very long. However, after viewing Legend, you will probably find yourself wanting more of Dr. Neville, even if he is alone.We can only hope that there will perhaps be an extended edition released on DVD giving the film the screen time it deserves, but for now, Legend is definitely worth seeing on the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Will Smith in yet another sci-fi....,"Independence Day, MIB, I Robot..... and now it is I Am Legend. Will Smith's love for sci-fi continues. And does it disappoint? Nope, it doesn't. The movie starts off slowly showing a totally deserted New York City, apart from the wild animals and the lone human being, Will Smith as Dr. Neville. The initial part of the movie tries to convey to the viewer the strangeness on being the last man alive on earth. Will Smith has the entire onus on him of keeping the viewers engrossed as he is not sharing the screen with anyone else. He tries to depict the fight his character goes through in order to maintain his sanity in the lonely world. The pace of the movie is slow in the beginning but then it starts building up and the second half of the movie has more action and thrill in it. The movie gets more gripping as the mutated beings are introduced and events start unfolding that will help Smith to find the cure to stop all this.Will Smith is cool throughout the movie, be it the lonely scenes which are more emotional or the action-packed gun-slinging ones. The dog Samantha gives good company to Smith. The other characters have small bits and they fit well. The movie lacks at times in building up the intensity to the appropriate levels. There are not enough scenes where the viewer has his heart in his mouth. The special effects are great though (they usually always are).Overall, a fun film.... and a definite watch if you love Will Smith's work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The whole aspect of the virus thang was real to me as we all know they mutate. I took my son and he thought it was great as well.

a bit conventional but with extraordinary visuals,"Robert Neville is almost literally the last man left on Earth. Through some bizarre trick of fate, he's one of only a handful of people with a natural immunity to a virus that, in less than three years time, has denuded the world of most of its human population. Now, Neville, a renowned virologist himself, spends his days cruising the streets of a deserted Manhattan, and his nights hiding out from the infected cannibalistic mutants who venture forth only after dark (shades of ""The Time Machine,"" ""Night of the Living Dead"" and dozens of other similar films).""I Am Legend"" is just the latest film version of the 1954 Richard Matheson novel that also served as the basis for 1971's ""The Omega Man,"" with Charlton Heston in the lead role. Despite its occasional feeling of over-familiarity, ""I Am Legend,"" is a generally more subtle and thoughtful work than the average sci-fi film, one that, in addition to its more conventional action sequences and flesh-eating monsters, explores themes like survivors' guilt and the effect of prolonged isolation on the human psyche. The movie, however, is clearly most notable for its remarkably convincing vision of a desolate, post-apocalyptic New York City, where weeds grow promiscuously through holes in the pavement and uninhabited buildings and idle cars serve as ghostly reminders of a civilization now gone from the scene (though one questions whether the place would really look quite this shoddy a mere three years after its abandonment). Kudos to director Francis Lawrence and his crack team of visual and special effects artists for so successfully bringing this concept to life on screen. For the most part, the thrills are nicely balanced with moments of tender sentiment, as Neville reflects back on the time he had with his late wife and daughter.In a role reminiscent of Tom Hanks' in ""Cast Away,"" Will Smith, largely bereft of any human companionship, spends most of the movie talking either to himself or to Sam, his loyal German Shepherd. In this setup, Smith once again demonstrates that he is definitely a commanding presence on screen, keeping us interested even in those moments when not much is actually happening in the story. For, there is, admittedly, a trifle more downtime in the movie than many of the more hardcore action fans would probably like. That objection aside, however, ""I Am Legend"" provides enough food for thought and a sufficient number of jump-out-of-your-seat thrills to make it worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Smith holds the film together almost single-handedly,"In his sophomore offering, director Francis Lawrence (who debuted with 2005's Constantine) successfully turns Richard Matheson's half-century old sci-fi/horror novel into an enjoyable, truly memorable motion picture. Previously twice undertaken (once in 1964 and again in 1971), and both times ineffectively, Matheson's 1954 classic, I Am Legend, proved to be more than a difficult project. Though I'm sure it was no easier this time around (Warner Bros. has been working on this film for 13 years), Lawrence and his superstar, Will Smith, make strong efforts to hide it.Smith plays the lead to Matheson's story (a role formerly played by Vincent Price in '64's The Last Man on Earth and Charles Laughton in '71's The Omega Man), a scientist named Robert Neville, perhaps the last human on earth, who roams the desolation that is New York City with his German shepherd three years following the apocalyptic release of a man-made virus.After losing his family (which includes Smith's real-life daughter, Willow) to the hellish pandemic, Neville sets forth, resilient to find the curehe combines the knowledge and state of his ""immunity"" with slab-top experiments he conducts on its mutated victims. Nevertheless, he's a man tortured by the absence of human life, which is brought to the forefront of his psyche by horrible flashbacks (which are beyond disturbing in their plausibility and wrenching in their effect), and recollections of it. And as the film progresses, we watch as the man's burden takes its toll on him, gradually dragging him into madnessa show that is as saddening as it is well done.Set in a not-so-distant future world, in which gas prices are nearly $7 per gallon and the ""cure for cancer"" is actually the culprit of the widespread sickness, the film opens with Neville ripping through the Big Apple's vacant streets in his red, white-striped Shelby GT 500, circa 2007, hunting a flock of deer. Subsequently, we learn his strict daily routineexercise, recreation, research, and sleepwhich he maintains for the sake of his sanity and survival.But what would the last man in the world have to survive from? How about unremitting hordes of veiny, hairless mutantsthe products of the virus that decimated the world's population? Understandably, these villains make for the movie's weakest contribution. They feed into prominent horror-movie zombie clichés (super-human speed and strength) and exhibit abysmal CGI, while thrusting the film into action that undermines its initial intelligence.But I Am Legend endures its dreadful flaws by staying closer to the original novel than any other cinematic version, by creating an incredible, eerie scene of desertion in the U.S.'s most lively mega-city (perfectly done with grassy, weed-plagued corners and streams of abandoned vehicles), and by casting the inimitable Will Smith to play its focused study Smith delivers an achingly good performance as the lone man, capturing our favor by allowing us into his predicament through delicate expressions of his own fear and yearning for human life. He probably won't be nominated for an Oscar for his role as Neville, but maybe he should. After all, Tom Hanks was for his part in Cast Away, and the only difference between Hanks' Chuck Nolan and Smith's Robert Neville is that Neville is considerably smarter and defies insanity with proactive rituals and physical conditioning (of course, it's to Neville's benefit that he, unlike Nolan, has an abundance of food and spends all of his time with a wonderful pooch, rather than a volleyball). Regardless, Smith does what few actors can: he holds the film together almost single-handedly and manages to keep viewers' attention for close to two hours.The fact that I Am Legend swings back and forth between two genres is ultimately an advantageous trait, for, though the sci-fi portion is far better, the horror facets instill enough suspense and distribute enough scares to affirm Lawrence's film as one of good quality and massive entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Will Smith does it!,"Many have tried to play the role, and many have failed - but not Will Smith as he plays Robert Neville, an immune American Solder and the last person in the world.Emma Thompson, though uncredited for her role plays a doctor who find the cure for cancer, but like every medicine it has a side affect. When affected, all humans lose their human instincts, soon acting like vicious animals who travel in colonies and kill for survival. Robert Neville, alongside his companion German Sheppard Sam have to hunt during the day to live, and hide during the nights to not die.This movie would be nothing without Will Smith, probably one of the best actors who finds the best roles throughout the past few years. The first 3/4 of the movie is a one man show, somewhat like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, but instead of talking to a volleyball, Robert Neville sets up mannequins and talks to them to keep the little sanity he has left. Will Smith is stunning in this movie - there are about three scenes which I can recall where he put on such a miraculous performance.I didn't think this was possible, but the last 1/4 of the movie where it wasn't all of Will Smith's show anymore actually ruined the mood of film. I did appreciate the ending though, which revealed to us the reasoning for the title of the movie and that gave me shivers down my spine.Throughout the movie, there were stunning flashbacks of Robert Neville's life before the entire population was wiped out. It revealed his wife and daughter, who was actually Will Smith's daughter in real life. In the Pursuit of Happiness, it was his real son who starred alongside him, and now it's his daughter.Overall, the movie lacked some CGI (you could easily tell that the infected were poorly created), and although the ending ruined the mood, Will Smith's performance made this movie a piece of artwork, and I would recommend everyone to see it. There was no swearing or blood, so the younger audience who loves a good scare would enjoy this movie.I would definitely recommend, for those who enjoyed this movie to see the four-part mini series by Stephen King ""The Stand"" - http://imdb.com/title/tt0108941/ 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Great acting,"Will Smith is superb in this film, his acting skills really excel. I must say, I wasn't expecting such a tear-jerking drama with this film, I thought it would be much more action orientated, but thrill seekers will be disappointed with this film if thats all they have come for.The basic story is that of Smith being the last man on earth, as a result of a deadly virus, along with his dog Sam. Smith is striving to find a cure for this, and along the way encounters emotional events. Though I say this is very much a drama, it still contains hints of humour, action and sometimes jumpy moments.Overall a well above average film, and if superb acting is what you look for in a film then you must see this, and if it isn't, then still go to watch it the emotional story involves the viewer and engrosses them in the film.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
One of Will Smith's Best Performances Ever!!!!,"This film is one remarkable masterpiece if you ask me. Dramatic, visionary, yet delivering comedy at the right moments, ""I am Legend"" presents one of Will Smith's best performances yet. The story is solid and never fails to keep our attention to say the least. The total highlight of the film in my opinion would definitely be the empty Manhattan, which in itself will send chills down one's spine. Francis Lawerence brought this concept to life just the way it should've been. Will Smith really out does himself here. The emotion he puts into his performance is astounding and he portrays the last man on earth perfectly. I myself was actually brought to tears when I first saw this film in theaters. And trust me that's a rare thing for me! The way the action is shot makes the whole movie feel more realistic in a way and the terror is unrelenting. And with a tragic and well done score by master composer James Newton Howard, this ""I am Legend"" is one of my favorite films of 2007.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Riveting Science-Fiction at its finest as only Will Smith delivers and executes brilliantly,"Military virologist Robert Neville(Will Smith) is alone,somewhere on the edge of sanity,patrolling barren New York City streets in a battered SUV,with his steadfast German shepherd,Sam. No pedestrians bustle along Fifth Avenue.,in Times Square,or Chinatown. Yellow taxis sit idle,bumper-to-bumper,with no passengers and no place to go. Grass grows up through the pavement as nature exerts its revenge. Deer herds run wild. Demons lurk in the shadows. It's not a dream. It's a nightmare,a living nightmare. The frightening picture of a world gone astray is very realistic as it gets.Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the aftermath of a plague and desperate isolation has inspired earlier films,including ""The Last Man On Earth""(Vincent Price,1964),and ""The Omega Man""(Charlton Heston,1971). Screenwriter Mark Protosevich,who developed this script with writer/producer Akiva Goldsman(Academy Award winner for ""A Beautiful Mind"");Will Smith along with producer James Lassiter(who was behind Will Smith's Oscar nominated film ""The Pursuit of Happiness"");and director Francis Lawrence(""Constantine"")saw this adaptation as a contemporary science-fiction allegory. The year the story is set is in 2012,three years after a manmade,retrofitted virus has run amok. Neville follows his daily routine. He's cordial and keeps conversations with unknowns(such as talking to mannequins)light;it helps him retain some semblance of normalcy. He sends out an S.O.S over the airwaves,""If there is anybody out there,anybody. Please You are not alone."" For means of survival,he patrols Gotham hunting deer and chasing images. As the night falls,he and Sam hunker down in a brownstone near Washington Square. Neville bars the doors and shutters the windows. He curls up in the bathtub in a fetal position with Sam and a submachine gun. Terrified. Things scream outside:the living dead,mutant victims of the plague,dark feeders led by a vicious alpha male(Dash Mihok).Although post-apocalypse films aren't new(""Planet of the Apes"",""Mad Max"",""The Road Warrior"",""28 Days Later"",""Vanilla Sky""),most feature several protagonists. Neville,however,is bereft of any human contact. Haunted by the past,the mass evaculation of New York City,and the loss of his wife(Salli Richardson),and child(Willow Smith),he reasons that he must find a cure for the mutants' misery. The setting of Manhattan has rarely felt so desolute. It's isolated and abandoned. It's dreadful and very terrifying. Danger is around the corner never knowing what Neville would expect toward the unexpected. Never knowing what is over your shoulder. Then from the moment when the dark feeders appear,Robert knows he has to fight for his life,even if it means survival of the fittest. The stark skyscraper ghost town sets an eerie tone. Uncanny special effects and the sound team's fearsome,growling mutant canines,zombie wails,and thunderous deer stampedes augment their efforts. These technical strengths mitigate the film's transgressions. By all rights,""I Am Legend"",is stunning entertainment. And it may win that distinction,but not without some flaws. Everything goes right for the first 45 minutes,then over-ambitious plotting,slow pacing and melodrama,it lets the viewer hungry for more quick-tempo action sequences and concise character studies,since overall Will Smith himself,is carrying the balance of the picture. Yet,just about anything goes in a Will Smith movie,and here Smith's performance is magnetic. He digs emotional depths and exhibits a spellbinding aura while sharing screen time with only a dog and menacing shadows. This is riveting science fiction at its finest,with a philosophical concept cloaked in a new age of a world gone astray and a man facing sheer terror at every turn.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Worthy sucessor to previous versions,"Any film which holds nice Emma Thompson (here playing a 'Dr Crippen', crime buffs please note) responsible for the death of 5 billion people can't be all bad - and I AM LEGEND, fourth version of the famous work by Richard Matheson, is almost all good. Despite those who harp on about the changes from the source novel and the undeniable weaknesses in the CGI department LEGEND, like Smith's earlier I ROBOT, proves an above average, pleasurable surprise. Smith plays Robert Neville, ostensibly the last man on earth, fighting the zombies of the dark while struggling to isolate an antidote to a virus which has destroyed humanity. Swopping THE OMEGA MAN's over talkative, white haired soul brother brethren who menace Charlton Heston for more fearsome, inarticulate brutes is a real improvement, while Smith's sensitive portrayal of Neville brings to the surface a humanity and sadness streets away from Heston's chess playing, machine-gunning white autocrat.In one scene Smith tearfully asks a shop mannequin to talk back to him. To his credit the actor walks away from this moment with his dramatic integrity intact, and introduces a pathos missing from the franchise before. Whether or not one sees the enhanced Christian subtext as successful or not will be a matter or taste (I gave it the benefit of the doubt), but the film retains the central irony of an atheistic hero proving the salvation on mankind. In any case it is no more subtle - and arguably less blasphemous, should one care - than Heston's carefully staged 'crucifixion' death scene in OMEGA.Interestingly the new script has Neville refer to his perilous existence as ""ground zero"" - a phrase particularly pregnant in the context of mass death, aptly recalling the apocalyptic mood of 9/11. Like the contemporary American mood, Neville too thinks he can ""fix it"" (i.e. put the status quo back together again) a view reinforced by the final image of LEGEND: a fortress community, a ideally harmonious USA in miniature perhaps, and one presumably besieged by hostile attackers.Criticism of LEGEND has largely been levelled at the last third which has been taken as inferior to the first two - an opinion no doubt started by the American market which saw a feel-good ending. For the UK DVD release this has been replaced by something more downbeat and is more powerful even if there is a sensation of rush in the wrap up. The most memorable parts of the film remain those which evolve around the lonely Neville in a deserted city, which is convincingly realised.Smith's portrayal of a haunted hero, broken by the death of his dog, is a fine one, and lifts the film well above average. It's a sign of the changing cultural times that Neville's solitary trip and mouthing of the words from the anti-establishment WOODSTOCK in THE OMEGA MAN is here replaced by an equivalent moment before the family-friendly SHREK, enjoyed amongst sympathetic company at that, an altogether less powerful moment. And if perhaps the closing 20 minutes do seem a little breathless, then this is a minor miscalculation in a genre piece which I think will bear revisiting",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Really nice, still could be better...","I really liked this movie. I have to admit I wasn't expecting too much coming from Francis Lawrence due to his prior Constantine, but he surprised me in a good way with this 'I Am Legend'. Although a reminisce to Cast Away is impossible to avoid, this movie has its own excuses to twist even a bit more the 'one man in no man's land' context. And it does it pretty good, at least 3/4 of the movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not that the ending is poor or that it can be foreseen, but when 'I Am Legend' is finishing (and you feel when it's doing it) you have that annoying thing in your head that tells you ""I would have liked a bit more"". The idea of the movie and the way it's developed along the filming is close to superb, but suddenly it goes down abruptly enough to actually avoid the ""Classic"" category that it should have deserved otherwise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
i would rather lick a leper babies ass than watch this movie,"This mobie sucks so much, however, there is ONE thing that I greatly appreciated.This movie showed that black people would never have the proper genes to survive as zombie vampires. I like how all the zombie vampires were white muscular alpha males.However I think this movie is about how we should not look for cures of cancer, because that is how the zombie outbreak started is because will smith tried to cure cancer and he messed up and created white zombies running around NYC and he has to kill them all or cure their whiteness.This movie is also kind of like a allegory for the future race war that will happen in NYC it's a movie created by the weinstein jews and the illuminatti.Its a shame that will smith took part in a illuminatti movie when his other movie I robot is a movie about going against the illuminatti.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Will Smith saves the world,"Will Smith and the special effects are the two main reasons for watching I Am Legend. It might also help to be a fan of Bob Marley. This is another adaptation of sci-fi and ""Twilight Zone"" writer Richard Mathieson's 1954 novel of the same name. There have been two previous film variations, with Vincent Price ('64) and Charlton Heston ('71). The basic story is about a military scientist who believes himself to be the last surviving healthy human after a virus has depopulated the planet leaving only (in this version) hordes of raging nocturnal mutants. Neville (this time Smith) has injected himself with an experimental vaccine that makes him immune. He's still trying to find one that will work on others and cure the infected. He insists (this time) on remaining at what he calls ""Ground Zero""Manhattanto do his work.The movie has done well with some NYC film critics. Apparently they like seeing a post-apocalyptic version of their home town free, if at a horrible cost, of tourists or holiday crowds.Speaking of costs, Lawrence's movie has gotten another kind of injection: lots of money, $200 million, by reports. Money does not bring sophistication and indeed may banish it. But it means the filmmakers can afford Smith, a charismatic movie star who makes a convincing superhero. Already extremely buff in I, Robot (which this role somewhat reprises), Smith's now not only in even better physical shape (we see him working out, with his trusty female German Shepherd, Sam), but also a mercurial actor, able to register every conceivable human emotion. Unfortunately for most of the two hours he has nobody to share his emotions with but Sam.The most notable ones are desperation, loneliness, and despair. This is, as has been pointed out, not only the most expensive Rin Tin Tin movie of all time, but also a vision of the ultimate urban alienation. I Am Legend is at its strongest when it evokes the sadness of a world without people in it. Other than Sam, Neville has nobody to talk to but manikins he seems to have arranged himself in a video shop, and at home nobody to watch but Shrek and old recordings of TV news shows before disaster struck, some time around Christmas. It's not easy being the last man in New York. Occasionally Neville sees flashbacks of the departure of his wife and son during a tumultuous and unsuccessful evacuation that recalls both Spielberg's War of the Worlds and Cuaron's Children of Men. Then he knows he is alone. Roaring about the city in a Mustang 5000 feebly trying to shoot wild deer (which he's surprisingly inept at), talking to Sam, and doing his workouts are not distractions for long from the angst of isolation. For us, it's fun looking at the CGI images of a deserted Manhattan that is already, after three years, overgrown with weeds and overrun with deer being preyed upon by lions.This high-budget Neville lives appropriately, in a big house on Washington Square fitted with heavy steel doors to shut him in at night, when the infected ones, who're light sensitive like vampires, go on the rampage. In the basement is a full laboratory where he pursues his research on animals and captured infected humans, recording his findings in streaming video. The bridges may have split in two, but he's still got power. He also has an AM radio message on all stations setting up a meeting with any healthy survivors down by the docks at noon every day. Like the father and son in Cormac McCarthy's The Road, he sometimes breaks fearfully into houses to scavenge canned goods and other preserved eatables.In Mathieson's Cold War era novel, it was biological warfare between Russian and China that depopulated the planet; this time it's the fault of science. Three years ago a doctor (Emma Thompson) engineered a virus capable of preventing cancer. Unfortunately it horribly mutated, turning the the inoculated into raging vampire killers. The resulting creatures are bald hyper-muscled creatures very like the infected of 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later only more expensive, though they lack variety, since 90% of them look like Woody Harrelson on steroids.Perhaps as a carryover from the book, Neville has an uneasy hold on his sanity, and despite his air of logic in the lab (and his denial of the existence of Godthough he fervently believes in the humanism of Bob Marley) he can occasionally lose it, fly into a rage, and do really stupid things. Handling a dire situation unwisely, he gets himself injured and brings grief to Sam. Despairing later, he randomly attacks a pack of the infected, apparently welcoming death at their hands (or teeth). And then somehow he's rescued by a mother and her young son, Anna (Alice Braga of City of God) and Ethan (Charlie Tahan). By then the movie is past its prime and the finale is neither convincing nor satisfying, and visions of half a dozen other zombie/vampire sci-fi movies, all of them made on a lower budget with more interesting results, are left dancing in our headsas well as some other big budget ones that weren't any better than this momentarily exciting and energetic, but not imaginatively very stimulating effort.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
The last man on earth is not alone,"Robert Neville is a brilliant scientist, but even he could not contain the terrible virus that was unstoppable, incurable, and man-made. Somehow immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City and maybe the world. But he is not alone. Mutant victims of the plague lurk in the shadows. Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But he knows he is outnumbered...and quickly running out of time.With its very high budget and an all star actor, this film manages to be unlike any other apocalyptic film you've ever seen. Yes, there's New York. Yes, people are killed. Yes, the future looks depressing. No, there aren't many action scenes. No, there isn't blood, gore, and violence.This is The Host of 2007...well, The host was released in 2007, so it's like The Host. Why? There is a great performance in this film: The actor is Will Smith, obviously. Yet, this film is underwhelming. It's different because there are so few action scenes and too much slow moments in the film (of course, with one person in the majority of the film).In The Host, you expect a monster movie, yet most of it is filled with character development and not enough monster attacking, which makes it underwhelming. In this film, you expect more zombie violence, yet there's only like three scenes of that in the whole film, which makes this film underwhelming. Is that a good thing? Sure, but we need more action.Now, I may sound like an idiot by saying more action will make this film good, but no. I just thought it would've been more interesting if there were a few more zombie violence and less quietness. Still, I can't help the fact that this film manages to be disturbing and eerie with the limited scenes of zombies.This is not your usual big budget movie. Yes, it has explosions (many, in fact) and some action sequences but not enough to satisfy an audience looking for something to happen. Still, Will Smith is great and the silence in the movie will get deadly. Overall, this is an underwhelming yet satisfying film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"No 28 Days Later, but much better than Omega Man.","Of course, that's not saying a whole lot. Low as the bar was, Will Smith's version raises it with ease, with better acting and much better production design. (Always helpful when the deserted city is at least as important a character as the protagonist.)I was impressed by how quick and morose the hordes of the infected are. Though they look a bit digital, I still say they're much more effective than so many idiots in white makeup and sunglasses.This movie was surprisingly well-paced. They took great pains to establish a tangible eerie stillness, which in turn set the audience up nicely for the inevitable outbursts of activity.I was pleased to see the climax didn't spoil the tone of the movie. And yet, the overall package was only moderately convincing. The narrative lies somewhere between empty calories and world-class fiction. Since I'm a sucker for all things post-apocalyptic, I'm glad I checked this title out. If not the creme de la creme, it certainly could have been much worse.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Kibbles and Vampire Bits,"I Am Legend marks the third kick at the film can for Richard Matheson's 1954 novel about the lone survivor of a global pandemic that has transformed humanity into a horde of blood hungry vampires.Originally brought to the screen in 1964 under the title The Last Man on Earth, with Vincent Price in the lead role, the movie was re-made in 1971 as The Omega Man with Charlton Heston, and now gets another pass as a starring vehicle for Will Smith.While none of the versions actually get Matheson's apocalyptic fable right, this latest incarnation is probably the best of the bunch, the result in large part to some impressive and atmospheric CGI, decent acting on the part of Smith, and a German Shepard that practically steals the movie.Directed by relative newcomer Francis Lawrence, whose only significant prior helming credits include the tepid Keanu Reeves demon flick Constantine and a series of Britney Spears and J-Lo videos, Legend manages to ramp up the cringe factor by turning every darkened building, corridor and stairwell into places of unspeakable dread, for while daylight manages to hold the vampirish mutants at bay, there's nothing stopping them from holding court in dark corners.Set three years after the genetic manipulation of the measles virus into a cure for cancer has run amok  the virus itself mutating in horrific and unforeseen ways  Smith's Robert Neville, a top flight military scientist, remains alone at ""ground zero"", barricaded in a fortified home complete with basement laboratory from which he wiles away his days conducting experiments on rats and captured human mutants in a desperate attempt to find a cure. His only companion in this lonely existence is a dog named Samantha whom he leans on to hold isolation-induced insanity in check.While increasingly the efforts of computer generated effects are poured into the realization of unworldly creatures and spectacular explosions  of which Legend has its share  it's in the transformation of Manhattan into a moonscape of abandoned vehicles and buildings, slowly succumbing to reclamation by nature, that the computer wizards behind this film really deserve credit.As tales of the apocalypse go, Legend falls short of filling the ample shoes of such previous entries such as 28 Days Later and even the 2004 re-visioning of Dawn of the Dead, but its capable packaging of creepy dread, coupled with a great performance by Smith as a lonely man struggling to be the lone voice of humanity, all topped off by more than capable effects make this a popcorn film not to be missed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
grown-up movie,"It appears that in the last few years, Will Smith has grown up. It's done wonders for his acting. There are a few moments of levity in I Am Legend, but nothing like the non-stop stream of bad jokes that helped make Independence Day so atrocious. Mr. Smith has learned to bring gravity and vulnerability to a role when it is required. He expresses several states of mind here with skill.But I think big-budget action/science-fiction movies have grown up too. After all, Will didn't write his own quips in his previous blockbuster movies, and his directors likely encouraged him to ham it up. The nineties are rife with movies that don't respect their audience's intelligence. The Fifth Element, Alien Resurrection, The Rock, and Armageddon are a few others which spring to mind, movies that undercut their own suspense by drowning it with idiotic jokes.Anyway, this movie is an example of the darker breed of sci-fi film that has emerged since. Most of humanity has been wiped out. All that seems to be left is Will Smith, and some scary humanoid creatures. The post-apocalyptic world is vividly realized (there are weeds growing through cracks in the middle of downtown New York streets), and it truly feels like Smith is the last man on Earth. The scenes of suspense are intense. If you enjoy science fiction tinged with horror, I recommend this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Surprisingly Good movie and unique (possible spoilers),"I enjoyed ""I am Legend"" for the fact it rises above many other zombie type films of its genre. Will Smith does an excellent job in his portrayal of the possibility of being the last man on earth. You do feel his loneliness; his isolation and his incredible bond to the only organic companion left with him. It was refreshing to see a movie that highlighted faith in a positive manner. You see characters praying and Christian symbolism. It was happy to see a ""Anna"" who claimed she heard from God, and was NOT portrayed as psychopath, but someone who DID actually hear from God and believed in his plan and purpose. The movies apocalyptic views of New York are something to watch and are a scary view of what would be if something devastating happened to our city. In the end there are clear redemptive qualities for the character and the story. I would recommend this film on many levels and appreciated it lack of excessive profanity and no nudity or sex scenes as well as a good story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Good Remake of The Omega Man 1971,"I enjoyed it knowing that I don't have to spec to much from a Will Smith movie.

The portray of a devastated, abandoned and empty NY is very good.Why does Will Smith have to work out every morning in all of his movies? To show his perfect Hollywood buddy perhaps... Anyway the movie is enjoyable if you don't spec to much and just want to distract yourself for while.There is not need to waste time and compare Charlton Heston with Will Smith.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Lawrence comes close to creating something totally different...it's just the ending,"Lawrence, considering I had never heard of him before, pulls together the best of the Omega Man and such related movies. Truly, the movie starts off being possibly the best movie of the season. The CGI effects are wonderful in terms of the New York that is beautiful in its lonely state, yet scary and haunting at the same time. Also, Will Smith is wonderful, especially the acting he makes to show the affection between the dog and him. But as the movie drifts further into its story, Lawrence made a decision crucial to this films outcome....the monsters. The monsters are actually not as big apart of this film as they seem, and while they are the cause of this deserted New York, they don't have much importance, until Lawrence brings them on to the screen in CGI form. Nothing is wrong with CGI, and they tried hard, but with such a real seeming situation (considering), the monsters should not have been in full form at all. Rather, like I believe Omega Man, or maybe another related film, they didn't show the faces much, just blue eyes, bony and cold hands. These other monsters add well to the suspense feel and opens up room for the viewer's interpretation of what the beast is really like. BOTTOM LINE: Lawrence almost reaches a turning point in suspense movies with his quiet and well created beginning, but the monsters being CGI ruined much of the effect that this film could have had on its viewers. Go see it, it's good, but not legendary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The movie was original for once, although it is not hard to anticipate what is to happen next once you first figure out what is going on, it keeps you guessing and watching with full attention and alertness; the way a movie should be.I credit Will Smith for being so excellent with his acting skills and abilities, and his ability to make the audience feel how he is, specifically in the emotional parts. He is an amazing actor and i don't think anyone else could have fit this part as well as he did. I also credit the producer/director/etc with all of their imagination and originality in making this film, it truly was a movie i needed to see, i have not been that entertained and enjoyed a movie like this in a very long time, i recommend it to everyone and believe it is an excellent movie not only for entertainment, but to keep people aware of possibilities that no one expects, for one day something such as the plot in this movie is bound to occur, in one way or another.I Am Legend - i thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Convincing acting!,"This was a particularly relatable film considering the current state of the world, the world's downfall to a virus is an interesting 'if', which feels ever more possible considering recent history.The film made a good representation of the effect of loneliness and desperation on the human mind and spirit, the inability to tell what's real from fake, quickness to anger, and the desire for human interaction being key themes in this film.It stressed me that the ending left the story incomplete (in respect to the world affairs), but it was Neville's story and the constant loss in this movie showcased how life isn't easy, it's a struggle and to be alive means to have struggle.The fact that the virus is manmade, could be interpreted to warn about the power of humankind and our collective responsibility to be ethical and careful with our great intellect. It could also be interpreted to show the destructive power of nature when it is distorted and messed with.All in all, it was a great film, very poignant, and felt like a unique viewing given the world today!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Honestly a really really good movie.,"Will Smith proves yet again why he is one of the most popular actors working in Hollywood today, his role as Robert Nevile is brilliantly played, he hits every emotion spot on and when the character loses his grip Smith never goes to far, no overacting here the man is just plain likable throughout. His co-star for the main length of the movie is a German Shepherd called Samantha the work between canine and human actor is so well handled scenes later on in the movie are heartbreaking! My only real gripe was the use of Cgi on the zombie characters but to be honest they are menacing enough and the film is really about Robert Neville and although important in terms of plot the real emphasis is on Neville and his search for mankind's redemption as well as his own sanity. That aside the movie looks amazing the deserted/overgrown streets really bring home the desolate existence Neville is leading, haunted on a daily basis by the remnants of a once vibrant city.I have also read reviews calling this yet another remake and how it wont be as good as Omega man etc etc.I Am Legend is not just another cash in remake the screenwriters and various producers have been trying to make this movie for quite a few years now. It is of course 'based on' Richard Mathesons book of the same name, 'based on' being the key words. The movie also has as many differences as it does similarities to the book it is based on but don't let that put you off if your a fan of the book its a terrific movie. Just because a film isn't 100% faithful to a book doesn't mean its a bad film just a different interpretation, look at The Shining for example Kubrick almost rewrote that and i was still in my opinion as good as the book.

I Am Legend(2007),I am Legend(2007) is the latest adaptation of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel going with the same name. The story revolves around Dr.Robert Neville(Will Smith) a military scientist who appears to be the last living man of the Earth on the hunt for the cure of the mutation in the antagonist Dark Seekers.Seeing the opening scene one completely expects the movie to be utopian but during the course of movie director succeeded in creating the dystopian feeling of the movie.There were several scenes and instances which shows the mental instabilty of Dr.Neville talking to his dog in utter despair.The post-apocolyptian theme gives the audience a new environment to deal on; an environment of being alone in the world surrounded by man-eating zombies.Overall the movie is good with exceptional performance from Will Smith and giving deep emotional feel for death and the end of the world.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Sucks.,"Will Smith really ought to be making better films than this, he has a certain talent. I watched this as I always enjoyed the film it is based on, namely 'The Omega Man'. But if you agree with that don't bother with 'I am legend'. All the interesting parts of 'The Omega Man' have been culled and substituted with a lot of cute dog, pretty lady with kid stuff.A pity because the film could have improved on 'The Omega man' and been turned into a really powerful film, albeit of a rather outdated type.Bad as it is I stayed awake and Will Smith was funny on a couple of occasions So please Hollywood producers, no more duff apocalyptic clunkers.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I Am Legend,"I am Legend is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. If you are a fan of the books, I have been told that this movie doesn't come close. But then again, I have never heard that any movie was better then its previous book adaptation. Will Smith did a spectacular job in this film. His acting should set a benchmark for future movies of the genre. The alternate ending that was released on the HD/DVD/BLU RAY formats was also fairly decent, but I believe they picked the right ending with the movie.If you are a fan of any of Will Smith's movies, or if you like any movie that can keep you on the edge of your seat, I highly recommend you buy this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Overall excellent film only slightly disappointing,"This film was rather well done. One of the most interesting aspects, to me, was watching the psychological effect of total isolation on Will Smith's Dr. Neville. Two scenes in the film were particularly tear jerking and touching, with Smith demonstrating again that he can clearly be one of the best dramatic actors in modern cinema. Overall, this is an excellent film; it's thrilling, frightening, and touching and pretty much everyone but the most bitterly cynical people will really enjoy it.I only have one complaint, but to me its a big one...The infected. Yes, they were extremely frightening until they attacked! I've read that the director originally started filming the infected as live actors with special prosthesis but felt they weren't convincing enough, so he decided on entirely CG characters using live actors only for some motion capture work. I think this was a remarkably dumb choice in his part. Actors with prosthesis can still be incredibly effective at playing convincing, sometimes superhuman, monsters. Reference the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, ""28 Days Later"", ""28 Weeks Later"", and ""The Descent."" The infected in the 28 Days films were absolutely entirely convincing, especially in the sequel, and were played almost entirely with real live actors in makeup utilizing CG for detail and enhancement. The infected in ""I Am Legend"" were clearly CG, which I found to be very disappointing. Also, these are supposed to be humans who have been infected with a virus causing their appearance and behavioral changes. Well, if you are going to base your monsters on humans you should try your best to keep movement as realistic as possible. The first time you see one of the infected scream, its clear that the size of their mouths don't make mechanical sense when compared to the shape of their faces with mouth closed. Its that kind of error that breaks the ""suspension of disbelief"" in audiences. Once the audience gets its first full glimpse of an infected human, they lose much of their ability to frighten. Still, my opinions about the quality of the infected CG doesn't really detract from my opinion of the film as a whole. The infected are only a fraction of the focus on this film, and there is so much else left to love. The lack of reality in the CG is trivial compared to the depth and reality of the psychological isolationist elements in the rest of the film.I do have a theory regarding the situation with the infected. I think the studio wanted this film to appear to a broad range of people, including families, and possibly they allowed the CG to be a bit obvious to actually reduce the level of fear in younger viewers? *Shrug* I don't know.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Could have been better... but wasn't bad.,"Will Smith shines in this Sci-Fi ""Cast Away"" role, playing a noble man whose sanity is wearing in a few spots. He holds this movie on his shoulders with his own brand of charm and empathy. By melding his performances from ""Independence Day"" and ""Pursuit of Happiness"", he creates a character that makes the evacuated NYC seem filled with life.The script is tight, smart, and engaging knowing when and how to play with the audiences emotions. The script doesn't believe the audience is stupid by aiming low, but instead treats the audience with intellectual respect which results in storytelling that always moving forward without a movement of boredom even in the less action packed scenes. This 2 hour movie is the first blockbuster in awhile that doesn't drag on. Because of all its great aspects, the movie is easily forgiven for its bible pounding pro-Christian themes.Where the movie fails is in the direction. Coming off of ""Constantine"", Francis Lawrence looked like he could be the next Guillermo del Toro, and very well still could be. (This could also explain why he got the job on the film... see Fun Stuff trivia section) However, he made a few, but very key, poor choices and couldn't pull good performances out of his supporting, albeit unknown, cast. The major complaint about this ""Cast Away"" meets ""30 Days of Night"" blockbuster is that when we finally come across the zombie vampires, we don't see things-that-go-bump-in-the-night. Instead we see a CG representation of the things-that-go-bump-in-the-night. And as advanced computer technology is (and increasing becoming), it still can't replace the ethos and pathos one feels for a flesh and blood actor. The villain(s) never draw us in because of their inorganic quality. This caused the film to simply be a blockbuster spectacle rather than an iconic film.However, Lawrence's pacing was very good never dragging, and the action sequences were gripping, and many left the theater still unnerved with the fear instilled by his work on the big screen.It's a must see if you are interested or curious. 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A good evocation of a catastrophe and derelict major city,"Having posted up some reviews of ""old school"" zombie movies here (by George A. Romero), I thought I'd post up one for this Hollywood blockbuster variation (Romero was not mainstream and worked on shoe-string budgets).Will Smith, playing military scientist Robert Neville, finds himself in a world which has imploded after a medical virus which seemed to cure cancer goes feral, creating 'zombie' humans and seems to leave him as the sole, unaffected survivor-at least in New York, but perhaps the world too.Smith manages to hold our attention despite being the sole human character for much of the movie (there are flashbacks where his character is seen with his wife etc). One of the strengths of the movie is the relationship Smith shares with his pet dog-sort of like the relationship Max has with his mutt in Mad Max 2 (I posted up a review of that here earlier today).Perhaps the best reason to see this movie is for it's depiction of a derelict New York. These are the most effective evocations of a world gone wrong.One gripe about this movie is the representation of the 'zombies' in this movie. In the latter scenes, these affected humans cease to be plausible representations of victims of a mutant virus (um, I don't want to get into a debate about 'realistic' depictions of zombies though!).In fact, one of the most effective scenes is when we see these things up close for the first time. It's really unnerving and scary. That was a bit of an opportunity lost, I thought, in not going down that road. In trying to be novel about the zombies, it goes in a less satisfying direction than it could have. Even with a budget, Romero didn't overdo the zombies in his movie.Given the subject nature of this movie and the fact that it is an American movie, it's not really surprising that you get religious references in this movie-from posters, to theological discussions. Not a huge downer, but it does get tiresome having many American movies behaving like God botherers.Watch this movie for its evocation of a derelict New York. It looks REALLY cool.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Unbalanced and Unfocused,"The biggest thing that keeps people back to watch this movie is Will Smith, because he is holding this movie from falling apart.Bad CGI zombies aside, the biggest problem with I Am Legend is a clear identity, is it a post-apocalyptic action?, or it's a deep and dark look to a man alone in the dark?.I like a lot of things in it, but the script is was holding this movie from becoming a legend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"The 1971 version ""The Omega Man"" was better!","Although rarely mentioned, this remark of the 1971 film ""The Omega Man"" starring Charlton Heston should have been much better than it turned out to be.The storyline is identical to the original which starred Charlton Heston and was made in 1971 called The Omega Man and to be honest, if not for the more modern effects & CGI this film wouldn't be worth watching at all.On the hole I preferred the original over this unchanged modern version which is unfortunate given the potential for modern day special effects and CGI.I'd liked to have seen more backstory with regards to his role as a bio engineer in the army as well as the virus spread and attempted solution. Also maybe expand the storyline to include backstories for the other survivors once they appear in the film.I liked the ""bad man"" character better in this version than the original however they missed out on a potential backstory only giving this character scary dogs and not explaining clearly why he is a hybrid. In the original, the character at least had a backstory as a tv newsreader who hated the system and this lead to his behaviour after the fall of the world 🤔If they do make another I hope they make it worth the effort 🤔",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Breathtaking movie about loneliness and meaning of life,"I would shake hands with the screenplay writers and the director...It is a heart-braking story,really different from other apocalypse sort of films.Will Smith (Robert Neville), the last person alive in New York, gave a heart and spirit performance that I highly appreciated in the end since I had a 60% whole cinema experience. It is not a HAPPY FILM and definitely not the one you should watch after having a bad day. If you are a rather thoughtful person, you will like this one.I think the reason, why a lot of people did not like it, is that they got embarrassed as this one is a DEPRESSIVE one.Throughout the film, I felt all Will's emotions and at the same time I was observing myself after how long I would have given up the whole thing if I was him.It is a great self-testing how strongly you insist on life.It translates a message about strong will, faith and that the meaning of life is to fight for survival at any price.Indeed, I do agree on that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"good, but not finished","I liked that there were emotions in form of relationship between humans, zombies, animals. Also nice landscape, action, story, intro. Nice idea such as that zombies are sensitive to light, performing experiments on them, and even bit human. But bad that story is not fully explained and not finished. We do not know what will happen in the end, and names of medications etc. Could be better maybe with more people and more drama. We do not even know is medication really working and are zombies really good or healed. Still too many questions and holes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Good,"Will smith gave a very impressive performance, however this film was totally ruined by CG. Superhuman zombies, they looked as fake as they are. Most looked like robots from I Robot this was especially noticeable on close-up shots where you can see similarity's in the face used to make them. The dog zombies were also a miss, not looking like dogs at all.A much better look would have been to use one like that of the killer Vampires from Blade 2, which looked lots better and was just what this film required.Please don't make a sequel, Will Smith was the only good thing about this film.

"Great movie, well directed and superbly acted","This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Really well directed and superbly acted by Will Smith.I read a review after watching the movie on the bus ride home where the writer said that the last 40 minutes of the movie fell apart and seemed as if the ending had been phoned in last minute.I completely disagree with this review. The ending was really well done considering the rest of the movie and without spoiling anything, I can't imagine it being done any other way while eliciting the same emotional response from the audience.The other great thing about the movie was that it wasn't all action/suspense like I thought it would be. There was even a scene that nearly made me cry.

A Little Bit Disappointing,"The truth about this film is that there was way too much hype surrounding it and I got caught up in it. I went into this film with extremely high hopes of how awesome it would be. What I got instead was a well acted but strange film that didn't seem cohesive in many parts. Will Smith as usual was on par with his acting, its the script that could have done with some major changes. For a start the creatures were believable, unlike so many of these kinds of films. The script offered some good ideas but failed to capitalize on many of them like on how to bring the creatures under control...this was under utilized, there was also a very silly idea at the end of the film with the grenade, it could have been done differently....watch it and you will see what i mean. However i did thoroughly enjoy the first 40 minutes or so but then the film went off track a little bit...the ending was another very weak point. Despite my negative comments I urge you to watch this film and make up your own mind on whether it is good or not...this is just my personal indication of how I felt about it....my friends who watched it with me felt the same.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An outstanding film.,"My first comment and the first film in the last year that has made me feel the NEED to comment.This is unlike any post-apocalypse film ever seen, anyone who says that this film is too basic, has poor acting or is generally a bad film isn't worth listening to.For the record, Will Smith is OUTSTANDING in this film, he captures the role perfectly, portraying the emotions and mild insanity of a man totally alone in the world. The film mixes a blend of emotions, humour, action and tension perfectly in a way that truly makes you appreciate the phrase ""on the edge of your seat"".The cinematography itself is remarkable, with the theme of total isolation wonderfully explored with the shots of an empty New York, these shots themselves are worth paying to see.Here is where I would list all the things wrong with this movie but I can honestly say that I saw nothing that could be criticized.Altogether this is a masterpiece of film-making and while it is under-rated by the critics today, like most genuine classics, it will come to be appreciated as one of the best films of the year.Watch it :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I am Meh,"This movie is 14 years old and that makes me feel old and I don't like it. I remember when this came out, the hype that was around this, the spectacle and blockbuster status that this was built up as only to watch it and... Well, 14 years later I decide to watch it again and here's the deal.Seeing an abandon, post-apoc New York city like this is stunning in so many ways. The trips Smith takes around the decrepit Manhattan is absolutely stunning to look at and I think is easily the best part of this whole movie honestly. The sets and the visuals, even now are just gorgeous. To me that's about where the greatness ends though. I think the CGI looked bad in '07 and those zombie things look even worse now. They look alien in all the worst ways and it's impossible to properly take them seriously as a threat when they look so absurd. Then there's Smith, who may have a mountain of charisma to him but her feels like he's really overacting here to try and be dramatic and it never quite works for me.Overall, it's a movie more about the spectacle than anything else and some of that spectacle really is incredible, I just wish the rest of the movie lived up to it more rather than just sort've wallowing in mediocrity. Still worth checking out at least clips of those desolate streets though. Oh, and trigger warning, there's a dog and things happen to her and it's heartbreaking so if that's a no no for you keep that in mind.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Great Legend,"In the opening of ""I Am Legend"" Will Smith as Robert Neville along with his dog Sam races through the desolate streets of New York City. We see the striking images of New York City over grown with vegetation, wild deer, and no people. This is Director Francis Lawrence grim post viral infected world of 2012. My bud Ron had told me that ""I Am Legend"" was remake of ""Omega Man"" starring Charlton Heston, based on a novella from the 1950's. Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman wrote the screenplay for ""I Am Legend"" based on the Richard Matheson novel. I have enjoyed ""Omega Man"". ""I Am Legend"" is more science fiction thriller than action movie. The action in ""I Am Legend"" is intense and spectacular. Will Smith is stark and powerful. It is just Smith for virtually the first half of the movie.In 2009 a doctor played the Emma Thompson announces a breakthrough virus that may be the cure for cancer. However, something goes awry. Soon New York City becomes a military quarantine zone with families desperately scrambling to leave Manhattan. Among those is Col. Neville (Smith), his wife Zoe (Salli Richardson), and daughter Marley (Willow SmithWill's daughter). Neville knows that the virus is now airborne, imposing a deadly threat.Fast-forward 3 years later. Neville tells fellow survivor Anna (Alice Braga), ""Everyone you know is dead!"" The virus killed 90% of the world's 6 billion people. Less than 5% survived, because of their built in immunity. The remainder of the population mutated into vicious nocturnal creatures. Meanwhile, Neville has so far been unsuccessful in discovering cure for the viral mutation using the DNA of his own blood. This seems to be Neville's mission and curse. He says, ""God didn't do this. We did."" This is Will Smith's action tour de force. The trimmed and chiseled Smith is in amazing shape, and performs the action with skill and pathos. He engages and enrolls us in Neville's plight and curse as a man on the verge of forfeiting his sanity and humanity. Smith has a poignantly heartbreaking scene with his dog Sam. The charismatic Smith embodies hero in Neville. Beautiful Alice Braga is great as the strong and smart Anna.This does not give away too much. ""I Am Legend"" acknowledges the courage and the possibility of humanity in people. Everyone can be a hero, we all need to discover and reclaim this in ourselves. Director Lawrence and Smith tell a great and timeless story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Nothing new,"Here is another end of the world action film starring Will Smith and a German Shepherd as his loyal companion on the road of an apocalyptic, dark and dreary landscape.

He captures a woman, Ruth, and she seems to be immune and so he injects some of her blood into his body. He passes out and wakes up a prisoner of the undead, of which Ruth is a part of. They are angry with him for killing so many of their compatriots.

You are not alone.,"""I Am Legend"" debuted with a monstrous $77 million weekend, but is an atypical Will Smith blockbuster, largely bereft of the slam-bang action and/or comedy common to his big movies like ""Men in Black"" or ""Enemy of the State"".As learned from the tagline and excellent first trailer, the premise is simple: Smith is Dr. Robert Neville, the last man left in a desolate New York City, but he is not alone. Someone or something lingers, a mystery that drives the first hour, which is absolutely fantastic. With the exception of a few flashbacks that gradually answer the hows and whys generated by the plot progression, Smith interacts with no one except Sam, his loyal German Shepherd.In this regard, ""I Am Legend"" is a cousin to the amazing ""Cast Away"". While their respective tones are drastically different, both are set on islands void of humanity. Instead of a volleyball, Smith anthropormorphizes a dog. Hanks wrestled with inner demons on his deserted island, Smith confronts outer demons of some sort. The difference in supplies is noteworthy, and the two main characters are driven by widely disparate motivations, but the isolated survival instinct is similar, and watching Smith stretch himself as an actor is extremely enjoyable. Smith's character still possesses elements of the cocky, wise-cracking nature that moviegoers know well, but with merely a glance or a twitch, his confident veneer often cracks to reveal the effects of his time spent alone. Seeing that uncharacteristic vulnerability is initially disorienting, because we're not used to seeing a hero crack like this, but the awkwardness soon yields to awe at the powerhouse solo performance.Aside from Smith's turn, the highlights of the movie are the breathtaking shots of a desolate New York City. We've seen the empty streets of a booming metropolis before, in movies like ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""28 Days Later"", but this is different. Not only is everything deserted, but also overgrown and eroded by nature and time. The minimal music and slow-moving cameras allow for an eerie and appropriate quiet within the movie, creating a game of I Spy in which one's eyes dart about, searching for familiar landmarks like Jumbotrons or Broadway signs.The only downside to all this quality is that it doesn't last throughout the entire movie. Without giving too much away, I can say that following a key plot development, the third and final act transforms into a more familiar, action-type of movie, leading to a finale that satisfies, but doesn't quite match the preceding hour-plus. This dissonance is very reminiscent of 2004's ""Collateral"", which similarly enthralled throughout before wimping out at the end, like a color scheme that matches at first glance but clashes upon closer inspection.If you know what you are in for, you will enjoy the movie more thoroughly. ""I Am Legend"" is much more ""Cast Away"" than ""Independence Day"", more ""Signs"" than ""Bad Boys"". In his best performance yet, Will Smith proves that he has the acting chops to match his pretty face and ripped physique, deepening his own cinematic legend as he frequently carries this movie to great heights.Bottom Line: Two-thirds of a great movie plus one-third of an average movie equals a good movie. 7 of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An engrossing and scary post apocalyptic thriller.,"To be honest, i wasn't looking forward to I Am Legend. It seemed as if a film that portrays Will Smith as the last man on earth could only be one of two things: 1. A post apocalyptic ego-fest, like Kevin Costners The Postman, or 2. A cross between Mad Max and the fresh prince.Thankfully, it turns out that the film is neither of these things- what it is in fact is an engrossing, tense and satisfying thriller.As the lone human survivor of a plague that has reduced new york to deserted ghost town, Will Smith does an excellent job of holding the film together with a world weary, vulnerable performance that really makes you feel for his character. Large moments of the film is just him and his dog going through their daily routines and it makes for gripping viewing.As for Smiths mutant costars, they are creepy freaks that do their job in the scare department but visually, they're kind of bland. Design wise, we've seen creatures like them before, particularly in Blade 2, and in many shots they look too much like CGI. The same goes for many of the animals that show up in the film (apart from smiths beloved doggy)- they are very obviously fake and its distracting in moments that are meant to be scary.Some ropey CGI isn't enough to bring down the rest of the film though- I Am legend is a darn good post-apocalyptic thriller carried on the very capable shoulders of its star.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Good Movie, but way too short","I really enjoyed this movie, but somehow it ended way too early The movie is told by switching between flashbacks, that explain why everyones beside Will Smiths character is dead, and Will Smith in an empty world, three years later. There is nothing to complain about the acting, everyone involved does a good job, and everything else was technically perfect and i was entertained the whole time. So the only thing i have to complain about is the length.As i mentioned before, the movie starts three years after the events that lead to the extinction of mankind. And all these three years the life of Wills character must have been really boring, frustrating, desolate and repetitive. And the first maybe twenty to thirty minutes give a short peak at what he did all the time. But right after, several events seem to rush on him, and the viewer doesn't even get time to breath. And that's the point that really annoyed me after the movie ended. You didn't get a chance to put yourself in the situation of being the last man on earth, cause the story is pushed forward with an immense speed.This could have been a really haunting movie, but it seems the studio didn't want to risk to bore the audience, and made a fast paced Hollywood movie instead.That's why I (beside of being good entertained through the whole movie) give this flick only 7/10 stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I Am Legend is Wil Smith's Castaway,"Welcome to the Wil Smith movie. We catch up with Col. Robert Neville and his family trying to get off Manhattan after some deadly type of virus as seemed to be released. They have a heck of a time but the real story is Robert Neville living on a desolate Manhattan and how he gets along. Smith's performance as Col. Dr. Robert Neville is wonderful. Seeing so much of him living in the ruble and the home he creates for himself is reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away. There is no volleyball unless you want to count the German Shepard dog. The problem in the movie is by way of the script which at times has more holes than my ganma's undies. There are scenes which are almost unbearable and then there are instances that just defy logic.Does the movie look good? Well, yeah. The film is full of rich, sweeping cinematography and more CG than I shake a stick at. I Am Legend is a spectacular film that you can see again and a again which is a lot to say of a 2007 film. On a side note here: the movie you see at the theater or on HBO is not the movie the Wil and the director wanted you to see. The original adaptation of the movie can be downloaded and I think seen on the limited edition DVD. And, as usual, the movie is not the book the material is based on. The script adaptation gets a bad c- but the film is just too cool to pass by just for that. **/****.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Wear brown trousers,"This kind of film is what going to the flicks is all about. I was scared witless from the first moment to the last. Admittedly I hadn't realised it was a zombie movie (of sorts) before the titles rolled and it was a good 40 minutes before we even came across one, but Jeez, this is a film designed to make you jump. I won't spoil it but, as they say, wear brown trousers.I know zombie flicks are overdone of late. But that's not a reason to overlook this freak-show.Will Smith is in fine form, essentially carrying the movie singlehandedly with very little human intervention. That's because we understand him to be the last man standing after a genetically treated measles virus which was intended to eradicate the world of cancer went ugly overnight.The scenes that have most redolence in this movie are the truly stunning and really eerie street scenes of an abandoned New York populated only by escaped zoo animals who aren't that handy with lawnmowers, the result being that, for example, Madison Avenue is well on its way to becoming a maize field with a bunch of abandoned, rusting cars lying around. Whole buildings are wrapped in polythyene, presumably a failed attempt to contain the virus in some way.Smith looks great, acts pretty well and builds up a strong relationship with his only companion, his three year old Alsation, Sam.The film is lavish. The sound engineering is both deafening and a major component to most of the shocks.The zombies, while CGI'd at times, are genuinely creepy. They cannot come out in daylight as UV burns them on the spot so they huddle, vampire like, in 'hives' in gloomy dilapidated buildings waiting for nightfall when they take over the streets with their ghoulish hounds.In one set piece when we KNOW Will shouldn't go into a darkened building the tension is unbearable and more drawn out than a Strictly Come Dancing result. You KNOW it will culminate in a massive fright and it does, but that doesn't stop it being eye-wateringly scary.This is a cracker and my first 8 out of 10 movie of 2008.Go see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Great movie but unsatisfied ending,"I saw this movie on DVD, when movie started I felt the subject is very interesting, actually director touches the human emotions beautifully with a common concept of horror movies like resident evil etc. The idea is very unique in its depths but at the end I realized that, I saw nothing. There should be more for characters even his dog ""sam"" should be not killed in the mid of the film.You can see the movie...over all it is not boring, very interesting,special effects are great...but surprisingly the buildings & cars of new york shine and cleaned among animals and there is no human in the new york except the hero.Watch it....",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Mysterious and enjoyable,"I am so glad this movie was not two and half hours to three hours long (although it was about 15 minutes/4 scenes short IMHO) - this is actually a great watch - albeit a little contrived at the end. Will Smith is one of the few actors who could have pulled off this type of action and drama without seeming too - Will Smith (or insert actor's name here) - at the time. I really enjoyed the camera shots and seamless CGI - most of the time it felt like hand held cameras and natural lighting - very cool. NYC is amazingly transformed into oblivion. Kudos. And in general, the affect on Smith's character of being under constant stress (both physically and mentally) is poignant.I must admit though, that the story while well told, does not really have the legendary status that it could have had - or rather that the story never seemed to have a start or finish. For a character driven movie, one really needed a few of the characters to have more - scenes. I just saw some missed moments and revelations, hopefully there is a director's cut somewhere that maybe has a few extra scenes? All in all though, I loved this movie - it felt like faithful sci-fi thriller a la old school movies such as ""The Thing"" or any other 1950's 60's sci-fi.Definitely check this movie out. Although I don't think it would happen - I would love to see a sequel to this. Maybe it should have been 3 hours long!UPDATED 12/31/2008 - Well, I was right, there is an ""alternate"" version of this on the DVD, and I ask myself - why in the heck did they release the original?

"Pretty good post-apocalyptic movie, but suffers from a cliché-ridden ending. (No spoilers)","I am Legend, starring Will Smith, is a feature film adaptation of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name. And the movie is quite a good one, successfully portraying the feeling of isolation, post-apocalyptic dread, sufficient acting, and a tight storyline for the most part, it suffers from a cliché-ridden finale that weakens the experience a bit.The movie is about virologist Robert Neville, who thinks he may be Earth's only human not affected by a man-made virus. He works to create a cure while living in a city inhabited by mutant victims of the plague.The film starts off great, with a little flashback to how the infection began, and then moving towards the present when Will Smith is the only man on Earth. Throughout the movie, the movie goes back in time and tells what really happened and led to the current state of humankind. This was a great way to start off, and the idea of how the infection spread is unique from other zombie movies, and makes you think too.Talking about the vampires in the movie, they do not look most convincing as they would have if they would have been human, but thankfully, that doesn't detract from the experience so much. Will Smith gives a good performance as an isolated scientist looking for a cure, so does the rest of the cast (a few to speak of) It is after the first act that the experience starts to be marred. Midway, the movie adds a few drawn-out Castaway inspired sequences which we all have seen, not to mention the one with the dog. You will know it when you see it. They are well-shot, but we have seen them before done better.As a few other characters are introduced, the movie falls for a very cliché-ridden ending, which is the weakest point for the movie. Not spoiling anything, I can just say that we have seen the very ending in countless zombie movies like 'Dawn of the Dead', 'Shaun of the Dead' etc.Overall, I am Legend is a fun ride for the most part, and though the clichéd ending is a letdown, the movie never fails to entertain. Worthy of the ticket price.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Smith dazzles in an above-average sci-fi romp...,"Shaun Munro's Film Reviews (www.shaunmunro.co.uk):Francis Lawrence's I Am Legend is the latest adaptation of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel (which has already been put onto film twice), starring Will Smith as Dr. Robert Neville, who may well be the last man on Earth. Neville is charged with reversing the effects of a botched cancer cure that killed 90% of the world's population, leaving 1% immune, and turning the other 9% into ""dark seekers""  mutated beasts that wish to feed on any living humans they can find.Following a welcome cameo from the wonderful Emma Thompson (as the doctor who started the whole mess), we press on to three years later, where the entire world is seemingly desolate, ravaged by the effects of the ""Krippin virus"". Is such a post-apocalyptic setting conventional, with its overturned cars, and its litter-filled streets? Absolutely, but the buck stops there, as the film's introduction is anything but rudimentary  I Am Legend is not a film filled with dialogue, and the opening fifteen minutes is curiously, adventurously devoid of speech almost entirely. Given how Smith's character is alone in New York City, with nothing but his dog for company, it is commendable that screenwriters Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman chose not to have Smith regurgitate an inner monologue, which would only serve to insult seasoned cinema-goers. Instead, Neville simply has occasional, ever-believable banter with his dog, which serves not to progress the plot, but to telegraph Neville as the sympathetic character that he is.The seeming emptiness of the opening scenes reflects the drudgery and loneliness of Neville's own existence  each night he is forced to lock himself away in his home, sleeping in the bathtub with his rifle at his side. All Neville has left is his dog, and at one point early on, he enters into a dark, potentially dangerous building in order to search for her after she runs away. In similar fare (such as Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake), risking one's life to such lengths to rescue a pet seems ridiculous and non-sensical, yet in this paradigm, whereby Neville's mental state cannot be ascertained, and he has no other living contacts, diving into the abyss for a hound doesn't seem so insane.In a brief series of flashbacks, we learn of Neville's loneliness and personal torture to an even greater extent. Neville has endured unspeakable family atrocities, and such interludes aid in envisioning him as a truly, uncomprisingly sympathetic character. Neville is a tortured soul of the greatest variety, and combined with Smith's moving performance, we are presented with an affecting, highly driven character that the audience can support for reasons other than the usual star power and recognisable face.Robert Neville is, in many aspects, an unconventional action hero. Neville is a uniformly Hollywood-esquire scientist, in that he is muscular, yet when faced with volatile situations, he breathes heavily, and he shakes  he is scared, and more often than not, he will flee in the face of danger rather than stand his ground in rather gung-ho fashion and unleash his rather hefty rifle. Only when faced with even more personal tragedy does Neville turn into rent-a-kill, and even then, it is understandable considering the gravity and emotional impact of his loss, and moreover, his true motives (such as his care for his own wellbeing) are unclear.To this effect, there are a surprising amount of genuinely affecting, heartfelt moments in I Am Legend. Following a savage, brutal attack, in which Neville is faced with a heartbreaking choice (with an unexpectedly disturbing payoff), Neville is left empty and shell-like  he sustains emotional bankruptcy beyond measures he believed possible, and it appears to be this tragedy which drives the climax, rather than the other, ham-fisted way around, to the film's further credit. The sadness of the situation is furthered by Smith's entirely convincing turn, particularly in a rental store scene, where he, in his jaded loneliness, begs the various mannequins scattered around the store - ""Please say hello to me!"". In the hands of a lesser actor, such a scene would have fallen flat and appeared preposterous and histrionic, yet Smith, the ever-underrated actor that he is, digs down deep and packs his performance with the appropriate emotional wallop that it dictates. Smith claims that preparing for I Am Legend was his most challenging turn since Ali, and given the surprising emotional depth of his character, one need not wonder why.The film's third act is a tonal departure from the preceding hour  Neville's environment is altered drastically, and in doing so, brings with it a wealth of clichés, metamorphosing a minimalist, restrained survival film into an overblown, rudimentary horror endeavour. The scenes in which Neville makes his most important discoveries are also the most conventional, dabbling in a dash of deus ex machina, and transforming plot-driven action into action-driven plot. The final moments, whilst wonderfully lit and a tad inspiring, are typical of such films, and whilst Neville's actions in the film's final moments are unassailably heroic, it failed to convince logically. I Am Legend's final act of violence works more as a reason to cause a lot of explosions rather than to paint a universal picture of heroism, yet when one considers Neville as a character, and what he has been through, it is a considerably more acceptable, yet nevertheless frustrating creative decision.I Am Legend is a rarity  it is a mainstream Hollywood action thriller that packs an authentic emotional punch, and allows Smith, holding the picture solely on his broad shoulders, to demonstrate his acting credentials with flare and zest. The film suffers from some incredibly hokey visual effects, and the film's third act seems to undermine the inventive preceding hour, yet as far as high-concept action fare goes, I Am Legend is a cut above the average.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An amazing Film,"When i first heard news about I Am Legend i was excited and was looking forward to it. The reason I liked it so much was because i was expecting a good movie and thats exactly what i got. Contrary to other movies set in desolate New York, this movie was highly believable. The weeds growing through the street made it seem so real. Along with the scenery came Will Smith as Robert Neville. What really caught my attention is how well he portrayed a human being living alone for 3 years, even when encountering the mutated humans he has tactics (Covering flashlight) and characterizes them as a sub species (Using words like colony when they group.) Its an extraordinary film, Please PLEASE see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I Am Legend,"The story is not too strong, killing the dog is the highlight of the film! Also, the rhythm is too slow, to see the ending will have a kind of frustration just entered the play and then there is no sense of frustration. But the visual effect is great.

re: Not a bad movie ..indeed,"I feel that Will Smith did a great job here with his character. He looked the part. He made you feel at times what it would like to be alone - supposedly in New York.I just wish the script writers could have been more bolder. For instance when they introduced Anna and her child to the plot. Maybe the could have written into the story a flash back of how she survived. And how she came to save Robert Neville, when he was about to lose his life.Maybe, they could have written into the plot things like. The stench of the place. All those dead bodies, bad food going off, etc....They could have made it even more realistic by showing us eve more New Reels. People fighting for petrol. People fighting each other maybe to be allowed to go into home made bunkers, etc, etc. So don't blame Will Smith for their mistakes on that score. OK? Also I felt that the film could have been made longer. 1 X Hour and 40 minutes is far too short for a film like this. Scriptwriters come on! I still would love to see a Sequel to this film. I still think that we haven't seen the best of this film. A sequel might quench our thirst.After all that though. The film had breath taking views of New York. Also I loved the ""Fear"" that Will Smith showed when he went after the dog that was chasing the deer into that building.I like the fact that Will Smith, lost it when he was re-quoting the entire scene of Sherk. ""You not very good with people now are you?"" , says Anna, when she see's Will losing it.I liked the deer scene at the start of the movie. Looking for fresh meat! Great add to the story. Also the fact that we got shown that he was guzamped by the Lion.He's about to shot the deer himself, and yet the Lion got there first!I liked this movie. It was a lot better movie then a lot that came out in 2007, I can tell you. Just sit back and think, and I am sure that you will agree with that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

The Legend of His Time,"In the 2007 film I am Legend, directed by Francis Lawrence, three years have passed since a viral epidemic swarmed the globe turning the world's population into nocturnal mutant predators. Will Smith stars as Robert Neville, an Army scientist who is immune to the virus and also possibly the last man on earth. The film takes place in New York City, 2012. The movie follows Robert Neville as he attempts to find a remedy for the virus. Neville hunts the infected vampire-like creatures to conduct experiments in search for a cure. Neville tries to experiment with the infected to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. I am Legend has two different endings, such as a theatrical ending and the alternate ending. The alternate ending corresponds more with the book than the theatrical ending. I tend to like the alternate ending more because it helps people understand the meaning behind the film. It gives viewers a better perspective of the message the director is trying to establish. It is very hard to understand the meaning of the film by viewing the theatrical ending and can throw off viewers who have not read the book. Like Tom Hanks in Castaway, Will Smith commands the screen alone for most of the movie along with his companion dog Samantha (Abbey). There are multiple forms of critical intention in the film to make the film seem more realistic, although some are more practical to the film than others. The director of the film uses music minimally allowing the cityscapes to remain mostly silent to give the impression of extinction to no other life forms at all. An overgrown and deserted Time Square adds suspenseful moments to the movie. The scene of the lion hunting the deer brings the thought of how civilization has ceased and natures overwhelming power over mankind. The film was nominated for seventeen awards and won seven awards. The film won the Saturn Award for best actor and the Teen Choice Award for Best Horror Film. The film also won an MTV Movie Award for the best male performance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Will Smith is incredible!!!,"I have never read Richard Matheson's groundbreaking novel of the same name but I still like the film despite not knowing of its existence and never having the chance of reading the original source material on which the film (and its countless variations) is based. Will Smith is incredible. A fine actor that he is in bringing genuine anxiety and bleak outlooks in this post-apocalyptic tale of being the last man on earth. The scenes of a deserted NYC is so shocking and disturbing that after seeing the film, I deeply pondered if such an event was to happen suddenly without warning; really intense stuff. But I gotta say the best supporting ""actor"" in Legend is Sam, soul mate of the weary (and somewhat crazy) protagonist in a desperate race to save humanity from extinction. Their scenes together form a lovingly heartwarming bond that is the emotional center of Legend.Will Smith is a joy to watch, especially when he's going through his ""daily routines"" while trying to find a sense of normalcy of the world that once was and you really emphasize with his struggle against loneliness, insanity and despair. I don't think they couldn't have gotten a better actor for this role but thankfully I'm glad that they took him aboard this film as a bankable and talented actor.However the film does have its faults. Many complained about the special effects being to ""video-gamey"" and it's length. Unlike most, I'm willing to overlook the special effects though I find them exceptional at best. It's a real shame that the film's length wasn't longer. It would've been great if the film had an extra hour of story and giving a much more satisfying experience; sadly it doesn't and the ending does feel like a cop-out. Still it is a good movie. It should be interesting to see what the special edition has to offer for the added scenes and bonus content.I rate it 8 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A good try,"It took me a few days and a few viewings to decide that I didn't like this movie. The first act is very intriguing and certainly had my attention very quickly, though it was hard to accept Will Smith as being a scientist who's trying to be man's savior at first, it grew on me and he really does a good job at convincing us that he's a versatile enough actor. It's when the zombie/vampire things start showing up that questions began to arise about the intention of the filmmakers. Why were they CGI? I think this is a very good example of a studio that might recognize it's errors in script, and therefore try and make up for it with lots of unnecessary CGI, like the new star wars movies. The only things that have a reason for being CGI were the rats and the dogs, ie; actors in the film which need to act differently than normal but can't just be told to do so. And why were the zombies' lower jaws like those of snakes? They would detach and extend far beyond what the human bone structure can do, and they did it all the time! Along with that, they could somehow climb up walls and things. With what? Their suction-pad finger tips? And how did they organize and make language and such in the 2 years since they took over? There were far too many things that just didn't make sense for this movie to earn a good rating.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Well made, emotional thrill ride.","This movie surprised me. I walked in expecting another zombie shoot-em up, but got a well-developed emotional thrill ride. I love how I got attached to the The main character and was shocked to find myself experiencing genuine fear for Sam, his dog, in the ware house scene. (which was masterfully done.) Will's performance was stellar, an emotionally trouble man, bordering Insanity, with a dog as the only source of companionship. The suspense this film provides is not disappointing.The only problem I see with this movie is its controversial main idea (that there is a God)is hard to make out. whether this is intentional or not it seemed that the unobservant viewers left unaware of the message the movie was giving. It was definitely there, but tough to make out.an overall astounding film, worth the price of admission. Go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Chilling & Moving,"I'm just home from the cinema and Wow, this film was really excellent! Firstly I was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie! It was so suspenseful and tense that I literally jumped out of my chair on more than one occasion.There was comedy and sadness throughout and these emotions were portrayed by an elegant, if small, cast of highly under-rated stars. The final minutes shared between Robert and his wife was jaw-droopingly upsetting.The action was thrilling, the suspense was nerve racking. The humor was poignant and provided a much needed, albeit short, break in the tense scenes which surrounded it! I don't want to give away any of the story but I can recommend this film to anyone looking for a good, deep story, with a lot of scares! The ending isn't half bad either!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Could have been legendary!,"Lots of folks been complaining about the CG monsters in this movie and how poorly they've been created. Well, don't let that crap keep you away from the movie. Yes, it is clear that the vampiric ghouls created by a worldwide spread of a man-made virus are computer generated, but that doesn't make them less scary and here's why: when we see the hero of the movie, a trained soldier and scientist, venture inside a dark building where the ghouls reside, he gets scared. So scared he almost abandons his only friend, his dog Sam, to the infected monsters within. Heroes don't typically act this way. They're normally a little too calm and collected in situations like this. So when Will Smith shows genuine fear of going inside that building, we fear for him. The CG is used only to make the creatures something inhuman, which is what the virus made them. Dudes running around with plastic teeth and shaved heads wouldn't have the same effect.Smith plays Neville, an Army scientist who was in charge of the virology team on Manhattan when the virus, which was originally made to cure diseases, went bad and started turning people into super vampires. The movie opens several years after the outbreak and Neville is still on Manhattan, still researching a way to reverse the virus's effects. I Am Legend uses the ""Lost"" method of employing flashbacks. We jump back and forth between past and present, the scenes giving each other more depth the more we learn about Neville's predicament. He has become an urban survivalist, living off of canned food and whatever animals he can hunt with his 2010 model Mustang. At night, when the extremely UV-sensitive creatures come out to feed, Neville's house becomes a steel-encased fortress and he sometimes sleeps in the tub with a rifle in hand - I guess when hundreds of growling beasts lurk outside your house, the bed just feels a little too open. The first hour is all about how he survives from day to day, how he is trying to cure the disease in a high tech lab in the basement, and how he's beginning to totally crack up from the isolation. This first hour is great.Every day he exercises to keep himself in top physical form, pampers and scolds his dog like a child, goes down to the video store to ""rent"" a movie from the mannequin he's placed behind the counter, and at midday he goes to a certain pier and waits for someone to answer his constantly broadcasting radio message. The routine is probably what has kept him from going insane up to this point, but he's still slowly slipping away. He tiptoes around a particular female mannequin at the video store, afraid to speak to her like I am to a real live girl. He invents whole conversations with the silent figures out on the street. And when one of his ""friends"" turns up in a place he's not supposed to be, we can't be sure if he's finally going nuts or if someone is playing a trick on him. But he's supposed to be all alone Eventually, the screenwriters do the lame thing and bring a plot into the mix. But not just a plot - a message as well. In the last 10 minutes of the picture, Neville appears to have a crisis of faith which undermines his ability to save the human race. That's all well and good, but up to this point, spirituality has practically no role in the movie at all aside from a short prayer in one of the flashback scenes. I didn't have a problem with that plot point itself, I just wish that point had been inevitably reached like it should be in a well told story. Instead it just pops up suddenly for no other reason than the end of the movie was approaching. Still, that first hour Hot diggity. Now I have to give up my own dreams of making a post-apocalyptic adventure movie because the first two-thirds of this one do it so well.http://www.movieswithmark.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
zombie-like humans and they're chases and attacks,"n 2012, three years after a genetically modified virus which was supposed to cure cancer ended up wiping out most of the world's population, a scientist named Robert Neville, immune to this virus, appears to be the only uninfected human left in New York City, maybe even the world, and his only companion is his dog, Sam! Neville does research in his basement laboratory to try and find a cure for the virus, and regularly sends out radio messages, calling for other survivors to come and meet him, if there are any out there, but so far, this has not worked. Eventually, the scientist discovers people in New York who have not been killed by the virus, but have been mutated by it, and as a result, they have become dangerous monsters! Worse still, there are many of them in the city, and Neville is still waiting to see another uninfected human, so he is grossly outnumbered!This film is slow-paced around the beginning, but this works well, starting with the introduction to the virus which was yet to fail, and going from there to views of a deserted New York, which are reasonably intriguing. Some scenes may be a bit tedious, such as Robert Neville looking through the dark building before finding the mutants, and the camera is sometimes a bit unsteady, but to make up for the flaws, there's quite a bit of tension (which includes scenes with the mutated, zombie-like humans and they're chases and attacks, even though I'm sure we've seen scenes like that before in movies), as well as some poignant moments, with Neville and his loneliness. Also, for Bob Marley fans, the main character is a big fan of his, and at one point, he talks about Marley and his philosophies. As someone who listens to his music and has read a lot about his short life, this part definitely touched me, and it obviously isn't featured in the previous two adaptations, as they were both made before Marley became an international superstar.Yes, this film has its flaws, and seems to have gotten a lot of positive feedback as well as negative, but personally, I have to give it a positive review. While not quite a masterpiece, I still found it to be a memorable sci-fi/horror film, with a fair amount of suspense, action, and poignancy. Once again, I don't know how it compares to the book or the previous two adaptations of it, and clearly, it seems to be widely considered inferior to those, but while that may be true, I cannot join the naysayers on this one. If you see this version of ""I Am Legend"", I guess you could easily end up on either side, but if you want to see a combination of sci-fi, horror, and drama, and you're a Will Smith fan, I think it's worth a try, and yes, it just MIGHT help a BIT if you're a Bob Marley fan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"""I Am Legend"" is working because of Will Smith","Yesterday I watched ""I Am Legend"" and I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised with few things. It's very hard to make apocalyptic movie, that is mostly based on one character, who fights with some nasty creatures. You have to make good special effects, you have to hire good actor and you have to make a good story so people could enjoy themselves. ""I Am Legend"" succeeds on every single level because it's made on great book by Richard Matheson. Of course this is Hollywood blockbuster so the movie isn't completely true to the book, which bothers me the most. The genius story of the book is not totally transfered to the big screen and that can easily be seen in the ending (there is no happy ending for humanity as known) and in the little things that are very important (dog came to Neville on a different way). But if you put aside all those things, you have a story that is not boring for a minute, excellent shots of empty streets of New York and what's most important: Will Smith is brilliant. His role is very demanding and Smith takes it all on his back. Smith is emotional and strong at the same time, his role is believable and he again proved that he became top class actor. What to say then ""I Am Legend"" is working because of Smith.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Bears little resemblance to the book that spooked me as a teenager!,Saw I Am Legend yesterday and thought it to be a very well done film. Will Smith had a tremendous role to carry and carry it well he did. The book scared me spit less as a teenager and was out of print for many years but I did re-read it recently. This film carries the spirit of Richard Matheson's book but bears little resemblance to it. I do realize that the film had to be updated to make it commercially acceptable. What it did not do though is scare me. Richard Matheson is to written horror what George Carlin is to comedy. The best. Few movies can or do conjure fear in the audience. They usually don't let our minds take off and work with the story. Loved the dog but that's no surprise - I love dogs. The Smith child is another adorable. The film stands alone but so does the book from which it came.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A good sci-fi that balance thriller and commercial aspects in a more efficient way. The danger is around every corner and thr audience is wisely reminded of this at all times,"Released in 1954, the novel I Am Legend, by Richard Matheson, is in its third film adaptation - and should win many more in the future. The reason is the excellent ideas contained in the work, which relate to humanity's most primal fears, which do not age. This basis is the same in the three films - Dead that kill (1964), The Omega Man (1971) and the current one, I Am Legend (2007) - all absolutely aesthetically distinct and iconic representatives of their times.The first quoted and most faithful work featured a great and embittered Vincent Price, but failed due to the zombified vampires who did not pose any threat, while The Last Hope on Earth (from 71), with an amusingly unsympathetic Charlton Heston, partially sank thanks to the ""satanic cult leader"" style adopted by Anthony Zerbe's villain, since the film had made the bad choice of combining, in a single creature, the two versions of vampires existing in Matheson's work. ""I Am Legend"" is a typical blockbuster, loaded with competent Hollywood megalomania, but with the ""something extra"" that marks the good representatives of the genre. If ""28 Days Later..."" has one of the coolest abandoned city scenes ever made, I Am Legend has an entire movie of them - and shot in real New York, interrupting the veins of the frantic capital of the world for the sake of fun.Written by Mark Protosevich ""(Poseidon"", ""The Cell"") and Akiva Goldsman (""A Beautiful Mind"", ""I, Robot""), the film opens with an interview during which a certain Dr. Alice Krippin confirms that she has discovered a cure for cancer - something that Emma Thompson (in an uncredited cameo) announces after a subtle pause, as if she can hardly believe herself, proving that a good actress doesn't need a big role to make a difference. Strong impression. Soon after, however, the story jumps three years in time and, in a shock heightened by the contrast with the news that came before, we discover a New York taken over by grass and wild animals. It is then that we are introduced to the protagonist, Lieutenant Colonel (and doctor) Robert Neville - apparently, the last survivor of the human species after the Krippin virus wiped out most of the population and turned the rest into blood-feeding aberrations.Just like Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away"", here Will Smith has the difficult task of carrying the narrative alone, arousing the public's interest in his character's tribulations without being able to depend too much on the dialogues - and, proving the charisma shown in films like Looking of Happiness, Men in Black and Independence Day, the actor does admirably well in the task. Portraying Neville as a guy who clings to routine in order not to go crazy, Smith gives a touching aspect to the way in which the character insists on watching programs recorded on video or talking to mannequins in order to simulate a normality that is far from existing. . In the same way, the obsessive nature of his search for a cure (how does he intend to convince the monsters to submit to the treatment?) reveals a moving denial of his condition of eternal solitude - and it is precisely when he thinks he has seen someone alive in the midst of city that he finally lets his mask of passivity fall, revealing an almost beginning of insanity when he shouts at a mannequin in one of the most dramatic moments of the narrative (and which is echoed in the scene in which he begs, in contained despair, for an answer he never will come).And if Hanks had the Wilson volleyball, Smith here gains a much more expressive partner, the dog Sam: the only living being to keep the doctor company, she becomes one of his last links with the past - and the actor, intelligent, he demonstrates understanding of the animal's importance to his character by portraying Neville's panic when he realizes that Sam has put himself in danger. By the way, this sequence, which takes place in a dark warehouse, is vital because it performs a dual function, since it also introduces the audience to the villains of the film - and, once again, Smith is right when he demonstrates the true fear that the protagonist feels of the creatures: breathing heavily and obviously fighting the urge to just run away, he persists in his mission just for the love of Sam. In addition, the actor also deserves applause for holding the camera's cruel gaze in the scene where we see him in close-up while, off the field, he performs a particularly painful action, in yet another moment of great impact.One of the great merits of Francis Lawrence's (Constantine) direction is to show that danger is around every corner, in every dark alley, in every abandoned building. And we are wisely reminded of this at all times. Which does not mean that we are not caught by surprise with each new scare. The director gives strong realism to the plot of I Am Legend. Relying on the viewer's intelligence, he wastes no time hammering information through expository dialogue, opting instead to subtly present it through a magazine cover (a Time) taped to the hero's fridge door or an information leaflet. About ""vampire dogs"" seen briefly in an abandoned apartment. Likewise, instead of including an unnecessary scene in which Neville would explain how he prevents the monsters from scenting him, Lawrence simply includes a quick shot in which we see the guy spreading vinegar on his apartment building door, leaving it to us to draw our own conclusions. Finally, by including a flash of the protagonist's family in the kitchen, when he sees an unknown woman and child in the room, the filmmaker subtly and elegantly portrays all the emotional turmoil that that vision evokes for the subject.The director perfectly understands one of the most obvious and ignored concepts of the Seventh Art: you don't have to tell what you're showing - and the silent film, which has almost two-thirds resting on just one character - is perfect for exploring this. The filmmaker tells his story with images and Will Smith responds to it as the last man standing in an infected city. He has a few monologues, but accompanies his director in the small moments that give the film all its richness. It's in the details and research that the backstory is, not the flashbacks and text.But that's not all: the presentation of the villains is done gradually and extremely effectively by the filmmaker, who initially only reveals the effect that the Krippin virus causes in rats. From then on, we hear the creatures' screams in the distance until, finally, in the already discussed warehouse sequence, Lawrence and editor Wayne Wahrman build an almost unbearable climate of tension by interspersing closed frames that show Neville and others who are more open and taken by darkness, when we only see the hero's flashlight beam running through the environment. And even so, the director postpones the moment of revelation as much as possible, arriving, first, to show only the backs of his monsters.And it's a pity, therefore, that the creatures themselves are so disappointing: created on a computer, they are nothing more than terribly artificial digital puppets that appear almost as an anti-climax to the film's careful presentation. Incidentally, they are a perfect synthesis of the dangers of technology as far as Cinema is concerned: the fact that it is possible to create digital characters does not mean that this is the best option for all cases, as I Am Legend would benefit tremendously from good and old makeup job. The rest of the movie is heavily concerned with scientific fidelity, so how do you explain that infected people gain super strength, super speed, inhuman jaws, become able to climb walls, etc.? Okay, that's a bit precious, after all, Matheson's work talked about human-vampires... but if I Am Legend sought realism all the time, the animals just don't convince in the end. Monsters in the tradition of a George A. Romero would be a lot scarier - but a lot less commercial.Regrettably, another ineffective aspect of the feature resides in the character of Brazilian Alice Braga. Not that the actress is to blame, who does what she can with the unidimensional Anna: linked to a script that sees her only as a dramatic device to give weight to the third act, Braga already enters the scene in an artificial way, acting as a frustrating god ex machina to get Neville out of a difficult (not to say impossible) situation. From then on, it is used by the scriptwriters to try to attribute thematic relevance to the story, indulging in a silly and superficial speech about God. It is as if they had concluded that the film lacked a theological discussion and decided to throw it into the story anyway to symbolize the emotional redemption of the protagonist, who denies God in a moment only to, minutes later, accept Divine Providence as the logic that governs the world. Finally, the only way the script finds to bring Neville and Anna together is through the music of Bob Marley... of whom the girl has never heard of. Unbelievable.Either way, there are plenty of qualities to justify a visit to Matheson's universe through Lawrence's eyes. Smith is as competent as ever (watch out for the scene with the dog in the lab), the filmmaker knows what he's doing and the script has a different rhythm than what you usually see out there. And if commercial concessions exist, well, at least they worked perfectly within the studio's intentions. ""I Am Legend"" is a film that works in its most important aspect: our identification with the protagonist. Robert Neville. And the dramatic impact of its denouement is a tribute not only to the director's talented narrative, but also to the charisma of the increasingly efficient Will Smith.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
This movie was truly an awesome movie that was moving throughout the entire movie.,"First, my reaction is ""WOW."" This movie was really great. I was disappointed to hear the negative feedback regarding the emotional depth of Will Smith. I think Will Smith did an excellent job playing this role. He really took on a characteristic that could be any one of us that happened to be in that situation.The Plot of the story was good. It's kind of difficult, however, that you really have to pay attention to the plot because you can easily be lost. The movie begins with a quick summary which you make an assumption of what's going on, and the movie takes you to today of the movie. The movie had great characters and scenarios. This is what made the movie great. Also, the movie is scary. I admit that this movie was scary, and I'm usually never scared of movies. If you happened to be scared of simple scary movies, I recommend you seeing it during the day. I saw it at night and left a little scared. My girl left frightened. haha.The downfall of the movie is going to be the lack of understanding what's going on. I'm personally one of a viewer who likes to watch a movie and not think to hard on what's going on when the movie is still playing. I get lost, and some pieces of the movie feel left out. I really never got to understand how Robert Neville got there by himself, and the development of everything which he came through to today of the movie. I was disappointed on the transformation of what happens resulting in the movie which was saddening. If you watched the movie, you know exactly what I'm talking about.The movie was really great overall. I was really touched by everything that happened. Someone else wrote a review and basically said the right thing. The ending made the purpose of the title of the movie. Will Smith displayed great emotion again with the entire movie. I thought it was hilarious, and he did normal human emotions, such as talking to his dog Sam. The movie touched great elements of his life and reactions and emotions. I know I keep using the word emotions, but the movie was really emphasized on his feelings. I really encourage many to watch this movie. You will not be disappointed. This movie takes most movies to another level.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Disappointing,"You know when you finally watch a film that you've seen bits of so many times, and then you watch it but you're left feeling like 'that's it?'First half started off really well, nice tense scenes and post-apocalyptic environments, and no doubt Will Smith at his prime always put in 100%. But then the first infected person shows up on screen, and from that point the plot becomes nonexistent, cliche or just filled with dumb decisions that are all even more tanked on by the awful ending. The CGI of the creatures is really, really, really awful and is the worst version of a bad PS3 video games cutscenes.Very mediocre directing, sound design, and overall story. Disappointing to say the least, there isn't much that this film has to offer tbh.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
great movie,"I wanted a little more at the end, but overall a great movie.It seemed to me that the movie was kind of short, but that could be because the movie was so good that it just sucks you in. Will Smith did a great job with being alone in most of the movie. It has to be hard not having people to do lines with. I think this is the best physical shape he has been in since Ali. I am truly impressed with the skill that went into making this movie. I actually went through a lot of different emotions during this movie. At some points I was laughing and others I was nearly in tears. There was a great dynamic between him and the dog. I almost wanted to go out and get one just like her. I can truly say that the movie was not a disappointment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I wish it lasted longer,"I think the movie shows us our future, even if it seems funny because it's 'just a movie'.

Worth seeing,"I liked this film quite a bit. But I have to say that for basic eeriness, the Vincent Price version The Last Man on Earth is the best of the three films. But I Am Legend beats out The Omega Man in my books. I agree that the sets were amazing, especially the emptiness of NYC (almost unbelievable!). Smith did a great job with the script, although I don't think he reflected the dementia that Vincent Price showed, but then Charlton Heston couldn't either (and few actors are capable of that). He did have a range of emotion, though, and that helped considerably in conveying the desolation of the last survivor. What I didn't much care for was the ending. The book and previous films had bleak endings and this one didn't get there. But then it's a new millennium and a new type of ending is fashionable for this era, or so it seems. The inclusion of the dog was nice, and the infected dogs.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

I am Legend is a movie about NOTHING at all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
do not see this movie if you have read the book.,"this movie is nothing like the novel written 53 years ago! if you have not read the book,then who cares go see it. you wont be disappointed because you have nothing to be disappointed about. the name of the title ""I AM LEGEND"" is the entire basis of the story which the movie completely ignores and changes. also it completely ignores the vampire creature as a non intelligent head banging freak. in the book they are a new civilization, some are completely infected which makes them vampire like and evil,but some are almost totally human. robert neville goes out to destroy the vampires thinking there is only the violent ones, but since they all sleep during the day, he kills all he can find including the semi human ones. in that sense he becomes a ""legend""to these people as a ghost story that they tell to each other .this movie also ignores the scientific explanations they give to the vampire myth. for instance, the sunlight would bother the infected because the virus made their skin very pale and would dehydrate them which would make them weak. another example would be that a chemical in garlic would irritate the virus thus having an effect on the infected. another would be that the virus made their blood congeal very rapidly thus u couldn't really kill them with bullets, you would have to drive something into their chest that was thick and hard , hence the wooden stake. and the last was the mirrors. they would always be disgusted with how they look now compared to what they used to look like so they did not like mirrors.none of this was explained in the movie.it is almost like Hollywood re-wrote the novel and put it on the big screen thinking nobody had read the original. once again they are wrong thinking that all people are morons and don't read books. i am waiting for the day when Hollywood can actually make an accurate adaptation from a book into a movie. i am surprised that richard matheson is not freaking out about this, i am pretty sure he is still alive. this movie is a huge disappointment.with the technology we have today in film making this could have been one of the best movies of the year. instead it is a ""cgi drenched"",""post- apocalyptic"", ""run away from the zombies"" pile of crap.only people that are die-hard will smith fans who have no knowledge of movies or books that just want to see special effects will like this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Pretty Good Film,"When i saw the teaser of the film i was astonished for the idea , the last man on the earth is not alone , wow , what a cool one , with the help of will smith ( one of my favorite ) it will be great , and when i downloaded it and watched it , i found that it deserves the time , Will smith was very good in his role , the professor who want to have a cure for the plague , and the man who want to defend him self against the Zombies , he sleeps , he eats , he do his experiments , and all of this happen while he think that he is alone in the world , When Anna came to him , she gave him more power to continue , but with the faith that they are the last human , contrariwise Anna how believe in the survivors colony , and the scene which bring them together to talk about god's plan , if u can see will smith's face when he say "" dead "" you think that "" yea , what a nice shot , what a nice film "" and when you see the last scene when he blew himself to protect Anna and Ethan , you will be satisfied with the filmmy rating for the film 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Good for its genre,"This movie was great for its genre. It was a ""War of the Worlds"" type film with the world ending and all. It's plot was good and the over all had most of the elements needed.

I personally rated it an 8 out of 10 because it had all the keys to a good film and I think people will enjoy it.The theater was the most packed I have ever seen since the opening night of ""Superbad"". There were barely any seats left.

Does it hold up in 2023?,"This has no doubt become a modern classic since it's release. It's an iconic role for Will smith and is certainly a loved film by many. However the biggest issue with it is the CGI, it's a shame to see so many movies like this that could be so much better if practical effects where used more. However it's certainly not bad CGI it is considerably worse to what you'd see in cinemas today. As for the actual story and writing of the film I feel it is certainly pretty good. I did feel it sometimes can get a bit dry and boring in parts however it's not too bad. The great acting that's full of emotion and heart is definitely what stands out to me the most however. So overall I would say it's a decent dystopian film that is certainly still worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Not a SciFi classic, but certainly the best telling of this tale.","Will Smith does a creditable job of bringing Richard Matheson's post-apocalyptic tale to life. This story was made into a movie in the 50s (Last Man on Earth), but was kind of boring and low budget. Then there was the 70s Omega Man with Chuck Heston, which was more fun and more action, but still low budget and a little too campy. I am Legend lends the right amounts of action and pathos to the tale, and keeps your interest throughout. Smith's acting is very good, showing that he can do drama as well as romantic comedy. The creatures, brought to life through computer animation, are far superior to the goons in fright wigs seen in Omega Man. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
disappointing,i found this film disappointing cause its a short film and as soon as you get in to the mood of it it is all over. Neville's hideout is meant to be impregnable and he has metal shutters every where on his building but why he had to use the explosives outside his compound to ward of the creatures i don't understand it. earlier whilst he is sleeping in the bath with his dog the dark seekers can be heard shrieking outside perhaps pounding on the protective shutters. i did not mind the c.g.i. effects only the length of the movie had been about 20 min longer it would of been good if the story was explained more.like i said i wish it had been longer and i did not feel that feeling of loneliness or sorry for the character. the lab basement scene really ruined it cause that glass is meant to be really tough and how did them zombies get in it was meant to be a secure area.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Everyone we've ever known is dead!,"Based off of the novel of the same name I am legend follows Will smith as Robert Neville a military scientist. Who after a a supposed cure for cancer is distributed to the Public. End up resulting in most of humanity being infected and transformed into vampiric mutants. Robert spend his day alone in New York City hunting down dark seekers while trying to find a cure. Whether you've read the book it does kinda determine how you view this movie. If you view this movie it is highly recommend that you view the alternate ending which is the true ending to the story. The film itself is a slow burner not much doesn't go at first. Whole the stake of this film rest on Will smith giving a good performance while one of his better known roles. In similarly to Vincent prince in the last man on earth which was the first adaptation of the book. It's rather obvious Will has to carry the whole movie by his self. The 1st half with him and his dog Sam are the most powerful moments of the film. Going by their daily routine with this stage setup with these mannikins are entertaining. Which some dialogue in their that rather Will smith ""I like Sherk"" he's trying to make the best of this while still hoping to find survivors. Eventually he does meet this woman named Anna with a boy named Ethan. Which in All honestly these two are pointless specially with alternate ending you can cut them out entirely.

Does Will Smith have it in for all our classic authors?,"I mean really, first we get that chunk of garbage: I,Robot, which basically stole an Asimov title, and screwed up the rest with a totally non-Asimov story, and now he's hacked up Matheson. His second go around as Will Smith vs Great Authors brings us a story that has been completely changed from the book (as usual with Hollywood, I know, but still.) Even the title, the very words ""I Am Legend,"" take on a new and ridiculously typical Hollywood meaning, and the entire thought provoking depth of the original meaning has been totally lost. If you were unlucky enough to have been given this movie as a Christmas present, birthday present, or dug it out of a dumpster somewhere, do yourself a huge favor, plop it down on your coffee table, grab a tall frosty beverage, and use the disc as a coaster as you prop your feet up and read the book. This just makes me wonder what amazing author he's going to attack next. Will Smith vs Robert Heinlein, or Will Smith vs Ray Bradbury. I really should stop naming names, just in case one of his producers can actually read and says ""Hey Will, ya know what would be great..."", although, judging from this movie they can't, so we're probably safe...until next summer.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Surviving in Silence: A Riveting Apocalyptic Tale,"Directed by Francis Lawrence, this adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic novel immerses viewers in a desolate and eerie version of New York City, where Smith's character, Robert Neville, navigates the deserted streets and abandoned buildings in search of a cure for the virus that has transformed the infected into mindless, bloodthirsty mutants.Smith's portrayal of Neville is a tour de force, capturing the emotional toll of isolation and the unrelenting struggle for survival. His interactions with his faithful canine companion, Samantha, and the mannequins he uses for company are both heartbreaking and poignant, highlighting the depths of his loneliness and desperation.The film's strength lies in its ability to create a palpable sense of dread and tension, as Neville faces constant threats from the infected creatures that roam the city at night. The action sequences are intense and well-executed, with the mutants' relentless pursuit of Neville adding an extra layer of suspense and danger.However, ""I Am Legend"" is not just a mindless action flick; it also explores deeper themes of sacrifice, hope, and the resilience of the human spirit. Neville's unwavering determination to find a cure, even in the face of overwhelming odds, is both inspiring and heartbreaking, making his journey all the more compelling.The film's visual effects are top-notch, with the deserted cityscape and the mutants' grotesque appearances adding to the overall sense of desolation and horror. The score by James Newton Howard perfectly complements the film's somber tone, heightening the emotional impact of Neville's plight.While the third act stumbles slightly with a somewhat contrived and rushed resolution, ""I Am Legend"" remains a gripping and thought-provoking entry in the post-apocalyptic genre. Smith's powerful performance, coupled with the film's haunting atmosphere and exploration of existential themes, make it a must-watch for fans of intelligent and emotionally resonant science fiction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
c'mon people,"Overall, this movie elicited more emotion out of me than I had experienced in a while. The cinematography and set work was stunningly chilling, that aspect alone puts the movie up there on my list. If you are looking for a movie that will make you cry, laugh, jump out of your skin then here is your choice.A fair warning on all the ""jumpy"" parts thrown in. They are a bit used and abused.The casting decisions probably couldn't have been matched with any other actor today, or in other words, no one else would have really done it the justice it needed. I was only left wanting more from the CGI work and ""villain"" depiction. It wasn't awful, but I feel that it definitely could have been handled better. Now, if they had taken the villains of 30 Days Of Night, matched them to the plot and background of Legend, then there would be no room for improvement there. If that sort of thing doesn't bother you either way then there aren't many things to pick apart.The story development carried along and kept me anticipating, although you can see the outlines of how the story might unfold, but certainly not enough to have any reason to pan it. I will say it was the last 30 minutes that really stuck with me, being best topped by the heroic final sequence. I left with chills and tears in my eyes. Yes it is a remake, as were about 4 other versions of the Richard Matheson novel, so that's not enough reason to write this off as the movie scene being dead and unoriginal. Going in there with expectations of seeing a novel directly reincarnated on film is not a realistic and not a good way to go into any movie. I am just beginning the novel now. But, if you don't want to see a movie to see a movie, then stop going to the movies, and hey, maybe you can do it better. I hope all of you who go to see it find it equally as thrilling and thought provoking as I did.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Wonderful Smith, well-directed thriller","Anyone familiar with Richard Matheson's story about the last man to survive a massive worldwide plague will have very little to complain about regarding this newest adaptation, with Will Smith as the slightly crazed Dr. Robert Neville, the harried former military doctor who's been waiting for signs of other survivors for three long years.Every day, Neville gather supplies from throughout New York City, and every evening, at dusk, he shutters his abode against the onslaught of zombie creatures that live only in the dark. Well, against those who'd attack if they knew where he lived. Which they don't, really. And Neville has it made, at least in terms of resources. He has generators for electricity, so he can cook his own food (and for his dog, Sam). He has great security. He can watch movies to his heart's content. But after three years, he's more than a little lonely - he's beginning to go crazy. (He's even positioned mannequins in the video store so he can ""converse"" with them each day.) We have a vague idea of what caused 99% of the Earth's population to die, but the movie's more concerned with the aftermath; how Neville survives, and how he lost his family. (Hint: It's not because of the plague.) And this is where the strength of Will Smith comes into play. Until recently, Smith was mostly Action Guy - Independence Day, Bad Boys, I, Robot, and so on - and basically thrived on dopey catch phrases. Good news! There are no catch phrases in this movie. In fact, Smith has to actually emote and act, and damn if he doesn't do an exemplary job. Remember when Tom Hanks chatted up a volleyball? Same sorta thing, only Smith's talking to his German Shepherd; he needs to in order to keep hold of the tenuous gossamer strands of his slippery sanity.When he's not out gathering provisions and scouting for people, Neville is busy in his basement lab, trying desperately to reverse the virus and cure everyone. I'm not sure about the science angle of this, but since Neville himself is immune, he figures he can inject one of the zombie creatures with his blood, but that doesn't work. So he keeps at it, adding things, taking away things. It's all very scientific.Smith's beautiful, evocative performance is among the best he's ever given, about on par with the maudlin The Pursuit of Happiness; I Am Legend is an action movie that doesn't smack you over the head every five seconds with, well, more action; it instead builds suspense and then pays off. Multiple times. One reason this works is that director Francis Lawrence employed a hand-held camera during many of the more violent scenes, and it's usually a pretty effective method - it's just that sometimes the zigzagging is a little jarring. Still, not a big problem.There are some differences between this movie and the original story, but they're not bad differences, exactly; an example of a story being updated while not being demonstrably altered. And here's another plus - although you do get to see the creatures - and they're pretty nasty looking - you don't see them often enough to get used to them, or their hideous screeches, or their no-holds-barred, uninhibited, visceral behavior.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Yes they may not look absolutely real...but there not enough to spoil the movie (for me). And i say that strongly. Also not the most original of movies, as it has ''zombie'' like creatures in it which do seem to be common at the moment...also has the hole virus infection thing like the ''resident evil'' movies and ''28days later'' ''28weeks later''.Saying that it does enough to make me recommend it.Its not completely original but it does it well.Worth a watch!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I Am Legend,"If you don't cry, you are heartless. If you don't get scared, you are fearless. If you are Will Smith, you are legend. It currently holds a record of ""the best-ever December opening weekend with $76.5 million USD of domestic box-office sales1"" which even topped Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Based on the amazing novel by Richard Matheson, I Am Legend is one of the greatest Sci-Fi Thriller movies to date.Dr. Alice Crippen (played by Emma Thompson) reveals over a TV interview that she has cured 10,009 cancer patients by engineering a virus to become helpful to humans rather than harmful. The scene cuts off and we are now looking at Manhattan, New York, three years later. A little emptier than it is today, not a person in sight, hardly any cars, only ones parked on the street. A Mustang GT500 speeds through the deserted streets, Dr. Robert Neville (played by Will Smith) and his dog, Sam, drive around Times Square hunting for foodone of his daily routines. We watch Neville pretend he's living in a regular world, cooking dinner for himself in an apron, listening to music, washing his dog in a bathtub, then he closes up, locks all doors and windows with extra protection, and goes to sleep. Then, he suddenly has a flashback. He remembers a piece of the past, back when he and his family had to evacuate Manhattan. Pieces of this flashback occur throughout the movie to help us understand the horrific day that haunts Dr. Neville, and push him forward to finding a cure.The entire first third of the movie engages the audience into this fictional future, and we learn all about the characters (or character in this case) and atmosphere. The middle is filled with confusion, mystery, and sadness. Robert Neville falls down the pyramid of life's needs, and is struggling to crawl back up in the third half, filled with anger, depression, and fear. During all of this, the audience is riding a roller-coaster that features every emotion: anticipation, comfort, happiness, sadness, laughter, fear, depression, joy, disgust, love, vulnerability, and relief. Out of all the movies based on the original novel, The Last Man on Earth, The Omega Man, and I Am Legend, although The Last Man on Earth may be the closest to the plot of the novel, I Am Legend provides us with what a movie should. It has amazing computer graphics without overdoing it, minimal use of background music in the best possible way, and outstanding acting by Will Smith. This movie is legendary.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Alright movie...... Could have been better,"Okay, I would really like to give this movie 6 1/2, but thats not an option. And since Will Smith did a really good job,...

He definitely carried this movie through til the end. His interaction with his dog, etc..... was very convincing and you could imagine how he felt and what state of mind he was in.Also, the idea behind this movie is really good. (yes I know it is a remake) My problem is that this movie had a lot of potential,... but in my opinion it didn't capitalize on it. And also, where as most movies drag on for like 15 minutes after they should have ended,........ I really felt like this movie would have been better if it had maybe ran a little longer.Really wish it would have shown a little more of the ""dark seekers"". Maybe shown some flashbacks of the virus taking over, and people de-evolving into these creatures. Maybe a little more interaction between Smith and the main ""dark seeker"".But mainly I was disappointed with the ending.

Its a beautiful movie in a strange sort of way and although short of cast it makes up in the sense of relationship between a broken and lonely man with the one thing he has left. You feel the sense of disaster quickly and its bold however all the way through I got a feeling that something was missing. Not a lot happens but there are some emotional and heartfelt moments to make up for this. There is also some thought provoking moments to create the idea of what Nevilles situation would really be like. Although the plot is simple and short its effective, this is mainly down to the way it was shot. The major plus of this movie is Will Smith, he is superb. He acts incredibly and takes his role to another dimension. The major flaw happens to be its lack of loyalty to its source, Richard Matheson's novel. It strays a little to far in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Great movie,"I think this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It seems like Will Smith can do no wrong, his movie Pursuit of Happiness last year was amazing too. He's just an excellent actor all around. Smith did an awesome job in this movie, especially since he was not only the main character, but throughout most of the movie, he was the only character.I think this movie's only downfall was the development of the characters personalities. It was lacking a lot in that department. But the plot, story, camera shots, everything else was right on. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Uncanny good performance of mr Will Smith,"No, I'm not a fan. But William, prince of bell air shines in this flick. Contrair to I Robot Mr Smith does show what it takes to carry a movie. No comparison to the Omega Man this is a much watchable flick. Really go see it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I am impressed,"There are many parts of the film which stand out of me. The incredible way they turned New York into a ""ghost town"" and the detail they put into it. The long shots and wide angles they used to show us that there is nobody left, that New York is dead, was really impressive. But the performance of Will Smith is what captured me throughout the film. It takes a lot for a single actor to hold the audience all by himself and in my mind, he pulled it off. From the solider like persona to the scientist to the man talking to his dog and joking with the mannequins, he grasped them all. I kept thinking to myself that guy who played in The Fresh Prince and Men In Black has grown up into an incredible actor, with a performance I cannot find a match for this year. Well Done Will Smith.I do however feel the movie would have been more effective had the zombie like creatures been played by actual people rather than magically CGI effects. I think it would have brought a more terrifying understanding of what had happened if we could see raw emotion in the monsters rather than another Alien type creature we are all so use to in scary movies which cause ourselves to say ""it's just a computer animation"". I do understand that the idea was that Will Smith was suppose to be ""The last man on earth"", so I can see why they did what they did.That being said, it is a movie I am glad I watched and felt that it was more of a sad story than a scary one. It broke my heart twice and when you see it, you will know when.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Legend in a making?,"This sci-fi horror flick plays on your fear: what if you were the last man on earth?

The post-apocalyptic NYC has been brilliantly re-created with an eerie ambiance.Will Smith plays his character with great intensity and perfection. There are parts in the movie where you will find his idiosyncrasies amusing especially his interaction with inanimate objects. The zombies on the other hand, seems like they imported these zombies straight from a video game with superhuman strength and a bad attitude.

Really entertaining,"This is by far the best of the ""last man alone, apocalyptic future"" type movies out there. lately i've been a big bored in the theaters, but not this time. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the whole movie and was really grabbed by the suspense.Will Smiths performance is as usual very entertaining and pretty good, he's probably one of my favorite actors, there isn't really any movie i don't like him in, and i don't think anyone else could have played this part any better.I say overall anyone who was thinking about seeing this movie but isn't sure should definitely take a look, its worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Legend's a Notch Above,"As amusing as Will Smith putzing around an abandoned New York City, doing things that you've daydreamed of like picking any random car and driving it around the city or golfing at skyscrapers, or as frightening the shocks Francis Lawrence shows us at just a pace to keep your nails dug into the seat, what sets this apart from say 28 Days Later or Dawn of the Dead, is the humanistic quality among the chaos. I loved the two afore mentioned films, because they were scary and a lot of fun, but I Am Legend offers that with genuine moments that will tug and pull on your heart, and make you feel a way that most zombie movies aren't going to make you feel. I'd like to give a large portion of that credit to Will Smith. If you've seen Ali, and Pursuit of Happiness, you know what a magnetic force Will Smith has turned out to be on the screen. The intensity he paints across the screen, showing us his frustration, pain and loneliness all the while being a hero along side an Indiana Jones. Francis Lawrence who previously directed Constantine, shows his affinity for shock shot direction, pacing the action so you never know when somethings going to jump out at you. Sometimes it's just cheap, and sometimes it's genius. He's a very talented director that I think will take up the camera for several more action/horror/blockbluster movies just as I Am Legend and Constantine (side not, I didn't like Constantine although I thought Lawrence's direction was good for it, but he's improved here.) If the zombie's look a little less than authentic after a while you might consider that a flaw in the whole movie. Don't hesitate to see it if you get the chance. I am telling you, I am Legend doesn't disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Not Too Shabby,"This is another film that gets a lot of hate, mostly because of the ending. I thought it was a decently done post-apocalyptic film that features only one actor for the majority of the film. It was a fun watch that executed better than many critics would like to admit. It may sound like I'm heavily praising this film for something I only have a 6/10 to, but I think I Am Legend's negatives have already been magnified in other reviews.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
My 2 Cents,"The movie is yet another concept of humans changing into monsters due to some maltreatment. The movie spins around no one else but Will Smith (Dr.Robert Neville) and his Dog (Samantha). Apart from these two you can see some savage ugly and nasty monsters who lurk in the dark and hence the name Dark Seekers.Though the movie is around Robert Neville, who appears in all the scenes you would not find the movie boring as Will Smith has put all his acting skills and made sure the folks watching it wont get bored. Kudos Will.The movie wont be much of a surprise and a new story for the dudes who are fans of the Resident Evil series but it is still worth the money.The point to notice for the Resident Evil fans is that the Monsters in this movie are not as dumb as the T virus struck folks. The Dudes have lost their basic survival instinct but still they work as a clan. They are a pretty scary bunch. They can think,plot and also have a leader. Thats new. These intelligent dumb monsters make the movie more interesting. Can watch the movie twice...but it depends on your views...If you are a SAW or any other movie where there is a lot of blood..then this movie definitely wont satisfy your primal instincts. The movie is pretty scary though...not frightening.Let me...see....thats it...go ahead...and watch the movie...Its good...8.0/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
it was ok,"The film I Am Legend is a film directed by Francis Lawrence in 2007. It's about a guy trying to find a cure in a place where almost everyone is turned into Vampires/zombies and he is living as well as he can and if he can get supplies. He starts to go kinda crazy because of all the alone time so he uses mannequins so he doesn't feel alone in the city. Will Smith did good acting in this movie,it was mostly him alone the whole time until by the end. I liked the style of the movie and how it was made because it's what everyone would try to do if it would happen and it is surviving a lot but the ending didn't make much sense because they said they were in the island but it was a good movie but it would of been better if it showed what happened to the people after the cure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
i am legend rocks,"This by far was one of the greatest films of 2007. I just loved it. The thrills, the action, the direction and to top it all Will Smith's best performance to date. Here in this film we have a post apocalyptic NYC and Robert Nevill( Will Smith) is the only man accompanied by his pet dog Sam. We have indeed heard most plots like these yet this movie goes far above the likes of 28 days or weeks later and i'm a big fan of those movies yet I like I am legend way better. Of course 28 days or weeks later has better thrills, more gore, better monsters and high octane scenes. Yet ( i can't believe a big fan of gore is saying this) I am legend is deeply emotional and focuses on its main character largely and the authenticity of a post apocalyptic world. But the best thing that I loved about this movie is that Will Smith's performance was pure brilliance. I only wished they could award him with an Oscar. Because he carried this film so well with great emotional performances and give a new definition to the post apocalyptic era. By far THIS IS THE BEST AND I MEAN IT. THE BEST POST APOCALYPT HORROR, DRAMA MOVIE EVER.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I am impressed,Before seeing this film I was iffy about if it would be good or whether it would just be another end of the world action movie. It is actually quite the contrary. This movie is full of emotional scenes AND scenes that will have have you on the edge of your seat. From the start of the movie you'll be wondering why will smith is alone and you will find out why in the film. Your heart will pound in your chest as you follow Smith through an eerily quit times square. I'm not about to ruin the film but it does a good job of explaining why Smith is the only person walking around. As you follow Smith through the film you will learn not only about why the city seems so empty but you also get go deeper into his mind and learn about him. This movie is about that person who is alone in this world and just looking for a special friend. Luckily Smith is that person and its a hell of a good time watching Smith deal with his surrounds. In the end I think you'll have gone through enough different emotions to appreciate that person sitting next you in the theater.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Performance Piece!,Robert Neville is the last man on earth or is he...? This is the question posed to the viewer throughout the film. Neville(Smith) is left alone in New York City after a virus meant as a cure unleashes a plague on the entire world and pushes the human race to the brink of extinction. The film explores this post apocalyptic world with Neville and his dog Sam as he tries to find a cure to reverse the damage done. A nice mix of genres come together to elevate this beyond the average Christmas time film or blockbuster. Smith's command of the screen shines through and carries us past the monotony that has become Neville's day to day. The only point of real weakness for the film comes in the final act however it avoids typical Hollywood clichés just long enough. By the end the audience welcomes the end as if it were a true story.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Surprisingly good, albeit flawed, ""Legend""","There is a certain majesty and genuine creepiness present in the early sequences of ""I Am Legend,"" an apocalyptic sci-fi/horror, last-man-on-Earth featuring Will Smith as Robert Neville, our heroic Last Man on Earth. The film opens with Neville, accompanied by his German Shepherd Sam, driving a new Ford Mustang through the streets of a barren New York City chasing a herd of deer. Stalking one through Times Square, he's about to pull the trigger when he discovers that a lion is about to have a much better day.And so begins ""I Am Legend,"" an adaptation of the Richard Matheson novel, and had it come out in 2001 or 2002, it might fair better in the area of being a genuinely frightening sci-fi/horror flick. Other similarly themed movies have come out over the years, most notably ""The Omega Man"" (1971) and more recently ""28 Days Later..."" (2002), all of which have had varying degrees of success in adapting Matheson's work or taking the theme to a whole new dimension.In ""I Am Legend,"" the year is 2012, five years after a viral cure for cancer mutated into an even deadlier virus that turned much of the world's population into bloodthirsty vampires. As a result, the island of Manhattan was quarantined with all bridges leading onto it destroyed. He has the city all to himself during the day, feverishly working on a cure (to which he seems to have had some success at doing because he's somehow immune) but at night, it's time to batten down the hatches of his Central Park brownstone because at night, the city belongs to them - the ""Darkseekers"" (the plague-infected vampires) that own the night and the city when they come out to feed.A wrinkle in the plot comes in the form of beautiful Anna (Alice Braga) and a young boy named Ethan (Charlie Tahan), who have somehow managed to survive through this thing, thus no longer making Neville the Last Man on Earth. She says that they're heading north because there is a rumored ""sanctuary"" somewhere in the mountains of Vermont, where the virus cannot survive due to the cold. Neville is skeptical, but Anna is absolutely positive because she believes that there is still a God up there.The early scenes of the film featuring only Smith and his loyal canine companion Sam are the best sequences of the entire picture. I'm not sure how director Francis Lawrence achieved the effect of a deserted New York City but it is damn compelling. And we get to see fairly early who Neville's nocturnal adversaries are in one particularly suspenseful scene.But one area that ""I Am Legend"" seems to suffer from is the Last Man on Earth Really Isn't the Last Man on Earth Syndrome. It's one of the things that has repeatedly killed these sorts of movies in the past. I seriously think the movie would have been better had it just been the ""Will Smith Show Live & Uncut"" for 100 minutes. And another area that really faults the movie is its climax, which is a sort of haunted-house routine that kind of ends anti-climatically and felt more than a little cheap. Of special effects, there is no shortage of them, even if these effects look a little unrealistic for today's highly sophisticated times.While ""I Am Legend"" has plenty of faults, it is a chilling effective sci-fi/horror picture that does deliver in terms of shocks and special effects. I only hope the next Last Man on Earth is truly the Last Man on Earth.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
From the legendary writer Richard Matheson (DVD),"I knew the story even before the release of this movie because it is originally a novel from Matheson, the same good writer of ""The Skrinking Man"" and ""Duel"". But I never read it and I always wondered how to explain the title:How can the last man among vampires be a legend?Now I understand!The twist has been unveiled in a mesmerizing way:I don't see lately a movie with such loneliness, grief. Will Smith is a surprise here because he tries a new suit for him: he leaves the smiles, the fun for the darkness and pain. The entire movie, he lifts alone a sad life and when everything falls apart, he fights every second. Smith is really good and he should do more drama!The vision of an empty New York is surreal and as attracting as scary! Between ""the Stand"" and ""War of the Worlds"", the terror is never so high when it takes root in our daily life. ""Dracula"" is maybe frightening but as Pennsylvania is far away, it is also baroque. Not here. The reality is cold, uncompromising. Sometimes we wished to be all alone and this movie as the french ""Seuls Two"" brings an haunting visual and emotional experience.In conclusion, a brilliant movie that hurts consequently the vampires!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I don't get you people!!!,"I must say 1 thing... No statue was ever made for a critic. If you do not enjoy the film thats one thing. But for you people to say it wasn't executed properly that you must be very mis-informed. Will Smith is going to go down as one of the best actors of this time. He was great , the flashbacks were great, and the rabies were described perfectly. Everything fit and if you didn't like it than you must be one of those glass half empty type. The ending was exactly what you expected and I don't mean that in a bad way. He did what he had to do and made sure there was always hope.

"Good, But CHILDREN OF MEN Was Better","Third and best adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic science fiction novel. Special kudos to Will Smith, who manages to hold the screen with nothing more to interact with than a German Shepherd. Unfortunately, the ending is marred by pseudo-philosophical babble about God and Bob Marley (!), not to mention a lengthy plug for SHREK. (Do Will Smith and Eddie Murphy run in the same posse?) They should have stuck with the original ending from the novel: the vampires form their own society, and Will Smith's character realizes that now HE is the monster (hence the title). Last year's under-appreciated CHILDREN OF MEN did a much better job of balancing hope and despair, without tipping over into sentimentality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Not quite there...yet,"This movie falls short of being the definitive post-apocalyptic movie I have been waiting to see since I first saw Romero's Dawn of the Dead (DOTD). Although Will Smith was an excellent choice for this movie the CGI zombies were appalling. You have to ask why they did not use real actors like in 28 Days/Weeks Later which were horrifying. The bloodshot eyes of the infected in Days/Weeks truly hit the mark. The only time IAL came close was the scene with the mother trying to get her daughter past the checkpoint in one of the flashback sequences. Her bloodied eyes and tears of blood lifted that sequence considerably.However, CGI aside, what really failed in this movie was the lack of any screen time covering the end of civilization. Sure we get to see the streets of New York 3 years later and sure we get a look at someone's abandoned apartment. However, I wanted to see more during the time the virus began to spread and panic began to break out. I wanted to see how people survived and barricaded themselves in at night  living in fear and terror with the noises going on outside. What would you do in a similar situation? How well could you fortify your abode? How long could you last before you had to make excursions to find supplies? What if you were trying to hide out in an industrial area where supplies would be scarce? Referring back to 28 Weeks Later (again), the best sequence in that movie was the first 5 minutes with the group of survivors living in a farmhouse. The tension in that first 5 minutes was second to none and when he left his wife behindsublime moment in horror movie making. What would you have done?What I would have done to improve IAL: 1. Use real actors over the abysmal CGI. 2. Add 30 minutes to the beginning of the movie show casing the decline of civilization. 3. Show Will Smith fortifying and stocking his home to protect his family from not only the infected but also other survivors. Imaging having to fear both during the day and night! 4. The last 2 hours could have been all about Will Smith surviving and trying to find a cure for his Wife and or Child who had become infected. This could have made the story a more selfish mission of just trying to save his family and not the world. Think of how he might have hunted down his wife/daughter without killing them. Think of how it would have been if it had been his Wife/Daughter on that operating table at the end when the infected were trying to break through. 5. Remove any notion that the infected were intelligent. They should have been nothing more than pack hunters. This is what ruined 28 Weeks Later for me as well. That is, having the father act with intelligence and seemingly recognizing his children after he had become infected.Anyway, overall I give IAL 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Over-hyped and inexplicably overpraised,"I am thoroughly shocked by the sheer amount of positive reviews of this woefully inept film here on the IMDb board, I had the misfortune to sit through this last night and after reading the positive reviews here I thought that I was watching a totally different film. The special effects were terrible and in 6 months time this film will look dated, the whole film was souless, not to mention clichéd, the characterisation was too generic and I can only believe the reason this film got great reviews here on IMDb was because the majority of reviewers were Will Smith fans that would have praised any film in which he starred. The Omega Man while being far from perfect is an easily superior effort and The Last Man on Earth beats it too, 2 classic films in their own right.

I Am Impressed.,"I'm a huge fan of The Omega Man, the 70s film adaptation of Richard Matheson's book I Am Legend, and so when I heard that a new version was on the horizon, starring crowd-pleaser Will Smith and directed by Francis Lawrence (who made the so-so Constantine), I feared the worst.However, I am glad to report that I Am Legend is a hugely entertaining post-apocalyptic chiller, despite featuring that scourge of many contemporary fantasy/horror films: poorly conceived CGI monsters. Lawrence delivers a tight, effective, and very enjoyable movie, and Smith does a commendable job in a role that, for the most part, requires him to interact with just a dog, some mannequins, and a bunch of digital effects.The film opens in a deserted and derelict New York, as Robert Neville (Smith), survivor of a worldwide plague, travels the lonely streets of The Big Apple hunting for food and searching for other humans. Then, as the sun begins to sink, he nervously heads for home (taking special care to cover his trail) where he barricades himself in until dawn, because, when night falls on Manhattan, the infected crawl from their hiding places to feedon blood!Much of the film follows Neville as he goes about his daily routine: hunting, foraging for food, searching for other survivors, talking to shop dummies, driving golf balls off the end of an aircraft carrier, and desperately searching for a cure to the disease that has ravaged the planet. The mundanity and repetitiveness of his life is brilliantly conveyed and the fragility of his sanity is easy to understand.Of course, occasionally, our protagonist's familiar schedule is interrupted by something a little different, such as when (in the film's tensest moment) his trusty canine friend Sam chases a deer into a very dark building, leaving Neville no choice but to follow. And sometimes his experiments require him to capture a live infected specimen. Which is interesting.Eventually, however, Neville's lonely life takes a completely unexpected turn, when, late one afternoon, he falls into a trap set by the infected, and the sun slowly begins to set...Often exciting, sometimes scary, and even occasionally quite sad, I Am Legend is a blockbuster film that actually deliversquite a rarity these days.Shame about those CGI monsters, though.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Story = Good,     Acting = Good,     Scenery = Good,     CGI = Awful","At this point in time, it's safe to say that Will Smith has established himself as a great actor, best known for his heroic, action-filled roles.However, this movie had something different. The protagonist, RObert Neville had to be skilled and intelligent, and Will Smith pulled it off nicely.Smith made being the last man in New York very interesting. Add great scenes of an abandoned New York City, and you have the blueprints for an excellent movie. So why is I Am Legend NOT an excellent movie? I'll tell you why: the CGI was absolutely awful.The CGI for the animals was pretty bad, but not awful. I was able to overlook that if I really tried. However, the CGI for the infected was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! They could have just as easily dressed people up as the infected but no, they HAD to use bad CGI.

I am Legend,"Will Smith Carries this movie with a stunning Oscar-worthy performance. As is his character, Will Smith is famed for putting 100% into the things he does. In this case, he put in 110%. The Entire movie from the acting to the music to the message was enjoyable and worth while.I think the critics are over hyping the ""fact"" that the movie adaptation strayed too far from the book. I found it the opposite. The movie and book had the same basic themes, the movie contained direct quotes, and the only main difference was that the endings were different, which then made the book convey one message while the movie conveyed a different message. However, both messages are powerful and worth conveying, I think so who cares? Anyway, the things the movie did change from the book were only devices used to strengthen the message of the movie, so I think that Hollywood did a good job taking a good story and turning it into something people in present day can get a good message out of.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Strong film that falls a little short near the end,"I Am Legend, based on the Richard Matheson novelette of the same name, is quite good. I loved the pacing and never felt bored with the film even though almost the entire film focuses on just one character and his dog. It falls a little short at the end, but is still a worthwhile experience.In a world where most of humanity has been transformed into zombies or killed off by a man made plaque that was suppose to cure cancer, one man, the lone survivor of New York City, struggles to find a cure and somehow save humanity. His name is Robert Neville, and as played by Will Smith, he gives the character depth. That is something that not all actors can do, and with a film which follows just one character and his dog for about ninety percent of the film's length, I'd have to say Will Smith does a splendid job. We sense his fear, his anger, and his struggles with loneliness since his only companion is an animal that is unable to carry on a conversation.There were some things in the film which made me feel a little leery. One would have to be Neville's confrontations with mannequins. I'm not sure what would happen in real life if someone was left alone for such a long time, but would they actually do what Neville does? And I'm not talking sexual either. If anybody saw Castaway with Tom Hanks which involved a soccer ball, you might know what I mean. Tom Hanks had a character that was alone for a long period as well, but he made it feel a little more convincing then Will Smith does. With Smith, it just felt a little awkward, with Tom Hanks it was a little more natural I guess.Now onto the CGI and the sets and special effects. The director Francis Lawrence did great things with all the New York scenes. New York felt quite desolate, and it had to be hard to get and effect like that in the city that never sleeps. It makes you wonder how long it took to get those scenes to work so well. The creature effects were okay but could've been better, and it was the CGI that weakened the last third or so of the movie. A creature here and there was okay, but then you have a bunch all at once and it was just not as effective.The finale was different from the novel, but it still left and impression after it was over.

The reason why he survived (which i never understood at first) is that he was immune to the virus.Anyway more to the movie, the movie was very tense in the first parts of the movies, i was really scared at some points and it did have some REALLY good shocking moments, so if you are seeing this on the big screen, you'll probably going to crawl down to the floor. Because believe me the first part is really, really tense.Yes that was the first part of the movie, the later parts you are getting more used to everything (i'm not going to spoil). And many things aren't that scary anymore since you've seen it a lot. You'll probably get it.It felt like this movie had two volumes, the first volume is more the slow and thrilling part. While the second volume got more bang bang and all of a sudden it's ZOMBIE CITY!!! There is a major twist in the plot later in the movie which i never thought would happen, of course i won't tell.Anyway is this the best picture of 2007, i don't know. For me the movie year has been kinda weak, i didn't see a GREAT!!! movie though. The movie of the year 2007 for me was American Gangster, which i didn't think was fantastic but it was a good movie. Not that I am Legend is bad, but i now understand why the ratings decreased from 8.0 to 7.4 to fast.I just didn't feel it just as the line say "" I just didn't feel it"". There was some really beautiful parts, with beautiful music that really fitted, and music is the most important point in a movie i think.Anyway this movie gets 75/100 from me, that would be 7.5/10. Well since you can't vote in decimals i will just give it a strong seven, or a weak eight if you like.""A very well made film that will make you jump certain times""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Will Smith is THE MAN!,"I Am Legend is a 2007 post-apocalyptic science fiction film based on Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name. It is the book's third celluloid adaptation. The film stars Will Smith and comes from director Francis Lawrence who earlier directed Constantine.I Am Legend is a futuristic film which is dependent on basically two things : Will Smith, and stunning visuals. The later succeeds in grabbing one's attention to an extent. The visuals of a 2012 Manhattan; empty, deserted, abandoned completely after the spread of a deadly man-made virus, are truly something to marvel at. However, if one remembers, this is nothing new. We have already seen such images in Danny Boyle's earlier film which revolves around a similar story, 28 Days Later. The only difference is that the setting there was London. The let-down here is that the film is a little too dependent on the visual effects. Even the zombies here are CGI as opposed to what they were in 28 Days Later. After a point of time, it no longer seems interesting anymore. There are just two sequences that are actually scary throughout the 100minute film.However, the marvelous thing about I Am Legend are not the visuals, it is Will Smith. The actor shoulders just about everything on his own. It is entirely upto him to keep us involved, to keep us interested. And therein lies the savior of I Am Legend. The film itself might not prove to be much of a legend, but the individual who shoulders just about every second of the film is. Will Smith is The Man. He, singlehandedly, makes I Am Legend what it is. He makes you care. For him, for his pet dog, for his remaining cans of food, for his mental state, everything. The ending of the film was a bit of a let-down, as was the background score. Then again, maybe I was expecting a little too much. It loses out to 28 Days Later when it comes to being a solid post-apocalyptic film with zombies, but it still is quite a good watch.6.5/10. All for Will Smith.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Zombies, again","I know that this movie is based on a ""legendary"" book, and I presume that it received a lot of hype when it came out stateside. From the fact that it's already out on DVD, I guess it didn't do too well at the box-office.I caught it on DVD and without expecting too much, which allowed the movie to surprise me positively. It is very entertaining while you're still trying to figure out what the duck is going on. Will Smith's acting is outstanding, and the movie builds up the suspense very effectively. It's an intelligent and at the same time entertaining movie which brings a fresh breath of death to the often rather stolid horror genre.That said, it's not perfect either. For instance, the CGI-zombies don't work that well (they look fake, like out of a computer game), and there are many other elements of the movie which overstretch the viewer's credulity for the cheap benefit of a quick thrill (strangely in those movies, the viewer usually buys the general premise -- aliens from Nebulon-3 have invaded earth and are now feeding on puppy's brains -- but gets stuck on fairly minor details such as ""Sgt Brubaker fires 13 rounds of transmuto-semtex at the slime-bot when the clip of the T7/A1 holds only 12""). Right at the beginning, for example, Will Smith hunts deer in a ghost-towned New York City by pursuing them in his shiny Ford Mustang -- cool, spectacular, but also pretty moronic, especially as it later turns out that while he never manages to shoot a single animal for food, he has absolutely no difficulty capturing those blood-guzzling zombies alive. Less would often have been more in this movie, the zombies would have been more effective if they had been less visible, the basement lab would have been more believable if it had been a bit less vulcano-lair-ish and his flat more plausible if it had looked less like straight out of the Ikea catalogue, etc. The movie is best in its quiet moments, like when we realise how the relationship between Neville and his dog represents his last bond to his previous life, or how he uses his daily routine of ""renting"" DVDs from a store to keep sane (with varying success).The movie kind of jumps the shark when Anna and that little boy arrive, but luckily it wraps up the story fairly neatly and quickly from there on.And I really can't get over the fact that Anna's never heard of Bob Marley. She's never seen his face, heard his name, and doesn't recognise even his biggest hits. Even my grandma can sing the chorus to ""No Woman No Cry"". From that point on, I was rooting for the zombies.Overall, not a classic but still a solid, entertaining, thrilling movie, with a fantastic performance by Will Smith, and a new twist on an old theme.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Smithy the Vampire Slayer,"It goes without saying that if you're not a fan of Will Smith, this probably isn't the movie for you. For about ninety percent of the running time, he is the only character to be seen, the sole survivor of a virulent plague that has wiped out the entire human race and left him to spend his days wandering around New York city listening to reggae music and talking to shop window dummies. Doesn't exactly sound like the most entertaining movie in the world does it, I mean how interesting can a two hour film be when all it revolves around is one man and his dog? Actually, it's really enjoyable. In fact it's one of the best post-apocalyptic movies out there. Principally, this is down to Smith's powerful performance, the former Fresh Prince bringing a hopeless sense of loss to his character that makes him a very sympathetic leading man. That and the vampires.Like 28 Days Later before it, I Am Legend is a film where the fall of man brings with it some incredibly beautiful cinematography. The numerous shots of an empty, dilapidated New York where herds of deer race around abandoned cars and thick grass has grown through the cracks in the pavement lend an eerie, sombre nature to the film. As Smith's Robert Neville moves round this landscape, he is surrounded on all sides by towering skyscrapers that have turned into extravagant bird's nests. It's a disturbing setting and the sight of our protagonist dwarfed by the empty metropolis does wonders for the atmosphere. The special effects team deserve a hearty pat on the back for the first ten minutes alone.Pity then that the vampires look so rubbish as they had the chance to be truly threatening. The scene where they are first introduced is terrifying, Neville's search for his lost dog through a darkened building ending in a nailbiting chase back to the light. All the tension is dissipated though when you finally get a good look at his foes, badly rendered CGI clichés who look like Gollum on a protein rich diet. The lacklustre villains aren't enough to sink the movie, it's just frustrating to think that make-up and prosthetics would have yielded far more satisfying results.That aside, I Am Legend is still an incredibly entertaining experience and makes for a worthy last trip to the cinema in 2007. Smith gives one of the best performances of his career and it's worth seeing for the depiction of New York alone. Like all things in life though, it's the little things that make it, a fact made perfectly clear in the opening sequence where an overly confident female scientist appears in a television interview about the miracle cure. She's all smiles and self-satisfaction until the reporter asks if they have found a genuine cure for cancer. For a split second a flicker of doubt appears on her face before the smile returns and she confirms it. The next shot is of an abandoned Times Square that reeks of death.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I am Legend,"I find I am Legend's concept is interesting: a disease led to the near extinction of humanity. Will Smith's character is pretty alone for most of the film and is immune to the disease that is wiping out humanity. There are a couple characters in the film that don't get a lot of development. That's what I would change with the movie. Give some more development to the characters.

"""I Am Legend"" (2007) - A Haunting Exploration of Isolation and Survival","Released in 2007 and directed by Francis Lawrence, ""I Am Legend"" is a gripping post-apocalyptic thriller that combines elements of science fiction, horror, and drama. Based on the 1954 novel by Richard Matheson, the film stars Will Smith in one of his most compelling performances as Dr. Robert Neville, a lone survivor in a world ravaged by a man-made plague.The film is set in a desolate, abandoned New York City, three years after a virus intended to cure cancer has wiped out most of humanity, turning those infected into nocturnal, zombie-like creatures known as ""Darkseekers."" As the last uninfected human in the city, Neville spends his days searching for a cure and his nights barricading himself against the relentless Darkseekers.Will Smith carries the film with an intense and emotional performance, capturing Neville's profound loneliness, desperation, and determination. The film's exploration of Neville's psychological state-his struggle to maintain sanity in total isolation-is one of its strongest elements. Smith's portrayal of a man clinging to hope in the face of overwhelming despair is both heartbreaking and riveting.The visual effects effectively create a hauntingly empty New York City, with nature reclaiming the urban landscape, adding to the film's eerie atmosphere. The scenes of Neville navigating this abandoned world, accompanied only by his loyal dog, Sam, are some of the most poignant, highlighting the deep bond between man and animal in the absence of human companionship.The film's action sequences are tense and well-executed, particularly the nighttime encounters with the Darkseekers. These moments of horror are balanced with quieter, more introspective scenes that delve into Neville's backstory and his efforts to find a cure. The contrast between the serene, sunlit city and the terrifying, shadowy nights underscores the film's theme of duality-hope versus despair, life versus death.""I Am Legend"" is not without its flaws, however. The CGI used to create the Darkseekers has been criticized for looking somewhat artificial, which can occasionally break the immersion in an otherwise realistic setting. Additionally, the film deviates significantly from the original novel, particularly in its third act, which has led to mixed reactions from fans of the source material. The film's ending, which emphasizes sacrifice and redemption, differs from the more ambiguous and thought-provoking conclusion of the novel.Despite these criticisms, ""I Am Legend"" remains a powerful and thought-provoking film. It is a poignant exploration of human resilience and the instinct to survive, even in the face of unimaginable loss. Will Smith's performance is a standout, anchoring the film with a mix of vulnerability and strength that makes Neville a truly memorable character.Overall, ""I Am Legend"" is a compelling entry in the post-apocalyptic genre, offering both thrilling action and deep emotional resonance. It's a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll, leaving viewers to ponder the nature of humanity and the lengths to which one might go to save it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
a decent sci-fi thriller,The cure for cancer has been discovered and a genetically modified virus is the solution for our problems but it turns out that this virus is turning humans into man eating zombies and Robert Neville(will smith) is the lone survivor . Now its upto him and his dog Sam to find the cure for this disease and save mankind from extension. So we have Will Smith driving Shelby Mustang GT500 on the 'empty' streets of NYC hunting deers. We get well constructed shots of deserted NYC. The bond between Robert and his dog is amazing. The strength of the movie is its pace with well inserted flashbacks that explain the plot.Will smith is as usual good. But the script has some loose ends and is not very convincing at parts especially when the is a hint of god's intervention to save mankind. Its a worth watching once affair.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Expecting more out of the film,"I just came back from watching I Am Legend and overall I thought it was all right, decent, not a terrible movie. However I felt that many scenes dragged on and didn't seem to get to the point. By the time the credits started rolling, I just had the feeling of empitness of the story. I just felt that they could have added more story to it, maybe develop will smith's character more. My recommendation is to wait to rent the movie. I think its a waste to see it in theaters, especially since now the prices to see movies have gotten expensive. On the other hand, there doesn't seem to be many other good movies out so i guess seeing this one would not be so bad",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A simply plot with a big moral,"I recommend the film.

Some regrets of his past avoid to turn the film to a boried dynamic and helps to understand what has happened to the humanity. The special effects could be better but regarding the movie is from 2007 they are moderately right.

I Am Legend with Will Smith,My take on this movie is great I seen the old Vincent Price movie The Last Man on Earth was he did pretty good and then Omega Man free Charlton Heston was also very good but nothing like Will Smith's on the original title I Am Legend he was very strong and vulnerable at the same time you show different emotions and carry it out this film like the predecessors before handling the loneliness in survival apocalyptic world he carried the whole movie I enjoy this movie immensely I every time I see it the president serves were very good but for some reason Will Smith's acting with the different ranges he played showed his acting ability Bravo Will Smith I wish you would do more movies like this,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Better than the average film,"Even though i had higher expectations for this film, it was still a good film to watch, there seemed to be a few holes in the plot though, and the usual product placement.

I think some people are getting to critical about films nowadays (including myself) and just need to open up their minds a little, its a half decent film to see at the cinema, i don't think it will have any profound effects on anyone, but it will be entertainment none the less.

Watch it,Good. Good contains and have a following 2 different ending,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A movie that manages to keep your mouth open until the end credits start rolling,"I am legend gives a new angle at an apocalyptic epidemic. In terms of the premise, it reminds of the still fresh in memory movie called 28 Days Later, that is: survival in a post-apocalyptic zombie world, which is not a particularly original premise. But in terms of the quality of the execution, it is far better than anything of its kind.The story follows Robert, a scientist who appears to be the only human who remained unaffected by a horrible pandemic that ravaged the world a few years prior. Robert tries to survive, find a cure for the virus and find other survivors.With 90% of the movie centred on Robert, played by Will Smith, fleshing out this character is very important and, thankfully, proper attention is given to this goal. Robert is a man who is set on his goals, maintaining discipline, but at the same time, loses his discipline and composure when overtaken by anger and desperation following the loss of his family and the life in isolation. Will Smith successfully carries the movie on his shoulders, showing the humanity of the character, with all his imperfections.The film spends some time on exploring the ethics of science, though very lightly, and the theatrical ending takes most of that contemplation out. The themes add a little flavour to the movie, but I Am Legend is still primarily about Will Smith going around Manhattan dealing with monsters.The production features excellent shooting and editing, with notable transitions to and from Robert's flashbacks. There are long takes when the camera follows the character around and the shake adds instead of detracting. There are many cool angles and zooms to provide an interesting view of the action.The special effects are a mixed bag. The vampires look a bit silly and generic. There is that generic big mouth opening with a screech that you've seen in so much other horror media, but those shots are quick, so you don't get to focus on the bad CGI. In the scenes where the creatures are shown for longer than a second, they also look much better. There are a few scenes with the car that are clearly computer generated but are shot in the dark, again hiding the imperfections as much as possible.The most distinctive and interesting thing about the visuals is the abandoned Manhattan. Nature is slowly reclaiming the land, as the plants grow through the asphalt and animals take over the streets. It is both beautiful and scary. Will Smith racing through the overgrown Manhattan in the Ford Mustang has become an iconic scene.The building and release of tension in this film is masterful and is responsible for much of this movie's effectiveness. The danger from the creatures is ever-present. The emptiness and isolation causes anything out of place to be immediately suspicious. The sound work is a major contributor to this effective tension.OK, now the endings. The big discussion surrounding this movie has been about its alternate ending that the test audiences rejected, in which Will Smith's character turns out to be ""the monster"" rather than the zombies. This alternative ending is important, as it remains available to the public on some DVD editions, so it is worth discussing.Some say this alternate ending makes much more sense than the one we got in the cinema's and that the current ending misses the point of the book on which this movie is based. And I would agree, had the movie been built to fit that book's ending, but it isn't. The problem is that the monsters are shown as cartoonish aggressive crazy creatures from the beginning, so the alternate ending doesn't work, as it requires you to forget parts of the movie.At first, I thought that this was the result of Hollywood dumbing down the vampires from the book for the mainstream audiences, but the movie's portrayal of those creatures is largely accurate to the source material. Most vampires in the book are also presented as mindless and savage. Only some have developed a primitive kind of community. ""The human is the real monster"" angle doesn't work in that context.The result of this all is that the theatrical ending is rather generic, while the alternative ending doesn't fit the rest of the movie.Still, I Am Legend is a must see. It's not groundbreaking but it's a quality piece of work in almost every aspect.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"A Poor, Over-hyped Telling of a Good Story -- Trash","Virologist Robert Neville is the last man in New York after surviving a plague that was meant to cure cancer. Somehow, he is one of the few who was immune. Now, he continues to search for a cure while patrolling the streets with his dog, looking for survivors like himself. But, as the tagline says, ""the last man on earth is not alone.""I had heard a lot of bad things about this film before going into it. My colleague, Tristan Sinns, trashed it in his review. I heard it was action-packed (which seems silly when you're by yourself in a desolate city). And it was directed by Francis Lawrence, who made ""Constantine"" (which, unlike everyone else, I don't care for). I tried to have an open mind and not compare it to the past versions I already enjoyed (""Last Man on Earth"" and ""Omega Man""). Clearly, this film doesn't match up to either of its predecessors, so don't watch those first if you want a chance of liking this one.The biggest complaint I heard from people was what the critics call the ""third-act collapse"". As always, I cannot reveal the end, but I will say that there is some truth to the ""collapse"" -- after a suspenseful beginning and middle, we do spend a fairly short time trying to wrap everything up. And pretty much everyone who saw the film didn't agree with the way it was wrapped up. Myself, I thought it was abrupt but that the manner of the execution was decent and made sense. It certainly could have been much worse, and I'm glad that they chose a serious approach to the subject matter.Another complaint I heard was about the ""excessive and unrealistic"" CGI. Believe me, I couldn't agree more. My hatred for computer effects is deep, and this film made sure to use every possible computer effect it could. Deer, lions and even infected humans are all computer-generated, and poorly done. If you can't get a real lion or deer, at least make them look good. And why have the people animated? It made them look cheesy and not the least bit scary. It's not hard to get people to be played by... wait for it... people! And it's not hard to make them look infected with a virus, as has been done in hundreds of films before.If I had to say one good thing about this film, it's Neville's turn from God. Will Smith, in interviews, compared Robert Neville to Job. Except for the big difference: Job loses his family and becomes diseased and still loves God. Neville loses it all and ceases to believe in God. I found this to be somewhat edgy for the film and especially for Smith. There was no need to bring religion into the film, but I'm glad that they chose to do it in this manner: a strong, atheist character who still has impeccable morals despite a lack of faith. That's a bold move.I don't recommend this film. At all. Watch ""Last Man on Earth"", ""Omega Man"" or ""28 Days Later"". Don't watch this one. It's bringing in high ratings now (for reasons I cannot understand), but I don't see it passing the test of time. A year or two from now and this film will fade into obscurity, or so I hope. Die-hard Will Smith fans will love it, and all others will just be bored.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I am bored,"I am Legend is entertaining but flawed. We all know the premise. He's the last immune person in New York to a deadly virus that kills 90% of the people and turns the 9% into hairless raving maniacs. Leaving the last 1% to be eaten by the 9%. He's military scientist that is working on cure for the virus that will return the people back to normal. Int he mean time he hunts deer with his German Shepard. The best parts are the tense moments where he has to stay in the light away from the crazies. The boring parts are when we get to see how he goes about his day. It just wasn't that interesting. The movie picks up after some bad things happen and then some good things. Just when it looks like it really might be getting good, we have an ending which I didn't care for. I felt it missed the mark. The crazies would have been better played by people rather than CGI characters. Oh well, it was OK for a DVD rental. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A Bad Copy???,"I got what I expected out of this film. I was suspecting that it would be a copy of ""28 Days Later"" and it is very very similar. It really is an Americanized version of it though. 28 Days was a quite nicely done post apocalyptic fantasy that gave a stronger sense of human psychology. Consider the rape-inclined soldiers, a very strong sense of survival etc.The first part of the movie is great. Will Smith is a great actor. I must say the dog isn't bad either! Nice acting on Sam's part also.At the bottom of it though this is a spiritualized, Americanized version of 28 Days Later. Especially at the end when he is trying to talk to the diseased.

Great movie that had me in feelings,"Simply put the one sentence description that they had for this movie did not do it justice.

I had thought that he was a superficial actor who could be slapped on any Disney movie and had lost his passion long since the era of fresh prince. But after watching this movie that captures so much of his talent I couldn't have been more wrong. His performance in this movie is beautiful; he can truly express the emotions and psychosis that someone would go through after being isolated in this high stress environment for so long. The world building in this movie is just too good, they express so much with only a few short flashback scenes. This movie could have been stretched way past the two hour mark but they chose not to.

A Disappointment,"It's been a long time since I've seen ""Omega Man"" or read the original Matheson story, but I'd heartily recommend them as superior entertainment, while this... Well, if you've got nothing better to do, it's not TERRIBLE, but...I have to agree with everybody who says this was all about the CGI, and not about the plot - or, in my opinion, the suspense. There's not enough characterization of the zombies, and too much of Robert Neville - I like Will Smith, but I didn't care for his rather hysterical interpretation, although the interplay with Sam was good. There was too much backstory on the virus (and Neville's family) and too little on the zombies. And things don't seem to have been too challenging for Anna and Ethan - nothing worth talking about, anyway! Ethan isn't really necessary in any way - Sam is the Richie character (I think it was Richie - anyway, it IS kind of a clever riff on the doofus who wanders off in search of the cat...)I can't believe anybody respects the pacing. There are two moments of genuine suspense in the movie - Following the Deer, and the Copycat Trap - and both of them totally failed to have any shock value. Following the Deer turns out OK, while The Copycat Trap builds up and builds up, but then, well, up hops Bob and gets his gun, oh dear he drops it - oh, Sam isn't in as much trouble as we thought - oh, he was, was he - and we wind up waiting around for the dog to change, and then - well, that was that. Poignant, maybe (he has the recovered-rat antitoxin - why not Sam?) but suspenseful - are you kidding? And As for the film's finale, did we really need to see it? I think it was irrelevant (especially with the voice-over), and the prologue is also unnecessary - we could have spent the time getting a few real chills and thrills in.Ruined New York is well done, but it's not like we haven't seen THAT before (couldn't this have been filmed in Detroit, without CGI?) The movie has a kind of moral, which has to do with Neville being wrong about what turns out to be true at the very end. There's a worthy idea there - nothing to do with Matheson's original idea, or the title of the film, of course - but there isn't enough supporting material in the rest of the story for it to be said to be the film's theme - and there's nothing else to the story, really - so why is Neville a legend? Apparently, it's the same reason he was on the cover of TIME magazine...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I Am Legend,"The most recent version of I Am Legend had a lot of problems with budget. It was suggested for remake a number of times but shelved due to soaring costs. This is what they came up with that worked and fit into budget. I hope people understand this. Will Smith did an excellent job in the part of Neville. He really showed the isolation of the character and how he held it in because he had the dog. I have the original book and it is somewhat different but this is an adaptation. All of them have been but the first movie, ""Last Man On Earth"" showed the beings to be what Matheson wrote, ""vampires."" They were not zombies but his vision of a type of vampire-like state that developed. In the first movie Neville (Vincent Price) went out by day staking them. As they made more adaptations screenwriters brought out the more zombie like nature of his vampires. They were not patterned after the Eastern European vampires most identify with. Matheson wrote some of the screenplay for the first movie with Vincent Price but he didn't like how it turned out. One has to keep within a budget and so what one can do in a book cannot always be translated onto the big screen the same way.This version was very good and they were the Dark Seekers and Hemocytes. They were vampires too that many are calling zombies. If you see the cover of the book first released again to publication prior to the Will Smith's cover they have fangs more or less. I don't know what the producers are saying but the book is about people transforming into vampires and that is why they didn't come out into the sun except for the adaptation,Night of the Comet which was very loosely based on the story and only inspired by it.All in all I really liked it and felt it could have had a better ending for the viewing audience than the predictable killing him off, martyr. It would have been nice for once if the man got away and was awestruck by the surprise that there really was a colony in the end. Sort of the beat up man living in isolation finally finding others and a new life. His character was never suppose to be a doctor anyway. Each group that takes this on makes their own changes very similarly to the things Spielberg does when he ruined War of the Worlds.I have to say though standing on its own merits I thought the movie was a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Great film and great performance by Will Smith,"This was a fun film to watch, with a nice message that was hidden behind the lines of the script. But this is not what we will be talking about. If I could sum this movie up in one sentence, it would be this: Go Will. Will Smith is the driving force of I Am Legend. His performance as Dr. Robert Neville is impeccable. Living in a deserted NY city, his acting is reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away, but instead of a volleyball, he has mannequins and a faithful German Shepard named Sam. His basement, a retro-fitted, high-tech lab to find a cure for the disease that has turned the population of the entire planet into mutant, zombie-like, hive mind, blood-thirsty monsters, and, for some reason, Robert is immune. His days, spent hunting. His nights, sleeping with a high-powered rifle and hoping that the mutants don't find him. Keeping the movie flowing are well placed flashbacks that show what happened to Robert's family and why he is there. The movie falters a bit at the end, maybe at the last 5 minutes, but it doesn't ruin the plot or acting put forth. Containing wonderful cinematography and CG, I Am Legend is a spectacular film that I will be seeing again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Omega Man is much better,"Richard Matheson was a great writer, and his Last Man on Earth has been made into a movie three times. The first, starring Vincent Price, was pretty brutal but the production values were extremely low budget. It was a good try.The second version, Omega Man, with Charlton Heston, was awesome. It had the science fiction, the science, the conflicts, the action, and something more, great drama. Charlton Heston was a great actor, and he had a great supporting cast in Omega Man. The film makes you feel something that I Am Legend never even tries to do.I Am Legend is basically a video game. The CGI was horrible. I could never believe in any of the creatures. They were ridiculous. Will Smith never pulls it off as the last man on earth, or as a scientist seeking a cure. The lab is a joke, and the house had nothing in terms of credible protection. It was all half-baked at best, and unbelievable.Perhaps the best acting was done by the dog. He was the only character I cared about. The ending with the surprise addition of a woman and her kid was beyond fake and forced. Nothing happened naturally or felt real. Just putting together ingredients in a formulaic story that had a lame ending.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Hear me roar,"Two thirds of this film is wonderful entertainment, both in scope and story telling, and in Will Smith we have a cracking central performance that carries the film with consummate ease, sadly the final third undoes all the great promise and tension building that had gone before.After a genetic engineered cancer curing virus wipes out practically all of mankind, Robert Neville {Will Smith} appears to be the sole surviving human on earth, the only company he has is the family dog and an army of virus infected mutants that can only come out in the dark. That Neville is a former scientist who is immune to the deadly strain is a bonus as it means he can work on a potential cure.Yes it's daft, and yes it's contrived, but there sure is a lot of good stuff to enjoy before the films major failing surfaces. Firstly is Will Smith's performance, there is no doubting he is a major star these days, but here he cements his standing as a bona fide A lister of note. He layers the performance so well, his character not only has to deal with the heavy threat of being killed by the mutants at night, he also has to fight his own isolation, mans inherent need for companionship is a tortured thing when you appear to be the sole beneficiary of gods green earth.Secondly the setting of a barren desolate New York is eerily staggering, overgrown with foliage and stalked by lions searching for food, it really is a big screen must to embrace the scope of it. Thirdly the mutants themselves are scary enough, but they honestly would of been better served being played by human actors rather than the CGI used admittedly to competent effect, and Fourthly the tension building is pitch perfect, the makers manage to have you on the edge of your seat gasping for a solution to this cracking story unfolding, but then...............They throw it all away by a rushed ending that had me positively seething, a quick turn of events should be a prelude to a fully fleshed out finale but instead we get a quick wham bam, oh The End. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth on leaving the cinema and frankly the audience deserves better, and in fact so does Will Smith, did they run out of money ?, well that I don't know, but what I do know is that we so nearly had a genre classic to look fondly on for years to come, shame.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Why Do People Hate This Movie?,"Personally I really enjoyed this movie from the get go. It was intense, great story, good acting, and just really good. Every time I watch it I get freaked out and even though I know what's gonna happen I jump. How can people bash this movie it has everything most horror movies lack, Great writing. I mean none of the lines said sounded stupid it all fit in even when they added a funny line to add some light heartedness to an intense movie it all worked for it. I think Will Smith brought his A Game and I thought it was one of his best next to The Pursuit of Happiness and 7 Pounds. Will Smith is such a great actor and this movie is completely underrated.

Another winner from Smith,"I admit, I only went to see this movie because I heard it was about a planet where Will Smith was the only human left, and let's face it, that'd be a pretty great planet to land on. The storyline is definitely not something that interests me, and I would not have even thought of seeing this movie if not for the star. I did really enjoy the film though. It is tear-jerking in two particular moments, makes you jump out of your seat and while throughout the film you may feel a little bit lost, don't despair as by the end of the movie you will completely understand everything that happened.

Even IMAX can't squeeze adrenaline from this,"By choosing IMAX I assume the idea was to help stimulate a 'scared' response from the viewers, I understand this suggestion, and I would wager that part of the production team came up with this suggestion AFTER they saw the script, as the technology needed to make this film scary 'Throw the audience of a ledge a vision' hasn't been perfected yet.I can't understand why a film inspired so obviously by 28 days later never learned anything from its idol. For example the very reason why 28 days later was terrifying was because the ghouls were human, not almost human, not CGI, but human. It is the very idea that Humans could be responsible, just by a change in nature to become the raging monsters that terrified us so much in 28 days later. Therefore why did the director choose to distance us from such a possibility and 'possibility' is the key to this type of terror, the likelihood of it happening for real is what makes this genre scary when done correctly. Instead he chose the worst CGI I have ever seen (they even CGI a Lion (Badly) why don't we have real lions? or trees for that matter?), each ghoul had the same features, why? they all looked like London cycle couriers, they just lacked the laptop saddlebag with the strap that femininely goes across the chest! and more importantly they DID NOT LOOK REAL, this is an absolutely important point THEY DID NOT LOOK REAL. The lack of 'real' makes things unreal which again relaxes the audience as they know it's not REEEEAAAALLLLL.The Director also owes Will Smith, he delivered his lines with 100% commitment, the script was so poor, weak and lame that it drew attention to the mechanics of the film and its film making, as one became aware of this serious weakness, nevertheless Will Smith persevered, and even cried in one scene so top marks. I also cried, but only because I remembered that the Director and script writer of this rubbish would be a lot richer than me.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Nice Post-Apocalyptic Zombie Vampire Film,"This New York extravaganza was a thing of its time; it didn't have the best CGI so all the zombie vampire humanoid things look the same. Will Smith is easily the best part of this film; he was great with the dog for the first half of the film than with the woman in the second half. The world is very expensive and interesting. The flashbacks could've been entertaining in themselves. I wish there was a prequel it would be entertaining to see a Contagion-like movie but with a zombie vampire spin. I will say the film's message on who is truly the monster is an interesting idea that I've seen before. The alternate ending (which you should see on the Blu-Ray or Youtube), is in my eyes more profound but not profound enough to save this movie and turn it into some kind of incredible A-movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Enjoyable yet not scary,"I didn't quite know what to think of ""I Am Legend after it ended. I liked it, but at the same time there was just something about it that made me dislike it. In the tradition of ""Cast Away"", Will Smith is alone, and the only thing he can talk to is his dog and some store mannequins. His character Robert Neville is part of the 1% of survivors of a virus that turns everyone into zombie/vampires. He is totally alone in Manhattan, and watching him speed through deserted Times Square is extremely eerie. During the day he hunts and tries to find a cure for the virus, and at night he hides from the ""dark seekers"".There is one of my problems, the trailer promised a freaky movie, and it is until we see the creatures, then we find out they look almost laughable. Though a scene when Neville is in a pitch black warehouse, before he first sees them, will scare the daylights out of you. Even though the dark seekers are not scary, the director still manages to make you jump at least 8 times. The most I've ever jumped in a movie. The creatures look like poorly done CGI; bald humans with rotting teeth and red eyes. And that's not very scary to me. Also, towards the middle, some scenes start to drag since you have realized that it won't be scary.That aside, Will Smith is brilliant playing a quiet, dark, brooding character instead of his usual one liner cracking macho men. He literally carries the movie on his own and actually makes otherwise tedious scenes, like giving his dog a bath, interesting, or talking to his mannequin friend, Fred, believable. Director Francis Lawrence did a good job for the most part creating an eerie and dark movie, yet he failed horribly in making a believable, scary vampire hybrid, and with tons of plot holes in an otherwise interesting concept. Also, the ending is sorely lacking, if they would've come up with a better ending the movie would seem even better, but sadly they did not.This is a very enjoyable movie for the hour and forty minutes that it plays out, but the second it's done it becomes mostly forgettable. ""I Am Legend"" is one of those movies you see once, like it, but then never see it again. Already this film has made 76 million in the first three days, so see it mostly because it'll be the ""thing"" right now, and also see it because of the amazing Will Smith.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I am 28 weeks later,"This film is good. I have given my comment a bit of a cheeky title as it is very very similar to 28 weeks later. Although it is pale in comparison. It still is good. Will Smith did a good job but I am getting a little bored of his 'save the day' characters as they are getting all a bit samey. It was great seeing New York empty and Will got his characters isolation across quite well ""please speak to me"". It was quite creepy but and there are some good suspense moments but the zombies were all a bit odd looking. Very CGI which was a bit disappointing, the same as the lions.I loved the bond between the dog and Will and how we discovered how the army evacuated New York. Very scary.The ending was very typically American, giving the glimmer of hope in the 'Village' type community in Vermont, where the little Irish woman has the cure. Where as in 28 weeks later, the disease has just spread into France and it looks as though there is no hope.All in all, quite a good film. I would watch it again on DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"It was a good film, but it was built into something it could not  keep up with.","Don't get me wrong, it was a good film and held up very well. It was emotional, action filled and the storyline was worth awards for sure, but it was built up so much, that it made it seem like something that it could not be and in my opinion, it is the fault of the marketing. You should market all of the big movies but if you overdo it, you may not only get disappointed fans, but also the chance of less DVD sales.Now, off the subject of marketing and onto the movie side of the movie, it is extremely good. Too often now do we see movies completely ruined by special effects and big name actors, and lose everything that the (Very thin) storyline, but in this film, we see the good concept executed well and melted in perfectly with the special effects which were very good. Also, the direction in this movie is in the top 10 directing performances in 2007 by anybody, every scene is so thought out and magnetizing that if you turn away for a second, it takes 10 minutes to catch up.When I first watched the film, I did expect more, as I have previously stated from market hype, but I did enjoy it more the second time. I do strongly recommend this to everyone who enjoys a good movie.Overall, I liked this movie, but it could have been better, it does get boring in bits, but it is an overall exciting flick. I rate it 74%.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Smith, resolution of film are good","I gotta say, I was all ready to sneer at this movie for mythologizing the last man on Earth (like, would you really be most upset that someone ate your bacon when you haven't seen another human for three years? Would you really be that upbeat and have your wits about you to that degree after three years without human contact? Would you be so hard-headed as to separate yourself from your young family and solve a probably intractable problem as Smith's character does?) but in the end, I found that the resolution of the film made it worthwhile. If you can accept that someone could survive as they do in New York in that state for three years, I think you can appreciate the manner in which the film is resolved, in a positive, but realistic tone. Smith is very good although not much is asked of him. That is no diminution of him though and he as charismatic and compelling as ever. However, the director structures the action and plot well, identifying the manner in which Smith's character lives when he is supposedly the last man on earth, then introducing some challenging elements to his way of life. Smith's character looks into the threat posed by some disturbing creatures and finds out how the human race might continue. An enjoyable diversion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"An interesting and well unravelled genre piece that revels in its scenes of sheer terror, pure heartache and what some might call dopey symbolism.","I think 2007's I am Legend is a fitting enough adaptation of a popular book that I have read about in terms of it carrying so much weight in terms of ingenuity and inspiration for contemporary texts. Films like I am Legend come complete with threat of just collapsing under the sheer familiarity of both its set up and narrative, but this pulls through. In terms of its placement within the genre of survival horror, the film makes the grade rather easily, but it does so with its fair share of ideas; dramatic set pieces; genuinely heartbreaking moments and striking visuals of deserted contemporary Western pieces of iconography.I am Legend sees a solid, if familiar, set up involving what was first assumed to be a cure that helped humankind but actually carried a bit of a hitch. This is somewhere in late 2009. What was a cure for cancer progressed into a formula that mutates the individual it inhabits into something known as a Darkseeker which, rather obviously by name, demands they stay out of sunlight and in the nooks; crannies and rundown, abandoned buildings that make up the bulk of what is most probably all of the world's major towns and cities. So as to come across as contemporary, the film avoids the term 'vampire' in the same sense 28 Days Later avoided calling its antagonistic force zombies by manipulating into the text a plot point that demanded they be labelled 'infected'. Non-existent by day but screeching loudly and dominating the city by night, they act as a fairly interesting anti-human component to the text.During the opening, mankind as a species is relegated to that of resembling an ancient hunter; wondering, perhaps aimlessly if the daily goals are not achieved, through a once bustling arena of contemporary life represented by towering buildings; street lamps; cars and numerous vast, once electronic, billboards that used to display advertisements for the latest in 'must have' consumerist items. All of that has gone and, albeit aided with an automobile of his own, the individual shots of a wandering lead seeking out game for means of nourishment work well.The lead is Robert Neville (Smith), a once top U.S. Army virologist, now rendered the only known human left in New York City after having spent three years on his own. But he is accompanied by the film's non-human component, which comes in the form of his German Shepard dog named Samantha. For its very brief and relatively basic substance during this opening, I am Legend calls, albeit meekly, on inspiration from 2000's Cast Away as a man struggling with his loneliness in this dystopian setting. If Cast Away took place on a beautiful and somewhat exotic deserted island and turned it into a place of terror and no hope, then I am Legend's look at New York City as a place that retains its contemporary look and vast feel, only with undergrowth beginning to take over. The key difference is I am Legend's ingredient of an antagonistic force in the Darkseekers, something the lead must be weary of.But it is all very brief. Some key scenes to get across this factor of loneliness sees Neville interact with mannequins he has taken from other shops and actually placed in stores he visits to get across a sense that he is communicating with people. I am Legend's decision to break the film up into past and present tenses works surprisingly in its favour. The cut aways from the first instance we hear the Darkseekers howling in the night leave us on a knife edge of sorts as we go back into the past for some brief pre-apocalyptic story to do with Neville and his wife and young daughter. Addtionally, the flashbacks don't feel as intrusive as they might've done; we can take a break from Neville in his post-apocalyptic world and hark back to see the development of the outbreak without really feeling frustrated or torn away form something. The approach and this manipulation of time aids in distancing the film from things like 28 Days Later and the subsequent sequel released around the same time as I am Legend.If there is any substance in I am Legend, then it is rather unfortunately linked to the finale and the very end of the piece, which halts going into things too deeply. Other than this, the film is principally a nuts and bolts survival horror only with the lead being able to freely inhabit the space in which he is surviving in during the day. Items are removed from the text and the film dips slightly, whereas certain other elements are installed into the text, even if they carry a nagging, obligatory feel to them.It's thought that when the third element that does actually meet with Neville stumbles across him, it was God that brought them together. The introduction of God via the dialogue is a distinct shift towards what the film ultimately builds to: a scene of great sacrifice so that millions of others may live on, echoing the plight of Jesus Christ. It's the sort of symbolism that'll have some groaning in frustration, others crying gallons of tears, depending on which way the text sways you. But I bought it, and I enjoyed all the somewhat familiar point of attack; establishing of the situation; Neville's routine plus relationship with the new world in which he lived as well as the overall direction the film took me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

"Deserted Manhattan, wow","In the plot, the world becomes infected with a zombie virus leaving the immune Will Smith alone in New York, trying to find the cure.A great premise for a movie, with an excellent set of a deserted post apocalyptic Manhattan.

Late Alterations Damage a Well-Intentioned Adaptation,"As with almost any literary adaptation, fans of the source material in search of a literal interpretation will probably find a lot to fault in this Will Smith vehicle, particularly in its neutered take on the story's conclusion. All of the original's deeper underlying meanings are still there, buried in the actions and expressions of the transfigured creatures Smith does his best to avoid, but without a big reveal to lay all the cards on the table they're too easily shrugged off or overlooked altogether. That positions this as, basically, a hybrid summer blockbuster / suspense-laden monster movie with a better than usual premise. In this role it fares well - Smith portrays the terrifying isolation of the last sane man on Earth with passion and depth, leaving memories of his less-inspired earlier work far in the past. He's come a long way from Independence Day or even Hancock, and surprisingly little of that has the more stern-faced, serious script to thank. Legend's computer effects are a different story: while exceptional at rendering an overgrown, deserted NYC skyline, they feel excessive and overwhelming when it come to the creatures themselves. Though it may not live up to the lofty expectations of its namesake, this is hardly a complete write-off. In fact, as mass market action pictures go it's unusually smart, expertly paced and generally contemplative. A pity it didn't have the balls to stick with that original ending, though, as I think it would have been much more universally appreciated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Could Have been a 10 easy,"This movie could have blown the roof off any megaplex. Instead it left me wanting at least an hour more which is a bad sign from the get go.

I hope when this comes out on DVD a special edition is available such as a directors cut or something.

Surprisingly good.,"I was happy to hear that there would be a new film adaptation of this book until I heard Will Smith was staring and then I assumed it would be rubbish. Thankfully that wasn't the case.Will Smith is excellent in the lead, which is good since he is the only real character in the film, he manages to deliver an great performance as a desperate man who is refusing to give in and unlike in other films he's been in he never compromises the performance by showing his own personality.The film is dark and atmospheric at times with a little running and screaming. The creatures are probably the worst part of the film, they are obvious CGI and look fake and silly, their behaviour isn't consistent either, sometimes they display high levels of intelligence but not when the are actually on screen and are shown as dumb zombie style creatures for simplicity.The film does have two of my least favourite types of direction; the first is jerky camera work, we can see that he is running making the screen jump up and down doesn't heighten tension it is just annoying; the second is things jumping in to shot suddenly to startle you, yes people jump when it happens but it's no smarter than jumping out from behind a door and shouting boo!The ending is OK, it's a little convenient and not especially smart but this is an action film after all.This does lack the intelligence and sophistication of the book, the creatures and the ending are much smarter in the book, but it is a reasonably faithful adaptation.It's a good action film which works better in the quiet scenes than in the action ones but it hangs together well enough and Smith's performance is good enough to hold your interest.Entertaining but not really special.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
three points off for lacking elements,Will Smith lands the title role of a character involved in some type of supernatural crisis as usual. Though I liked the movie I felt it wasn't as twisted as it should've been. That's what I expected from his older movies such as Independence Day and Men In Black and I got just that. But this one ended a little too abruptly just before we got a chance to digest what we were viewing just previously before that woman and her daughter traveled to the city of survivors.I did like the cinematography and the scene where the dead suddenly travel to Smith's house. Pretty spooky. I guess the director knew something about how to rock the audience with slime oozing from their seats in the theater.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
+SUBSTANCE / -STYLE,"A remake, one with light and shade. Very well realised the images of a deserted New York and the study of a lonely man approaching lonely man approaching madness, desperately searching for a way out. Speak the whole post-apocalyptic opening sequence. But the makers certainly speculated in advance, pre-2007, that this, and and a shooting star in the lead role, would not be enough to lure the current audience for a visit to the cinema. It was no longer 1800-Vincent Price or 1900-Charlton Heston, so appropriately massive action and horror effects from the middle onwards to keep the audience happy. A mistake, not the idea itself, but in terms of implementation. The computer effects are simply not worthy of a high-budget film of this time, they look like video game sequences. Video game sequences. The following question came up more and more often now: Why do they digital tricks, what happened to the good old masks and make-up? Make-up? This lowers the rating of an otherwise exciting work with an interesting storyline, in which even the protagonist, whom I normally see neither as an actor actor or musician or whatever, could do little to harm.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
An exciting first two thirds let down by a poor ending,"This is another one of those films that takes an interesting concept but has no idea how to conclude it. For the first two thirds of the film, I was on the edge of my seat as Will Smith entered dark, derelict buildings. It is a shame though that the final third changes the films atmosphere and takes away any suspense that was in the first two thirds of the film.Thankfully Will Smith is consistent as ever doing a fantastic performance as Robert Neville, a scientist who is working on a cure to heal infected humans. His performance carries the film and it would not have been half as good, were he not involved.People have complained about the CGI in the film and it is indeed bad in places. However this did not bother me as I was able to ignore it. The real issues though is the ending. Without spoiling too much, the ending reveals a lot to the audience that makes the film feel like a waste.

Could've been better,"It will be a short review. I think this movie would be better if it was a mini show or something. They could've made this movie 2 hour and maybe it would be better.Great potential, but ending was really bad and flashbacks of main character's family was not enough and boring. Not enough information given through entire movie, not about main character or his past. Will Smith is really well choice for the main character.Overall it's a fun movie to watch and I don't think it's a waste of time or something.I saw a YouTube trailer of the second movie I think it is a alternative ending of this movie and its really unnecessary.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"Remake of a remake, but still OK","Remakes are always to be watched with a cautious eye. Remakes of remakes even more so. But in this case I haven't read the book the original film was based on, haven't seen the original film and haven't seen the first remake. I have only seen this one.The story is easy enough: humankind is in a pickle. A virus has wiped out a large part of society. The sole survivor is a scientist who has to survive day after day in a menacing world. But is he really alone? I have always had a weak spot for films that play with the end of mankind. This one doesn't come with an original plot - even in its original time it had been done before. But the way it brings it is quite interesting. As the days pass by and the guy explains his actions and his motives it is hard not to feel for him. The story is interesting enough and even though most of the film is carried on the shoulders of just one actor it comes out pretty well. There's plenty of action, but not too much and there's a good dosage of drama too.Lovely film, 7 out of 10 lethal viruses",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A great film,"When i first went to see this movie, I expected it to be more based on the fact that he was alone, but it turned out to be more of a zombie/ suspenseful film. It was still great, but people who hate stressful films that make you jump ( 4 times for me )shouldn't see this film. Will Smith's acting was incredible, as always, really showing his emotions. New York really looked strange, in a good way. It really looked like no one has been there for years. But the bad points of this film was the ending (which I will not spoil), because it just didn't really fit the whole story, but it's not really important. I really enjoyed this film, even if it wasn't what I expected. I'd recommend it to people who enjoyed ""28 days later"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
"""a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.""","Lavishly produced and beautifully acted by Will Smith, ""I am Legend"" is but a shadow of the seminal novel by classic fantasy/science fiction writer Richard Matheson (""What Dreams May Come,"" ""A Stir of Echos,"" ""The (Incredible) Shrinking Man"" and ""Bid Time Return (""Somewhere in Time)"". ""...Legend,"" unfortunately more closely follows ""The Omega Man"" than ""The Last Man on Earth,"" the first film based upon Matheson's novel. Matheson conceived of a world-wide plague which not only killed EVERYONE but Dr. Robert Neville, it turned the undead into vampires. Thus, Neville's dual mission was to rid the world of vampires AND find a cure for the plague of which he was the only one immune. Since Neville was ""bringing peace"" to the undead, his actions were far more ""justifiable"" than Heston's (""The Omega Man) or Smith's (""I am Legend""). However, Neville learns many of the ""vampires"" he was killing were actually plague sufferers; and, among those who survived, Neville was a horrific ""legend,"" not a saintly one.While ""I am Legend"" is much superior to ""Omega Man"" in dramatic terms, the plot holes are nearly as horrific as the plot. WHO set the ""booby trap"" for Neville? WHY did Anna or anyone else NOT respond to Neville's short wave transmission? WHY did the ""head ghoul"" take so much interest in Neville's latest human experiment? While I understand the last question is answered in the deleted scenes, movies must stand on their own narrative or be rightly criticized. I would love to see a ""Director's cut"" in order to ascertain whether or not these plot holes were closed. However, my primary criticism of the film (i.e., that Matheson's original theme has been turned on its head) would still apply.""I am Legend"" is impressive to look at and to savor Will Smith's fine performance; but, it is otherwise shallow. In this exercise of Matheson's classic, life really is but ""...a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury. Signifying nothing.""I give ""I am Legend"" a weak ""6"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Why, who, how is what I wanted to know beyond the superficially-explained premises. Like who is Smith's character anyways? Anyhow, maybe i'm just to demanding and my need for details usually surpasses any reasonable capacity a screenplay can offer, but I can surely say that with Legend, my needs were far from met.

Smith Saves Flawed Vision of Apocalypse,"Everything bad about this movie almost spoils everything that is good about it  almost. Will Smith once again saves the day by making sure we're at home in his latest effects-driven picture and invested in its story instead of feeling like the 20 we dropped for tickets might have been better spent on a new shirt.Playing Colonel and scientist Robert Neville, Smith nicely updates the last-man-on-earth concept with his trademark humor and humanity. Only Smith could get a laugh from an audience while we watch him patrol an eerily sad and decayed cityscape overgrown with encroaching foliage.But Smith's world is more than just eerie. At night, other survivors of the air-born virus that wiped out 90 percent of the world's population come out to roam the streets and feed on any person or animal unfortunate enough to cross their paths. For these survivors, the virus has twisted them into bald, sinewy, vicious and oddly acrobatic ""dark-seekers"" who'd just as soon eat your head as look at you. Smith is among the tiny fraction who survived symptom-free due to a natural immunity. The dark-seekers seek the dark because the virus has also cursed them with an inability to withstand sunlight and their skin starts to sizzle and smoke in the faintest of light rays. Being Irish, this reviewer felt an uncomfortable fealty with these poor creatures on this point.Accompanied by his faithful companion, Sam, a German Shepherd, Smith's Neville wiles the days away watching three-year-old tapes of the 'Today Show;' chipping golf balls off the wings of flightless fighter jets; chatting with mannequins, and hunting deer in Time Square  now overgrown with tall grass. But he also replays in dreams his family's doomed flight from Manhattan; seeks other survivors by way of a daily radio broadcast and experiments on captured dark-seekers in an attempt to find a cure for the virus.The sight of Smith fishing in corporate coy ponds and cracking jokes with his dog keeps the haunting solitude from overwhelming the film but we wonder in a number of scenes if that's such a good thing. Giving us a little more time to ponder the concept may have helped its weight. The sun sets in the distance over tantalizingly vacant skyscrapers but we're invariably tied to whatever shoot'em up action Smith is coping with in the foreground.But then the film grabs you by the heart-strings and shows you just how invested in the plight of Smith's 30-something boy-and-his dog story you've become. While it's got you, Smith's youthful next-generation movie-star humanity steps in and does that thing it always does in his effects-driven films: makes you take it all just seriously enough. He puts you squarely in his character's shoes and then makes you proud to be there. Only Smith can embrace pop-culture crappola in one breath and put a lump in your throat the next. His sentimental soliloquy about life and love in which the film's title is tied to a beloved Bob Marley album ( instead of the more obvious, somewhat prideful interpretation ) marks an effective emotional crux. This reviewer has never seen the 1971 'Omega Man,' adaptation, but I expect Charlton Heston's Neville was significantly less satisfying in this respect.What drags this film down is the usual Hollywood smart-assery that inevitably infuses major releases like too much bad cologne: The dark-seekers can't just be a pack of lost souls with a heightened form, perhaps, of rabies. They've got to be computer-animated vampires with lightning-fast reflexes and super-human agility. A character cannot just meet another character in likely fashion but must be rescued in the nick of time from certain death. You can't have just a likable scientist at the center of your plot; he's also got to be a muscle-bound hipster with a wisecrack for every situation and a blast of machine-gun fire for anyone who ticks him off. In a key opening sequence we accompany Smith on safari in midtown Manhattan where a lion  yes, a lion -- ultimately takes down Smith's intended prey. Despite the faith moviegoers have lately placed in computer animation, this film's makers are definitely abusing the privilege. This scene's ""lion"" looked like a refugee from Pixar's cutting room floor  circa 1998. Same goes for the dark-seekers. If someone at Warner Brothers neglected to compare the cost of paying some animators for a few months of work versus paying an animal wrangler and a makeup artist for a few weeks of work, they should have thought twice about it.Major, major kudos, however, to the set designers and everyone involved in making you believe you're looking at a New York three years after every person on Earth has perished. Grass growing in the middle of Broadway and brackish water filling underground parkways definitely set the mood.In the end, though, it's Smith's depth and star-power that land this film safely in the winner's circle. From everyday exultation to heart-breaking loss and everything in between, it's the rare note that Smith misses.Good for him and see this movie.This movie review by Erik Gloor",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Watch the alternate ending...,"At first I thought it was a pretty good movie. The story went forward very well. There were subtle hints hidden here and there that pointed towards an interesting ending. Unfortunately the ending did not live up to my expectations (or that of all other people I asked about it). Also all the hints here and there didn't make any sense any more.A few months later, I had the chance to see the original ending, which was replaced after a negative test screening. It was exactly the ending the movie needed. I don't know what kind of people the audience of the test screening was made of, but it seems they were somehow intellectually challenged.Thus, if you happen to get your hands on a DVD or Blueray which contains the original ending, skip the 'fixed' one when the showdown in the lab begins and switch to the better one. It will return a meaning to the movie.I'll give the cinema version 6/10 and the original cut 8/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"

Not a bad flick but hardly a faithful adaptation,"""I Am Legend"" is the third film adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic novel but only the first to use the original title. However, don't let that fact fool you into thinking that this film hews any closer to the source material. Still, that doesn't stop the film from being a decent effort in it's own right.The story takes place a few years in the future after a miracle cure sparks a virus outbreak that kills 90% of the earth's population and leaves the few immune individuals to be terrorized by bloodthirsty, zombie-fied hosts.Sounds more like ""28 Days Later"" than the novel ""I Am Legend"", right? Yes, the screenwriters basically chose to throw out any reference to vampirism and go the copycat route. Even the meaning of the title is twisted around to a different purpose. That being said, the story is a pretty good one, judged on it's own merits.There's not much to remark of in terms of the cast. For most of the film Will Smith is the only human around. Smith is a reliable leading man and is certainly up to the task here.The film's look is pretty good and manages to create a fairly convincing New York that is virtually devoid of human life. The CGI, on the other hand, isn't 100% believable in my opinion. Music is sparse, which is fitting for the material.In the end, I thought that this was a good horror/action film. However, if you're looking for something that's (a) faithful to the novel, or (b) not a blatant rip-off of ""28 Days Later"", then you'd be advised to look elsewhere.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
A lost opportunity to make Matheson's story great again,"Not many know that of all three versions made of ""I am legend"" the one that more closely captures the spirit of Matheson's original novel is actually the one with Vincent Price, ""The Last man on Earth"", dating back to 1964 and that pales in comparison to the latest for its total lack of special effects. However, Vincent Price alone is intense enough to convey so effectively the utmost terror of human isolation, and the atmosphere in this relatively forgotten movie, shot in a suburb of Rome built up by none other than Mussolini, is at times far scarier than the CGI - ridden blockbuster. This is I think is what makes ""I am legend"" today some kind of lost opportunity to resurrect the Matheson masterpiece, as halfway through the beautifully photographed movie it ends up slipping in the cliché of computer graphics zombies - themselves not even overly original or particularly scary in concept. While Will Smith is fantastic in his portrayal of Dr. Neville, his wonderful performance gets pitifully overridden by a showcase of digital effects that was not only unnecessary, but redundant, confusing and more than anything else at the antithesis of what Matheson had imagined his metropolitan vampires to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Criminally under-appreciated,"I watched this movie with some doubts, as I had heard mixed reviews. My doubts faded as the movie progressed though, and I find many criticisms of this movie to be lacking in credibility, the one that bothers me most is ""HOW ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE IMMUNE TO THIS VIRUS AND HOW DOES IT TURN PEOPLE IN TO BLOODTHIRSTY LUNATICS?"", and at first I thought that was a good question, but near the end of the movie I found myself wondering, why explain it? One of the great things about this film is the mystery surrounding the story and characters. It furthers the idea that this man, this survivor, really doesn't have all the answers. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't have felt better about the movie if they had spent five minutes explaining the virus in a bunch of medical jargon that the majority of us wouldn't understand anyways, but I digress. The imagery in this movie is absolutely beautiful, and the writing provides dialog ranging from disturbing to comical, and unfortunately near the end, rather preachy and cheesy. Will Smith is magnetic and the character development is easily the strongest part of this film (amazing how someone can still hold such interesting conversations without another human being around :D). While there are some shortcomings at the end of the film, overall it is powerful and a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I Am Almost A Great Movie But Due To Some Bad Decisions Am Ultimately Disappointing,"Will Smith has come a hell of a long way since ""Fresh Prince"", and after some great turns over the last few years he's become a pretty well respected actor, but as the last man on earth can he carry a movie solely on the shoulders of him and his dog? Luckily, for the most part he can. He's certainly got the charisma to fill a big screen on his own, and considering the majority of the movie is him wandering around empty streets, it's surprisingly absorbing. Where the movie falls down though is with it's effects. It's not that the CG here looks terrible, it's just completely unnecessary. The empty New York streets aside there's nothing being done here digitally that wasn't being done ten years ago with make-up and stuntmen, and there's plenty of movies which have done this kind of thing far cheaper and more effectively.In comparison to the terrifying infected in ""28 Days Later"" the rabid nasties in ""Legend"" just don't cut the mustard. They also stick out like a big sore CG thumb, ruining the impressive shaky-cam realism that the movie has worked pretty hard to achieve. It's a shame, because the jarring effects aside there's a lot of atmosphere on show, and if the effects geezers had gone down a more sensible route this could have been something special.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
I Am Man!,"Will Smith at the moment is the world only superstar which could ensure a studio can make big profit in any film he stars in. Since 2002 he has not had a flop film, Men in Black II, Boy Boys II, I, Robot, Hitch, The Pursuit of Happiness and Hancock: some of them are actually pretty good. He is a unique position to do what ever he wants and now produces many of his films. But even with I Am Legend it demands a lot from an actor, because he has the carry the film all by himself. But luckily he does in a film that works.In the 2012 most of the world has be whipped out or turned in a vampire-zombie hybrid (the Darkseekers). They act like zombie, surviving just to eat flesh of any animal, but can not go out in sunlight. They seem to lack any humanity. Also animals like rats and dogs can be inflected by the virus. In New York there is only one man left, Robert Neville (Will Smith), with his dog Sam, his only companion. He is a army officer and a virologist, who spends his days researching for a cure, hunting and growing food, exercising, sending out radio messages, and waiting for possible survivors at South Street Seaport. He does try to keep active just keep his mind from frying, like watching DVDs, old TV boardcasts and playing golf off an aircraft carrier. At night he stays in his home, staying alert in case there is an attack by the Darkseekers. Robert Neville at night suffer from flashbacks when the virus gets out and when he takes his wife and young daughter Marley (Salli Richardson and Willow Smith) to Brooklyn Bridge to fled the city. There is renewed hope for humanity when one of his formulas starts to work on a inflected rat. He needs a Darkseeker to ensure that the cure would work on humans.I Am Legend is a good film, but it's also a film of two halves. There is the really good half showing Robert Neville as a man by himself and a fascinating look of the effects of isolation from humanity, showing signs that his mental facilities are starting to slip. Will Smith gives an excellent performance of a man on the edge who had to life at every turn, and on a desperate mission to save the world by himself. There is a good emotional drive, particularly involving his Sam (I don't want to give the game away). As a psychological film it works. What lets the film down is the action side. They are some decent action scenes, and they are some moments that are really good like the beam of sunlight dividing Sam and the infected dogs. But the director Francis Lawrence was too reliant on CGI. It was pretty obvious when he used to for animals like deers and lions, and especially on the Darkseekers. It would have looked more realistic, effective and scary (and properly cheaper) to cast actors and get a good make-up team to put prosthetic on them.Besides from the CGI, Francis Lawrence does offer a steady hand behind the camera and he does have potential as a director. He does have some problems and I think he needs to direct a smaller project just to prove what he can do. Ridley Scott and Guillermo del Toro were linked to the film and I think though two could have made a good film even better. Del Toro would have been really suited to the material. But Michael Bay also at one point was going to direct and we all know that would have been a CGI porn explosion fest.A little note, this was the film that got me in Bob Marley, having his song played throughout it, which is never a bad thing.If you enjoy post-apocalyptic fiction like 28 Days Later or Stephen King's the Stand then you should enjoy I Am Legend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Third adaptation and nice work,"This is the third adaptation of 1954 novel ""I am legend"" written by Richard Matheson. Although not so faithful to the novel, it is one of the most popular zombie movies ever filmed. It is also among the top movies of post-apocalyptic genre.It has a simple story in which a virus has spread, killed millions of people and turned the rest into zombies with only a few being immune. Will Smith plays such a survior who has lost his hope and slightly gone mad. He acts alone most of the time, speaks to his dog and fights zombies. He manages it pretty well. Zombies are scary and hyperaggressive but you can easily tell that too much CGI is involved. This is one major drawback of the movie. Nevertheless, cinematography is so nice that it makes the movie watchable multiple times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
Too short,"This film has many good points, however what it lacks is decent screen time...I was surprised that it lasted little over 90 minutes which really cut out a lot of the tension and drama. When the credits role you think...OH...that's it? It was pretty disappointing.This meant what was a pretty decent film became little more than a quick suspenseful flick.However this does not mean it was a bad film, Will Smith was effective and held up well on his own for the majority of the screen time, albeit that time being short. Furthermore the scenes of a deserted Manhattan were amazing. Most of all this film was decently scary. The use of darkness obviously emphasised the fear and suspense which is rife in the film. The CGI isn't brilliant but does work, while there are some seriously scary moments.All in all I am legend does have its shortcomings- its far too short and therefore seems rushed and ill-conceived. However it still does create a certain amount of suspense and Smith is reasonably good in this thrilling film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Drama"
