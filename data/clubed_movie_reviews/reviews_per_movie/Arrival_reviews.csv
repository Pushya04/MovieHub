It's a masterpiece. Period.,"I will help you choose if you want to watch this one or not. It's easy. If you like, for example Sixth Sense, you will love this one. If you prefer Independence Day, you will hate it.I think it's a masterpiece. Period. I'm actually a bit shocked it's not closer to 9 and a top 20 all time movie. The script is so intelligent that it feels that you have watched 4 different movies in the end. It's a thrill ride for drama-, thriller-, action- and science fiction fans in one package.I had to compose myself for 20 minutes before leaving the theatre and it took me and my wife about 3 hours and 3 glasses of wine to talk about it afterwards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Time. Life. Gift. You. Gift. Life. Time.,"As a kid, my dad used to tell me stories at night just like any other dads out there. I grew up, got busy with life but those priceless timeless beautiful storytelling moments that I once shared, that amazed me in wonder, curiosity, imagination and desire to know more..I know if I think hard enough I might remember some of them, but that's not the point. The point is all those stories had characters and people and objects and places and things that I could either imagine or something that I could picture and understand and visualize in my young mind. If not for those imaginable characters and people, I would have never understood those stories, the true meaning of the story, the actual story behind the story that my dad probably wanted me to understand.Arrival, for me is such a story. Aliens are just fun characters that help me understand the story so I can actually see beyond it and understand the untold story. You see, the way I understand it is that the director had to dumb it down for us and wrap this movie in a sci-fi genre and add aliens so you could relate it to something you are familiar with and hoped, really hoped that we try to understand the true purpose, the message behind all this. It simply couldn't have been portrayed better than this!This movie teaches you a lot of things, if you are ready to learn. About 'time' and how much we are bound by it, about life and death, about loving unconditionally, about believing in yourself that everything happens for a reason, and so much more..",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A beautiful sci-fi masterpiece.,"Arrival is a sci-fi masterpiece. The acting is tonally perfect. The script is very well written and manages to make the complicated sci-fi lingo seem plausible. Denis Villeneuve directs this film with a gripping realism. The score is haunting and otherworldly at the same time, perfect for the subject matter. The story utilizes the concept of time brilliantly, almost like it's another character.This is a sci-fi drama. It's not an action film. It's an intimate study that shy's away from big theatrics, instead opting for a philosophical discussion that challenges the viewer. The twist is beautiful and heartbreaking. I love that this film makes you think, it's what great sci-fi is suppose to do.Watch this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"No CGI overkill, just some fine acting and directing","Denis Villeneuve is without a doubt an upcoming director and I can't wait to see Blade Runner 2049. Prisoners, Sicario and now Arrival (haven't seen Enemy yet, or some of his earlier work). Denis knows how to capture the tension. It is almost the strongest point of all of his films. Minimal use of computer generated images, and main focus on story, characters, acting and thrilling scenes. Back on IMDb board, I have noticed a lot of people calling Arrival a boring movie. So many hypocrites these days. People trying to point out every possible flaw to look and sound smarter while at the same time hailing far worse movies. Calling it boring and slow while at the same time complaining no originality in Hollywood, only giant CGI laser explosions extravaganza. Go watch Independence Day. In Arrival there is no action, no explosions, just some amazing acting performances combined with good directing, editing and cinematography. There was not a single moment I felt bored.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?","An intriguing, interesting and original story focussing on Louise Banks (Amy Adams) a preeminent linguistics professor who must lead humanity in communicating with visiting aliens. I think what most caught me surprised that it's so different from all the other scifi alien ""attacks"" movies - it's not all action all-guns-blazing at the threat - yet, rather a thoughtful humanity driven movie. Amy Adams is amazing as the protagonist demonstrating humanity as well communicating and befriending the aliens' unknown language and the impact it has on her. She carries the movie single-handed. I think it's a very beautiful message about humanity, what's the whole story is about. And tragic, surely, that despite knowing her future and the painful future she will have, she will not change anything. That's a great message. ""Despite knowing the journey, and where it leads...

"Excellent, intelligent, just a terrific film.","This is a very, very well made film, which is thought provoking, measured, engaging, and thoroughly well made.There is nothing brash, or heavy handed about it, the story is superbly told, with well grounded characters. The story is of course sci fi, and hugely creative, but it's never silly, it is incredibly intelligent.Awesome special effects, I loved the design of the alien race, and their language, quite incredible.A story of hope, which I loved. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A different sci-fi film, and a good, but divisive, one","Despite being critically acclaimed, 'Arrival' is another one of those films that is praised to the heavens with critics but has wildly divided audiences judging from the nature of both the positivity and negativity. Though it has to be said that the positive reviewers have been far more mature than the negative ones, many of which to me being disgustingly condescending.'Arrival' is a very different sci-fi film, and one can definitely see why people will love it and be moved by it as well as seeing why people will hate it and be alienated. To me, 'Arrival' is not as good as reputed and is not a masterpiece, but even if it didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4 at least. From personal opinion there are far worse films out there that are far more deserving of 1/10, and it would be insulting to put 'Arrival' down there with them. Even if the film didn't much for me, the good things would still be acknowledged and there would be real effort to be respectful of other people's opinions regardless of agreeing or disagreeing with them rather than being insulting and inventing ridiculous and untrue conspiracy theories. Those who hated it do need to grow up and start accepting that not everybody hates this film and that those who loved it are being genuine, and no being angry at being disappointed by it is not an excuse. Coming from a younger film lover than most on this site who's autistic and disabled but those have not gotten in the way of being understanding of people's opinions, what's your excuse?Back to my thoughts on the film, 'Arrival' is a meditatively paced film, and is not an action filled or jam packed with constant narrative. While this may understandably alienate viewers, neither of these are necessarily bad things especially when there are great to masterpiece films that are the same. Of the four films seen of Denis Villeneuve so far, 'Arrival' may be my least favourite, and his most polarising, least violent and most gentle, but that is just testament to how very good 'Prisoners' is and how fantastic 'Incendies' and 'Sicario' are.The criticisms are understandable and am in agreement with some. It does drag in the middle act, softening and slacking too much. It does get confusing in the later stages, where things can get ridiculous and predictable.Forest Whittaker and particularly Michael Stuhlbarg's characters are underutilised and underwritten with both having very little to do, the two do make the most of their roles one has to give them that.However, 'Arrival' does look wonderful. This is particularly true in Bradford Young's cinematography, being fluid and its tactile quality is of sheer beauty. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed and lit, the special effects have grand spectacle and the editing is some of the best of its year.Johann Johannsson's music score is another standout, it has a haunting creepiness and has a heart-pulsating and emotional beat. It not only adds a huge amount to the film, it also enhances it. Denis Villeneuve's direction is his most subtle and least hard-hitting, which is not only a good thing but the right thing, the approach he gave to 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' would have ruined an atmosphere that's the complete opposite.In terms of how it's written, 'Arrival' is not perfect but it has a movingly raw emotion, thoughtfulness, subtly suspenseful mystery and gives a compelling realism to its character especially the protagonist. Likewise the story (yes there is one), with a poignant emotion and a clever and powerful, if perhaps not the most logical, twist.The acting is one of 'Arrival's' best assets, all round it's very good even if some characters are better realised than others. Amy Adams in particular is astounding, she has rarely been more poignant. Jeremy Renner also underplays effortlessly.All in all, divisive film but count me as one of the people who liked it but in an appreciation way than a loved it way. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Slow burning Science Fiction,"If you are looking for flashy, loud and generally speaking fast paced action Science Fiction: This is not the one you are looking for (no pun intended). But if you like slow, lingering and long shots, a movie that takes time to breathe and gives an epic scale to it's framing and cinematography, you could do a lot worse.I'm being a bit modest concerning the movie of course, because we're talking about a very well written script, that has a few surprises along the way and warrants more than one viewing and things to discover on those repeat viewings. It is really well acted and it has a story that is gripping as well as interesting from start to finish. The title alone suggests something, even if you haven't seen the trailer (which I didn't) - so you are in a way more prepared than our characters. But at the same time on their level ... So many Questions and not all get answered (at least not while watching it for the first time)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Plenty to like but falls well short of greatness,"While I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from watching Arrival, it didn't really capture my imagination in the way I had hoped. It's a reasonably engrossing watch but it kind of feels like a rehash of various different sci-fi films. There was very little about the plot, the visuals or the dialogue that I haven't seen before in some form or another. There was the alien landing, the media frenzy, the civil unrest, the stern military guys and the wise and noble central character who saves the day. Throw in a boring romance and some lazy stereotypes about China and Russia and you have yourselves a generic Hollywood blockbuster.The one element of the film that stands out is the storyline with Louise and her daughter. These scenes had genuine intrigue and emotion and were nicely incorporated into the main plot. The other big positive about Arrival was the performance by Amy Adams. Her role wasn't particularly challenging but she still offered a level of subtlety and delicacy that is so often lacking in films like this. It was a huge shame that Jeremy Renner was cast alongside her as he was laughably inept by comparison. It was also unfortunate to see Forest Whitaker given such a corny one-dimensional role knowing what he is capable of as an actor.Where the film went wrong was with the communication development between the humans and aliens. I won't go into detail on this as there are plenty of negative reviews that really labour the point, but it was unfeasible that things would progress the way they did. The conversation between Louise and Costello towards the end of the film was laughably corny and by this point I was just wanted it all to end.The alien genre is a difficult beast to tame and very few movies have done it well. Arrival promises a lot early on and was close to pulling it off but was let down badly by some lazy writing and weak characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Intelligent science fiction,"In the opening scenes we see protagonist Louise Banks raising and ultimately losing a daughter. We then see her lecturing in linguistics in a university; her class seems poorly attended but it soon emerges that there is a good reason for that... news is breaking of the arrival of twelve alien space ships. They are hovering at various points around the world just above the Earth's surface. Louise is approached by Colonel G.T. Weber of the US Military to help them try to communicate with the craft above Montana. Here she is teamed up with scientist Ian Donnelly. Upon entering the ship they meet two seven limbed aliens, dubbed 'heptopods'. It immediately becomes clear that their method of communication is unlike any human language. Gradually a basic vocabulary is developed; then a potentially worrying message is received... it may be an offer, or a threat or just a misunderstanding. Some countries take it as a threat and prepare to attack the crafts above their countries. If peace is to be maintained Louise and Ian will have to decipher the aliens' final message.If you are hoping for the sort of sci-fi that delivers lots of fasts moving action and sexy, almost human, aliens then you are in for a disappointment. If however you want an intelligent, ideas led story then you should watch this. Most science fiction conveniently avoids the problems of communication with ideas such as 'universal translators', 'translator microbes' of a fish you stick in your ear but this film is all about establishing communications. As such it moves at a fairly slow pace with much of the action set in drab rooms... this doesn't mean it was boring though; I was thoroughly engrossed and the twists, which I won't spoil, surprised me without being too convenient or irritating. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner impress as Louise and Ian and Forest Whitaker is solid in the role of Col. Weber. The rest of the cast is pretty good too. I feared that the ending might not live up to what went before but thankfully it did. Overall a great film that fans of more cerebral sci-fi need to watch... that's not meant as an insult to action packed space operas like 'Star Wars' or the high camp of 'Flash Gordon'; I love those as well!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Wow - what a surprise,"Sometimes I can get very irritated by a trailer for giving too much away (case in point, ""Room"" and more recently ""Passengers""). Sometimes I can get very excited by a really good teaser trailer (case in point, ""10 Cloverfield Lane""). But most of the time a ""ho hum"" trailer typically drives the expectation of a ""ho hum"" film: ""Jack Reacher: Never Look Back"" being a good recent example. Then there is ""Arrival""Because the trailer for ""Arrival"" belies absolutely nothing about the depth and complexity of the film. At face value, it looks like a dubious ""Close Encounters"" wannabe, with a threat of movement towards the likes of ""Independence Day"" and ""The 5th Wave"". Actually what you get is a film that approaches the grandeur of ""Close Encounters"" but interlaces it with the intellectual depth of ""Inception"", the mystery of ""Intersteller"" and a heavy emotional jolt or two of ""Up"".Amy Adams (""Batman vs Superman"") plays Dr Louise Banks, a language teacher at a US university facing a bunch of particularly disengaged students one morning. For good reason since world news is afoot. Twelve alien craft have positioned themselves strategically around the world, hanging a few feet from the ground in just the sort of way that bricks don't. Banks is approached by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) and offered the job of trying to communicate with the aliens: where did they come from? why are they here? Banks faces the biggest challenge of her academic career in trying to devise a strategy for communication without any foundation of knowledge on what level communication even works at for them. Assisted by Ian Donelly (Jeremy Renner, ""Mission Impossible IV/V"", ""Avengers""), a theoretical physicist, the pair try to crack the code against a deadline set by the inexorable rise of international tensions – driven by China's General Chang (Tzi Ma, ""Veep""; ""24"").Steven Spielberg made a rare error of judgement by adding scenes in his ""Special Edition"" of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" showing everyman power guy Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) entering the alien spacecraft. Some things are best left to the imagination. Here, a reprise of that mistake seems inevitable, but – perversely – seems to be pulled off with mastery and aplomb. The aliens are well rendered, and the small scale nature of the set (I'm sure I've been in similar dingy waiting rooms in UK railway stations!) is cleverly handled by the environmental conditions.But where the screenplay really kills it is in the emergence of the real power unleashed by the translation work. To say any more would deliver spoilers, which I won't do. But this is a masterly piece of science- fiction writing. The screenplay was by Eric Heisserer – someone with a limited scriptwriting CV of horror film reboots/sequels such as ""Final Destination 5"", ""The Thing"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" – so the portents were not good, which just adds to the surprise. If I were to be critical, some of the dialogue at times is a little TOO clever for its own good and smacks of Aaron Sorkin over-exposition: the comment about ""They have a word for it in Hungary"" for example went right over my head.Denis Villeneuve (""Sicario"") deftly directs, leaving the pace of the story glacially slow in places to let the audience deduce what is going on at their own speed. This will NOT be to the liking of movie fans who like their films in a wham-bam of CGI, but was very much to my liking. The film in fact has very little exposition, giving you lots to think about after the credits roll: there were elements of the story (such as her book) that still generated debate with my better half on the drive home.Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are first rate and an effectively moody score by Jóhann Jóhannsson (""Sicario""; ""The Theory of Everything"") round off the other high-point credits for me.An extraordinary film, this is a must see for sci-fi fans but also for lovers of good cinema and well-crafted stories.(Agree?

"Not A Masterpiece, An Achievement","Arrival was one of my most anticipated movies of 2016 I loved all the trailers for this film and the talent behind it made me even more excited to see the final product and I can safely say that I was blown away by the final product. This is a slow burning, thought provoking and incredibly intriguing Sci Fi masterpiece that I think in future years will become a classic. Amy Adams gives one of the greatest performances of her entire career in this film, she perfect embodies someone who is determined in her pursuit but damaged by her experiences and it's a performance that will hopefully give her an Oscar. Jeremy Renner was just perfect casting for this film he was incredibly convincing in this film and his chemistry with Adams was fantastic. Forrest Whitaker was great in this film and it was nice to see a different type of role from him. The slow pacing of this film worked perfectly it helped to build up the slow burning suspense and gave the characters more time to be developed better. The special effects in this film are also fantastic mainly because they are used sparingly as it is clear that the focus is more on the characters. Denis Villeneuve did such an amazing job directing this film he really sucked you into the situation and made it seem more life like. This film asks a lot of questions about humanity and how it interacts and these questions are incredibly intriguing and thought provoking it forces the audience to think on real life and accurate the events of this film are to real life. The whole mystery of why the aliens are here is done perfectly you're more that likely to change your mind at least once and when a mystery like that is built up for so long it's hard to make the eventual discovery satisfying but in this case it was, the eventual reveal makes you look at this film in an entirely different way, the film also doesn't feel the need to answer every question it asks leaving certain things ambiguous that allows the viewer to think on their own answers.Arrival is a film that trusts the intelligence and patience of its audience, it is complex and thought provoking but is never boring or dull. This is not only the greatest film of 2016 but it's possibly one of the greatest I've ever seen. I truly believe that in the future this film will become a classic.100%/A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Denis Villeneuve's magnum opus!,"Prior to approaching this film, a word of warning that it is what many like to call a ""thinking person's sci-fi"". If you're going to watch this, I beg that you dedicate your utmost attention to it, as it is truly one rewarding experience, one of the smartest, most well-constructed science fiction marvels of recent years. 'Arrival' is Villeneuve's magnum opus.Firstly, to put your mind at ease, I won't be analysing the plot, thus avoiding the use of spoilers. This decade, Villeneuve has crafted some fantastic works of art in the form of 'Prisoners', 'Sicario' and now this science fiction gem, and here's hoping his career further develops with more movie masterpieces coming our way. In a world where mysteries remain and the possibility of extraterrestrial life still stands unanswered, 'Arrival' approaches this with it's cliché-free take on the genre.The relatively unknown Bradford Young provides the film with some of the most stunning cinematography ever conceived, taking advantage of the twilight hour to give the film its somewhat unique look, supported magnificently by Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson whose score is both haunting and beautiful. If you're someone looking for a science-fiction tale that keeps you guessing and thinking throughout, with fantastic performances, cinematography, music and near-flawless direction, then 'Arrival' is the film for you. The masterpiece of 2016!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Dead on Arrival,"It's fitting, I think, that the main action of Arrival takes place on a barren Montana plain, because while pleasant looking in it's own nondescript way, the film itself is flat, empty, and mostly devoid of complex life. To begin with the highlights, Adams and Renner give frankly admirable turns in the roles they are given, and to go a step further Adams may well have salvaged what could have otherwise been a dull and forgettable part, one of a legion of 'approachably smart' tragic geniuses that movies and TV can't seem to get enough of. Whitaker and Stuhlbarg, unfortunately, are not afforded enough screen-time or overall thought to distinguish them from their narrative roles, and are given no chance to shine through the thick soggy blankets they've been written under.Arrival is a film that asks many questions and then proceeds to forget about most of them, to instead answer a set of completely different questions. If its title, its synopses, and the entirety of its marketing campaign had given off a general impression that the mystery at its center in any way concerned aliens and that the unraveling of this mystery would be its thesis, this impression is not well founded in the film itself. To save a reader the price of a ticket, the sum of what is learned of the aliens and the path taken to discover it, ergo the majority of the film's runtime, is simply not very interesting.The special effects, while serviceable, are not good enough on close inspection to be a selling point in their own right. The CGI would not look out of place in 2006, the designs are too grey and familiar to hold one's attention, and the film is too sedentary with its fantastical elements to qualify as a visual spectacle.The characters for the most part are flat archetypes, such that were it not devoid of all humor, one could be forgiven in mistaking Arrival for a Roland Emmerich movie. The framing and interactions are practically paint-by-numbers; brilliant liberal arts professor and her encyclopedic recitation of internet listicles, the self- superior yet hunky scientist, and the the gruff colonel who exists merely to have things explained to him on the audience's behalf and to provide a false sense of conflict whenever he disagrees with the protagonists for no good reason. The characters are at best nothing new, and together with the dialogue, I was put more in mind of a low-grade CBS procedural than the thought-provoking cinematic experience this film was evidently trying to be.Of course this is all driven moot by the film's ending, in which the audience member is slowly given to realize that the preceding ninety minutes was nothing but a plot device within an almost entirely unrelated personal drama. At it's heart, this, although I won't spoil what it is, is what the movie is actually about. The aliens are nearly inconsequential to this. The film is perfectly content to let the Aliens simply be aliens and explores them or the implications of what they are or do no further, beyond their relationship to this. I would feel cheated at the anti-climax if I weren't impressed at the movies bamboozling of my expectations. The weight of the reveal, which I take no shame in dwelling on as it's the only necessary part of the movie, hit me with its brunt right as the credits rolled, leaving me somewhat slack-jawed. Unfortunately whatever profundity the movie had re- earned at this point did nothing to assuage the tedium of a second viewing, and so I cannot earnestly recommend one.The true concept behind Arrival, which again I will not spoil here, is an intriguing one, but a full length feature film was not the right the medium in which to explore it. I will not discourage anyone from seeing the movie, it boasts a few solid performances and isn't at all an unpleasant time sink for an evening out or an empty afternoon, I will sum up my feelings to say that Arrival is harmless entertainment that is too conventional for its own good and makes poor use of its ideas.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A cerebral masterpiece,"There are different kinds of food. Some people don't like some kinds. That doesn't mean the food is bad ; it means their tastes aren't refined to enjoy that kind of food.Except for one gratuitous F-bomb (why do writers and directors do that?)... this is a brilliantly conceived and executed film.For those who don't get it, don't like it, hate it, or who were ""bored""... I'd have to say it's because this is a thinking-person's film that doesn't quite fit adrenaline-fueled brains that have been fed on sex, gore, violence and constant-action, CGI eye-candy. When it comes to science fiction, one either understands the concept of science + fiction... or they don't. If one reads the negative reviews, we see the same claims repeated: boring. Others claim it's pretentious. The only things boring and pretentious here are those jaded negative reviews.Science fiction does not always mean giant mutant animals, space battles, aliens blowing up cities, or rampaging robots. Sometimes it's just plain brilliant writing, directing and acting, with a script that catches the audience off-guard. This film is the exact opposite of a Michael Bay flick, the opposite of Battle Angel and Maze Runner and Hunger Games. This story requires thinking and a willingness to understand the story being told... as well as the vehicle in which it is delivered. Some folks watch a film just so they can rake it over the coals. Perhaps they need to go back to their eye-candy flicks and leave this level of sci fi to those capable of understanding it.This film is top-shelf, well worth the watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Intelligent, challenging, emotional, revolutionary.","This is one of the most fascinating stories I have seen adapted to the cinema by non other than the prolific and wonderful Denis Villeneuve. Arrival is one of those movies that you'll never finish praising 'cause every time you think about the plot, it'll seem incredible that this type of story came from a person and not from a heptapod itself. It's based on Ted Chiang's 1998 short story called Story of your Life.Let's start with the technical details. The general aesthetic that Villeneuve and his team want to impose is a simplistic and minimalist one. The direction and the cinematography are a fantastic mix. It's a simple display that plays with open shots, geometric and symmetrical sequences, close-up shots of the characters, out-of-focus shots and a color palette to synchronize with the emotions displayed. All this hints at an intimate, dreamlike and reflective tone. The late Icelandic composer Jóhannsson was able to connect perfectly with the ideas of the director Villeneuve, Chiang and the screenwriter Heisserer, and proposed deep and disturbing dissonances, but beautiful and subtle in keeping with the nature of the aliens in the film.Now back to the story, it's really cool. It challenges our perception of linear time as we know it, its entanglements with our memory and its far-reaching effects on our deepest emotions that ultimately make us human. There is no other movie where it doesn't make better sense to start playing with the timeline of its characters' history than this one. And not only that, but it also has the luxury of taking this game, looking at it, analyzing it, molding it and rearranging it to give us a work of art that you need a few seconds with your head on one side to fully understand it, and when you do it, there is no neuron left without receiving the most electrifying stimulus of their nanometric lives. As if that were not enough, this science fiction story presents us with a new linguistic puzzle with which it rethinks the way we see life itself. It's just an insanely good movie.You have to see it without distractions, with a fresh and rested mind.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

ARRIVAL: The Best Sci-fi Film Since CONTACT,"ARRIVAL delivers on so many levels it's impossible to describe without spoilers. The book is out there, so if you really must know before you see a film, read, ""The Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang...but I highly recommend you see the movie first. Honestly. You want it to unfold as a warm, fresh croissant on a chilly morning, and melt in your mouth.From visually stimulating scenes to an unexpected score masterfully composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson you recognize at once this is a thinking film you'll long remember.One scene in particular features a cloud that took my breath away. Sure, the extraterrestrial vehicle was amazing, but that cloud... As a photojournalist of nearly fifty years, I was stunned at the lifelike character of the cloud and suspected it was real, though I knew that was impossible; you can't cue Mother Nature when it's time to roll. I wanted to praise the CGI team for the effect, but Shawn Levy confirmed it was natural. They had set up to shoot this wide shot, worried about impending rain, or too much wind, or the lighting being too dark for the right effect, but the cloud wanted to become a star that day, and it rolled into frame with absolute perfection. This scene alone is worth a nod to Bradford Young for best cinematography.The special effects team delivered, too.Amy Adams performance was stunning. Sci-fi is largely disregarded when awards are passed out, but if the Academy neglects to acknowledge Adams work in this film, I may boycott them forever. Adams is Oscar-worthy for a Best Actress nomination for her character of linguist Dr. Louise Banks in this one, though Meryl Streep will most likely take it for Florence Foster Jenkins.It is clear the five years taken to bring this story to the screen were well worth the work.Ten well-deserved stars for ARRIVAL.

A Science Fiction Film for Your Mind,"Arrival (2016)**** (out of 4)Excellent science fiction film has a linguistics professor (Amy Adams) being called in by the government after twelve spaceships appear out of nowhere. The twelve ships are scattered throughout the world but no one can communicate with them until the professor tries to break through.Science fiction really isn't my favorite genre but there's no question that whenever it's done right you can get an excellent movie. ARRIVAL is a film about an alien invasion but there aren't any major fights. There really isn't too much action. Those wanting to see Will Smith blow up various spaceships are going to be disappointed because this certainly isn't that type of movie. What ARRIVAL is is a movie that tries to attack your mind instead of your ears and your senses. The movie doesn't try to be some blockbuster, although I must say that it's great to see it capture an audience like it did.I'm not going to pretend that I understood every single moment or twist in the film but what was so great about the movie is that even though you've seen countless invasion movies, director Denis Villeneuve manages to grab your attention right from the start and bring you into the material and take you for a ride. The film has been attacked by some as being dumb but I'm obviously going to disagree with that. The movie works perfectly as a science fiction film but also as a mystery since the lead characters are basically trying to solve a puzzle before it's too late.There's no question that one of the greatest things going for the film are its performances but the main focus should be on Adams. She gives an extremely intelligent and rather deep performance as Louise. I'm not going to spoil that various plot twists that happen since that wouldn't be fair to first time viewers but Adams is certainly wonderful in the role. One could argue that no one could figure out this language that the aliens are using but Adams really makes you believe the character and you can take this ride with her because you believe what you're seeing. Both Jeremy Renner and Forrest Whitaker are very good in their supporting roles as well as the various other actors in the supporting parts.The special effects are another major plus. I really loved the look of the aliens and thought they were simple but effective. Their form of communication also works extremely well and I thought it was a fascinating way to tell the story. The music score, cinematography and all other technical aspects are excellent and in the end ARRIVAL really delivers a thought-provoking story.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Masterpiece of Sci-Fi Cinema!,"Arrival is nothing short of breathtaking. This film transcends the boundaries of traditional science fiction, delivering a deeply emotional and intellectually stimulating experience. Denis Villeneuve's direction is impeccable, creating a world that feels both grounded and otherworldly.Amy Adams gives the performance of a lifetime as Dr. Louise Banks, portraying a linguist's journey with such raw emotion and nuance that you can't help but be captivated. The storyline is beautifully layered, blending humanity's first contact with extraterrestrial life with profound reflections on communication, time, and the choices that define our lives.Jóhann Jóhannsson's haunting score elevates the film to another level, perfectly complementing the stunning cinematography. Every scene is visually mesmerizing, with the alien ships and their mysterious interiors etched into your memory long after the credits roll.Arrival is not just a movie; it's an experience that challenges the mind and touches the heart. It's a rare gem that will leave you pondering its themes for days. A must-watch for anyone who appreciates thoughtful, groundbreaking storytelling.Bravo to the entire cast and crew for creating a timeless classic. ✨",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Sci-Fi Film Had Me Bawling Like a Baby,"Some of the best science fiction films are those that aren't actually what they appear to be about, but rather use a sci-fi premise to explore the human condition right here on Earth. ""Arrival"" is one such film. Though an encounter with aliens and humankind's reaction to it sets off the action in this film and comprises the bulk of its story, it's the human characters that we learn and care about.Amy Adams is one of those human characters, and she gives an absolutely lovely performance, one that totally carries the film. She gets no histrionics or big Oscar scenes, yet days after the movie I was still thinking about her and the journey her character goes on. It's hard to discuss the plot of ""Arrival"" without giving too much away to those who haven't seen it, and this is one movie that will be most effective if you know very little about it. It's got what I suppose would be considered a plot twist, but it's not one in the traditional, gimmicky sense. It grows organically from the plot, and by the time it comes you realize that it's not actually a twist but really what the movie's been about the whole time.The question ""Arrival"" asks is: ""If you had your life to do over again, good and bad, and didn't have the option of changing anything, would you?"" The ending, and Adams' character's answer to that question, had me crying like a baby in the movie theater.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Best of the (fairly rare) ""smart"" sci fi forks...","To this reviewer, there are two kinds of sci fi.The common type dates back to Buck Rogers and has more modern iterations in Star Trek and Star Wars. Action and mayhem.The other type, the ""smart"" or intellectual type, is harder to classify. It has been around forever but appears and disappears randomly. Consider the DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951/2008) or CUBE (1997) or the more recent MARTIAN (2015).The second type is an oddity because most of the heavy lifting takes place in your brain, not on the screen.I consider ARRIVAL the best example of the ""Smart"" genre ever done.These films, because they are so subjective, require a central character that the viewer can identify with. Ms. Adams deserves special merit for picking this film up and carrying it to the finish line.A must see, for fans of ""smart"" scifi.((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

"A film that not only tests the idea of aliens, but of humanity.","Are we alone? This question has haunted mankind since they first gazed at the stars. ""Arrival"" answers this question with an abrupt no. Other films have tackled the question of humanity being alone in the cosmos, from classics like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951) ""The War of the Worlds"" (1953) ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977) ""Arrival"" deals with the idea of alien landings in a much different way than traditional Sci-Fi films. While the picture focuses on creatures from another planet, it still has the uncanny ability to question our own humanity.Although ""Arrival"" is set up like many other Sci-Fi films with a doctor being needed by the government to do some top secret work to save human kind, it is not a traditional Sci-Fi film. Being Denis Villeneuve's first leap into the Sci-Fi genre ""Arrival"" is a story of self-reflection which is helped along by an alien presence. For no particular reason 12 alien ships land all over the planet in seemingly random locations. The only true form of communication takes place from a single opening in the bottom of the alien vessel, where Linguist Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is tasked at trying to open up dialog with the visitors. Physicist Dr. Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) is tasked with finding out how the alien vessel is capable of travel through space and how it seemingly defies gravity. The real question however remains in not how the aliens got to earth, but why?What sets this film apart from others in the genre is the way that it plays with the notion of time, love and the essence of being human. Which is showcased in director Denis Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer's effortless ability to jump from time and place. While trying to discover what the Aliens are, and their motivation, Dr. Louise Banks discovers what makes herself human and questions everything held sacred to her. ""Arrival"" is just as much a film about aliens landing on earth, as a film about self-discovery and the value placed on love and loss. Dr. Banks although participating in some of the most ground breaking work a linguist could ever be involved in, is haunted by the tragic loss of her daughter. This coupling of discovery and loss is reflected perfectly in the acting performance of Amy Adams who is often torn between several emotions throughout the film.Just as in his previous movies ""Sicario"" (2015) and ""Prisoners"" (2013) Denis Villeneuve employed composer Jóhann Jóhannsson who created an eerie and often unsettling composition for ""Arrival"". The sound pairs perfectly with the strange other worldly images of the aliens and their craft, the composition adds another layer of complexity to the already foreign and creepy world that is the alien craft. Visually the film is fantastic with an expert play on light and dark imagery, and the very deliberate use of color to emphasize certain characters and events. This transfers into the shadowy and smoke filled environment inside the alien vessel as well as the ink like Rorschach style alien writing. The visual effects used in Arrival give a sense of other worldly presence making the ship look as if it were a great technical feat of some unknown civilization, yet at the same time look organic as if were merely plucked from the surface of some far off planet. The aliens themselves look as if acquired from a Guillermo del Toro set, they are octopus like with long tentacle arms and gunmetal gray coloration, which begs the question of how a creature like this could have the dexterity to craft a sophisticated vehicle.The film comes together to create a package of visual, intellectual and audible bliss. The composition of Jóhann Jóhannsson is second to none and at times the sound plays a critical character in the film. The cast with inclusion of Michael Stuhlbarg and Forest Whitaker (2 actors not really know for Sci-Fi) was a welcome addition. The dynamic between Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner seemed organic and a hallmark of great acting. But the stand out performance was that of Amy Adams who played a truly troubled and conflicted character.In ""Sicario"" Vileneuve finished the movie with unanswered questions and left a lot to the imagination. In ""Arrival"" the film ended with a perfectly packaged ending that felt too neat and tidy. The film went into some sophisticated ideas that dived into the essence of humanity, yet did not give the same license for abstract thought with the conclusion. Ultimately Arrival is not just an exploration of alien beings, it's an exploration at what makes us human, and the positive and negative aspects that are associated with that humanity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Sorry, but ""Arrival"" didn't do it for me","I had high hopes for this movie: the premise (however unlikely according to the laws of physics) of aliens visiting Earth is endlessly fascinating and the work has had rave reviews. But I was disappointed - for me, this was ""Close Encounters Of The Slow And Boring Kind"" with a lack of entertainment value and a plot that was overly cerebral and rather opaque.I'm sorry to reach this conclusion since French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve fashioned a brilliant work in ""Sicario"" and there is much to admire in his latest film including striking cinematography by Bradford Young, an atmospheric score from Jóhann Jóhannsson, and an excellent performance from Amy Adams as a brilliant linguist who decodes the aliens' complex language.Ultimately the problem is the story-line which simply does not make sense and lacks narrative pace.

This generation's Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"The mystery of the unknown is something that doesn't get explored enough within science fiction. Too often we see science fiction films, particularly involving aliens, that are only interested with how we, as a species, would fight back against them.Every now and then however, we get a film like Denis Villeneuve's Arrival that comes along and offers something totally different. The film uses its tagline ""Why are they here?"" quite literally to deliver one of the most fascinating films you will see all year.Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is one of the world's leading linguists, who gets recruited by the military to assist in translating alien communications. Along with mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), Louise attempts to get answers as to why twelve alien spacecrafts have landed at different locations around the world.I had only seen three of Denis Villeneuve's previous films before yet I have been impressed with the diversity of his films, a trend he continues with Arrival. What I really admire about Villeneuve as a filmmaker is the choice he makes to not spoon feed the audience with every single piece of information. He instead makes films to challenge the audience, leaving them to either complete the puzzle themselves or question the morality of his characters.With Arrival, Villeneuve has crafted a truly thought provoking science fiction film, telling the story in a slow yet masterful manner, leading to a beautiful pay off. The theme of communication resonates massively with the world today, the moment communication between twelve countries via satellite link breaks down summing it up quite suitably.Villeneuve's storytelling is aided by some superb cinematography from Bradford Young and a haunting score from Jóhann Jóhannsson. Young's cinematography captures the sense of wonder perfectly while Jóhannsson's score heightens the sense of mystery surrounding the alien visitors and their intentions.Coming to the performances, Arrival features a real emotional heartbeat thanks to a fantastic performance from the always dependable Amy Adams, who conveys such a wide range of emotions as Louise, growing in confidence with each session she gets with the visitors. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker offer some fine support for Adams but there is no doubting this film belongs to her.Arrival is one of the best films of the year and a really great example of science fiction filmmaking from Denis Villeneuve, who is perfectly suited to bring us the sequel to Blade Runner next year. I would happily put this film in the same league as something like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, one of the all time greats of sci-fi.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An extraordinary film.,"I saw this last night at the opening of the Mill Valley film Festival. Arrival is unlike any movie I've ever seen. It's about love, loss, tolerance, language and non-linear time, wrapped in a science fiction story about our first encounter with extraterrestrials.Under director Denis Villeneuve's masterful direction, Arrival takes its time to unfold, but it gradually gets under your skin and commands your attention. The last half hour was one of the most emotional experiences I've had at the movies in a long time. There aren't many movies these days that I would call required viewing, but this is one of them. And Amy Adams is Oscar-worthy in the lead role. In fact, Arrival could also win Oscars for original score, sound, direction and Best Picture.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

People who didn't understand 2001,"Picasso was a Genius, he had so much to say, he could do it in the most abstract and cryptic way, and still be beautiful, poetic, meaningful.Jackson Pollock was a talentless drunk who threw paint on a canvas and called it art.If 2001: A Space Odissey is the Guernica, this movie is Number 8.That's what most of the new wave Sci Fi has become: Poorly trying to remake 2001. This movie is the definition of Kitsch. 2001 is cryptic because it had to be, this movie is cryptic because they intentionally made it cryptic. Thing is, just like the linguist who never thought of starting with drawings and mathematical representations and went straight for words in the English language, we'll be lost trying to decode it because there's nothing to decode.Something is cryptic if it has any meaning to begin with. Not all streams of numbers are cryptic, most are merely random. It is pointless to look for the Rosetta Stone to the Voynich manuscript because the Voynich manuscript is a meaningless fake.Arrival is the Voynich Manuscript of movies, enjoy the nonsense, and don't look for any further meaning, because there isn't any.If at least it had any action, It could be enjoyed with some popcorn, but on top of being meaningless, it's also a snoozefest.

Not as clever as many reviews make it out to be,"I have to admit, I was a little bit disappointed with this movie. This was touted as one of the best and most intelligent sci-fi movies of the year, and it didn't quite live up to all that praise. It's not a bad movie though. The acting is solid, the directing, sound design and visuals are really good. But the story is kind of bland. For a movie that is all about communication, I thought it was a little bit odd that the most obvious way of communication (pictures) was completely ignored. The movie also depicts Russia and China as paranoid villains, while America of course saves the day. In light of history, this is hard to believe. It is also very difficult to believe that China, a country whose alphabet is literally a bunch of pictures, would not try to communicate with pictures, and instead is presented as the aggressor against the aliens. In the end, the climax of the movie is basically one big Deux Ex Machina, and that is a tough pill to swallow. Could they not have thought of a resolution that was a little bit more clever, and not the equivalent of pulling a rabbit out of a hat? The whole movie is about communication, so shouldn't the movie end with a break through in communication? So while this is not a bad movie, it's not a very good sci-fi movie. It needed a better script.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I'm glad this movie arrived,"""Despite knowing the journey... and where it leads... I embrace it. And I welcome every moment of it.""Now Denis wanted to talk to aliens. I remembered watching this in the theater and was surprised that it wasn't actually about alien invasion. Just like the previous movies, the second time viewing with some prior understanding made me appreciate this piece of art.The music and cinematography resolved so well with each other. Whenever the characters came into the spacecraft, it was an entirely immersive, quiet, yet slightly intense because I, like the characters, were stepping into the unknown. Like Enemy, the whole scenes were filled with one blue color, creating a sad yet again immersive tone.Just as immersive was the performance by Amy Adams. Her character had to deal with a trauma while talking to these aliens. Such sadness filled her face, as well as the voiceover.This time Denis explored the dual nature of language. It can divide as well as unite people. It's a weapon as well as a gift. Denis cleverly reaffirmed the main purpose of language as a gift by capitalizing on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Not only that, this usage also became a way to beautifully explore the nature of time and apply it to build Amy Adams's character and how she confronted her trauma. I just loved how everything seamlessly coalesced and nothing felt forced.Besides that one exposition scene that explained the nature of writing and language, I don't have any problem with this movie.Overall, a beautiful, emotional, and immersive movie with a daring theme about a common tool that can unite us all. 9.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Slightly overrated,"I mostly enjoyed this film while watching it, but the ending was weak and empty. It reminds me of Christopher Nolan's films, where he uses science fiction in order to attempt to pretend this films have sophistication and brilliance. But in reality it's a smokescreen to hide the fact that you're watching gibberish. Go ahead and say that I'm wrong, but you know in your heart it's true...In the case of Arrival, there is quite a bit of filler going on, and it's perhaps not until the final act that we get some meat, but then it just ends. I don't want to have to use the spoiler button but honestly the revelation that is presented is pretty epic if you think about it, yet the film really makes no attempt to capitalize on it other than for the single portion we see during the film.

A Science Fiction Masterpiece,"Arrival is the best sci-fi film I've seen in my 22-year-old lifespan. I haven't seen certain sci-fi films like They Live, Alien 3, or Metropolis, so I can speak only from the standpoint of someone who watches a shitload of narrative, documentary and experimental films. Some of my recent favorites are Holy Motors (2012), Son of Saul (2015), and The Look of Silence (2015).I just saw Arrival two days ago at the Telluride Film Fest and everyone in the theater had their brains cheesed out at various points in the film. For people paying close attention to every frame, the rules of the film might become clear in the beginning sequences. For an Average Joe moviegoer like me, the film is a slow, natural process of discovery from the first scene to the last. The influences of Stanley Kubrick on science fiction films has been noted time after time, but Arrival picks up its Kubrick vibes with it's slow sense of discovery, even if Amy Adams and her technology moves around the screen more frantically than 2001: A Space Odyssey. That's why I respect this film and also why I like 10 Cloverfield Lane. A lot of sci-fi films (like the new Star Trek released this summer) don't create that unfolding sense of science/alien-related mystery. The way information is revealed and presented leaves us begging for more answers, and boy does Arrival deliver.Oscar-worthy for sure, especially in production design/special effects/sound.

There should be more films like this,"Earth is visited by aliens and a Professor of Linguistics has the ominous challenge of establishing communication.This is an interesting and visually beautiful film with strong themes and some quite emotional moments.The plot involves the unraveling of a mystery surrounding certain characters and has an element of race against time drama. It is not exciting in the traditional sense of Hollywood entertainment, but is a refreshing story of heroism through intelligence and avoidance of conflict.I love the themes of communication, understanding, and different perspectives on the universe that come out during the most important scenes. It makes me think of movies like 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' and 'Close Encounters of a Third Kind', which are similar themed, but 'Arrival' shows the dangers of the negative human response to misunderstood language. Game theory is quite prevalent in the movie's portrayal of various countries responding to their interpretation of the aliens' intentions.The characters are written as believable individuals who behave plausibility in a number of situations. I found some interactions quite emotional, and I think some scenes will definitely hit home with parents.Visually it showcases plenty of stunning cinematography, strong editing, beautiful colour grading, and artfully designed sequences involving the alien language. As some scenes are quite repetitive the movie relies on the quality of the visuals to keep it as interesting as possible.I would say this is a movie about communicating with other forms of life, and seeing the universe from a different perspective. Although there are some moments of violence, it is not a particularly violent or action centric movie in the slightest. So anybody looking for a popcorn alien invasion movie should stick to the Avengers or Independence Day. If you are interested in movies with the complete opposite purpose, i.e. People looking for ways to work together, make discoveries, and avoid violence, that is what 'Arrival' is about.All the cast are great, particularly Amy Adams who carries it well. It's good to see Jeremy Renner in this type of role and he is typically solid.I don't think it's perfect. It is a mostly joyless affair, with little relief from the dark, melancholic tone of virtually every scene and there are some rather unsubtle exposition dumps written into the dialogue.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

An extra point for mentioning Abbott and Costello.,"I did not want to see this film, but it was the only thing showing first thing in the morning when I had the opportunity to get to a cinema. I'd seen the trailer and it didn't look good. I was more than pleasantly surprised. There's real emotional power in this film, borne from a strong (cerebral) script, delivered by a director in real control of the material, and a standout performance at its center.Everything that can be said, has been, so I'll keep it simple. If you're a parent, this will hit you right in the gut. It's not a film for 18 year old's hoping for Independence Day style explosions. This is a film for emotionally mature people and those with half a brain. That rules out all the naysayers (mostly active in the forums).Judging by the scores however, most IMDb people do have an appreciation for something stimulating and engaging, elements lacking from most superhero/remake fodder today.I love Abbott and Costello movies, so really appreciated those references and the Sheena Easton gag, lost on many I assume.It's not a film about special effects, but I'm really glad I saw it at the cinema. It didn't allow me the opportunity to pause it and wander off and come back to it. I was drawn in emotionally and held captive, in a particular mindset, for the duration of the story. As a parent, there were tears, I'm not ashamed to admit.I hope those younger naysayers embarrassing themselves in the forums get the opportunity to revisit this film in later years and feel its true worth.

Clever and thought-provoking but a bit underwhelming and derivative,"Aliens have landed on Earth, in 12 different locations. Language professor Louise Banks joins a US army team at one of the locations, in Montana. Her job is to try to learn the aliens' language and enable communication with them. Through regular meetings with two of the aliens she starts to compile a record of the aliens' ""language"" - a series of drawn symbols. The important question is - are they friend or foe? Other nations with alien landings are starting to view them as a threat, making it a race against time as war with the aliens could erupt at any moment.Interesting, engaging drama. The concept of aliens arriving and how we deal with them, especially communicate with them, was well thought out. Could have been explored more thoroughly though.The reason it isn't is that the movie takes a sharp detour towards the end. The aliens aren't ultimately the main story, something (or someone) else is. The detour is quite clever, and its point quite thought-provoking.However, due to its late arrival, the second plot isn't explored much at all, just left as a profundity without much room for debate or development. This makes that theme feel a bit half-baked. This is exacerbated by the fact that it comes out of a storyline that had, until then, seemed unimportant and merely there as padding. So the profundity comes out of a story that you weren't that engaged with.In addition, you feel blindsided by this twist. The focus is on and the engagement is with the alien story. When the ultimate theme comes along, the alien story quickly has to make way, making the ending to that feel rushed, contrived and a bit of a damp squib.It also doesn't help that the plot feels a bit derivative, with movies like Contact, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Interstellar springing quickly to mind.Overall: intriguing and entertaining with a clever twist but a bit underwhelming, given its potential.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I just don't get the love,"People are hailing this as Villeneuve's greatest, but IMHO his masterpiece is Incendies. Prisoners and Enemy are also excellent. I truly felt deeply for the characters in those earlier movies - based on those other flicks, I consider Villeneuve to be a genius.What happened with Arrival? I don't know. Perhaps sci-fi is not his forté. Perhaps he was hampered by a book that was difficult to transform into a visual work of art. But mostly I found the movie to be embarrassingly pretentious.There are attempts to create suspense through loud music, but they just fall flat. The alien ships are uninteresting and not particularly threatening. The movie also could have been several minutes shorter - why did that boring helicopter ride take so long? That was just one example of directorial conceit.All the characters aside from Amy Adams are totally incidental and could be replaced by anyone - what a waste of Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker.On the positive side - at least we see some different looking aliens, a vast improvement over the cliché tropes from the past 35 years. Amy Adams gives a sensitive and moving performance (aside from the usual screen rule for actors to have their mouths open in awe half the time, a requirement she handles better than most mouth breathers).Overall, Arrival comes off as a sophomoric attempt to show us how we all have to work together to save our world. A necessary, noble and admirable mission, but oh my - there must be a zillion more effective and engaging ways to get that message across.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Masterpiece 10/10,"Arrival is a masterful blend of science fiction and emotional storytelling, directed with precision by Denis Villeneuve. The film explores the concept of time as non-linear, using language as the bridge to this profound idea. Amy Adams delivers a moving performance as Dr. Louise Banks, whose journey is as personal as it is universal. Comparable to Interstellar and Inception, it challenges viewers to rethink communication, choice, and destiny. The stunning visuals and haunting score create an immersive experience, making Arrival a standout in modern cinema. A deeply impactful and unforgettable film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Not the usual alien invasion.,"Denise Villeneuve delivered yet another amazing movie. Some huge UFOs land on our planet. The aliens instead of attacking humanity, they actually try to communicate with it. This motion picture really stands out for its originality, instead of being yet another mindless action shenanigan, it delivers deeper topics and I think that the entire relationship between human and creatures was well built and realistic as well. I appreciated the slow pace of the plot because in this case it deepens the characters and I personally got really attached to Louise and to the aliens. ""Arrival"" kept me on the verge, because the director unveiled the mystery around the plot slowly, the big revelation is only at the very end. I had to watch it a couple of times in order to fully understand the ending due to some details that I missed during my first watch, but overall it is very straightforward and I was able to connect all the dots. Cast members are amazing: Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker and Amy Adams stole the scene.I think that the soundtrack and the sound design were extremely well done and they create a lot of tension and suspense which perfectly match with the mood of the movie. Visual effects were nicely done, and I really enjoyed the design of the aliens, which I personally found interesting and different than usual. Despite the numerous movies about alien invasions, this one is in my opinion one of the best and original ones out there, definitely recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

translation makes for a great movie,"I first learned of Denis Villeneuve when his Academy Award-nominated ""Incendies"" got released. He's directed some movies since then, but now he brings one of the most impressive movies. Although advertised as a science fiction movie, ""Arrival"" emphasizes language issues. Amy Adams's linguist gets hired to communicate with the extraterrestrial beings, and in the process breaks down their language. She notes that a person's native language influences how he/she thinks, and we soon learn that the aliens' language is unlike any recorded language.Overall, the movie addresses our relationships with each other and with other species, as well as our place in the universe. But the language issues are the main point (as a man who's into foreign languages, I particularly enjoyed this aspect). It turns out that there is often better communication between the humans and the aliens than among the humans, as the different governments start refraining from talking to each other. Whether or not we can communicate with each other will be one of the most important matters in the coming years, especially if world leaders refuse to do so.Anyway, outstanding movie.

"""Arrival"" Review","In ""Arrival,"" mysterious spacecraft land on Earth and a team of investigators, led by linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), to look further into this situation. The arrival of these visitors, called heptapods, begins to raise questions about who or what they are. Banks and her team race against time to figure out how best to communicate with these unusual beings. As she unravels the mystery surrounding the spacecraft, Banks takes a life-threatening risk that could potentially make or break the whole of mankind.Based on a short story entitled ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang and the latest directorial effort from Denis Villeneuve (""Prisoners,"" ""Sicario""), the film is not a science fiction story in the traditional sense of the term. Instead, it can be regarded as an allegory for discovery of one's self, and joins ""Interstellar"" and ""'2001: A Space Odyssey"" as a film that raises scientific questions about humanity itself. Because the heptapods use symbols as their language when communicating with the human characters, this plays a key role in the film's themes of interaction with different cultures, and the paranoia that can arise from misinterpretation. The visual motif depicting numerous international broadcasts of the heptapod spaceships further reveals how this is also a major international conundrum.Adams gives one of her best performances as Louise, who is trying to put herself back together after the loss of her daughter. She carries the weight of the film and never lets go as she struggles to make sense of what is going on around her whilst interacting with these heptapods. There is a great degree of subtlety and nuance in Adams' performance that makes Louise all the more endearing and relatable. Some of her more memorable scenes are outside the pod with Renner portraying Ian, containing the best, most natural dialogue from Eric Heisserer's screenplay. Supporting players Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg also portray their roles as Col. Weber and Halpern with a greater degree of sympathy and complexity than the typical military operatives seen on film.The stone-shaped pods and squid-like heptapods are thoroughly designed, with their glass environment retaining the appearance of a waterless aquarium. Villeneuve creates graceful compositions of science-fiction scenery on par with Kubrick's imagery in ""2001,"" and the slow, melodic editing by Joe Walker and muted cinematography by Bradford Young add to its claustrophobic atmosphere. Adding to all of this is Jóhann Jóhannsson's haunting music score, which is just as mysterious as the heptapods themselves.""Arrival"" is a fascinating glimpse into human behavior and interaction with the unknown, making it a science fiction film open to various re-interpretations upon multiple viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Strange events happen when twelve extraterrestrial spacecrafts appear.,"A breathtaking and overwhelming flick resulting in a spectacular journey through the wonders of an allegedly pacific alien invasion and the mysteries of time from the boundaries of the incredible to the borders of the impossible. Mysterious 12 spaceships land in different parts of the Earth. Then the United States government hires an elite team, who must communicate with them to discover what their intentions are. So, U. S. Army Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) asks the assigment for linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) who at the same time is caring for her adolescent daughter, who dies of cancer. While she is lecturing at a university, Louise is asked to join physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) (an experimental physicist) to decipher their language and find out why they have come to Earth. But the extraterrestrial beings are very weird, as time is non-linear for the aliens, and they have different means of communication. Why are they here?A slow and brooding Sci-fi movie with intelligent themes but that the ordinary viewer looking for strong emotions and some action might not like. This picture successfully combines visuals with character studio, though the complicated story is still somewhat impressive. It is a contemplative and thoughtful film, made to think and be very attentive to it; that's why it is necessary to be very absorbed in order to savor the nuances that little by little are emerging, and in the end it turns out to be rewarding. However, being difficult to follow there are many questions that are not correctly explained, with full of flashbacks and flash-forwards that make the whole thing quite complex. In fact, I did not understand the plot very well but thanks to a the complete synopsis provided in 'IMDB' I was able to clarify what it was about, especially the final disjointing. Along with two main starring: Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, giving stunning acting, there are awesome secondaries, such as: Forest Whitaker, Michael Stuhlbarg , Mark O'Brien and Tzi Ma.It contains a mysterious and 'new age' style musical score by composer Jóhann Jóhannsson. As well as a luxurious but somewhat dark cinematography by cameraman Bradford Young. The motion picture was originally written/directed by Denis Villeneuve, developing the moving story amid attractive visuals that even surpass other films from this powerful director. Containing an interesting and elucidating script by writer Eric Heisserer based on the story ""Story of Your Life"" written by Ted Chiang. In fact, the original name for the film was the same as the source novella; however, test audiences did not like that title, so it was changed to ""Arrival¨. Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer created a fully functioning, visual, alien language. Heisserer, Villeneuve, and their teams managed to create a ""logogram bible"", which included over a hundred different, completely operative logograms. Villenueve is a good filmmaker who has made decent movies, such as: ¨Enemy¨ , ¨Sicario¨ , ¨Incendies¨, ¨Prisoners¨ , ¨Maelström¨, ¨Blade Runner 2049¨, ¨Dune I and II¨. Rating Arrival (2016): 6/10. A decent sci-fi film, but those looking for non-stop action, spaceship attacks, or other similar films should beware and avoid watching it .",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Coming to a country near you,"Denis Villeneuve is aiming for a high brow, intellectually stimulating sci fi film. It had all the tropes of an alien invasion film.You might think Independence Day or The Day the Earth Stood Still or even 2001: A Space Odyssey but the director keeps his cards closely to his chest while leaving little clues here and there in the space/time continuum.Twelve alien ships land around the globe. Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is the linguist expert brought in by the military in the USA to communicate with the aliens in the ship that is over Montana.Physicist Dr Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) has also been recruited to find out how the spaceship has travelled through the vast reaches of space but both are really tasked to find out why they have arrived.The various governments and their associated military are convinced that this is an invasion and some of them have become extremely nervous with the alien's intentions and the slow pace in understanding what is going on.Before long nations that were communicating with each other suddenly cease sharing information and throwing down ultimatums to the visitors.Dr Banks makes a breakthrough and finds out that the aliens have a complex visual language but the meaning of the words are open to interpretation which is not helped by a media frenzy based on misinformation and half truths.Dr Banks is also affected by scenes of her daughter who died young through a rare disease but those memories might actually help her to deal with the aliens.Even though the events depicted are on a global scale, Villeneuve keeps the human drama on a smaller more abstract level and lets the film unravel like a mystery.I guess there is something a little Christopher Nolanesque about the resolution. There is clever and eerie use of music and sounds. With the appearance of the aliens, you can understand why people are nervous.I found myself thinking back to Independence Day or the television series Torchwood: Children of Earth for sinister motives by the aliens as they were shrouded in smoke behind a glass wall.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
What a beautiful piece of science fiction.,"In an age where sci-fi movies can just as easily be horrendous as they can be wonderful, it can be a gamble going to the theater. I didn't have much expectations going in to see ""Arrival"", but I think that was to my benefit last night. What a unique, thoughtful film this was.Essentially, Amy Adams plays knowledgeable university linguist Louise Banks and Jeremy Renner plays her physicist foil. Forest Whitaker plays their skeptical boss and does great in his own right. One day, a dozen colossal alien spacecraft appear at seemingly random locations across the globe, and we tag along the Americans as they attempt to communicate with the visitors, all while also trying to maintain conversation between the other divided nations. I won't spoil anything else - that's sufficient enough information to walk into the film excited.The acting is great, the visuals are great, the tension is towering; I found myself feeling terrified for the humans engaging the aliens and the entire scene where the main cast first enters the ""shell"" is one of the greatest uses of suspense I've seen since ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". The actors did well to convey their sense of utter wonder and fear and I felt enveloped in mankind's anxiety for first contact. And the SCORE, it was just beautiful... Dvorak composed some gorgeous work and you may also recognize the palindromic music from Shutter Island in the beginning and end sequences.This is an example of what I call an ""efficient"" film; nothing goes to waste. Every line of dialogue, every clue, every image serves a purpose and it delivers such an incredible punch towards the finale that you can't help but feel compensated. This really is what makes the film stand out from the rest of science fiction - it's moving creative, and non-gratuitous, and it earns every tear and clap the audience emits. It's so difficult to combine something as significant as a worldwide alien appearance with raw, deserved human emotion and somehow still make sense. I loved all of it, from start to finish (and back again).Go and see ""Arrival"". Have as little expectations as possible, for you might be disappointed if you're hoping for a ""Battle: Los Angeles"" or even something reminiscent of ""Contact"". Let yourself be swathed by the movie, drink in what it says about human beings, relationships, time, and language. Congratulations Villeneuve, you've created a masterclass piece of science fiction.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A must-see for anyone who enjoys cleverly written sci-fi,"Arrival is a science fiction film starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. Easily one of the most thought-provoking films I have seen since Interstellar, it is a must-see for anyone who enjoys cleverly written sci-fi. However, if you are expecting non-stop action and explosions, you will be disappointed.In random locations around the world, twelve mysterious alien spacecrafts touch down with unknown intentions. A special team is assembled by the US military, led by Colonel Weber (Forrest Whitaker), to attempt to communicate with the aliens. The team enlists the help of expert linguist Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to help translate the alien language to figure out if they are here for peaceful reasons or to declare war on humanity.Featuring clever and intriguing themes about the nature of humanity and our place in the universe, Arrival is a thinking person's sci-fi film that delivers everything you'd expect and more. Director Denis Villeneuve's creative use of cinematography and long shots inside the alien spacecraft is very reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I think he's a great choice to direct the upcoming Blade Runner 2049. Amy Adams gives an excellent performance in the role of Dr. Louise Banks. There was never a moment in the film where her character felt unbelievable or forced.

Do NOT be fooled by bad reviews,"I'm gonna try say this in a nicest way as possible; it requires a bit of IQ to truly appreciate this film and you need to be able to love films who has a substancial plot and not just a typical alien film with lots of explosions and people arguing about survival.I was SO surprised by so many bad reviews, until I realised everyone of them had pretty much the same argument: it's boring.Let me tell you this: if you think this movie is boring, then you probably can't appreciate this masterpiece on an interlectual level! This film reaches out to ALL the typical cliche questions I've ever had in alien film: why do alien always have to be resembling us? How come they can live and breathe the same air as us - who says they didn't evolve in different conditions than us? And why are they either more interlectual than us, or just savage beasts? And the most important one: WHY do they always understand us or conveniently have technology that can translate our speech? And WHY do they always have to use a mouth and speech or sounds like we do? Whose to say there's not an entirely different way of communicating in outer space that humans quite simply cannot comprehend?ENTER ARRIVAL!!!!!!Arrival is so complex and so wonderfully well written. I've studied linguistics myself and the approach during this film was absolutely, mind-glowingly amazing. They take everything we know about math, science and linguistics to a new level. I found that watching this film the second time is even better. I really enjoy how this is a film that is fully aware of what genre it's in, and creates some typical settings that the audience is familiar with, but brings in a whole new and quite original approach! And most importantly: it actually made sense out of what it was trying to do. It is fiction, yes, but so well written that it truly makes you believe that the language studied in the film is just another unknown language humans don't know about!Please don't be fooled by these bad reviews I saw! If you're just into action and brain dead films that doesn't make you use your brain a little, then this is probably not for you.But if you enjoy a true masterpiece that makes you think and reflect, and which stays in your mind hours after you watched it, then you'll love it!!Had to give 10 stars because this film might just have made it to the top of my favourite alien genre films!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

It will make you think and will grab all your attention.Intertwined with periodic flashbacks backed by a terrific score, Arrival will also move you and touch you. While some of the material has been done before several times, it definitely updates the ""worldwide crisis"" line of the story and even differentiates itself enough to stand apart from other movies that have done so.In the end, Arrival is definitely one of the best movies of the year.

"""A Thought-Provoking Masterpiece""","Arrival is not just a science fiction film; it's an immersive exploration of language, time, and the profound implications of first contact. A slow-burn for fans of the sci-fi genre, Arrival takes the opposite approach to Nolan's Interstellar, exploring what would happen if Earth was visited by intelligent life. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, this cinematic gem boasts a stellar performance by Amy Adams and a narrative that lingers long after the credits roll.The film centers around Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a linguist tasked with deciphering the language of extraterrestrial beings who have arrived on Earth in mysterious, gargantuan spaceships. What follows is a mind-bending journey as Banks delves into the alien language, discovering a unique form of communication that challenges our understanding of time and causality.The film's core premise revolves around the breakdown of the language barrier between humans and extraterrestrial beings. The alien language, Heptapod, becomes a bridge for understanding, a tool for building trust and cooperation. While the film focuses on alien communication, it also emphasizes the importance of language in human relationships. Louise's daughter's illness and subsequent loss is a powerful subplot that highlights the role of language in expressing grief, love, and shared experiences.Beyond its sci-fi premise, Arrival is a deeply human story. It explores themes of loss, grief, and the power of human connection. The film's non-linear narrative structure adds to its complexity and emotional impact, allowing viewers to experience Louise's journey through time and memory.Arrival is a feast for the eyes. The film's visual aesthetic is both alien and intimate. The alien language, visualized as organic, fluid symbols, is a visual marvel. They are both beautiful and mysterious, reflecting the alien intelligence they represent. The film's cinematography is equally impressive, with wide shots of the vast landscapes emphasizing the insignificance of humanity in the grand scheme of the universe.Jóhann Jóhannsson's score is an integral part of Arrival's emotional impact. Ethereal and melancholic, it perfectly complements the film's contemplative tone. The music often feels like an extension of the alien language, creating a sense of otherworldly mystery. The score's ability to evoke both awe and dread is a testament to Jóhannsson's talent.Arrival is a testament to the power of human intellect and our innate desire to connect with the unknown. It challenges our preconceived notions about language, time, and the potential for peaceful coexistence with extraterrestrial life.Unlike many blockbusters, Arrival's climax is a quiet, intellectual triumph rather than a loud, action-packed spectacle. The film's resolution is a testament to the power of human understanding. It's a moment of profound connection between Louise and the aliens, achieved through language and empathy. As the climax of the movie wanes and you slowly begin to realize the true meaning of this film, you can't help but feel overwhelmed and ask yourself, ""what if I got another chance at life?""This isn't your typical Alien Action Movie, so please watch it with your mind present, and phone set away. Or else, you'd miss many minor but crucial points. They all lead to understanding the ending.Arrival is a thought-provoking masterpiece that transcends the genre of science fiction. Its intelligent script, exceptional performances, and stunning visuals create a cinematic experience that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant. It's a film that invites repeated viewings, revealing new layers of meaning with each watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Close Encounters Better,"Why would an alien civilization need we humans to teach them how to communicate with us.

Just another alien movie where the writers drew too heavily on what WE know. An alien movie should start from what we don't know and the questions we have about what we don't know. Or, better yet, take a look at some drawings of 3 year-olds. They are more creative than this.Throw in the usual protagonist and antagonist plot and we discover what again?

"A powerfully intense, cerebral and exhilarating watch","This is a very special film. A hugely unique take on first contact, Arrival is one of the most intense and cerebral experiences you've ever had at the movies, requiring full concentration, an open mind, and patience for a slow-moving, but utterly enthralling story. Featuring exceptional performances, astonishing directing from Denis Villeneuve, a near-perfect screenplay, and a mesmerising score, this is a truly exhilarating film to watch, and one that will leave you thinking and pondering long after the credits have rolled.First off then, suppose the most important thing to say about this film is that you have to have your brain turned on. This is not even in the same league as the likes of Independence Day or even Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, but is instead a dark, heavy-going drama that only uses a science-fiction setting to tell a gripping and emotionally powerful story about humanity.Much like all of Denis Villeneuve's films, Arrival is at times a soul- destroying experience, portraying some utterly devastating forecasts of how people around the world would deal with first contact, but that's one of the reasons that it's such an arresting watch.Villeneuve himself does an exceptional job at directing this film. It's the first massive-scale project we've seen from him, but his astonishing ability to create a stunningly eerie and tense atmosphere at every single moment in this film, whether it be in the unnerving sweeping shots of the alien spacecraft, or the smaller, more claustrophobic moments centring on the human characters' efforts to deal with them, is testament to what a talent he is.And that tense eeriness carries over brilliantly into every other part of the film. For me, one of the most memorable elements of Arrival was the score by Jóhann Jóhannsson. Staying effectively silent for so much of the film, Jóhannsson takes an incredibly unique and experimental approach to the music of the film, often making it appear as if it is sound coming from the real world.At times, the aliens' cries and speech become pieces of musical score, adding significantly to the sense of danger and tension, which was stunning to see. At others, however, he uses some powerful instrumental tunes to heighten the drama of the characters' emotions, and although this is a film in which you can hear the score, it plays such a significant role in shaping your experience that it's a huge positive.Along with the music, the performances are another key element that make this film so stunningly intense. At the centre of it all is Amy Adams, who is astonishing from start to finish. Dealing with a very complex character and story, she brilliantly powers through and portrays a huge range of emotions, from her character's crushing depression early on in the film, to her determination and strength whilst attempting to communicate with the alien beings. It's not the normal Amy Adams we know and love so much, but a far more battle-hardened and intense performance, but that deviation from her more typical roles is spectacular to watch, making this easily one of her best ever performances.And finally, we come to the screenplay. Based on a short story, the writing here is an exceptional display of ingenuity and intelligence. The heavy-going and slow-paced nature of the movie becomes a virtue because of the writing, giving you as a viewer the time to think about everything that is going on and understand it deeper, whilst also taking on some incredibly complex ideas and themes and making them work almost perfectly in the context of a science-fiction film.In the end, however, this film isn't so much about the aliens as it is about its human characters. The story is very difficult to talk about without spoilers, however I can say that the way the film's narrative unfolds throughout is genuinely one of the most unique and brilliant things I've ever seen, and it makes for an astonishingly powerful development of emotions towards the finale. It does require an open mind, but with that comes a truly incredible and thought-provoking story.Overall, I was blown away by Arrival. A masterpiece of directing, scoring, acting and writing, it's a truly exhilarating watch that will take you on a devastating roller-coaster of emotions, but with an ingenious and utterly enthralling story that you will not forget in a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I don't believe this film lived up to the hype **spoilers***,"I gave this film a 7 because it is visually stunning, well-acted, and the premise --while is what ultimately disappointed me-- is very unique and interesting.However, for starters, this film felt way too truncated. The aliens speak a highly complex language using ink-blotters and it is never explained how they finally understand the language - they just suddenly do... out of no where. There wasn't even an aha! moment. They literally went from saying ""this could take a hundred years to decipher,"" which is believable considering the language is entirely different than any human language, to just suddenly understanding it fluently.That's not even my biggest gripe. What really disappointed me was that the ""language"" didn't just give them a better understanding of reality or a more efficient way to communicate, it literally gave them the ability to defy physics. I've always been intrigued by the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis but I never suspected differences in language could give you metaphysical powers.And I love space/science-fiction movies! Interstellar is one of my favorite movies and I love the Martian and the 5th Element. I can suspend my disbelief very well, I just can't make ridiculous leaps in logic like this film tried to have me do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Overrated boring film from ""M Night Shyamalan"" Director's School","I see plenty of reviews comparing this movie with ""Contact"", when in fact it is a lot more closer to ""Signs"". It is an ode in honor of M.

Such as:1. This movie has one of the worst music score from recent years. 2. Slow to a crawl in most of it 3. Cardboard, flat charactersIt is not a total loss, but frankly, masterpiece?

Cinema At Its Very Best!,"Based on the short story ""Story of Your Life"" by author Ted Chiang, Director Denis Villeneuve's 'Arrival' blends Science-Fiction with Drama, to startling results. Stunningly Shot, Excellently Directed, Superiorly Acted & Masterfully Written, this recent critical & commercial success is an unmissable film, that only & only rewards its viewer. I was at the edge of my seat, throughout!'Arrival' Synopsis: When mysterious spacecrafts touch down across the globe, an elite team - led by expert linguist Louise Banks (As Oscar Worthy Amy Adams) - is brought together to investigate. As mankind teeters on the verge of global war, Banks and the team race against time for answers - and to find them, she will take a chance that could threaten her life, and quite possibly humanity.'Arrival' is projected as a Sci-Fi Alien Invasion film, and it is, but that's only on the surface. At heart & soul, 'Arrival' is a story on motherhood, the gift of being special & how violence is not always the answer to fight an endangering third kind. 'Arrival' is as much an emotional drama, as it sticks to being a Sci-Fi visual dazzler. I wouldn't want to give away the film's final twist, but all I can say is, we barely come across a twist as sharp & moving as this one. It simply WOW's you!Eric Heisserer's Adapted Screenplay is masterful. Easily one of the finest Screenplays to get made into film, Eric's affecting & engrossing Writing make 'Arrival' something so special, its hard to forget it anytime soon. The narrative builds up suspense, tension & an undercurrent of emotions, without ever giving you the feel of over-stuffing. Oscar Chase seems very possible for Eric!Denis Villeneuve's Direction is excellent. Emerging as one of THE finest directors of our time, Villeneuve creates such a mood & an atmosphere so accurate, you'd be silly if you looked away from the screen at any time. Bradford Young's Cinematography is stunning. Young creates poetry out of every frame & makes 'Arrival' an experience to be witnessed. Joe Walker's Editing is razor-sharp. Art & Costume Design are flawless. Graphics are top-notch. Jóhann Jóhannsson's Score is exhilarating.Performance-Wise: Amy Adams as Dr. Louise Banks, delivers a sensational performance. In a career filled with knockout performances, Adams again delivers, this time, with even more skill & sheer conviction. The supremely talented actress carries the film on her firm shoulders & not for even a single second, does she let you go. If this performance doesn't get Oscar attention, then what does an Oscar even mean? Jeremy Renner underplays his part well. Forest Whitaker is effective, as always. Michael Stuhlbarg is solid.On the whole, 'Arrival' is Cinema At Its Very Best! The film goes beyond the clichés of the genre its based upon & delivers something unforgettable.

A Hidden Masterpiece,"I don't often give a 10 to a movie yet feel this one deserves it as much as any I've given. But I didn't feel that way at first.There's purpose to why the story seems to jump around to different times and the meaning of the title ends up being different than what you might think when beginning to watch the film.This movie wants you to leave with something; to think slightly differently than you did before you watched it. Great sc-fi can do that but this is more than the story. For me it was how I can look at life differently if I shift my perception a bit.Maybe you'll see that right away but it took me a couple viewings to fully embrace it.

awful film,"this film is crap crap crap i was expecting a good sci fi film because of the actors ( whitaker, renner, etc..) but i got a garbage film insteadit's pointless, the plot is boring, there is no action and you don't know what they are trying to get to!!so boring this film",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
a short review for a very good movie you all should see,"1) I wonder what China will make of this movie.2) I hope that cinematographer Bradford Young (A Most Violent Year and Selma) takes it as a high compliment that I thought the whole time watching this ""damn, Roger Deakins, you're outdoing yourself here!"" (thinking this was his 3rd collaboration with Villeneuve)3) Amy Adams is incredible, some of her best work yet, even if so much of it is based around her giant blue eyes. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker also give strong supporting work (and hey, Michael Stuhlbarg too while we're at it, and even a particular Chinese actor gets a great scene), so a well-rounded cast surrounds her.4) I went in expecting Close Encounters and got a... reverse version Solaris I guess (and I mean Soberberh's Solaris). This is a welcome surprise and one I suspect a lot of viewers will embrace, though some may leave confused.This is very good stuff, bordering on great, and it warrants a rewatch, though the one mark I'd say against is that it's more effective intellectually than emotionally. The ending is wonderful, but it's so much slipping around in time that you lose the thread emotionally. But Arrival is ultimately made as a film as a rebuke to the countless ""sci-fi"" spectacles that are an excuse for showing off militarism and destruction. If anything this is a really strong movie to watch considering this election week: here's what happens when communication is actually engaged, and when governments engaging in aggressive action without trying to see the 'other', literally, and it's a sobering message right now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely different sci-fi movie but still very good in its own way,"I saw ARRIVAL out of curiosity because I like sci-fi movies from time to time and also because of its cast. This is one of those movies that divides audiences, in the sense that critics love it but the general public mostly doesn't understand it, as it's a sci-fi movie unlike STAR WARS or ALIEN.In this movie, some enormous space ships suddenly appear all over the world and people asks what they are doing there. Soon, Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) goes to Dr. Banks' (Amy Adams) office and asks her to join a team of researchers in the American west as she has impressive linguistic skills and will be helpful to try to communicate with the creatures inside the space ships (and they are HUGE). What follows is an incredibly cerebral movie a bit slow at times but still capable to capture the viewer's attention from time to time.The acting is probably the best asset in the movie. Amy Adams gives a very deep performance, and actually one of her best. Jeremy Renner is also very good effortlessly and Forest Whitaker is the standout of the supporting players The soundtrack is also very haunting and enhances a lot of the movie's actions. Denis Villeneuve's direction is great, not in the same level of PRISONERS but still great.In substance, a disivive movie that I liked but more in an appreciation sort of way and that at times left me a bit confused.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Stars Align, Enthralling and Memorable","Alien spacecraft suddenly appear and hover menacingly over twelve locations around the world. A team near a spaceship in Montana composed of the U.S. military, scientists, other experts and, of course, ever helpful politicians, attempts to determine what the aliens want. Linguistics expert Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is part of the Montana team. It soon becomes apparent that the aliens are an extremely advanced culture and that they have a message for humanity. Whether that message is hostile or friendly, or can even be understood, is a matter of debate among countries and individuals. One loose cannon could bring an end to humanity.Villeneuve is one of my favorite directors. His film Incendies, one of the best I have ever seen, is a hard hitting and masterful piece on the tension between hate and empathy, force and choice, control and liberty. In Arrival, Villeneuve applies his signature style to the genre of science fiction.Arrival challenges the notion that advances in technology are always better than the fundamentals. This enthralling and potent film combines star power with amazing graphics, a gripping story, wonderful themes, a memorable conclusion, intriguing sound, compelling dialogue and of course a great director. All the stars align. There are fantastic twists and turns and, as always with Villeneuve, our perceptions are altered. In watching Arrival it is helpful to have an open mind and to suspend beliefs.

Not as bad or good as reviews make out,"This is a very trivial film as you can probably tell by the reviews. It has the means of a great story with some slightly typical Hollywood implementation.Do I think this was a bad film? Most definitely not..
Do I think this was a masterpiece as some other reviewers have made out?No.I think the actors did a great job considering what they were given. I enjoyed the movie all the way right up until the very ending. I don't mind a slow burn and especially something a little bit different.But without spoiling the movie i will say, that if you are not prepared for a typical Hollywood ending. Then stay away and do not watch it.Until the end of the movie i would of rated a solid 8, but the manner in which the ending occurs is both extremely trivial and rather pretentious.But my god people... when will we ever stop with the 10/10 & 1/10 method of scoring? The worst movie in the world might get a 1/10, might..

Interesting take on aliens,"Arrival takes a great approach to the alien contact concept. It showcases the flaws of humanity and also the intricacies of linguistics. The cast, while small, works incredibly well together and creates some awesome chemistry. The soundtrack is a crazy orchestral soundtrack that creates a duper dramatic feeling for most scenes. The end of the movie deals with some really complex conceptual sci-fi kind of stuff but instead of treating it like an actual sci-fi it instead takes on this much more serious tone. I feel like the main character deteriorates by the end of the film in comparison to her start as well. Solid but generally not quite compelling enough to draw in the audience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the best sci-fi's you'll see,"Never have a seen such a methodical, realistic, contemplative approach to science fiction in recent cinema history. If you're expecting blockbuster action, or an epic space saga, then this might not be for you. But if you're looking for something mature, philosophical, and suspenseful, you'll love it. Villeneuve has a talent for creating wonderful stretches of tension with the well-written dialogue. The attention to realism, from the initial social and military response to their arrival, to the motives and histories of the characters, are all very well done. The pacing is wonderful, as is the exploration of time. The music is nicely chosen as well, and really adds to the meaning of the movie. I would definitely put Villeneuve among my favourite directors (along with Nolan and Cameron).

"At one point it's getting a bit boring, and that's not good","Okay if there is one genre of movies I'm always excited about it is sci-fi. And so when I saw the high ratings on IMDb for Arrival I thought it was going to be a masterpiece. But after watching the movie I can only conclude it didn't deliver my expectations. It all starts promising with strange things visiting our planet, and with interesting extraterrestrial octopus life forms trying to communicate with us. The end was also not bad, but the problem is everything between the beginning and the end. It's all way too slow and too long of the same story. Amy Adams trying to figure out the language, Amy Adams thinking, Amy Adams in deep thoughts, Amy Adams figuring everything out etc. After a while, watching Amy Adams in deep thoughts over and over again, it's getting boring. Too bad because the movie could have been much better if there would have been a bit more action. It's just a movie good to watch once, but it won't be remembered as a brilliant sci-fi movie. Well at least not by me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
TRUE and PHILOSOPHICAL Science-Fiction,"This is exactly what I want to see when paying for a cinema ticket!Denis Villeneuve is a true visual artist, with high creativity and deep understanding of the power good pictures/shots can have. He takes his time to take the viewer into the moment and let him feel the imagined atmosphere as good as possible. (I'm really looking forward to his interpretation of Dune!)I must point out the incredible and majestic one-take shot of the protagonists arriving to the place the ,Arrival' happend, in which Villeneuve presents us in an over 2min long, no talking one-shot, one of the (in my eyes) best ,First visual Contact' scenes ever made. Captivating sound and atmosphere! Brilliantly executed!This rather calm Sci-Fi movie is low paced with a lot subtile elements. The storyline itself is actually not complex on the surface, but has a highly complex and philosophical idea in its core! This makes it a multiple watch movie that demands way more from the audience than the average flick.It has good but no groundbreaking performances by the actors, but built in an all around great atmospheric environment, they are believable as well as their behavior.All together a MUST for experienced and demanding Sci-Fi watchers and a fantastic opportunity for everybody else to see a movie from the true genre of Science-Fiction!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Clever, emotional, and patience-testing.","Arrival makes me want to read the book on which it's based. The story is very good. It's the classic trope where extra-terrestrials land publicly and first contact is made. You brace yourself for a disaster since army men put themselves in charge as usual (a major reason why, in real life, aliens avoid Earth like the measles.) And where many writers failed to conclude their own take in a fulfilling manner, Arrival delivers the goods with a clever, emotional, yet simple narrative that explains all what we saw and still leaves a lot to our imagination.The film thus owes most to its story. It does complement it with great visuals, and decent acting. On the other hand, it does suffer from being unnecessarily slow. Your patience will be tested at times, and is required for you to enjoy your candy at the end. As I said, it makes me want to read the source material much more than it calls for a future rewatch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Incredible take on aliens,"Very different from any other alien film I have ever seen. In most alien films, the aliens are depicted as humanoid or speaking English which I never liked because of the lack of imagination needed to create a story like that. This film depicts aliens as wildly different to us and how we think, with their perception of time, their atmosphere, technology, their bodies and most importantly their language. I think this is a very fresh and clever take on alien life. This along with the score (which is incredible) makes the movie very impactful and a great watch.Another thing that this film does well, having a female protagonist but it doesn't feel forced. Sometimes 'girl power' scenes seem forced, for example avengers endgame. This film however, conveys a feminist message which is palletable.Overall, I enjoyed the film very much and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a thought provoking sci-fi.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Existential & Beautiful,"I came to Arrival expecting to see an entertaining blockbuster alien sci-fi thrillers, sort of like Skyline. But instead, my god, I got something light years better!

It was existential and beautiful... at the same time. Very few films can coalesce these two hallmarks so harmoniously and poetically - exploring the existential concept of time & language and then makes us see how it'd influence you on a profound emotional level.

Boring as hell...Seriously,"I can't believe the high ratings on this movie. It took me three sittings in order to get through it. This is one of the slowest moving movies I have ever seen in my life.So much time wasted on things such as, Amy Adams holding up a white board with ""See Ian Run"" written on it, while Ian is running in the background. It had already been established that they were using a white board to teach them words, was it really necessary to show us crap like that? There was also an insane amount of time wasted on the aliens various circle smoke language. We got to see circle after circle with minor changes, and oh my god it was slow.They could have had a decent movie if they shortened this to about 15 to 20 minutes. Heck, the first 20 to 25 minutes could have been cut down drastically. We really did not need to see Amy Adams in her classroom so many times, and the army (Forest Whitaker) showing up only to say they will not take her to the space ship, but end up taking her to the space ship anyways.Did I mentioned that this movie is SLOW.Anyways, someone needed to warn others about this movie.

Well made but serious suspension of disbelief,"Great cinematography and most of the dialogue was solid. There are some glaring plot issues that you don't need to look into too deeply to reveal = SPOILER ALERT = ..... It asks us to accept that these aliens are way more advanced than us (spacecraft tech; interstellar capabilities; non linear time sensing capacities etc) - and yet believe they would need basic language teaching. Even if you disregard the fact that they would already know the teachings (as they know the future! - so upon meeting they already will have had those lessons and know the teachings); they are so advanced they would have detected our crude communication via TV/Radio etc and would have learned all earth languages prior to the ""teacher"" meeting them. It of course then means she has no teaching role in the movie and kind of kills the plot. But it is an inconvenient truth all the same. Also the sacrifice of the blown up alien would be preventable (they would know the future and so have been able to stop the incident) - but it somehow served as a SECOND COMING sacrifice to humanity and so am sure that even though it was predictable and therefore almost certainly preventable (precog style) - it could well have been put in as a Jesus v2.0 sacrifice.Another slight plot issue is that the father of the child is not in the ""flashbacks"" (turned out to be premonitions) even though she would surely know who her future husband is (as well as future daughter). Of course, it had to be that way as showing who that is (will be) would give away the fact she sees the future (when we are led to believe we are seeing flashbacks)...I don't think it was as gripping and realistic as Contact. It was still well worth seeing as it felt very credible until it moved into the realm of supernatural.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Totally Unique and DEEP! A Masterpiece.,"This is one of the coolest movies I've ever seen, and I'm old enough to have seen most of them. I feel sorry for those who call it boring because, if you truly were bored, you either didn't understand it, you have a short attention span and can only focus long enough to see movement and shiny things, or you have no feelings. Either way, you are disadvantaged and the poorer for missing out on appreciating one of the most profound films ever produced. Why is it such a good film? First, there are no films that defy being categorized like this one. Sure, it's called a science fiction but, honestly, its way more than that. In terms of a genre, it's actually a combination of a science fiction with squid monsters, an intellectual study on communication and how it might affect your thoughts and actions, an exploration into the nature of time and its perception, a commentary on human behavior and the state of mankind such as man's tendency to jump to conclusions and make rash decisions, a mystery to be solved, a romance, a story of great grief and loss and, finally and most importantly, a bitter sweet statement on the value and beauty of life, all life, even life that doesn't last that, in the end, includes everyone's life. Secondly, Arrival does all of these things very well and weaves each element together seamlessly into something beautiful and thought provoking. It makes a statement like a philosopher. Like a great poem or piece of art, it forces one to think, to wonder, to feel, to understand love, to feel grief and loss, to ponder what is and what is important. I'm richer for having seen it and I give credit to those who achieved it. I can't believe they were able to do it and to do it so well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

More that Science Fiction!,"Most of the Sci-Fi Movies try to be gigantic, epic and ENTERTAINING

And when it comes to Philosophy, themes, Nuances, or messages, they have almost nothing
But Arrival had all of it! Obviously it also had some confusing scenes and plot twists, but the whole focus was on conveying a Message- that Communication is a very important tool if we don't have it, we might end up having a situation of War and Chaos

More Than We Expected,"Villeneuve continues to show us his talent as a filmmaker through his ability to build suspense, pull memorable performances out of actors, and wow visually with the camera. If one is able to do this with melancholy crime dramas in 'Prisoners' or 'Sicario', then it was a given he would be able to do the same with the science fiction genre. What's new with 'Arrival' is his ability to touch our hearts with a heartfelt twist of world peace, family love, and the ability to communicate with an alien race, perhaps the way Nolan touched our hearts in Interstellar. It brings back early Hollywood shades of 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'.

While much of the world is on the brink of an all-out assault on the aliens, Banks is determined to develop a rapport and open communications with the species. Starting with basic words and working up to complex sentences, Banks knows she has to learn the alien's language in order to better understand why they have come. When things take a turn for the worst, Banks and Donnelly have precious little time to stop countries from engaging in battle with risk of war. With so little time to unravel the mystery of why the aliens are here and what they want, Banks will find herself on a mind-blowing journey of her own.You've just got to see it. There is so much that i want to talk about but it would spoil so much of the film. I've mentioned before that there are great 'movies' that are mediocre 'films,' but this is a prime example of an excellent movie and brilliant film. The brilliance of this film is not in the stunning visuals, although that is certainly part of it; the brilliance lies within the cinematic and experiential storytelling. During the big reveal at the end of the film, your mind will be blown. You'll find yourself wanting to watch it again to more clearly understand the strategic placement of the pieces of the puzzle. During a time in which the country appears so incredibly fractured, this film will provide audiences with a renewed sense of wonder and appreciation for that which one may not fully understand. Making the tough calls and putting one's life at risk of what is right is also woven throughout this story. The theme of Arrival is not fully realized until the latter half of the film. More than a surface-level story about that which I cannot mention without giving it away, this film possesses a dynamic range of themes just beckoning for interpretation. As this film bares much similarity to avant-garde cinema in the reimagining of traditional storytelling, it will evoke a powerful emotional response.Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner deliver outstanding performances in the lead roles. Taking center stage for most of the film, Adams breaks new ground as an actor in this role that is nearly a complete departure from most of her other roles. Both Adams and Renner display excellent chemistry in their respective characters. Although Adams is the central character and responsible for the drive of the plot, Renner is strategically placed to reinforce the affects Adams' character has upon the plot. Forest Whitaker also plays a strong colonel and was an excellent choice for his role as well. The success of the cast can be attributed to both the outstanding direction from Villeneuve and the incredible screenplay by Eric Heisserer. Bradford Young's cinematography is so simple but yet so beautiful and profound. It is of no surprise that this film is being touted as one of the best of the year and has a nearly unprecedented 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Whether you are a linguist yourself or just enjoy an exhilarating cinematic journey, Arrival is definitely the film to catch this weekend. If you enjoy movies that prompt you to revisit how you perceive your life, time, or space, then you will not be disappointed. There are so many levels to this film. You'll likely find yourself wanting to see it again after fully realizing the innovative plot. Hopefully this film receives some Oscar noms in the upcoming award season.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A new alien concept is introduced.,The movie was filmed and plotted very creatively. A new concept of aliens and their technology was introduced in this movie. The writer did a great job throwing light on the fact that how difficult it will be to communicate if someone appears from nowhere and look more powerful than us. And how important it will be to understand their needs and their purpose to visit us. And why is it necessary not to proceed with guns and nuclear bombs.,6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A beautifully woven story.,"I'm new to seeing the film, but I can relate to everyone that mentions the emotional impact because it really does hit in a way that is hard to describe.The storytelling, visuals, sound, acting - it's just all so beautifully seen and told; it sucks you in from the beginning and guides you through the story so well that when it ends it almost feels like a chapter in your own life closed.This movie displays the power of communication, trust and acceptance (among many other things) and I hope it continues to impact others the same.Lastly, On the Nature of Daylight is the perfect song for this film. It evokes these powerful emotions when coupled with the movie. It's an excellent example of how music can create such an emotional atmosphere with no words. All around beautifully done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The movie's exploration of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which suggests that language shapes our perceptions of reality, is particularly fascinating and thought-provoking.""Arrival"" is a stunning masterpiece that seamlessly blends sci-fi elements with deep philosophical themes, making it a must-see movie for anyone interested in exploring the mysteries of the universe and the complexities of the human mind.

Breaking the Language Barrier with Heart and Precision,"Arrival is an engaging, thought-provoking film, even for someone who typically dislikes sci-fi. Denis Villeneuve crafts a meticulously detailed story with heart and precision. Amy Adams delivers a great performance, perfectly capturing the emotional weight of the narrative.Though the first half feels slow, it sets a strong foundation for the twists and revelations that follow, all of which are seamlessly integrated. The use of symbolism is fascinating, elevating the film beyond typical sci-fi fare. At its core, it's a poignant exploration of humanity's fear of the unknown, which might become known sooner than expected.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Fascinating Study on Human Response to the Unknown,"While I had heard a bit about Arrival, I actually ended up watching it because of an assignment I had in film school. I hadn't seen many ""alien"" movies and wasn't necessarily drawn to that genre beforehand. To be fair, my experience in that drama started with E. T. and ended with Race to Witch Mountain.Though the trailers for Arrival paint it out to be a tension-ridden, high-stakes extraterrestrial thriller, this couldn't be further from the truth. Advertising that this film comes from the same creators as Prisoners and Sicario in every trailer is a mistake to me. Those films are action, crime and mystery-driven dramas. Marketing Arrival as if it were a similar movie is a disservice to the film and the audience that would've most been drawn to and appreciative of the film that it is.Arrival is a much broader story about communication and linguistics, international cooperation, as well as exploring the long-running human question of, ""could the human race come into contact with aliens without either group of beings harming the other?"" Despite being centered around eight pods of extraterrestrial life landing on Earth, the events that unfold reveal much more about human nature and different cultures as the world responds.Those who are interested in sociology, philosophy and linguistics may be interested in seeing the film's take on communication. The supernatural and sci-fi crowd may also be invested in this sophisticated approach to the dichotomic effects that aliens imprint on Earth.I was blown away by the cinematography and CGI of this film from the opening frame. The color palette remains consistent throughout the film, which felt important as the majority of the scenes take place within just a few days of each other. The detail of the timeline becomes an important element to the story later on.This was the first project of Amy Adams' that I have seen and I was impressed by her portrayal of her character's intuitive nature that clashed so brilliantly with the instincts of the military operators she is on the landing site with. She brings a quiet strength necessary to the film. Without it, the most interesting aspects of the story would fall away and get lost in the sea of many other extraterrestrial movies.What her character is left with after the arrival of the aliens, is a thought-provoking moral dilemma about the human condition. Indirectly, the audience is asked that same question and will walk away from the film with a new question for themselves.I hadn't seen a film like this before, and I haven't seen one since. My best advice is to watch it straight away without looking up the trailers; it's much better with a clean slate.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Engaging and intelligent,"Arrival approaches a science fiction history in a clever way through a language interpretation that stands out in this gender.Louise is a language's specialist, required as part of the defense team for US to try to understand and deal with the arrival of 1 of the 12 OVNIs arriving on earth.From a slow start, the movie tractions towards a complex turning point that perplexes the audience, provoking reflection over time passage and the linearity of facts presented since the first moment of the movie.As a not sci-fi fan, this movie reminded me that there are exceptions worth it.I think some details, mainly on the final part, could have been better thought. Although, the non linearity component can be a barrier for some deeper explanation.Great movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Arrived just in time,"I was absolutely blown away by Arrival. It's one of those movies that feels like it's saying something really meaningful while still keeping you completely hooked the whole time. The way it handles the alien encounter is so original. It's not about big action scenes but more about connection and understanding. The whole concept of language and how it shapes reality is just mind-blowing.Amy Adams is amazing in it. She brings so much emotion, and you really feel her journey as the story goes on. The way the movie plays with time is so clever. It has one of those twists that makes you want to rewatch the whole thing right after.Everything about it is just so well done. The music, the way it's shot, even the design of the aliens all feel fresh and thoughtful. I love that it focuses more on hope and humanity than fear. Honestly, I wouldn't change a thing.

"""Arrival""-  A masterpiece of the Science Fiction genre.  One of the best films of 2016.","Every so often, you encounter one of those rare films that reminds you of the sheer magic and emotion that films are capable of crafting and creating. And 2016's magnificent Science Fiction drama ""Arrival"" is most certainly one of those rare treats. An emotional tale directed by Denis Villeneuve, ""Arrival"" is an absolutely stunning exploration of the unknown- whether it be what lays beyond our stars, or what lurks deep inside of our own heart.Linguist expert Louise Banks (Amy Adams) awakens one day to discover along with the rest of humanity that extraterrestrial crafts have begun to land all over the world, hovering ominously just off the ground, seemingly in waiting for something. Soon enough, she is whisked away to Montana with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), in the hopes that the two can help the military to start communication with the beings on-board. Through hard work and perseverance, eventually a dialog is established with the extraterrestrial ""heptapods."" However, Louise's own emotional conflict and the growing paranoia of the world at large- fueled by an increasing media circus- threatens to destroy all of the work done to create a peaceful communication between the two races.The film is at its core a very character-centered drama set to the backdrop of a classic sci-fi alien story. However, the extraterrestrial beings here don't threaten to destroy the planet... their presence makes humanity threaten to destroy itself out of fear. It's quite clever and consistently enthralling. Much of the film's runtime is devoted simply to seeing the alien beings trying to communicate their points to our human leads with their wildly different way of ""speaking."" But it's constantly intriguing and will grab your attention instantly, never letting go. It's fascinating. Most science fiction films would rather spend their time blowing up landmarks while broad archetypal characters spout one-liners and pretentious techno- babble. ""Arrival"" instead spends its time blowing our minds over and over with its very real drama and shockingly realistic portrayal of ""first contact.""The performances, and indeed the exceptional writing courtesy Eric Heisserer are what makes the film however. This is a movie all about character and emotion, and Amy Adams rises to the occasion with one of the greatest performances of her career. She injects such a pure, pained and sympathetic soul into Louise, and you'll be behind her completely throughout the entire film. She's one of the most compelling characters of the year, and I honestly hope Adams receives the recognition she deserves for her turn as their character. Renner is an exceptional supporting lead, and continues to stretch his acting chops, much as he has many times in the past few years. As much as I adore him in his more action-oriented roles, it's just so refreshing seeing him challenged in a more complex and realistic performance. I also highly admired Forest Whitaker as a senior military official who serves as our third and final lead, and he gives a good sense of both authority and sympathy in a role that could have otherwise come across as flat.Denis Villeneuve solidifies his position as perhaps one of the most important and invaluable filmmakers working today with his excellent and expert guidance of the story. In every way his work is a revelation, and when combining efforts with the stunning cinematography of Bradford Young, Villeneuve crafts one of the most beautiful films of the year in virtually every sense- aesthetically and emotionally. His sense of scope, scale, composition and flow is just wonderful, and each and every choice he makes is carefully calculated to serve story and character in the best of ways.In the end, ""Arrival"" emerges as not only a fantastic and stunning work on its own, but easily claims its position as one of the greatest films of 2016. It's an immense achievement in storytelling and drama, and its expert exploration of the science-fiction genre puts it on the same league as classics like ""2001"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" Yes, it is that good, and I can only hope that the minor degree of backlash from people who have found it ""boring"" or ""confusing"" does not dissuade others from going in with an open mind. Because this film is pure cinematic magic in any and every sense.""Arrival"" easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Left speechless,"I was completely left speechless! My wife and I love to go to the movies. My expectations for this film was more along the lines of ""Independence Day"". Boy was I in for a treat. Jeremy Renner and Amy Adams did a phenomenal job. You can feel the build up in each scene. If your familiar with any of the director Dennis Villeneuve's work Blade Runner 2049, Scicario and Prisoners to name a few. Then you know that pace and build up is a big part of his directing style, and right when you can take anymore the action happens and your left in awe. Arrival definitely didn't disappoint. I certainly don't want to dig into the movie and spoil it for anyone who never seen it.

Good...but also very slow and NOT the sort of film that pleases the masses.,"When you look at the reviews for ""Arrival"" on IMDB, you might notice that there is a huge disparity among them. Many hate it, many love it...more so than most films. The reason, I think, is because this sci-fi film is very cerebral....and not a bit like ""Star Wars"" and more traditional science fiction.In this story, 12 enormous space craft suddenly appear all over the world. Not surprisingly, folks are scared and people want answers. Soon, a representative from the military shows up and requests that Dr. Banks (Amy Adams) join with a team of researchers in the American west....as they want her with her impressive linguistic skills to try to communicate with the vessel and the creatures within...if there are any. What follows is a long, slow and mend-bending film...one that is interesting and appears very realistic...but also is cerebral.The acting, special effects and all were very nice. I have no complaints about that at all. As for the story, I generally enjoyed it but felt that the whole concept of time being cyclical a bit strange....not bad, just odd.

"Visually stunning with thought-provoking concepts, yet a little slow paced at times.","I love science-fiction so when I see a trailer and there are huge ships, alien beings, Amy Adams & Jeremy Renner I'm in.Now although I've just said there are ships and aliens coming to Earth this is in no way your alien Independence Day, Mars Attacks type scenario then you're going to be disappointed. Arrival stars Amy Adams as linguist Louise Banks who has been brought in by the government to help communicate with the extraterrestrials that have landed twelve ships around the globe; both she and Jeremy Renner's physicist, Ian Donelly must work out why they are here and what they want through their various visits inside a ship that has landed in Montana, USA. invasion movie; if you're walking in expecting someThe story director Denis Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer gives us is unique to say the least. Villeneuve's use of close-ups makes it such a personal and intimate story. His wide shots, including an impressive continuous shot, make the locations a gorgeous visual masterpiece to enjoy. All of these are scored amazingly by Jóhann Jóhannsson who's use of vocals in the music gives both an earthly feel but also surrealness to it. Villeneuve's decision when and where to use this music also proves well making impactful scenes and emotional moments.Of course the directing can't always work on its own but Amy Adams gives one of the best performances I've seen her give. I really can't expand further on that without giving spoilers but things like her reactions to the extraterrestrials and moments towards the end certainly tell me that this was a good casting choice. The other two leads are Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker both of which do a fine job; if you've seen their other work then you know what to expect here, they are both brilliant actors and play their roles just right but Amy Adams certainly steals the show in acting terms.Now for the plot of the film, I don't really know what to say. It's best to go into Arrival as unaware as you can with just the basic plot details such as the ones I gave earlier. I will however say that Arrival is one of those films that leaves you thinking about it for a couple of days. When the credits roll you just need a moment to ponder over it and piece together some of the revelations you've just had. When a film can do that I respect it. It's concepts of time, language, narrative and humanity is a lot to take in and certainly food for thought.I will most certainly watch the film again and upon second viewing I will see it differently than before with the knowledge I have. Is it the best film ever made? No, I've seen films that I have enjoyed a lot more and serve my personal tastes better. Arrival will definitely lose some viewers with it's slow burn quality; some may feel it drags and if you're not interested in the art of cinematography and film-making then it will feel even slower to you. And as someone who calls themselves a cinephile, even I was surprised at the gentle pace some of the scenes were going.In the end Arrival is stunningly beautiful with incredible acting and surreal sounds. It's commentary on stories is one I will remember and if I had to liken it to other films then I'd say some of the vibes I took from it were ones similar to that of Contact, Signs, and Inception.

Making some things different and more realistic would not contribute anything positive to the narrative and main themes.I'm happy a big studio had the courage to present the audience with something new - a risky move, but to move forward you need to take risks.

"One of, if not my favourite Sci-fi film","So glad it took the overdone alien first contact action flick and added a realistic setting. Highly grounded in sci-fi is what makes this one of my favourite films.Rewatched it for the first, after 3 years. Remember vividly a lot of stuffs, one the few movies I used to constantly think about 3 years ago. Script is a masterpiece, way to tell that story in that way, beautiful. The concept of time travel seen in a new light.The soundtrack is addicting, was listening to it out loud and my mother told me to stop it because it felt like 'someone was dying', I replied HannaH.The cinematography of that first scene of spaceship was gorgeous. Many social commentary about conspiracy theory, majority of them were correct as we can see from pandemic. I actually gained a lot of respect for linguistics, always thought of it as a useless study area but boy was I wrong.Rewatching it, caught many foreshadowing. The movie literally says everything at the beginning.Loved the themes, her taking the decision of have that child. Its not about the goodbyes but the memories we make before the goodbyes. She would rather find & lost than never get it. The parallelism with one the heptapods(alien) dying yet the other one not caring because their time isn't linear, they could go back in memory.Script was smart to have that Chinese official scene, many will say it was plot convenience but I have head canon of her later telling the Chinese official to tell her everything later on, hence he had a line 'I don't know how your brain/memory works'The movie did answer why aliens came but it wasn't concerned with that, it was more about humanity and their perspective & memories.

It is not about the destination; it is all about the journey,"Enemy (2013) and Prisoners (2013) merge and become Arrival (2016); a movie with continuous flashbacks and flashforwards - the main trouble with the pace and timing in this film.Denis Villeneuve, the 'Mystery-Drama-Man', is stimulating us to think that the journey (our life) is far worthier than the final destination (death). And this is something that can be understood thanks to Louise, because it is her who embraces life after suffering all losses in her past, and the events that will happen in her future. This is why she offers to the observers the thoughtful question of: ""if you could view your life as an image, a story told in one nonlinear and infinite symbol, would you change it?""But be careful, because the director makes us think that Louise is remembering her past when she could be actually seeing glimpses of her future! What is more, the movie is so slow that one could fall asleep four or five times during the movie! In here, everything happens every 15 minutes than the linear films we are accustomed to watch. This is why Arrival is not better than neither Prisoners nor Enemy. At least, in both movies from 2013 follow a linear path with a mysterious end, whereas in here the inexplicableness is not around the heptapods but Louise's visions.Despite this, it should be pointed out that there is no better choice for Louise Banks' role than Amy Adams. She is just brilliant. Every single move, word and look is just outstanding. And that is what the movie is about. The movie is all about Louise and the interactions in her mind, with her friends and between the 'aliens heptapods'.As a matter of fact, the problem is presented in front of us and it is something like ""imagine that there are 12 alien ships which have just arrived and positioned themselves around the globe - what would you do?"" Well, if the word was given to the Chinese General Shang, he would probably destroy humanity. But let us not forget that ""in war there are no winners, only widows"". Why do we have to fight? Let us learn the language of these aliens, teach them our language or let us do both things. Let us think about the consequences! Some of them could be changed. Others, like Louise's case, could be foreseen, and although Hannah's future will be dreadful, it might be worth to enjoy her a little bit.In a nutshell - the idea of the movie is excellent. It touches both reality and fantasy. The timing and pace were the only issue to convert this movie into Best Motion Picture of the Year at the awful Academy Awards given to the Moonlight-Disaster.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"""The best sci-fi of the decade?"" You're damned right!!!","Denis Villeneuve continues to show his skill and virtuosity with another film far removed from his last, and somehow tops that incredible movie with Arrival, which shares some similarities with his film Enemy, in that, you need to think.If you want to sit back with your popcorn, don't watch this. If you want to see a film examine many aspects of humanity, such as language, memory, trust This is a film that challenges the assumed norms of how we relate amongst ourselves, and more importantly, how those relations could be tested by an alien visitor, which most of humanity seems to see as a threat. And that is human nature, to be afraid of that of which we do not know.Arrival challenges this notion of being afraid of the unknown, and while doing so it delivers an incredibly thought-provoking story that I need at least two more viewings to piece together.The monolithic alien crafts are an important character of their own - their size dominates many incredible outside takes and represent just how big the humans' task is - that is, to translate what these aliens are trying to say.To go further into the story would be just mean, so go into this as blind as you can, with an open mind, and prepare for an experience.This makes other recent films of the genre (with the exception of Ex Machina) seem downright pathetic and dumb. This is what sci-fi should be like - apart from the ending (arguably), this film does NOT show its hand to the viewer. This is easily one of the best movies to involve aliens too - the contact between humanity and their visitors is infinitely interesting. Credit must go Jóhann Jóhannsson and the sound-editing crew for creating the such a tense atmosphere when needed.The way the aliens talk needs to be heard through cinema speakers, as it almost sends chills up your spine. Soon though we become accustomed to it, much like the scientists down on Earth who are trying to decode what these beings want, using all the mathematic, scientific and linguistic skills in the world. The soundtrack is also a fantastic feature - it is never over-bearing, but is incredibly strong when it needs to be, and it all sounds suitably alien.The film needs to be seen on a big screen. Not only does the alien craft look amazing, but it is also a part of some incredible camera-work. There aren't enough scenes outdoors to take advantage of this on a large scale, but boy, when we do see the ship, it is a sight to behold. Not only the craft, but the amazing looking clouds surrounding it, indicating just how huge the ship is.Amy Adams leads the way as a very convincing protagonist, the linguist who is lured in to somehow decode the messages. Her working partner is a scientist, a surprisingly okay Jeremy Renner. The contrast between these professions isn't explored as much as it could have been, but hey, given the massive themes this film is juggling with only two arms, I think I can let that one slide.""The best sci-fi of the decade?""

A great film needs more than a Clever story,"This film has a clever idea to start with and explains why an established actress like Amy Adams would take the lead .Unfortunately too many obvious faults drag the film down .
The idea that the worlds military would attempt to destroy an alien craft that had shown no aggressive intent and whose weapons capability they had no comprehension of is just plain stupid .The superpowers haven't attacked each other because they know the devastation that would entail and yet they are making threats to aliens who have far greater capability than we have -they have space ships that can fly to other galaxies and yet we are making threats against them .Painting the military as stupid is an old Hollywood cliche and should have no part in this film As to the main characters they are just boring .Adams is a fine actress but in this film there was no real acting to do -looking sad and removing your make up is all she had to do -to be honest any actress could have played this role with their eyes closed..
The film needed more interaction with Adams and the White House through an intermediary,with her concerns and what she was trying to achieve and the Presidents justified worry about what should be the most prudent course of action.The joke is we never see a President ,just some gung ho lacky making stupid decisions that are frankly unbelievable.
The film paints itself as a work of art and it is far from that .Really annoying was the overdramatised music drowning out what was being said -very amateurish

Never saw something like this before,"Without comparing with all the masterpiece-Sci-Fi movies, I think Arrival has some ""out of the box"" way of imagine that great arrival that everybody has ever dreamed when we were kids (you can't say no).The plot turns to catch you since the beginning, performances are awesome (specially for Jeremy Renner, who I used to think about him as a bad actor, he does it really well here), visuals are acceptable and also the soundtrack.But, what I really find great in this movie, is that turns to implement a kind of mindset on human's destiny and landing the idea of ET life out there really susceptible.I consider this movie a masterpiece of modern Sci-Fi (just one step below from Interstellar)PS.

Don't Wait. Watch it Now,"Villenueve quickly became one of my favorite filmmakers when I saw Sicario for the first time. The shots are well crafted to help viewers understand the setting and feel as if they are there. Villenueve hits the mark again with Arrival. A beautifully crafted of a short story that I've never read. While unlike other alien movies, I think Arrival captures what it would be like if Aliens really did come to earth. There would be those who only sought to understand them and those who wished to war with them. Villenueve, Adams and Renner do an excellent job at capturing the human experience when we are propelled into the unknown. This film seeks to encourage all of mankind to work together on our common issues, rather than turn off our communications and threaten another. I don't know why I did not see this when it came out, but I wish I had.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Amy Adams is great but 90% + no dialog just close ups of her seems much,"I totally get that the Director is using symbolism with all the range of worry and fear and troubled countenances they could squeeze out of Amy to represent the unknown and unknowable and the actual symbols of the aliens and miscommunication yadda yadda.Amy is great but that's a bit much. If one were to look closely an occasional 3 to 5 second cut away with actual dialog with Mr. Whitaker or Mr. Renny or both does occur but extremely rarely. Of Course, Amy is also part of that cutaway scene in either a 2 shot or over the shoulder shot (where you see the back of her head)Not trying to be snarky but about half way through it actually started become comical to me. My GF couldn't understand why I was quietly chuckling so much. She seemed to be into it and didn't want to spoil it. Later I told her I liked it because she was so ga ga about it. Why spoil?So I started counting in my head the time is seconds of any scene at all....that did not have Amy in it.Most often it was 3 to 5 seconds a piece.... A couple made it to 10 and one towards the end was nearly 20 seconds long with no Amy.Again, Amy Adams is excellent and I love her work but a 2 hours of a story that could have been told in a cut for TV movie in an hour time slot and with plenty of time for commercials?Or might be fun to go the other way and edit down to only Close ups of Amy making faces and no dialogue and also get an hour.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

So Good it is Jaw-Dropping,"Wow. I had high expectations and this surpassed them in everyway imaginable. When people say this movie is good, believe them. One of the best movies I have seen in recent times. Like holy crap.Starting off with the story, like I always do. Words can't describe the masterpiece that this story is. When you start the movie, it is not going to finish how you expect. The introduction to the arrival of the alien ships is amazing and haunting. Same goes when we actually finally see the aliens. The way the aliens are designed is top notch. This movie isn't a horror movie, not even close, but if you told me the aliens were form a horror movie, I'd believe you. The way the story progresses is slow, but never boring. I found myself interested and focused in every scene. Arrival always has a sense of intrigue and mystery right until the end, and that is one of its strongest aspects. My brain was jumbled up because of the amount of possibilities it thought of for how this movie was going to go. I had so many questions of ""Are the aliens friendly?"" ""What is the reason for the aliens?"" ""How is this going to end?"" And it takes a special kind of movie to be able to form those questions and keep me thinking throughout the entire runtime. It gives you the answers, but damn you have to be a genius to be able to figure out where this is going to go before it ends. Aside from the amazing story, the other best part of Arrival is the cinematography.The talent Denis Villeneuve has is absurd. He was able to create such a haunting and beautiful movie with jaw dropping scenes and goosebumps inducing scenes. The entire design of the spaceship is spectacular. The pitch black walls that, from afar, look like they have zero texture, but up close look rough and detailed, the weird oval-ish shape of the spaceship is incredibly unique, and such a spectacle. I can't even imagine how amazing this looked in theaters. Another thing I can't imagine experiencing in theaters is the soundtrack.The soundtrack is something else. It ranges from terrifying to mesmerizing. The movie was amazing enough, but you throw in this god-tier soundtrack and you have created something truly special. Like I said with the design of the aliens, this soundtrack could work perfectly in a horror movie. It is genuinely spine chilling. The acting is also amazing. The fact that Amy Adams didn't get an Oscar let alone get nominated makes me remember not to trust the Oscars in anything entertainment related. The pacing is also really good. Arrival is a slow burn, don't get me wrong, but it never gets boring because something interesting is always happening. The ending is also amazing (just like everything else). I love how it feels like the entire movie was a 10,000 piece puzzle, and the ending scenes were the final pieces required to finish it. Everything just makes sense at the end.All in all, Arrival is one of the best movies I've seen. This has a very high chance of showing up in my top 4 favorite movies of all time. A movie with such high scores has a decent chance of being disappointing. That's just how movies go, but this was not disappointing. Not at all. Arrival lives up to every bit of hype, compliment, and praise it has gotten. Watch it once you get the chance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Wonder-full. Not so much a review, as a viewer's guide to some of the issues raised.","Arrival is one of the finest movies of the year, firmly rooted in real people, real lives, and real science. The movie tells the story of first contact with an alien civilisation after spaceships land at twelve points across the globe.The movie is based on 'A story of your life' a short novella by Ted Chaing. The story won the 2000 Nebula Award for Best Novella and the 1999 Sturgeon award.Arrival expands on the novella in significant ways, including some stunning visualisations of semograms (alien language artifacts that are the central mystery of the plot), and visceral scenes aboard an alien space craft.Definitions vary (hah!), but for me this is a rare, true science fiction film, dealing in reality and wonder rather than commercial mythologies or transplanted epic. The science is real, and is not broken for purposes of plot or visual kinetics.Action scenes are few, and those expecting Star Trek may be disappointed or even bored. That said, its a beautiful, beautiful trip.The movie knows its lineage: there are knowing visual nods to both 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Contact. More, probably – I'll tell you after my second viewing.The Science of ArrivalCentral to the plot of Arrival are a number of perennial issues in linguistics, anthropology, and physics. Without giving away specific spoilers, a simplified short listing may deepen your appreciation of the film, and allow you to dazzle your friends in the post-film caffeine debrief. After dipping back into the novella, here goesNo spoilers, but mention of central movie themesThe Sapir-Whorf HypothesisThe Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is about how humans come to understand the external world. It states that language determines how we perceive reality, that we construct reality through the language we learn.Linguistics has two competing ideas about about what language is. One is that it's a cultural artifact, the outcome of an evolutionary process, ordered but arbitrary. The other is that it's a cognitive mental response – a rule-based outcome of the human brain's encounter with external reality, bound by the structures of the brain itself. The first is particular, the other universal. There are lots of flavours, and lots of variant positions. (Was that Noam Chomsky the medivac team were carrying out on a stretcher?)Do we think in words? Can we think without words, without metaphors to structure and taxonomies to enclose? Is human language intrinsically linked to the peculiarities of the evolved human mind, or is something more general?Just how distorted or arbitrary *is* our mind's version of reality? Are there thoughts that can't be thunk, sentences that can't be sentenced? There is no way we can know.Culture and the Limits of CommunicationIn anthropology, Sapir-Whorf broadens out to examine the multiple expressions of human (and alien?) meaning – cultures – and their various (in)compatibilities. It questions the limits of communication and understanding between cultures. (After the events of the US Presidential election, I'd venture to say even within cultures). Everything is context, everything has a deeper meaning, a history, and a trajectory of change. Translation is always partial.What are the rules separating the word for a 'gift' from 'trade'? Or 'tool' from 'sacred object' or 'symbol of contract', or 'weapon'? Every object is held within a web of created meaning, shared meaning, dynamic meaning.And yes, as the movie notes in passing, one of the Sanskrit words for war, 'gavisti', does indeed mean 'a desire for more cows'.The Nature of TimeThere are (at least!) two distinct views within science and philosophy on the nature of time. In Newtonian physics, time is sequential. A > B > C >D. Humans experience the world in temporal order, and perceive cause and effect.However, General and Special Relativity model time as a fourth dimension of a single interwoven continuum called spacetime.Fundamental laws of physics are time-symmetric: there is no fundamental difference between past and future. Time has no inherent direction: the equations work both ways.Eternalism is the view that everything in time exists at once, and can be experienced simultaneously.PhysicsMathematics is a mental tool: Physical laws can be described in a multitude of different ways, some more intuitive than others.The most common formulations of physics are causal, Newtonian. Others can be purposeful, even teleological, looking to outcomes.For example, light bends in water, and the path traveled is always the one that takes least time. Fermat's Principle describes the path of light through water by calculating minimal and maximal paths. We can say that the difference in the index of refraction causes light to bend when it hits water. Or, using Fermat, we can say that the light *decides* to minimise the time to travel to its destination, and has knowledge of effect before cause can be initiated. Two systems. One outcome.Free Will and ParadoxIf free will exists, we cannot know the future. Can we? Volition is an intrinsic part of consciousness. Isn't it?Language of course, is not only a vehicle of communication and thinking. It's also a mode of action. It is performative, ritual.Why would you go to see a play if you already know the script? Why would you listen to a song if you know every note?Heh, I love this movie. See it. Have fun!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Scores high marks for good intentions.,"Amy Adams acts her heart out in the role of Louise Banks, a renowned linguist who's recruited by the military when 12 mysterious spacecraft touch down (well, so to speak) in odd spots around the globe. The military hopes to get her to break through to the aliens and determine the nature of this otherworldly visit. Meanwhile, Louise is understandably sombre after having suffered a devastating personal tragedy. Much of the plot hinges on this incredible gift that Louise has, which she will attempt to utilize to avoid disaster.It's better not to reveal any more about story; some of these details and twists may actually come as unexpected.At first glance, this seems to be a somewhat different approach to alien ""invasion"" cinema. It's more intelligent than some entries into the genre, and more subtle, attempting to put a more ""realistic"" spin on what might happen were the people of Earth to be actually visited by an extraterrestrial intelligence. It's not for people who want action and spectacle. After a while, you do realize that this also a true human-interest drama, perhaps too drawn-out and manipulative to some viewers, but will definitely hit home for any parent who's ever lost a child, and/or had to watch them suffer.The film co-stars Jeremy Renner, as the scientist with whom Louise will work, Forest Whitaker, as a no-nonsense colonel supervising their efforts, Michael Stuhlbarg, as a CIA agent, and Tzi Ma, as a Chinese general who stirs the pot a bit. But make no mistake: this is almost entirely Amys' show, and her character is worthy of much sympathy and compassion, even if she seems to act senselessly at times.While ""Arrival"" is to be commended for concentrating more on human emotions than visual effects, it must be said that the design of the ""Heptapods"" (affectionately dubbed ""Abbott"" and ""Costello"" by Renner) is pretty effective. The other visuals on the alien ship are similarly striking.Overall, an affecting statement on the beauty of life and the way that the human race perceives things.Scripted by Eric Heisserer, based on the story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

An Amazing Story Accompanied by Great Performances and Beautiful Shots,"Arrival follows Louise Banks, a linguist who is hired to try to communicate with the aliens who have recently landed on Earth.This is a very interesting concept to me. Most science fiction involves a bunch of gunmen getting together and blowing the aliens back into space, or just hostile aliens killing humans. This is the exact opposite of that. Is the concept entirely original? I don't think so, but I haven't seen a movie like this before regardless.The performances are quite fantastic. I've made a point of seeing more Amy Adams movies as of late, and I haven't been hugely impressed by her somewhat exaggerated way of acting. In Arrival she humanizes her performance a lot more. By that I mean she's a lot more subtle and realistically portrays this character, and she is absolutely amazing. This is the best performance I've seen from her. Jeremy Renner is also great, pulling off one of my favorite performances by him. Forest Whitaker, for what his role is, does a good job too. In fact, I don't recall a single weak performance. Not that every single one was amazing, but none of them were below average, and those that were important to the story far exceeded that.The characters themselves are fleshed-out and largely well developed. Do we get to see every character's life and struggles and all that in detail? No. But Louise Banks is the most intriguing character, and she receives a hefty amount of attention. There's no reason for the other characters to receive as much attention as her because the movie's focus never averts it's attention to another character. The movie is entirely from her perspective, even when something more interesting is happening elsewhere, which allows the audience to be just that much more immersed into this story and, more specifically, this character.The writing is amazing. I was a little worried to see that the writer of this film was so inexperienced, but it seems like Villeneuve and his well-picked cast knew exactly how to take this potentially bad script and make it look good. However, this script isn't bad by any means. The way the story unfolds is fascinating to watch, and as much as I wish I could watch every little detail of the human-alien interaction, I knew that it would get tedious, nor does the movie have nearly enough time to go that long. I think the movie showed just enough to keep the audience invested and learning along with the characters more or less. And the third act was mind- blowing. I've heard plenty of people say that the third act flips everything on it's head, but I didn't believe them. Trust me though, it will.Right from the opening shot, this camera man proves he knows what he's doing. This is a beautifully shot movie. Not only is the scenery glorious, but the way the camera is positioned and where it's focus lands is all gorgeous. Every shot was a treat.Upon seeing the first trailer, I was somewhat disappointed by the look of the aliens. I later learned that I wasn't. At all. I love the design of these aliens. I'm not going to say any more, but they look great.One of my favorite things about this movie is the amount of detail put into the aliens. They are an entirely different species, and the movie goes all-out with that fact. Everything you wouldn't even consider that could be different between a human and an alien is taken into account and changed for the betterment of the film.Another little thing I liked was the reveal of the alien ships. Yes, they are revealed on the cover of the movie, but the movie still tries to hide them. But it doesn't go all out with hiding them completely, but rather use strategic camera angles to obscure the entirely of the ship. So it doesn't come off as the movie trying it's hardest to hide the ship, but rather making it natural.I almost had one tiny complaint with this movie, and that was the very end of it. Without any spoilers, I'll say that it didn't fit with the rest of the movie and came off as somewhat generic. And yet as I left the theater I realized that the scene made complete sense within the story. While I thought the movie had lost steam, in reality it kept chugging along at an amazing pace.There were a few points along the way, more towards the end, that I didn't understand right away, but upon further thought realized what was going on and liked the movie even more for how clever it was. It's a thinking movie that isn't horribly complicated. It strikes that perfect balance, and I loved it.Overall Arrival is spectacular. The acting, the story, the writing, the camera-work, the detail, the characters, the naturalism, the twist ending, everything is fantastic. Denis Villeneuve once again proves why he's my favorite director. This is quite likely my favorite movie of 2016, and hopefully an Oscar contender in the future. In the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this masterpiece of a film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A more cerebral ""Independence Day"".","While Independence Day continues to be a guilty pleasure for many people (and I thought its sequel was decent too), Arrival is a much smarter and braver rendition of the alien arrival themed film. Predictably misunderstandings and tension erupt between the new arrivals and their earthling hosts.The solution is of course communication and co-operation both between earthlings and the new arrivals, as well as between the different nations on Earth. Its also predictable that the main character finds insight through her own personal life. Yes it's all somewhat formulaic, however the execution of this simplicity is really quite grand and standout performances by Adams and Whittaker elevate what could have been a generic science fiction drama into a wonderfully told tale.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The interpretation of life,"""The arrival"" reminds me of several other films, such as signs, interstellar and even melancholy, because like all these examples he tries to bring something new, and succeeds. We have here a film that goes beyond the classic cliché of alien invasion, we have a philosophical film, it really is not easy to be digested, but it takes, ""The arrival"" talks about time, life, future expectations, peace and unity , All with a seemingly simple plot. ""An alien ship lands on the ground and a linguist is called to try to communicate with her,"" yeah, that synopsis can fool you, and a lot. The linguist in question is Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), in trying to communicate with these extraterrestrials she ends up learning to see the world in another way ... Technically the film is also incredible, with many scenes of filming in off , Spike Jonze style, he plays the melodramatic way flawlessly and with a beautiful photograph, mixes and beautiful soundtrack, the film places Denis Villeneuve as one of the biggest names in the new generation of cinema that is emerging, and is not For less, Denis is spectacular, we must also talk about the acting, Amy Adams is incredible, perfectly interpreting all the news and dramas that passes his Louise. Finally, ""The arrival"" is a good news, it is a film that goes beyond its two hours, is a film that goes beyond that cheap science fiction, it has a message, even if we could change the bad things that happened in our Lives, it would not be worth it, because it is these things that build the human being, Congratulations Denis Villeneuve.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Mostly Adams one-woman-show,"It's the end of the world as we know it! A much discussed and sometimes feared story has come true which, honestly, always sounded a bit ridiculous to actually happen in the real world.I am, of course, talking about this new sci-fi drama Arrival"" where mankind is greeted by huge alien spaceships in the sky who seem to be coming in peace wait, did you think I was referring to Trump becoming the next leader of the free world?But yeah, these two events have a very similar plot summary so it's only fitting that I had the chance to experience them in the very same morning.Directed by Denis Villeneuve – the man behind Prisoners"", mindbending Enemy"" with Jake Gyllenhaal, Sicario"" and currently filming Blade Runner"" sequel –, one could expect Arrival"" to be a thinking person's sci-fi. And one is not wrong.It is a 116 minute slow-burner all heavy on atmosphere and light on explosions or any quick thrills.If you wish a quick reference to any recent well-known movies, the result is a bit like Christopher Nolan's Interstellar"" crossed with Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life"".Robert Zemeckis's Contact"" (1997) would not be very far either, because Arrival"" also focuses on fragile yet brave female protagonist whose quality acting is one of the main pillars carrying the whole experience. The other one would be overall atmosphere, deliciously dark and ominous. Some will like it, others will probably find it depressing and maybe a bit slow for their taste.I haven't read the award-winning short story by Ted Chiang that Arrival"" is based on. Wikipedia says that the major themes explored are determinism, language and Sapir-Whorf hypothesis which sounds mighty dry and mostly sci-fi geek friendly.So it's nice to witness movie makers adding some mainstream appeal which comes mostly in the form of Amy Adams's great performance.She truly holds the movie together as a woman going where no-one has ever gone before. You will believe her hesitations, the tears, and also the silent determination when the going gets tough.This kind of role is tricky because of the need to play it out mostly alone, often in close-up where every detail and tone has to be clearly seen and felt. Think Matthew McConaughey's mighty turn in Interstellar"" but decidedly less showoffish.So it's mostly Adams's one-woman-show, and a quite rare chance to see her doing something memorable and worthwhile on screen. She accepts too many decorative pretty girl roles, even in more ambitious projects.The all-male supporting cast is good too, especially star players such as Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker.As stated above, I don't know the original story but ""Arrival's"" message is rather spiritual and not ""dry"" at all. Essentially it is a reminder that mankind's future depends heavily on our ability to understand and connect to the world, rather than attacking and overpowering everything we find foreign or downright alien.It's a call to rise above the inflexible ego-based mind the western society so dearly values, and to find balance with our intuitive side.Overall, Arrival"" is a good movie although I wasn't especially happy with the final act which seemed rushed. It felt like somebody grew impatient near the end and wanted to add something impressive"" just in case the people were not happy with this slow-moving tale.I do not want to talk about it here in detail but, for me, it lessened some of the movie's overall impact. Mostly because there was not enough time to play it out as properly as the stuff that had come before.But yeah, if you are into more intelligent sci-fi and don't prioritize explosions, Arrival"" is good to go.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Arrival,"Amazing movie about language, communication and time. I will surely watch this again to fully understand things and also because it's fascinating. Still confused but okay.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Pretty, shallow and kind of ridiculous","Alien encounters are so interesting, and it's great to see a film where we don't just fight the aliens.But the film also deals with both personal and political drama, which I didn't care for.I cared for the aliens' intentions and language, which was explored too superficially. Those were the real mysteries to me, and should perhaps have remained so in my opinion. But after a thorough exploration of communication and its pitfalls.Instead the aliens seem more like a plot device that provides the protagonist with Knowledge.And the Knowledge is very dubious as well. It stretches the idea of linguistic relativity way too far. It's too unbelievable and kind of ridiculous as well when you think about it.It doesn't make it better that I feel I've seen the plot twist before (and recently). The alien language has the same effect as the black hole has on Mattew Mcconaughey's character in Interstellar. Is this the best you writers can come up with nowadays?The film is pretty, though. I like the tempo. But it's a missed opportunity.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the best Sci-fi films in mainstream cinema,"As an alien first contact film, Arrival isn't just an ambitious answer to an age old question ""are we alone?"" its high concept thinking in presenting an answer to that question is a rarity in mainstream cinema these days. And unlike the typical bamboozle of a sci-fi blockbuster, this film isn't a thrill ride meant for 4DX cinema either. Rather, a crushing yet astute mediation on some of the biggest and perhaps oldest problems with the human race – our perception of what makes us human, our success and failure at communication and our discomposure associated with the unknown.Known for his baroque styled narration, director Denis Villeneuve is in no hurry to reveal the mystery behind seemingly random alien landings in twelve countries. The visualization of these megalith spaceships is a cinematic achievement in itself, aided with a haunting sound design engineered to raise goose bumps, but more on this later. Meanwhile, and ever the trigger-happy race, governments of these countries have already mobilised a pre-emptive strike. As expected, the United States military is also gung-ho but not before sending linguistic expert Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) into the ship to find out what they want. Working with the military (represented by Forrest Whitaker) and a theoretical physicist played by Jeremy Renner, Louise first learns their language and then discovers that it's not about what they want but why they are have come.With preceding films like Interstellar and Contact, the story here isn't really new, or even about the existence of intelligent life outside our planet. By the time Louise arrives at the astounding revelation, it dawns on the viewer that Arrival has more to do with the mysteries of our own existence, our innate ability to experience joy and sorrow, and even the incredible ability to change our own fate. Adams owns this film as much as the lines on the back of her hand. Hers is a tragic character played with conviction throughout the film, and then towards the end, hits it out of the park with a climactic moment that defines the human value of compromise.Although conceptually incredible with real life takeaways, Arrival is not perfect. For a worldwide event, the narrative is almost entirely about Louise, her deciphering of the alien language and how that information relates to the future of mankind. Supporting roles from Renner is also saved for a few scenes and also for what appears to be a paradox in the story, while Whitaker's military man is just there to throw the audience into thinking this film could end up like another misguided Prometheus. There is also a bit of slack in the pace during the middle segment that builds on the aforementioned paradox. However, this is also where we learn more about her personal loss and the impact of grief in our existence.Having said that, Arrival still has the craftsmanship of a great film that demands our full attention in return for a rewarding experience. Technical aspects are also critical to the overall production design with sound and visuals forming a skeletal binding with the story. Is it Villeneuve's magnum opus? That depends on what he does next. Until then, this is probably the best science fiction film of the decade and one of the best films of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Arrival is Villeneuve's Magnum Opus,"Arrival is a rare gem from Denis Velleneuve, who has proved many times that he is the next big thing. If you look at his track record, you won't find anything bad. He is an amazing director who has the ability to create tension and make you uncomfortable. If you do not believe me, go and watch Incendies, Prisoners or Sicario. With Arrival, he tried his hands on a new genre and did he deliver? He absolutely did.Arrival is a Science Fiction featuring Aliens (duh). But while most of the Alien invasion films focus more on the Aliens and visual spectacles, Arrival is the exact opposite. It focuses more on the humans instead of the Aliens. It is the story of Louise (Amy Adams) who is a linguist and is grief stricken by the death of her daughter. One day, 12 Alien Pods appear out of nowhere at 12 different locations on earth. They do not wreak havoc like they do in most of the Hollywood films. We are tired of seeing that countless times, thanks to Independence day. They just appear and that's all. Now the big question is why are they here? Well, that is the plot of the film, even the poster has it written at the center, in all caps. The whole movie is about finding the answer to this question. I would not spoil it for you but let me tell you one thing; If you love challenging films, this film is a treat for you. If you do not and hate slow movies then skip it, please. This movie explores many interesting ideas and is quite thought provoking. It also deals with many themes, especially of free will vs fate. The way the Aliens communicate in this film is very interesting too. Their language is made up of weird circles that they form using their tentacles. It results in some very interesting ideas about time. OK, I am revealing too much so I'll just stop here.The cinematography is gorgeous. The first shot that shows the Pod for the first time in its full view is breathtaking; most of the shots are. Bradford Young has done a brilliant job in creating tension with the help of visuals. But it could not have been possible without the amazing music by Johann Johannsson. Man, that background score scared me more than the visuals. It was kind of ..different?Now, lets talk about Amy Adams who delivers a powerhouse of a performance here. No one gets five Oscar nods for nothing. She is one of my favorite actresses and her work in this film is tremendous. She played her role of a grief stricken mother perfectly, no complains at all. It's only because of her performance that this film becomes much more than a Sci-Fi. It has an emotional impact on you. Jeremmy Renner did not have much to do but he was good at whatever he did.So, I can say that Arrival is one of the best Science Fiction films of the decade, if not the best. I loved is mostly because it was different. It is a Science Fiction with a soul. I have watched a film after four or five months and I am happy that I watched this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Spoiler and I'm just upset!,"Omg, I am so upset by this movie, thank you Amy Adams and Jeremty and Forest, why did you even be in this when you meant nothing to the the script!? I after sitting through a very long and boring movie with so so effects, looked a bit like monsters or war of the worlds minus big effects which had me interested and the back story of her daughter made me think it would have at least some meaningful ending. OK, so the daughter was in the future but what was the point if she was going to tell you how to save the world and still her dad would leave and she would die? I guess that's what was supposed to make it so great? Why? If your daughters only purpose in life was to tell you what to say something to the China man so the aliens don't kill us, what exactly do you get? Jeremy leaves you because you know yalls daughter is gonna get sick and die so what the hell? Was Amy Adams a happy martyr, was the daughter, did dadddy know and I would imagine he did so why would he leave Amy? Lastly, if the daughter had to die to fill Amy in on the future to save the world, ugh, I don't think the daughter really had anything to do with it, sorry, still trying to figure out why the point of the daughter, who was going to die regardless. Basically, if somehow the whole future thing had some sort of a happy ending then the movie would have been great, like show that they had to end up like that for her to save the world or show that daddy and daughter ended up in the ship that turned out to be heaven, or something. Maybe I missed something, please if all you people that gave this flick a 10 tell me why! Daddy and daughter on the beautiful beach from Contact?",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Great story and Idea, Bad directing/editing","It is really difficult giving 7 to a great Idea. The bad: But as it is the movie has flat characters (except the main one), The visuals are quite lame for a 21st century sci-fi, the sound of speech and diction isn't good at times making you struggle to understand without reading subs. Also, The dialogues are quite lame, and rather forced, especially the captain's. it is as if the director / script forced conflicts when they were not natural. The good: Never the less what I thought during the movie as a wrong casting choice proved a very right choice at the end. the movie tricked me very well and props for that. The Idea and story are great and once the movie is over you think and try to understand all you have seen. and then everything fits.

A Different Kind of Science Fiction,"I thought about 'Contact' before I saw this film. This is what a first encounter could really look like, attempting to communicate with beings so far advanced that simply understanding a single word would be a challenging task. Contact felt like it was made by a committee that needed to get all of Earth's issues discussed, at least amongst the humans. Religion, politics, nationalism, etc. because somehow the aliens are supposed to care. I like this film's approach because it shows that while the aliens recognize that this is a divided planet, our borders and petty human issues really don't matter in the scheme of the Universe. Beautifully acted, well-written and poignant on many levels. This is a thinking person's film which I believe Arthur C. Clarke would consider well done. Imagine a future in which . . . .

Arrival....Classic SCI Fi unbeatable,"This movie adapted from Ted Chiang the writer ""Story of Your Life."" original title
Directed by Denis Villaneuve par excellence.I re-watch every few years, and am always taken aback by the freshness I felt on the first view, plus adding in the Nature of Daylight score , which has been borrowed afterwards by so many other movies. The Soundtrack can get quite loud during the team excursions to the Craft, but the scripting and actor performance, and direction are flawless, they obviously wanted the audience to be emotionally committed to the movie, and they succeeded in just that. This is printed elsewhere on imdb, but needs reinforcing. Ted Chiang wrote:-
""I think it's that rarest of the rare in that it's both a good movie and a good adaptation... And when you consider the track record of adaptations of written science fiction, that's almost literally a miracle.""

Arrival is a nice departure,"""Arrival"" is a departure from mindless sci-fi summer action films. Inspired by science fiction writer Ted Chiang's short story ""Story of Your Life,"" this film is an intelligent take on how the Earth would handle first contact if 12 alien vessels appeared around the world.This is the first film I have seen from director Denis Villeneuve (""Incendies""; ""Prisoners""; ""Sicario""), and what I can say after watching ""Arrival"" is that he is a solid director. He has the confidence to pace a film slowly at first, and then build intensity as the material progresses. He also has a good eye for shots and working with cinematographer Bradford Young (""Selma""; ""Pawn Sacrifice""). And, he is one of those directors that allows actors to portray intelligent characters with quiet voices, and allows the impact of their ideas to turn up the volume.Mr. Villeneuve is ably assisted by Amy Adams (""American Hustle""; ""Enchanted"") who turns in a fantastic performance as Dr. Luise Banks, a linguist that is tasked with communicating with the alien visitors. It is a layered performance, where Ms. Adam's speaks with a dull affect and fierce intellect. Her emotions are not worn on her sleeve, and we see her communicate through the intensity of her eyes and her breathing.Jeremy Renner (""Hurt Locker""; ""American Hustle""; ""The Town"") lends a quiet, steady supporting performance, as theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly, who is the more tender character of the two scientists who lead teams to determine the intent of the aliens. Mr. Renner and Ms. Adams work well together.The last person I want to note is writer Eric Heisserer, who adapted Mr. Chiang's short story into a feature length film. Based on his previous work, ""The Thing""; ""Final Destination 5""; ""Nightmare on Elm Street (2010),"" I would not have guessed he could pen such a subtle film, which proves he is a true writer, one who can avoid the dictates of modern attention spans.After a summer of mindless entertainment, I found ""Arrival"" to be strong film, and a nice reminder that you don't have to dumb down entertainment to be successful, unlike running for President of the United States.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good but not great.,"Arrival follows the story of an alien arrival rather than invasion, note the distinction. We follow the first 10 minute of the introduction to this world changing event through the eyes of Dr Banks, who it turns out may be the best linguist the world has and the world certainly needs her now. How is she not a professor though is she's so good? Excessive TV exposition guides us through the parts of the story not seen through her eyes and I did get fed up of news readers telling me what was happening after a while. The opening 10 minutes moves very quickly but the then things slow down considerably. You do get some of the awe and wow factor like the first time the dinosaurs are revealed in Jurassic Park.The film has little wow factor in terms of colours, it's very drab and plain looking. The orange radiation suits are the closest thing we get to strong colour. The introduction to the sound and the look of the aliens is well handled. At first we see very little of them surrounded in mist, though as trust begins to be built they are gradually revealed a little more.The film for me had elements of Gravity (grief element) Signs (personal doubt and faith), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (straining to communicate) and the Day the Earth Stood Still (the threat humanity must quickly learn to cooperate or face the consequences and Aliens have come to force our hand). There's a fair bit of the military in the film though it's made clear they need civilian help.Jeremy Renner is in the film too and pretty good, I like him and think he has good screen presence. There's also a lot of sounds to the film, it's quite noisy in that respect, always some sound of machinery or ambient noises at the base where most of the film takes place. The design of the alien spaceship is very simple and minimalist but quite effective. Little explanation is given in terms of the technology of the ship or the biology of the aliens. You also wonder why they bother having such short conversations each time, couldn't they speak just a little longer? Jeremey Renner's character also chips in with some much needed though bizarrely placed exposition, since when did he become the narrator? The film claims to raise all kind of big questions but skirts over the biggest, namely with foreknowledge of future undesirable events couldn't a person armed with that knowledge now set out to make sure they don't happen? If that proves not to be possible then equally that's a depressing thought as we are now trapped in some kind of fatalism. Overall the film is well made, slow paced, the acting is terrific and the script is also quite good. I have a few gripes with it but overall I was fairly happy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
More Expectaion,"I was having a big expectation ,the movie is Oscar nominee ,but i was a little disappointed,the story is spectacular but i think its not concentrated on the main story the are too much news from other countries but there are not playing a role in the feeling of the viewers.Slow moving story-lane ,a lot drama(about the daughter,i understand its not easy to lose somebody but if you working hard you just forget and when you on workplace should be easy,just going deep in the work to forget ,for me its not logical)too much for me.I don't like the hidden signs like with bird if its bird there you are expecting in some point that the people will put down there masking ,they made that on the 3rd meet with them,unnecessary suspense and drama too obvious for me. The positive was the acting of Amy Adams and Forest Whitaker,Jeremy Rener was not bad but don't like him as scientist(not nerdy-look).The end is original-for Oscar but for me the end is not enough.And the filming crew did splendid work.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"""Arrival"" Just confirmed I'll never trust Rotten Tomatoes reviews","100% on Rotten Tomatoes? WTF?! I'm a big sci-fi movie fan especially if its story is quite philosophical and cerebral which IS the case with Arrival, but it got bogged down in the complexities of showing how humans would communicate with a superior alien intelligence amidst a distrusting and violent Earth society. Figure out how to communicate quickly enough with the aliens in order to prevent war is the main premise.I got confused. There are dream like flashbacks that at first don't make sense, combined with a lot of Amy Adam's long drawn out ogle eye'd tearful stares of bewilderment morphing to fear bordering on amazement as she attempts to communicate and build a vocabulary as a translator with the alien entities. Yes! Great visuals and audio to keep me interested in how this was done.But this movie relies heavily on building tension this way from an audience with high expectation and anticipation of what's going to happen next with a pay out that is a bit of a let down, drawn out and confusing to keep up with. I actually was struggling to keep from dozing off, but that may be from my trying to beat the anticipated crowds (going Rotten Tomatoes 100% review) at a midnight viewing the day before Friday release. There were just a handful in the audience that night.Besides I was expecting something more profound than Jodie Foster's ""Contact"", a much better movie at relying on audience expectation and anticipation from experiencing a unique imagining of what it would be like to communicate with extraterrestrial alien intelligence that also explains how they overcome the limitations of space travel. ""Arrival"" doesn't even go there. But it's still a well made movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A philosophical contemplation,"Arrival opens with a gentle fusion of architecture, music and nature to set a somewhat melancholy mood. The story is developed from the perspective of a linguist (Amy Adams); given the size of its budget, time duration and its ambitious scope, this movie is a success. It gives the viewers an opportunity to contemplate their own lives in relation to other people and to the infinite. Who are we? Why are we here? How do we judge since no one has seen God? Is life worth living - given its tragedy or its beauty or both? Everyone has their own answers; this movie affirms the worthwhile aspects of life in spite of our differences and our general skepticism toward each other (e.g. among races and politics). The movie also hints at the union of language (symbol) and science (method).",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Villeneuve delivers again!,"""Arrival"" is a mystery, sci-fi movie, directed by Denis Villeneuve, who also directed two other critically acclaimed movies I loved watching: ""Prisoners"" and ""Sicario"". This time, Villeneuve takes on the subject of extra-terrestrial life, and the communications between humans and aliens from another planet, starring Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whittaker in the lead cast. I'm not gonna lie, this movie floored me from beginning to end, and I came out from the cinema with satisfying feeling of watching what I think is one of the – if not the – best movie of this year. This movie is one big mystery from start to finish, forcing you to watch and to be amazed and intrigued of the outcome. This movie reminded me of a well-directed Christopher Nolan movie like ""the prestige"" or ""memento"", where the mystery is being beautifully resolved at the end. All it needed was some epic music composed by Hans Zimmer, but even that is unnecessary because the music composed for this movie was just as beautiful as well. Amy Adams plays the lead role as a top-skilled linguist, and is being contacted by the military to try interpret and establish communication between the aliens and us. Adams plays excellent in the movie, and now that we are closing in on the Oscar season, Adams could be in for a best leading actor nomination. I am also being told that she plays a good leading role in ""Nocturnal animals"" that is out now, so if she shouldn't be nominated for ""Arrival"", maybe she has a second chance with ""Nocturnal animals"". Jeremy Renner and Forest Whittaker play as supporting characters, who both do a good job. Renner plays as a theoretical physicist, and is not a crucial character for the movies story to work, but he adds humour and plays good along with Adams, so he wasn't a problem for me in the movie at all. Whittaker works great as a Colonel in the military, who is used to guide and tell the audience of the movie what is happening, and to move the plot of the movie forward. In the end, ""Arrival"" is a beautifully shot movie, that not only examines the communication between extra-terrestrial life and humans, but also the communication between humans themselves and how we seem more alienated with the people we live on earth with than the aliens above us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Another great Villeneuve,"When going to the movies tonight, I was afraid that I would be definitely let down due to my high expectations after watching all trailers, reading into the material and, of course, being quite the Denis Villeneuve appreciator.After walking out of the cinema with my significant other, both of us agreed that this was probably one of the best movies we had seen in a long time.The lack of unnecessary action, the brilliant story telling, the beautiful pictures combined with a much more than just suitable cast, made this film an amazing experience - and to round this up it sent the audience into the night with a beautiful message - working together in desperate times for the greater good will always be the solution.L.K.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Notes about intelectual Sci-Fi,"Looking at ""Arrival"" (2016) from a quasi-canonical perspective, its adherence to the unwritten principles of the intellectualist Sci-Fi of the 2010s is easily observable, next to movies like Jonathan Glazer's ""Under the Skin"" (2013), Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina"" (2015), ""High Life"" (2018), by Claire Denis or James Gray's ""Ad Astra"" (2019).Each one of these movies bear the sign of the same resemblance: the abandonment of the of the audio-visual effects glorification that the genre often uses in a deeply consumerist manner in favor of a limited use of the cinematic spectacle, meant to point out the nuances of the acutely philosophical discourse developed among the frames.Specifically, Denis Villeneuve's film, much like the others mentioned above, is not and does not try to be a blockbuster, rather cultivating the stylistic manner explored and polished in his previous films, although the plot itself seemed to announce a sordid show, which we have all seen in many Hollywood productions.Aliens visit Earth in ""Arrival"", the whole conceptual and thematic area of the diegesis revolving around this fact, but at no point does Villeneuve's film establish any identitary connection with productions such as ""Independece Day"" (1996) or ""War of the Worlds"" (2005). Instead, the Canadian director navigates the narrative thread stretched by Ted Chiang in his book, ""Stories of your life"", and further amplifies a Kuleshovian structure that first deconstructs the temporal nature of the film only to finally recompose it into a form that directly serves the concept he is questioning.""Arrival"" talks about time and predetermination with a palpable sensitivity and although a not very successful attempt to infuse the bombastic suppurates in the film through its final sequences, Villeneuve does not lose sight of its real essence and finishes a complex story, that is all the more relevant in the current context.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The cerebral has landed,"I watched Arrival on its first showing tonight here in the UK. I had been attracted by the buzz around the movie -- and I was not disappointed. I found it a challenging and absorbing piece of work, an intelligent speculation on the time-honoured sci-fi theme of what happens when 'they' finally land.Linguistics expert Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is recruited to establish communication with the aliens, joined by mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). They are driven out to Montana (played here by Quebec) where a huge alien craft, one of 12 to have arrived at various locations around the globe, hangs massively above the ground. Every 18 hours a portal opens in the base of the craft, allowing access within.Two giant, squid-like 'heptapods' -- irreverently nicknamed Abbot and Costello by Donnelly -- can be glimpsed behind a large, translucent barrier. In an effective visual trick, the barrier is the same size and aspect ratio as a cinema screen, so you find yourself looking beyond the screen into a kind of cinematic second world -- a screen beyond the screen, in fact, where here be monsters.The aliens communicate by forming mysterious, smoky glyphs that obviously mean something -- but what? Dr Banks is under pressure from the military, represented by Col Weber (Forest Whitaker) to determine the visitors' intentions. Gradually she assembles a vocabulary and begins to comprehend their language. Meanwhile international tensions grow as the superpowers race to read the aliens' mysterious messages, jockeying to gain military or scientific advantage over their rivals.There are tensions, too, in the internal dialogue of the movie's main character, Dr Banks, played by Adams with a kind of steely, intelligent vulnerability -- an award-deserving performance that is never anything less than completely convincing. Dr Banks is troubled by visions of a daughter who died young. It is natural to assume that the daughter scenes are flashbacks -- but beware of assumptions. The narrative plays with time. Renner's wise-cracking, caring, crumpled support strikes exactly the right note.Bradford Young's cinematography is muted, the story played out under lowering grey skies and within the dark confines of the alien craft, while director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) keeps the pace moderate but relentless. The film is a builder without a wasted shot. The dialogue is spare verging on staccato, wasting no words on excessive exposition, the writing credits going to Eric Heisserer (screenplay) and Ted Chiang, who wrote the original story. Johann Johannsson's score is consistently compelling and occasionally sublime.Arrival demands close attention. This is no dizzying CGI-fest of space cadets saving the world. The mood is serious, the theme grown- up, the narrative cerebral. Humanity is held up against the mirror of an overwhelming -- and manifestly technologically superior -- alien presence. Villeneuve treats his genre and his audience with respect. His film deserves the same.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Well thought out mix of ideas packaged in a sci-fi movie. Just what I was hoping for.,"I honestly don't understand the dissatisfaction of some reviewers. Maybe sci-fi is too broad of a topic and some of the people just wanted to see flashy explosions and alien shooting. Although I found many themes of the movie a bit overused (themes and ideas already seen in other movies, but don't want to go into detail here), it is still an original and grown up attempt to the genre.It would require more risk taking to make this movie really stand out, but at the same time, that probably wasn't the main objective. It was thoughtful and entertaining just enough to keep the average sci-fi buff hooked for 2 hours. At the end of the day, I guess it comes down to personal taste and I can safely say I wasn't disappointed at all.Villeneuve is becoming a director to look forward to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Midnight Special did it better,"The new Sci-Fi effort, ""Arrival"", isn't exactly a new idea. Going back to ""2001-A Space Odyssey"", and most recently ""Midnight Special"", stories about communicating with aliens haven't lacked for examination. In this piece, aliens arrive at various sites around the globe, and (surprise!) they don't have any known language. Amy Adams, as a renowned linguistic prof, is recruited to communicate with them. She is in a race with other ""communicators"" to find out why the aliens have shown up; the various governments aren't good at cooperating. No spoilers there. To my only very basic linguistic-trained experience, the linguistics in this instance are spot on. The science seems at least a bit shaky. The fantasy... well, it's waaay out there. In spite of all that, thanks to Amy Adams, the film does work on a storytelling level. Her character uses linguistics, along with her partner (played by Jeremy Renner), a mathematician, to decode the aliens' language. The task is time-consuming, and of course belligerents around the world get impatient. Can she beat the clock? That is her assignment, and she knows it from the very beginning. Adams, as always, is terrific. (Like Jennifer Lawrence, there doesn't seem to be any role Adams can't bring off.) Renner's subtle but positive influence is significant. He doesn't have a lot to do, but he makes good use of his assignment. Forest Whittaker, as the sympatico but hard-pressed military commander, is good but forgettable. Without Adams, there would be no film. Director Denis Villaneuve realizes this and makes good use of her. He would have been well assisted with a more cohesive script.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Thought Provoking,"Amy Adams is exceptional and really showcases her talents in this thought provoking Sci-fi movie. The 'aliens have landed' type of movie has been done too often, usually predictable, leave your brain at the door kind of nonsense. Arrival needs, and demands your attention throughout, with a very well directed and written film. With an interesting take on how the world would unite or split while facing an alien presence the director makes the story somewhat relevant with today's society. I enjoyed Arrival and would recommend taking time to go see it even although the story does seem to drift away in the final third.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Pretentious and overhyped,"I think the reason that Arrival has received such high praise is because it is a breath of fresh air to the sci-fi genre, it provides a unique take on first contact with aliens and focuses more on atmosphere rather than action.However, any meaningful introspection or interesting scenes of dialogue is lacking that typically make slow films like this great. The main character had a shocking lack of personal stake in the conflict and her personality simply moulded to what the scene needed. The dialogue was so sparse that I quickly became bored and lost investment. I was at no point emotionally invested.For the record the atmosphere was really interesting, and those looking more for a visual/audio experience from their films may really enjoy this one. I used the term ""Pretentious and overhyped"" because people seem to be linking the great atmosphere to this film being the pinnacle of recent moviemaking. But like I said I just found this film so incredibly boring that I have to disagree.The film has one clever plot twist which I actually thoroughly enjoyed despite my low rating, and in my opinion this gave the last 15 minutes of the film some weight. However I really wouldn't justify slogging through the first hour and 45 minutes just to see that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"A clever, not-what-you-think-it-is sci-fi thriller.","Denis Villeneuve, director of last year's looming, dark Sicario, has a dabble with science fiction, about some otherworldly visitors with unclear intentions. It's central to Amy Adams' Dr. Louise Banks, a linguist who is enlisted by the U.S. Military to attempt to communicate and understand the visitors reasons.Recruited by stern, demanding Col. Weber (Forest Whitaker) and teamed up with scientific mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) they travel out to a remote beautiful part of Montana to start conversation with the extra-terrestrials.Something that is always a challenge for this particular genre is the creativity, as there can be endless possibilities but also that danger of becoming so unbelievable it becomes ridiculous or possibly annoying. Fortunately it's a believable story and has a deeper meaning than just the usual alien encounters with an unknown purpose. Are they friend or foe and if they're no threat then what do they want?What is an integral part of the plot is that the this isn't the only encounter and is actually one of twelve hovering above supposedly strategic locations around the globe, which still remain a mystery. As usual, Hollywood has to give the American point of view with the rest of world taking a back seat or worse, being disgruntled, fearful trouble-makers. In fact, there's possibly more of a threat from our own actions.It's tackles how we, as a human race might deal with an unexplored situation like this and begs to question humanity as a whole, hoping that our stupidity does not get the better of us. There's so much more to the plot than what any trailer suggests and whilst almost agreeing with the hype of being ""the greatest sci-fi movies in years"" it isn't entirely original or unpredictable having elements of Signs and Contact.Things get weird, and like with Interstellar, all isn't what it seems and while some of it is predictable, it's clever enough to not give everything away, even at the end, some questions remain unanswered, leaving viewers in wonder and discussion.Darkness is no alien to Villeneuve's style and his use of light is brilliant, especially during the conversations and visions. But what is incredible is the sound, the language sounding like whale song or elephants. Again reminding me both of Signs and Contact where sound was a key element of the films.The score is also amazing, Villeneuve's usual composer Jóhann Jóhannsson composes an immersive soundtrack especially the vocal/choral songs like ""Kangaru"" and the build up like ""Hydraulic Lift"" that raises the tension tenfold but there's a certain ambiance about it as well.Superbly paced, it's suspenseful and engaging. While there are plenty of moments where viewers might get lost, it rushes to its conclusion before it gets complete confusing. Intriguing plot, strong performances and good creativity makes it's a definite must-see, even for non-sci- fi fans.Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 9 Script: 8 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 10 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for a clever, not-what-you-think-it-is sci-fi thriller.

good story with great aliens,"This is a good story with great aliens. I know there's all this timeline toying that is the main tenet, but to me it is the aliens and the interactions between them and the doctors in charge that bring it real. Actually, it's the aliens and their culture I really dig in this flick. A doctor of languages is recruited when a dozen space alien ships arrive on earth spread around the planet. She and another doctor, one from sciences, get down to work out a communication with them. There's all kinds of tensions when other governments have their own ideas about what to do with their own visiting aliens. When the aliens mention a weapon governments start to back down.

the language of cinema,"Greetings again from the darkness. Our cinematic love affair with aliens goes back decades, and these films typically fall into one of two categories: evil aliens attack earth, or aliens come in peace and humans react poorly. We've seen aliens trying to provide us with righteous advice (The Day the Earth Stood Still, 1951). We've connected via a few musical notes (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, 1977) and radio frequencies (Contact, 1997). And we have certainly had our share of surprise and unwanted meetings (Alien, 1979; The Thing, 1982). Leave it to cutting edge director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners, Incendies) to find a new, more head-and-soul approach for the genre.This high concept project is born from Eric Hiesserer's screenplay of Ted Chiang's short story ""Story of Your Life""  a title that makes sense by the end of the movie, but one a bit too blah for a big time production with Oscar hopes. Five time Oscar nominee Amy Adams plays Dr. Louise Banks, a renowned linguist and interpreter. There is an interesting and well done sequence at the beginning of the film that provides the back story for her character and the foundation for the final reveal.A dozen oddly shaped spaceships have docked (mid-air) at various points around the globe. The one in the U.S. is hovering over  no, not Area 51  Montana of all places. Forest Whitaker plays the military officer charged with assembling the team that will try to communicate with the aliens. He chooses Dr. Banks due to her remarkable track record with languages. She is joined with uber-Science and Math guy, Physicist Ian Donnelly played by Jeremy Renner.We do see the aliens and their artsy style of communicating (a touch of Rorschach), but this is about so much more than learning a new inner-galactic language. It's about how the military reacts, how the general populace reacts, how the world leaders work together (or not), and even how the military, intelligence agencies and academia coexist. It's about smart people working out a plan when the problem isn't even clear  a between-the-ears head-scratcher.Mr. Villeneuve utilizes what appear to be flashbacks in helping us better understand Dr. Banks, but the element of time may not be what we typically accept in story-telling. The story, characters, cinematography and score (one of the best matches of music and movie all year thanks to composer Johann Johansson) work together to provide an engaging, nearly hypnotic movie going experience. Plus, I'm fairly certain this is the first alien movie to reference Abbott and Costello and crack a Sheila Easton joke. This is beautiful filmmaking that is also thought-provoking and encouraging of some species self-analysis (our species).",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A modern Science fiction masterpiece,"This is why I fell in love with film, plain and simple, this film right here is the reason.This is not the average sci fi you think it is, it most definitely is not my friend, this is a pure masterpiece in film and science fiction combined, and honestly the best film of 2016. Adapted from Ted Chiang's short story ""Story of your Life"" into cinema at its very best.When earth is suddenly startled by the arrival of mysterious pebble shaped space crafts or ""shells"", Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is called in to assist in contacting with the lifeforms that dwell within. Using her knowledge of language and translation her and Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) become the interpreters of the world as they try to learn and communicate with the extraterrestrial beings that are visiting the planet.A marvellous masterpiece at the hands of Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario, and Enemy), who seems to create pure cinematic artwork in any situation, whether its cartel war, scary kidnapping thriller, and now he has proved that he can do with science fiction, I very much looking forward to the upcoming Blade Runner 2049. Sharing a similar theme and structure to the works of Christopher Nolan, the French Canadian director has created a compelling science fiction blockbuster that treats its audience with intelligence and respect. Also feeling familiar vibes from the works of Ridley Scott and the great Stanley Kubrick.Arrival is artwork, one of the greatest piece of modern science fiction, and must be appreciated for it, with all usually element that make a film a film being absolutely magnificent. From the opening tilt shot that very slowly zooms in, you know that this is going to be an amazing and stunning watch. Like The Revenant 50% of the this film is the cinematography by Bradford Young, telling its very own story in every single shot. Every scene is a piece of artwork itself (literally) presenting the melancholy atmosphere that Villeneuve is a custom for doing. Especially in the scenes where we enter he valley of mystery we are so glued to the screens and engulfed by what we see. There is a phenomenal circulating aerial shot over the open field where the main shell hangs with the mystic white cloud floating in the air. Every shot where the shell is seen, there is the unsettling sinister vibe that is emitted, similar to the black Monolith.But what secondly really empowers and makes up 15% of the film is Jóhann Jóhannsson's score, another key aspect that journeys us into the story. This a literal face melting score, (I promise you my face really melted). This is what also takes me back to the music as featured in Blade Runner and 2001, and also Sicario. This combined with the camera and editing made me fall in love with the film. It contains of the most intelligent pieces of editing work (Joe Walker).At the very heart of Arrival is the story, the solid heavy idea of alien translation. This idea is one is never really focused on in alien arrival movies, and is most definitely pulls it off and even journeys into a cloudburst of wondrous, emotional, and insightful story telling. Being an Alien movie, Arrival also focuses the identity in humanity, reflecting a mirror at our political relations with other countries, and tries to brings us together in this event. Mark Kermode said that this is the best film to watch after the week we've had. There is a point where I was slightly unsure where the film was taking us, but by the end I was satisfied and happy to say that it contributed even more to whole effect of the film.Along with this is Amy Adam's spot on performance, it is only by the end of the film that I really appreciated her performance from the whole film. Viewing events truly through her eyes, we are encaptivated by what is happening, and are convinced that this is what would happen in real life. Jeremey Renner delivers his role as the standard good guy which creates remarkable chemistry with Amy Adams.If you see any film this year, make it Arrival, I don't care how much you want to see The Accountant, you goes see Arrival. You don't even have to be a massive science fiction fan. A solid and professional masterpiece. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Should've been directed by Christopher Nolan,"There's a lot of science, a lot of physics and time theory that could have been shown in a better way so it can make sense. The beginning and ending are related but when you finish watching the movie you feel like something is missing. The story itself is great but the way they tell it, the aliens looking, their ship and their way of writing (they write with smoke). Something had to be done to make the film more like inception and shutter Island, especially, with that ending and that music. I felt the number of scientists was so few. Only two!. The national guards were few as well. I think you need more people when you're filming in limited locations. Amy Adams's acting was great but the story should've convinced me more that she's a big scientist.I think if it was directed by Christopher Nolan who can write about time and physics, it was going to be the greatest movie ever.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Thought-provoking,"Arrival is a study of the human condition. It's an exploration of wonder and perception. A thought-provoking release of mental shackles. What if you could explore time in the same manner you do an uncharted forest? If your entire life was laid out before you, and you were free to tour all the untold moments, would you embrace each and every one of them? Arrival stems from a simple premise, a set of unidentified objects appearing to contain intelligent life have landed on Earth. As we see humanity's reaction to this event unfold we are slowly drawn in and forced to reevaluated everything we have learned.Louise (Amy Adams) is a fiercely intelligent linguistics professor. She maintains the facade of a solitary lifestyle and leaves us pondering her past. This all comes to a crashing halt the day they arrive. Louise is pulled into a world of mystery and wonder. She's forced to draw upon everything she's learned, which takes a tole on her mentally and emotionally. If language is the pillar with which we've built our civilization, then Louise is a masterful architect. Her interactions with this foreign species are broken down with mathematical precision. Despite this we're also shown a calm, caring side. She slowly builds rapport as communication between the two species begins to take form.Ian (Jeremy Renner) is a charming theoretical physicist. He and Louise are tasked with forming a means of communication with the unknown visitors. He's often the yin to Louise's yang. Her emotional intelligence and deep thought combined with his rigor and attention to detail flourish in investigating the task at hand. The two are also inexplicably drawn to one another. It's as if they've both been traveling their whole lives to meet at this moment in time.Arrival leaves us with more questions than answers. We're left in awe as the story methodically unfolds before us. It's a slow build, but not one that leaves us with time to wander. The pacing and structure of the film are done to perfection. We can't help but feel as though these events are happening right before our very eyes. Denis Villeneuve masterfully controls our attention. The cinematography and score are awe-inspiring, which we've almost come to expect from his films. Amy Adams truly shines in this breakout role. We've seen glimpses of her excellence in the past, but this is something entirely different. From beginning to end she is a powerful force on the screen. Arrival is the kind of movie that will make you step outside and stare at the stars with childhood wonder. It will inspire conversation and provoke thought. Arrival is a film and an experience, but above all else it is a question – what if?",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Alien language,"When I saw that Denis Villeneuve had made this science fiction film, I knew I had to see it. It's an intelligent, gripping movie about first contact with an alien species, specifically with our attempts to communicate with them. It turns out that communication with aliens may not be as easy as one would think! Especially when aliens do not have the same sense of time and language that we have. Learning an alien language would have a profound effect.The story is told in such a way that the viewer is left to figure it out. The plot is non-chronological. I admit I had to visit the internet afterwards to understand better what I had just seen. Amy Adams pretty well carries the movie on her own, and she pulls it off. A great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"What a dumb, lame and clueless crap again","This awful film almost drove me crazy. It was perhaps the most ridiculous and stupidest Sci-Fi film ever made in this genre. The graphic design on The heptapods, the so-called ""Aliens"" were the stupidest and most disgusting creation so far on the screen. I strongly suspected that such kind of crap was inspired when the stupid screenplay writer(s), the director and the graphic designer ate at the seafood restaurant, or when they visited the aquariums, saw those octopus and star fish, then decided to draw up such ridiculous crappy combination and made them into what we saw in this film.I have to point out here again, with those so-called alien hands which could only ejaculate black ink as being their language and to communicate, they are not yet evolved advanced enough. With their star octopus sucking star fish like hands, there's no way they could invent tools or machines to build anything, albeit their space ships. The most and the least they could do are suck crap like the elephant trunks, sucking or spitting crap. There's no way they could build anything.But the most disgusting smoke screen is that they used these stupid aliens just to tell another you've-seen-thousand-times plain story. Mother loved her only daughter but she died, so the mother could never get used to it and moved on. She was tortured day and night and obsessed with the memories of her dead daughter, anywhere and anytime, she just couldn't get rid of her dead daughter's images. We didn't see anything that could prove her unsurpassed reputation as a leading linguist....Then the American government sent in an Army Colonel to call for her service when the mysterious aliens and their spaceships hung over all over the Earth's countries air space. The colonel supposed to treat her and other scientists, specialists like the lifeline to solve the international and national crisis, yet he just showed his rudeness, impatience to them, not the way around; which was also a very bad scenario among other stupid arrangement. Why she answered to him as a superior and Sir him all the time is beyond me. And this so-called number one choice of linguist could only inspired by her dead daughter's images and memories to solve almost anything and everything she failed to understand.But no matter, the funny outcome of this film is she found her true love from one of the specialists who has faced the unknown danger with her. She married that guy and had a child again, all the nightmares were gone. (this paragraph you could treat it as a minor spoiler). The invasion of the aliens only gave her a chance to be alive again. An Arrival of a new child is actually what this stupidest sci-fi film really wanted to tell about, and forget those octopuses, people!!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

This film got to my absolute top list.,"Remember that the one star rating almost every time not a marker for a bad film like 2,3,4 stars, but a marker of a failed expectations.This move is not about aliens, its about humans.

Sunday evening snoozefest,"I love SF, but I didn't love this. First, it is slow. It is so slow I nearly fell asleep. People were leaving the theatre. Agonisingly long shots of the heroine with quivering lip trying to show fear, instead showing angst and indecision. 'Mood' shots that bore. Repetitive motifs that are simply dull. Second, it tries to be dramatic and fails. Horribly. Overly loud music/sound effects (think Cloverfield without the menace), super-slushy strings for emotional scenes that are not that emotional and I found it difficult to care about, and a score that is just odd, like bad ambient music. Third, the actual story is nothing special. Heroine is called in to save the day, after difficulties, she does. Wow. The 'reveals' are not exceptional, and the whole basic premise of the film, the 'thing that makes it special' is so contrived that no matter what happened or you wanted to happen could be inserted and explained away. It's like a McGuffin. Fourth, the plot has a glaring hole in it, you wonder why 'they' did what they did in tat way. It just doesn't make sense.

I waited through the entire credits before I could turn to look my friends in the eyes and simple say ""wow!"".

"Interesting or Boring, Depending on a Viewer's Taste","Having read many good and bad reviews of this film, I am not going to go into too many descriptive details as to why I liked this movie, or give away anything too specific as to its plot or conclusion. Instead, I'm going to simply warn those away who might find this film a big yawn. If you are someone who wants cowboys and Indians in space, light sabers, funny looking aliens who happen to speak English, clearly defined good or evil adversaries shooting at one another and blowing things up, then this film will offer you nothing. Clearly, many viewers either felt this movie was a drag or saw themselves as being intellectually superior to its creators. There were complaints of plot holes, clichés, slow pacing and my favorite, pretentiousness, an overused word that often just means the subject was too deep to trouble one's brain over. Some people just want to be entertained, and that's fine, and others don't want to be lectured to, and I get that, too.There is an attempt in this movie to offer some kind of hope that the divided nations of this world might work together someday for a common cause. Some reviewers seem to hate this kind of wishful thinking, finding such ideas trite, and I even read some political rants blasting the film for its liberal appeal and/or its sentimental, romantic sub-plot. These are all valid criticisms, but I don't happen to share them.For my money, this good-looking, atmospheric bit of science fiction story-telling beats most of the big special effects blockbusters of the past thirty years by miles. It reminded me of previous attempts at using science fiction to ponder big ideas, like the definitive film in this genre, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968), and later, THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH (1976), CONTACT and GATTACA, (both 1997), DISTRICT 9 (2009), CLOUD ATLAS (2012) and INTERSTELLAR (2014), all varied attempts to get at something deeper than flying saucers and silly monsters. Some of these movies had bigger special effects, faster pacing or greater mass appeal. There is a dreariness to the design of ARRIVAL, but this wet, misty grayness perfectly fit the story. What really boosted this movie to a higher level was the fine acting by Amy Adams, Forest Whitaker and the rest of the cast. Yes, ARRIVAL is a bit slow moving, and although the musical score is beautiful, it was a little too present and insistent for my taste. Those were my main criticisms. I also wish the film makers had taken a cue from Hitchcock and sprinkled the script with a good dose of humor. But being a serious attempt at getting at some fundamental human questions, which have never been simple - how we communicate with those who don't speak - or think in - our own language, how we relate to time, our past and our future, how we overcome our deepest most common fears in order to avert human disasters - well these things probably left little room for jokes or sight gags.Those of you who have seen this film and liked it, I urge you to read the ""Trivia"" section on ARRIVAL, which includes a lot of clues and information as to how the writers and the rest of the creative team packed the script with references to other stories, movies, characters and their names, and even vintage television. This section enriched my understanding of this work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"'If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?'","ARRIVAL is a refreshing science fiction story that allows the audience to approach the concept of alien visits as something of value rather than the beginning of the end. No comic book antics in this sensitive film based on Ted Chiang's story 'Story of Your Life' and adapted with great skill by screenplay author Eric Heisserer. This is a film that asks us to ask questions about our place in the universe and in the cycle of life using the visitation of extraterrestrials as the stimulus. Denis Villeneuve directs with consummate skill.The dialogue of the film has many rare insights – words that come form the characters such as 'Language is the foundation of civilization. It is the glue that holds a people together. It is the first weapon drawn in a conflict' and 'But now I'm not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings. There are days that define your story beyond your life. Like the day they arrived.'The story line as action is simple – a factor that enhances the importance of the message of the film. Twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world. Linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is tasked with interpreting the language of the apparent alien visitors with the assistance of theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). They join the Army team led by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) in Montana – one of the twelve areas where the craft have landed. Banks job is to try to learn the aliens' language and enable communication with them. Through regular meetings with two of the aliens she starts to compile a record of the aliens' ""language"" - a series of drawn symbols. The important question is - are they friend or foe? Other nations with alien landings are starting to view them as a threat, making it a race against time as war with the aliens could erupt at any moment.With extraordinary cinematography by Bradford Young and a pitch perfect atmospheric musical score by Jóhann Jóhannsson (with a little help from Antonín Dvořák!) and first class acting by both Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, this is a film that should be marked as a 'must see' experience – for many many reasons – especially at this point in our earthbound history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Good old-fashioned cerebral, heady, thought-provoking science-fiction","This is good old fashioned cerebral, heady, thought-provoking science- fiction. It's also a somber picture; one that tries ambitiously to meld the heart with the mind. It mostly works, though in spite of what many are calling a formulaic plot (it's necessary, I think, and part of a larger theme).Amy Adams is basically herself but with the usual variations; this is her as stern, determined, soft-spoken thinker, broken or maybe always has been. It's a subtly engaging performance, the kind Adams has been doing great work with for a while now.The score is foreboding and ominous, fitting in not just with sci-fi history but also the kind of emotional tinkering Arrival plays with. Villenueve is a master of slow building suspense using striking and casual compositions in alternating rhythms.I wish Renner had been given more to do, more depth, more anything really. And I really wish the decoding of the language wasn't glossed over in a montage. It was built up as an incredibly complex and nearly impossible task, and then suddenly they had made really good progress with it. A few more minutes could have done wonders here.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
It is satisfying. It is visionary.,"I was surprised to see the difference between the high ratings from the critics, and the modest box office receipts. Having seen the movie, I am satisfied.The film makers have created an uncompromising adult sci-fi classic. This movie does not have the loud music and continuous explosions of today's blockbusters. It is not about gung-ho marines on a bug hunt. It is not about a fantasy adventure in another realm.Overpowering aliens suddenly appear on earth. It is the task of the experts to learn how to communicate with them. You can only understand their intentions by providing the linguistic bridge between species.It is not useful to communicate by numbers. That only tells you that there is a compatibility in the sciences. The movie makes it very clear that there is ambiguity in any attempt to understand intent. A weapon can also be a tool.This should be obvious when you realize that humans often use the same terms (e.g. freedom) with very different interpretations and intentions.There is plenty of drama in the movie. The eerie appearance of the aliens crafts. The alien environment of a radiation suit. The technological marvel of the alien craft. The sinister response of the hard men in the military and CIA. The bomb attempt against the aliens.Above all, the movie highlights the disunity and enmity among human nations.In the end, the linguist (Amy Adams) solves the puzzle. Using her rudimentary grasp of the alien language to receive a message from the future. Thereby, saving the day.A far greater achievement than the mere mastery of anti-gravity.On a personal note, the linguist demonstrates free will when she chooses to get married and bear a child. Knowing that a tragedy will befall the child.To those who don't get it, you're not in Kansas anymore.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"No payoff for all of the slowness.*** Minor spoiler plot points following ***I really liked Enemy, I loved Prisoners, and Sicario is a masterpiece but Denis Villeneuve's Arrival misses the mark.The ""twist"" basically invalidates the main character's reason for having the personality that she has throughout the movie. Arrival also makes the mistake of making this big science fiction first contact movie too much about the personal problems of the main character instead of making it about the subject matter at hand. Because in the end, with all of the time that was was put into so many flashbacks, it doesn't tie strongly enough into the issue of the aliens arriving on earth. Now I understand that the film makers might think that it does. But to me it's just a long drawn out sidetrack that is detracting from more interesting things that the movie could be showing.Now from a purely technical standpoint Arrival is first rate. It looks and sounds good, but Amy Adams character doesn't add up. Jeremy Renner's character is really the only spark of life and personality in the movie but he doesn't get much of a chance to do anything with it.I had high hopes for Arrival but, nope.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Finally- a science fiction film that assumes its audience is intelligent.,"Denis Villeneuve is a masterful filmmaker who consistently elevates genre pieces, as seen with Sicario and Prisoners, to awe-inspiring heights. Arrival, his first take on the science fiction field, is no exception.The film is perhaps the most realistic, measured tale of alien invasion yet made. Here is a movie that deals with extraterrestrial contact with probing questions of linguistics and science, rather than displays of violence, sound and fury. Our hero is not a six-pack laden, gun-wielding brusque, but a college lecturer. It is difficult to discuss the movie in depth without spoilers, but the most striking aspect is how impeccably and intricately well-crafted it is. By the end of the film. upon reflection, I staggered out of the cinema marvelling at the sheer craft of the plot, which weaves mammoth intellectual concepts, questions about humanity, human experience, and, in particular, the story of one woman, Amy Adams. The film's plotting works so well as a whole that it's staggering, and this is to a great extent indebted to the editing, which I believe deserves an Academy Award. In a feat only possible in the medium of cinema, the scope of this heady tale is brought alive by complex editing, leading to a rousing finale that is emotionally cathartic. Also of note is the eerie score, truly contributing a sense of necessary awe and perturbation, as well as production design and effects, which are used perfectly to contribute necessary spectacle, but never threaten to usurp the plot itself.It is because the positives of this film are so great that the negatives don't irk me so much. The weakest aspect of the film, fortunately alleviated by the strength of performances from Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, is a lack of character development. It's less that I sympathised with these characters and was involved with them particularly, and more that the plot remained so intriguing I was consistently engaged. In the fashion of the similarly cerebral Interstellar, whose Cooper-Murph relationship buttressed its science fiction plot, more character development could've made this excellent film perfect. In addition, there is an unexpected, incredibly corny line towards the end that really annoyed me.Overall, Arrival was an immensely satisfying and rewarding cinematic experience, I anticipate the movie will have some detractors, possibly because of its lack of action that populates most science fiction films, and a plot that demands your constant attention, but for me it was a thrilling exercise in realistic, grounded sci fi.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
What a waste of time.,"I hate to give a review like this, but I found this to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. It was almost un-watchable. I can't believe all of the high ratings for this.I usually am very interested in anything regarding UFOs, aliens, and the like, so I was very excited when this came out. Plus, throw in some great actors I respect in Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forrest Whittaker... and I thought this was a slam dunk.It was far from it. Boring, slow, no real point or plot. I just couldn't get into it. My wife said the same thing, along with several friends.Kudos to you who actually liked it and got something out of it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A smart sci-fi film which couldn't be more relevant or timely:,"As a fan of science-fiction, I'm routinely disappointed in the intelligence and scope of the average sci-fi film. The last few years have been a boon, with intelligent films like ""Moon,"" ""Gravity,"" ""Her,"" ""Ex Machina,"" and ""The Martian"" receiving wide release. These films use the tools of science-fiction to mine introspective and philosophical themes, to allegorically say something about human nature.And so it is with ""Arrival."" And yet, even though my expectations were set reasonably high by the trailer, I still found myself shocked by just how deeply interesting, powerful and moving this film was. In my mind, this film immediately joined the ranks of such all-time science-fiction film classics as ""2001"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""The plot involves Amy Adams as a linguist, and Jeremy Renner as a scientist, both contracted by the military to try to establish meaningful communications with an alien race who have mysteriously appeared, hovering in an egg-like ship, somewhere in the majestic back-country of Montana. The ship is one of 12 which have appeared worldwide -- and so the race is on, as the US and its allies vie to crack the linguistic code before China or Russia. Fears that the aliens might prove malicious hang, omnipresent, over every move.This could certainly be the plot of a fun, lightweight genre piece. But ""Arrival"" takes a more considered, more meditative approach. Rather than dispense with its heavy themes lightly, it examines them curiously, finds them more interesting the deeper it looks, builds its entire story around them. This is a film which rewards thought. The pacing of the film, which is very deliberate but not what I'd call slow, might owe something to Andrei Tarkovsky, the famous Russian director ""Stalker"" and ""Solaris,"" two of the slowest but most hypnotic and profound science-fiction films you're ever likely to see. Come to think of it, many of the sets in ""Arrival,"" as well as the camera- placement and lighting, reminded me of Tarkovsky's work.No review of ""Arrival"" could be complete without mentioning something about the film's surprising third-act. This is likely to go down in cinematic history as one of the best ""mindblowing"" third-acts ever made. I felt a rush comparable to what I felt the moment I first learned the secret of ""The Matrix"" -- and yet, here, the ""twist"" is so poetic, so natural, so obvious in retrospect, that it really stands alone as a thing of greatness. It's a big thought, presented elegantly. But make no mistake -- the greatness of the ending is well-earned by the film preceding it.I have to say that this movie did a number on me. There's this thing that happens when I see a movie that actually respects my intelligence, where I become moved by even the smallest directorial decisions, because they feel so right.""Arrival"" drew me in almost immediately, with its intimate and ultra-realistic depiction of how Amy Adams' linguist, Dr. Louise Banks, learns of the arrival of the ships. She actually gets the news kind of late. It finds her in the middle of a class she's teaching, as several students' phones start chiming with texts. She's asked by one of her students to turn on the classroom TV. After she does, they all just sit there, stunned, watching the news- footage, not knowing how to react. An alarm goes off, the building is cleared, and everyone is sent home. These scenes play out with crystalline logic; the film observes them closely, without comment or bogus emotional cues. A meditative, nervous score percolates beneath.And here I've described the feeling and the texture of this film, and given you many reasons to see it -- but I haven't even begun to tell you what it's about. Well, doing so would take a lengthy conversation; this film contains some very big ideas.But more than anything else, this is a film about the power of language. A popular scientific theory, discussed by the characters in ""Arrival"" but dating back to at least George Orwell's ""1984"" and its concern with ""NewSpeak,"" holds that language actually shapes thought, and not the other way around. Vocabulary and syntax: We're introduced to these concepts before we even know what they are; from our earliest days we're taught the linguistic labels for things, for actions, for emotions and desires -- and we're taught to connect these words in specific ways, in patterns which convey specific meanings. The form of a question differs from the form of a statement. We just learn these things, most of us, and it gives shape to the way we think. Language and thought: Irrevocably intertwined.To what degree is our perception of the world based entirely upon the language we use to describe it and interact with it?That is what ""The Arrival"" is about, at its deepest level. It's also about a lot more. It's about a woman coming to terms with grief; it's about a world poised on the brink of war; it's about the fears which divide us; and it's about the bravery -- the trust and the risk -- that it takes to come together again. It's about the miracle of empathy. Arriving hot on the heels of a very polarizing election, when anxieties and animosity are high, this film's messages couldn't be more relevant or timely.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The Main Story is great - But the poor writing around it drags this all down to be more of a Tuesday lunch time film than a Friday nighter.,"The main storyline for the film is extremely compelling, but the telling of it is marred by a thousand clichés that tell you from the start that you're too clever for this film.As the story unfolds, you suddenly realise you've seen this story before a thousand times. It's a classic tale - Sciency character introduced. Military are arrogant military people who don't science. They need Sciency character to science for them as they don't science. Aside from the obvious insult to the extremely talented people who do make up these militaries, the audience also feel slightly insulted that they're being taken for the same ride again. It's like you left the TV on for too long and David from Independence Day has just cracked the Alien Code that the military men couldn't solve.But the main storyline is enthralling. The sounds used in the film are masterfully done, and they almost, almost, get over the problems that the side stories have set up. A whole wonderful cast of misfired roles (Including a Forest Whitaker who has been given the direction prompt 'Be unreasonably unlikable') tar almost all of these main story scenes, in particular the ones which include the background military crew. You just can't get over the feeling that these people are stood in a green screen room, chatting amongst themselves about their weekends between takes. The gravity is just never there.Then, the film goes off the rails. A clever idea - poorly executed. Like a toddler telling you how clever they are, the film shouts and shouts and runs in circles, dropping all-capital-letter SUBTLE hints for the last 10minutes to make sure you work it all out before the main characters do so you can feel smart.All in all, it's worth watching. If this was the 90s it would be a great film. But it just isn't the 90s.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"More than scientists, professors, soldiers, we're all humans – and if there's something that makes us all different from other living things is that we feel.","It's not just science fiction. I always say that fiction is created by those who see a better future, and because they imagine it, they create it. Imagination becomes reality. It happened before, it's like writing a draft for a possible play. ""Life imitates art"" it's been said. More than scientists, professors, soldiers, we're all humans – and if there's something that makes us different from other living things is that we feel. ""Arrival"" starts with this idea. When extraterrestrial beings arrive, Planet Earth and all within it – governments, ideologies, people – gets terrified. What's their purpose here? Coming back to reality a little bit, look what happens now in human history – we're still struggling with the same problems, and we have been facing it for many decades – war, hunger, poverty, materialism, degradation of environment, fossil-fuel-based – all of these need to be ""cured"" as we step into this new century. We're still learning, but the process of learning is very slow – you cannot see it easily, but from far away, in a bigger perspective. In the movie, that's why they came - they saw a glimpse of hope. Somewhere, there was greatness in us, we just needed a little push. Maybe we could return the favor one day. They arrive. Scientists and linguists try to understand strange beings with a complicate but beautiful language, this holds attention for a while and after some time gets tiring and scary, but understandable – they wanted to pass just a simple little message and that was it. No wars, no ultra super-advanced technology, no immortal life and gold. The plot plays with it, showing us the immense power of (miss) communication and interpretation and how it can affect this messy, hurry and impatient world we live in. Maybe because we're still considered a primitive species, we want quickly answers, if we don't have it, bad things happen - They will exterminate us, and what chances do we have? Comparing with a society that had discovered the interstellar travel, we would be just bacteria at their eyes. Even if they were born a few million years before us, they would be much more advanced than we are at this moment in history. So let's bomb them before they bomb us. I'm sure the viewer feels the impotence, that this scenario probably would happen in a real-like situation and you could do nothing to stop the coming apocalypse. But there's a way out: Some argue that any intelligent and violent civilization would destroy itself before getting to the stars. It's like a ""firewall"" rule for life across the universe. A test - If you don't get good grades, you're not going to pass. And if this rule is valid for us, certainly was valid for them. Any civilization must think itself as one. Union. And that's what ""arrival"" is all about. They understand us more than we understand ourselves. If you've seen your whole future life, would you change something? This question is asked by the protagonist - Amy Adams, nostalgic and beautiful as always - as she sees her future, a power maybe given by them, to see a possibility of her destiny, and all that would come with it: flowers, but also sorrow. This is deeper than meets the eye. If you knew your destiny, would you still live it? would you feel again? would you feel more? Because even a brief happy moment with someone we love makes everything worth it. That's why a general ready to declare war will change his mind in the last moment, that's why a mother who lost her child will have hope again. In all our ignorance and arrogance, there's only one thing that can make us reconsider, be better, feel more. It's been said before ""For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love"".Note –the universal language we know is mathematics, and through it we could talk with any advanced civilization – but this idea had been used before in great novels like the utterly perfect ""Contact"" by Carl Sagan, later on made into a movie with a spectacular Jodie Foster's performance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Maybe you agree with me, maybe you don't. It doesn't matter.","I loved this movie. In the first five minutes it almost had me in tears, and not many movies ever succeeded in doing that. The pace is slow, but never too slow, it stays very interesting. Even though the big guy next to me fell asleep after devouring a popsicle, a bag of chips and a bottle of Fanta, I was never distracted from the story. The director pulled me in from the first second and the atmosphere he creates lasts throughout the movie. Great cinematography an soundscape as well. Amy Adams once again shows her great acting skills, and if you don't love Jeremy Renner after this movie, you never will.

The most unique sci-fi movie ever made.,"Arrival is based on the short story, Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang. When alien spaceships land on Earth, expert linguist Louise Banks(Amy Adams) is hired by the army. Louise is given the job of translating the alien communications. Louise is part of a team that also includes theoretical physicist, Ian Donnelly(Jeremy Renner). Together, they have to decipher the language of the aliens & find out what they are doing on Earth.Arrival is a mind blowing film. Director Denis Villeneuve has directed yet another masterpiece after, Prisoners(2013) & Sicario(2015). The best part about this movie is that, it is nothing like the usual alien flicks. There are no over-the-top action set pieces & the suspense is brilliantly maintained, throughout the film. The climax of the movie, will leave you speechless. The script by Eric Heisserer, based on Ted Chiang's source material, is fantastic. Pay close attention throughout the film, in case you miss any minute detail. The visual effects are subtle & perfect for a sci-fi movie, like Arrival. The haunting background score by Johann Johannsson is great. The cinematography by Bradford Young is gorgeous. Amy Adams' performance as Louise Banks, is the highlight of the film. Adams portrays a gamut of emotions throughout the movie, spectacularly. Jeremy Renner is superb as Ian Donnelly. Forest Whitaker is effective as Colonel Weber. Michael Stuhlbarg, Tzi Ma & Mark O'Brien are impressive as Agent Halpern, General Shang & Captain Marks, respectively.

A load of old codswallop,"""Arrival"" arrives garlanded with a lot of critical praise. Why, I ask myself since Denis Villeneuve's latest is fundamentally a load of old codswallop but with pretensions. It's certainly entertaining; Villeneuve is, if nothing else, a consummate professional but surely the comparisons with Kubrick and Tarkovsky are not only misplaced but insulting to two much finer filmmakers. A more likely companion piece is Robert Zemeckis' ""Contact"", (they both share a strong heroine), down to the sentimentality surrounding life, birth and, naturally, death. It's also full of gobbledygook about language that might not endear it to a multiplex crowd. Given that they have virtually nothing to do but look puzzled Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whittaker aren't half bad. The aliens themselves look like giant octopi putting this more in the category of the monster flics that America produced in the fifties rather than what appeared post-2001. Reasonably enjoyable then but hardly Oscar material.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

I've seen a few movies recently that felt the special effects WERE the story so it's refreshing to see a movie that used the special effects to enhance the story. They were also original and fascinating.I liked how the main character was treated by the military, it seemed authentic that she wasn't given any information. I felt like I was right there with her.

No words.,"One thing is clear.When the movie arrived it shocked me.From the first scene until the last it was worth it.It is a must-see.But,for those who haven't seen it,let me give an advise.Try to read and see as less things as possible about Arrival before you see it.The director,Denis Villeneuve,who is now working on the sequel of Blade Runner did an excellent work turning the wonderful plot of Eric Haisserer. into a high-quality film.The movie is based on the novel ""The Story of your Life""which i really want to read.One advantage of the movie is that turns a classic plot,that aliens visit Earth with some huge vessels and then wait,into a story talking about humanity,love and mostly the meaning of language.Amy Adams played her role in away so realistic that it may be sure that she will take the Oscar of best actress this year.Although Emma Stone and Natalie Portman will be surely nominees,Amy Adams was just perfect.Well,the truth is that she played a really interesting and clever character,Louise,who is a linguist who tries to talk with the creepy,strange aliens.She is a character that has a lot to share and with really important abilities that will help people to find a solution.Jeremy Renner,plays Ian,the scientist that helps Louise to solve the problem.Their relationship becomes really strong as we can observe that they come closer to each other and share their experiences.I think that the movie is awesome due to one fact.It isn't like the other alien movies,that people need to survive for the aliens and fight them...but it provides to the audience a really strong meaning,the importance of language and how it connects us and changes us in a great way. Meanings.theories,ways of life,ways to look,to learn and to understand are hidden into words.The movie contains an excellent twist that effects the whole movie and makes it even more complicated.I was also surprised by the design of the aliens,that have seven legs and write with a code of cyclical nature,instead of the typical structure of words an letters.The ""flashbacks"" are excellent scenes among with the scene that Louise talks with the aliens in person and she finally understands why they came there.These scenes make the movie a film of high quality and beautiful cinematography!All in all,Arrival is a movie talking about the borders not only between people but also between the pieces that build ourselves.With a perfect combination of science-fiction and drama,it is one of the best movies of the year.After Arrival I have really high expectations about Blade runner 2049 which will be also directed by DenisAnd,who knows,maybe these aliens arrive again...but this time their coming for the Oscars!Sorry,but I can'y say more.Because,very fittingly,I don't find the words in order to say more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Flips You Sideways in Knowing What Lies Beyond Us,"Immediately we are grabbed from our seats into the journey of Dr. Louise Banks and her discovery of what it means to be bound by time. Played vulnerably by five-time Oscar nominee Amy Adams (American Hustle, Doubt), Dr. Banks is weighed down in life by the loss of her daughter to cancer. While a sixth nomination for Adams is unlikely for this role, Arrival still gives a richly tense and starkly imaginative allegory to the coming end times, as paralleled by the inner demons of past trauma.In her present state, she is a college professor of English. At one of her teaching sessions, the lecture hall is suspiciously low on students. There are alerts on their mobile devices about unidentified objects landing across the globe, each one shaped like a large perpendicular shell. This causes for mass evacuation away from these objects, with only authorized authorities supervising and investigating what they are and where they come from. At this point, it feels like a rip-off of classic alien invasion thrillers including Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Day the Earth Stood Still. While it certainly obeys the tropes for the most part, creative liberties are still taken to ensure an exhilarating experience.Why did they land in these specific spots? That's the question the American government is trying to answer as they conduct an organized approach to interacting to whatever thrives inside these things. Their solution in interacting with this unknown is to bring in Dr. Banks to apply her English knowledge, a highly discomforting task for her, as well as the audience. The unpredictability and danger that she is thrown into hits you right where you feel, especially when it comes time to approach the inside of this vessel.Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) proves yet again how much skill he has in disorienting you without having to manipulate the screen with IMAX magic, as his choices of framing gives an overwhelming feel of scale in comparison to this unidentified object. The color palette used by cinematographer Bradford Young (A Most Violent Year) gives a stark feel of loneliness in a world separated by language barriers. The stressful sound effects complement the sad melodic music scored by Jóhann Jóhannsson (Sicario, The Theory of Everything).Inside of the object, the gravity is perpendicular to our own; then at the end of the object, these eerie, faceless, squid-like lifeforms behind a white veil await the approach of human investigators. Dr. Banks leads the interaction with these beings, later named ""Heptapods,"" who communicate through painting abstract black rings that make up their language. So she, as a college professor, applies her history in English to vigorously study their language, which they call ""nonlinear orthography."" The process in figuring out their form of communication is absolutely brilliant and inspirational in how it's created and discovered.As real as this small-scale epic feels, its treatment towards the other countries is still rather problematic. Essentially, they are treated like outsiders from America whose first resort is to rage war against the unknown, unlike those in the richest country in the world who rely on communication past language barriers to solve problems. Based on what I've seen in the news recently, this is not how things have played out.There's also an issue I have with the portrayal of Dr. Banks' daughter, who is absent for a large portion of the film as if she's not really that important to the story. If she were mentioned more consistently through the first and second acts, she would have strengthened the conflict between the key characters.Yet the reminder of our relation with family issues and the passage of time may just as well be the push forward that we need to communicate with one another despite the inconvenience of language differences across barriers. It is through interaction and compromise that we will arrive at where we intend to go.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the Great Films,"Tarkovsky's ""Mirror"" husband-wife dreaming of baby, scene is used when Amy Adams says ""do you want to have a baby"". Great homage to history of film.Aliens: ""Use your Weapon"" in the script is never answered literally. Yet what that means (I won't tell what that is) is acted out. The possible answers are brilliant. We artists can learn from that, pure cinema, pure art. This is not literature. Even past the end of film we the audience have to put together the literal answer to that question, but the meaning has already entered our heart, and thus Art was already committed. That's why it is so engaging. We the audience provide the answer to the scripted words, even though we are shown by the feeling and acting, we aren't sure, so we have to think, engage, and answer the question, as humans.Critically. I'm not a fan of the maudlin, boring neo-Communist, neo-Marxist ""we are all one and have have talk"" mundane story line. But Adams creates enough dreamworld to move people beyond those ""Marxist Universalist Utopia"" story element in the plot to carry the story to both a more profound depth and and arcing height. I think Amy Adams can elevate any script to that of legends.Amy Adams should compete with Lana Gulevich (Gulag Vorktua 2016) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5768140/ to win an Academy Award, they are both mind blowing in totally carrying us out of where we are to some imaginary space. Hats off to the director Villeneuve allowing Amy to carry it and allowing DP Young to shoot portraits from back 3/4 behind, as it was instrumental in getting us near the minds of the characters, a Circumspection POV, as though we are looking at themselves from the back of their heads, where ideas develop. Congrats on director for allowing F/1.2 plane focus shots even when they drifted off. As a film director/editor, I know it takes to guts fight for those artistic shots, but you reach into those spaces where feelings are in us and thus engage us.I took three pages of notes in the theater during the screening. Amazing film. Villeneuve, Adams, DP Young, all need to be put on people's short lists.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Because of Kangaroo,"It is estimated that over 90% of communication is non-verbal. It is interesting to think that of the thousands of languages and tens of thousands of words we have, we're only marginally more sophisticated than Cro-Magnon-level pointing and grunting. When attempting to convey a thought, there are countless ways for things to get lost in translation. The new and thought provoking ""Arrival"" takes this notion and raises the stakes to such heights that a single word misunderstood could result in global catastrophe. As a dozen alien space-crafts emerge all over the globe, the threat is twofold; how do we accurately communicate with these extraterrestrial beings, and how do we trust the rest of the world's handling of these new visitors?Sci-Fi has the potential to succeed in conjunction with any other genre. Action is easy, comedy is forgettable, drama is hit and miss, and melodrama is more miss than hit. It is therefore high praise that the guarded melodrama in ""Arrival"" functions successfully as it should, as a parable. The film starts with a fade-in accompanied by music that would be welcome in a Schindler's List montage. We see Louise (Amy Adams) in silhouette before we are thrown into a whirlwind of memories. Louise welcomes a baby girl, Hannah, into the world. In a matter of a few minutes Hannah is 4, then 8, then on her deathbed at 12. We accompany Louise after these events in a mental fog. She is a professor of speech and linguistics at a local University but she seems detached. Before we see her enter her classroom we hear the clapping of running feet to groups clustered around televisions. Murmurings suggest something big, but Louise is slave to routine and continues to her nearly empty classroom. When prompted to turn on the news, she gets her first glimpse of the alien spacecraft. The next day she goes to work to find not only an empty class, but vacant University.Naturally, Louise is tapped by the government to communicate with the Montana based ship, and we begin to see the fear and immediacy employed by our own government. After the first meeting with these entities, it becomes apparent how quickly things could go wrong with even a minor slip of communication. As the fear rises, the faith in the rest of the world's competence plummets. The developments of Louise's crucial role in communicating with the aliens are something I can't spoil. The logic and brilliant examples used to guide us through this process is extraordinary.The style of the aliens and their ships, however, is not the show stealer. The ships look somewhere between a Reese's peanut butter egg, and a rock for a hot-stone massage. The aliens themselves can best be described as a Harry Potter dementor, sitting atop a face- hugger from ""Alien,"" all wrapped in elephant skin. The words these visitors ""write"" look like a language based on forgetting to use a coaster on a coffee table. The purpose for the ""look"" of these aliens is not visual appeal, but to illustrate exactly how foreign this species is from human.Performances by Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are an afterthought to the plot and protagonist. This is Louise's movie. Amy Adams has to play a role that juggles grief, fear, thrill, and urgency. This may sound like a heroine from many action films, but ""Arrival"" takes its time to allow us into her introspection. We feel her doubt and confusion as her perceptions of chronology and reality begin to make more and less sense simultaneously. A film that can feel this intimate on a global scale has to anchor itself on a relatable character. Her emotions are relatable, but her mind is leagues beyond. Half of what we understand, we get second-hand as she explains processes to other characters. The second half is much more profound. The endless possibilities that can be hypothesized and entertained make for a great exercise of the imagination. Just think how maddening it will be to successfully communicate these ideas to anyone else.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A tad over-rated,"The state of Montana is one of twelve places in the world where alien aircrafts have landed. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a renowned linguist who is recruited to study and interpret the language used by the aliens. She is assisted by a renowned scientist played by Jeremy Renner.""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" will likely always be the benchmark for this genre (UFOs, alien landings). ""Arrival"" is a competent film with fine moments but it doesn't feel engaging enough to fill its almost two hours. Indeed, the acting is good and the story is interesting though maybe a bit far-fetched. It also seems to borrow from ""Gravity"" in which the heroine has a similar difficult past.The photography of this film is usually in dark tones. The interior scenes always have different levels of darkness. The outdoors scenes are mostly night-time, nightfall, just before dawn, or overcast days. The choice of maintaining darkness is interesting but after a while, it tends to keep the viewer at a distance.SPOILER ALERTWell, it's sort of a spoiler. After the release of ""The Martian"" last year, someone astutely pointed out that that film and ""Gravity"" were big-budget Hollywood sci-fi films that involved international co-operation, especially from China, in the rescue attempts. This good image of China seemed to be a way to draw Chinese film-goers to the movie. In ""Arrival"", when it became apparent that China was, yet again, involved in an international effort, it was easy to predict one of the outcomes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One Of The Best Sci-Fi Movies Ever..With A Heart.,"Arrival is the story of Humanity's first contact with an alien species that shows itself by stationing twelve objects at different locations around the planet. Amy Adams is a linguist who is assigned to attempt communication with the aliens.There are many things I love about this movie. If this was a sci-fi book this would be called Hard Sci-Fi. Based somewhat in reality and real science. The story moves at its own pace. There is a definite tension throughout. But, along with that is a feeling of wonderment. How would we speak to alien species that has little or nothing in common with us? And, as the film's tagline asks, why are they here?There is little to no physical action in this film. There is violence, but it is off screen for the most part.. That being said, I never felt bored or lost. The story moves in the dialogue and the actions of the characters in the story. This is a smart movie. It doesn't spoon feed the audience with TOO many details or nuance. You may have to fill in a few holes with your imagination. Which, honestly, could hurt how someone feels about this movie.The plot moves very well leading into the finale. I was completely satisfied with the resolution/revelation at the end of the film. If you are expecting an alien mothership/ Death Star exploding action climax..you may be disappointed. But if something a bit more cerebral and heartfelt is more to your liking...you may be pleasantly surprised.Amy Adams is GREAT in her leading role as linguist Louise Banks. Her journey, physically, emotionally and mentally carries the movie. Jeremy Renner, Forrest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg all shine in their supporting roles.Besides Denis Villenueve's amazing directing ( He continues to impress after Enemy, Prisoners and Sicario) I have to give praise to Bradford Young's cinematography and Johann Johannsson's music. This is a beautiful film to look at and the soundtrack is stellar.Arrival, at the moment is tied for my favorite film of the year along with Moonlight. Two movies at first glance that may have nothing in common. But, on a deeper level they are two sides of a coin. The celebration of the human spirit and the ability, despite our flaws and foibles, to become something better than what we are.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"It was a perfect contact, but troubled at the communication.","The film was decent. Nowadays there are lots of altered versions coming that you won't easily say those are the remakes or reboots or spin- offs or whatever they call them in these days. Like 'Premotheus' to 'Alien', this film can remind you a few titles from the past, but 'Contact' is what the majority of us believes it got inspired.The eight Oscars nominees for the film is insane. I know some people liked it, and the film was good, that does not mean it is an Oscar product. I'm okay with the technical side recognition as it deserved that. So visually it was very good, but not a special effects extravaganza. Just a simple sci-fi drama, with a few thrills, particularly towards the end.When the unexpected visitors from the outer-space land their ships in the twelve different locations on the earth, the humans patiently try to communicate with them to learn their intentions. This story focused on the American soil, where experts are brought in to decode the alien language. How the rest of tale develops was told in the remaining parts.To me it smells like a trilogy. If not, it should be. I enjoyed it, mainly because of being a drama. Sci-fi is always associated with action, adventure and thriller, but this drama was something fresh as per todays computer graphics dominated cinema world. This is particularly for the family and older people like the grownups. Like I said the youngsters love action and violence. So it is a one time viewable film and you will get everything in that attempt itself.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Superb Sci-Fi Metadrama,"In American education, there has been much emphasis lately on the so-called STEM topics at the expense of the Humanities. We emphasize career-oriented education and neglect education that emphasizes human relationships. *Arrival* is a movie that consciously tries, if not to reverse the power relationship between Science and the Humanities, at least to show the fundamental importance of the latter through contemplating what it sees as the basic tool in human relationships--language.Of course, Science Fiction is the perfect genre for such an endeavor because its very name is a combination of the Sciences and the Humanities. If we posit that the strength of the Sciences is their predictive value (for example, repeated experiments lead to technology that can predict that an airplane will fly under certain physical conditions), *Arrival* shows that the Humanities have a predictive power of their own that has to do with relationships. The Fiction part of Science Fiction can predict, in a less formal and less easily understood way than Science predicts things, how relationships will function.Specifically, the film's protagonist, Louise Banks, a professor of linguistics played very sensitively by Amy Adams, uses her skill in language to chart a course through the complexities of relationships on all the levels a human might experience, from confronting the absolute other of an alien species to political relationships between different countries to her own relationship with her scientist husband and the daughter they create. In doing so, Louise becomes a metadramatic surrogate (metadrama is drama that reflects on itself as drama-- think Shakespeare's ""All the world's a stage"") for the creator of *Arrival* itself and a champion for the mysterious predictive power of Fiction in general.It does all of the above, as it must do to be effective, in a humanly compelling story conveyed through wonderful performances. That is what makes *Arrival* a great movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Science Fiction Masterpiece!,"Science Fiction started out as a thought provoking genre that explored mystery and possibility. Films were made to raise questions about the unknown... The audience was introduced to groundbreaking ideas. Over time, technology developed, and film-makers took advantage of that. We began to see fantastic looking, big-budget pictures that, while being a marvel to look at, lacked the intrigue and mystery that used to be so rich in Sci-fi. Sci-fi, for the most part, became dependent on flashy imagery as opposed to master story telling.Some films rose above this trend, and recently we have been given some great Sci-fi films. However, Arrival surpasses these and goes down as one of the greatest Science fiction films of all time.We are given a simple premise that we have seen in movies before. Alien space crafts land on earth and strike fear among the human race. As the film progresses, the story unravels slowly... and transitions into mind-bending, unconventional territory. It goes in a completely new direction that is eye-opening and moving. There are important themes and ideas exposed to us that grab our interest and do not let go. The story is beautifully complex, and challenges its audience to think.Visually, this film is breathtaking. The direction by Denise Vilineuve takes viewers to a new level of experiencing a film. Gorgeous cinematography and camera-work that is sometimes intimate, sometimes grand, and often unconventional, adding an experience that is both hauntingly surreal and authentic. The visual effects are almost perfectly executed, blending into the films dark, raw style.The script, equipped with realistic dialogue and deep character development, makes this film stand out. The characters interact with subtle authenticity that feels natural. However, the strongest point of the film is Amy Adams. She embodies a character that is so vulnerable yet convincingly strong-willed. Her performance is all about subtle realism. She has perfected the art of living through a character as opposed to forcing the character out. The film rests on her and she carries it beautifully. All the other actors give convincing performances as well, delivering their dialogue and interacting with each other in such a natural way.Arrival is a rare gem. It transcends beyond what an audience is used to experiencing. It is a film that cares about what it tells its viewers. It is a film with a purpose. Along with the classic and groundbreaking films of Kubric, Spielburg, Scott, and Lucas, Arrival is one of the best science-fiction movies ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Thoughtful and visceral in nearly every sense, Arrival makes for a breathtaking experience","Arrival is far from your average science-fiction thriller. From the cinematic brilliance of director Denis Villenueve who's proved himself as a stellar filmmaking talent in 'Enemy', 'Prisoners', and 'Sicario', comes an intelligent sci-fi piece that ditches the typical special-effects action extravagant tropes in favor for some thought-provoking conceptions and mesmerizing visual storytelling. His efforts all come down to a story of extraterrestrials paying Earth a visit, a typical concept that leads you to believe the world has an full-scale invasion on their hands. This film however, is not quick to jump on that train. Instead, we are granted with a more thoughtful and emotional story focused more on the curiosity of this shocking event than an epic explosion-heavy fight between the two different species many sci-fi fanatics are often accustomed to. So this film follows Dr. Louise Banks (played by Amy Adams), a linguist professor who arrives at her class when she hears the worldwide news of a dozen alien spacepods that have landed in different locations throughout the globe leading millions of people around the world spiraling in panic and China's military preparing for war. She is soon approached by Colonol Weber (played by Forest Whitaker) who enlists her to help communicate with the aliens. Tasked alongside Ian Donnelly (played by Jeremy Renner), her mission to communicate with the extraterrestrials becomes a search for answers of a question the whole world is asking: Why are they here?Slipping in some credible influences to earlier science-fiction outings such as Steven Spielberg's 'Close Encounters of The Third Kind' and Robert Zemeckis's 'Contact', Denis Villenueve takes on a slightly more daunting task of mixing the sci-fi genre with solid realism and cerebral narrative heft to feed the audience into something more grounded and mind-bending than a string of explosive action-set pieces. The plot sets in within the first minutes when we are introduced to see strange looking alien ships descend around the world, and the media struggles trying make sense of this occurrence as countries everywhere are consumed in uncertainty and pondering on whether to remain calm or take military action. The real tension begins however, when Amy Adams is ascended into an alien ship to come face-to-face with their aliens via window. We watch as the grotesque-looking creatures express their language through use of circular patterns created by oozing some sort of ink on the window, and the mystery Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are investigating on these weird symbols mean in attempt to discover what their innovations are for presence on Earth. These scenes are equally breathtaking and smart to the point leaving viewers squirming with both curiosity and fear, while embracing the visual resonance that defines the film's beauty. As the story goes on and the fate of humanity rest of the characters' shoulders, Villenueve drives it on an emotional atmosphere that demands the viewers for questions and provokes fear not from what we know, but what we don't know. This all comes down to a revelation that is not destined to be impressive, but at least smart in some degree.There is much more than the handy screenplay by Eric Heisserer that guides the film into a smart, mind-bending atmosphere, the film also boasts its visual beauty in the technical department. One of the major elements is the cinematography. Roger Deakins who flourished some dazzling cinematography in Denis Villenueve's previous outings 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' is sadly absent from this collaboration with Villenueve. Fortunately, his place substituted by Bradley Young who demonstrated some solid camera work in 'A Most Violent Year' and 'Selma', and his fine cinematography deliver some camera work that can falls nothing short of breathtaking. Capturing long lingering shots of the alien space pod floating above the ground, Young's cinematography grants use with an electrifying (and occasionally jarring) look at the atmosphere surrounding the space pod and the sight is incredibly beautiful to look at. Furthermore, it all feels very believable enough to where you can almost feel uncertainty of the characters as they approach the mysterious sightings. Lastly, one of the astounding aspects of the film is by far Amy Adams in the lead role. She delivers incredible humanity to the character to the point of not feeling like one, but a normal human being looking for answers. If you were dazzled by what we delivered in films like 'American Hustle' or 'The Master' Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker who step foot in the supporting are both very credible here as well, even though they don't veer to far in the spotlight as lead Amy Adams.Arrival is thoughtful science-fiction piece that blesses viewers with one of the most visceral cinematic experiences of the year, and shows director Denis Villenueve on the road to the front ranks of American filmmakers. Though the slow pace is enough to frustrate some movie goers looking for something more exciting and less busy with high-classed ideas, there is no doubt that this makes for a remarkable experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Five-Word Review: Intriguing, Well-acted, Thought-provoking: Solid Sci-fi","When aliens come to earth, what is to be done? Take a diplomatic and intelligent approach to it, that's what. No Emmerich-style bombast or global war, just top linguist Amy Adams and genius scientist Jeremy Renner helping the government figure out why they have arrived on earth. And this is what this film does best.In offering a fresh perspective on sci-fi, Arrival allows for a truly intriguing film which has the unusual distinction of feeling very original. The diplomacy and tentative contact between the aliens and the Adams/Renner combination of genii is the best thing in the film, and the best scenes all come when the pair are attempting to communicate, and decipher the aliens' own language.The acting from these two, especially Adams, is superb, allowing for a real emotional connection and investment in the characters. Overall it's a solid effort from Denis Vileneuve, better than 'Prisoners' though not as good as 'Sicario'. It is perhaps not quite as good as some of the furore may suggest, and the final third loses some focus and credibility, but it is still one of the best and most intelligent sci-fis in recent years, and definitely worth watching. 82/100.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the best I've seen in a while,"Arrival is the latest alien movie to be released, and it completely avoids clichés, which is a good thing. Instead of relying on science fiction cliché and formula, it tells a very original story about a linguistics professor (Amy Adams) and a scientist (Jeremy Renner) who interact with these aliens that have landed in 12 different spacecrafts all around the world. The movie is very well written and the acting is superb on the part of Adams, Renner, and Whitaker. The effects here are great, the aliens look very interesting and I loved the way they designed the spaceships. I especially liked how the aliens communicated, their language and how Adams worked to decode it will really keep your attention. Even if you are not a science fiction fan, you will still walk away loving this film because it's just a very well made film that makes you think.

"An emotionally, narratively and visually spectacular sci-fi drama.","Non-action science fiction films are becoming rarer than hen's teeth in mainstream cinema, usually skipping the big screen for a video-on-demand release due to their tight budgets. The one-two punch of this year's Midnight Special and Arrival will hopefully change that. Fresh off the modern masterpiece that is Sicario, director Denis Villeneuve again showcases his incredible talent by crafting a deeply thought-provoking motion picture that credits its audience with the sort of intelligence and maturity so few movies are willing to do. When alien spaceships appear in 12 random locations around the globe, the international community must band together to figure out who controls these vessels and, more importantly, what their purpose on Earth is. Enter Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams – amazing), a professor of language who is brought in to communicate with the extra-terrestrials aboard the spacecraft situated in Montana. Banks has her own personal problems though, with memories of her dead daughter permeating throughout her thoughts. These two coinciding plots are handled with immense care and precision, ultimately bringing an intense poignancy to the overall story that culminates in a fantastic final act twist. The unpredictability of the reveal is inarguably clever, but it's the extra layer of emotional depth it adds that really hits home. The imagery is spectacular too: the alien vessels are simple yet beautiful; the squid-like creatures are simultaneously frightening and graceful; and the gravity-defying environment inside the ship is presented with subtle wonder. The icing on the cake is the profound auditory experience that the film offers, with the glorious, otherworldly sound design and an affecting, sonorous score conducted by Jóhann Jóhannsson (whose Sicario score should've won the Oscar earlier this year). A contemplative movie that eschews big budget action for provocative musing, Arrival is a tense, emotional and utterly gripping sci-fi drama.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Ambiguous, unfulfilled, riddled with idealistic/philosophical messages, and tries too hard to be thought-provoking.","If you didn't like Villeneuve's critically acclaimed Enemy, chances are you didn't like Arrival either. For something packaged as a Sci-fi blockbuster, Arrival is really good at building up the audience's expectation for a satisfying climax using established alien-invasion tropes. However, the movie then proceeds to completely shatter this expectation with an anti-climactic and overtly philosophical ending.The recent trend toward a more realistic, darker and philosophical take of the Sci-fi genre is welcoming, but this doesn't mean philosophical abstractions and not-so-obvious political and social commentaries are good substitutes for a fulfilling story. Unfortunately, this is exactly what Arrival is. The movie's premise is good, the mysterious atmosphere in its first half is fantastic, but a climax composed mostly of rather forced philosophical messages simply left me disappointed. Similarly, I imagine some Sci-fi fans who went into the theatre expecting to be entertained and thrilled came out confused and unfulfilled.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A thoughtful, haunting take on a familiar story - with layers to explore","I didn't realise this was such a dark film. Seeing it in the cinema on release I had been so overwhelmed by the sound, the cinematography and Amy Adams's mesmeric performance that this passed me by. I'm not talking about tone, of course; this films ends in a place of hope and invitation. I mean in light levels. Most - or all? - of the exterior scenes of the film take place in shadows, or with the sun evidently just one side of the horizon or the other. Interiors are low lit also; I notice two exceptions - the spotlight shone from a helicopter in to Amy Adams's face when Forest Whitaker returns to pick her up in the early stages of the story, the second towards the film's end, when the whole screen is bathed in white smoke as one character goes behind the screen that had separated people from the alien visitors up to that point. It all points to a person - and a human race - living in the half-light of partial understanding; unaware that there's a light that can be turned on until someone (or something else) does it instead.In many respects this film tells a familiar story of alien first contact with earth, and tells it as a thoughtful drama rather than an action spectacular. Like many science-fiction stories, this is one concerned with how we as a species and as individuals understand ourselves, and how we conceive of 'the other' - whether that's people or beings different to us, or God. It's certainly the case that even on the small screen this is a film that's deeply effective in evoking a sense of wonder; it may only be just over 30 minutes in to the film when we first see the aliens, but the lighting, the camera's repeated reminding us of Amy Adams's aloneness, the sound design and the remarkable score all evoke a sense of encounter with something that is truly different, alien in every sense of the word.Amy Adams's performance is towering; she seems to be on screen for at least 95% of the run time; for much of that time we seem to be following her from behind or looking in to her face, a face blessed with the ability to express volumes. This film was always going to stand or fall on her performance; as a result, it stands very tall indeed.The film initially sets itself up as a struggle between science (in the shape of Jeremy Renner's character, a theoretical physicist) and language (Amy Adams); but it becomes more than that. Breakthrough in communication with the aliens is only achieved when Adams, followed by Renner, break out of the strict, rigid almost ritualistic structures laid down by science and the military; maybe it's because I'm a priest and I was watching it in Holy Week, that I saw more than a hint of a reference to the curtain in the temple, separating people from God, through which only one priest could go and which was torn in two by Jesus' crucifixion.There's something in that, however. So often words and laboratories, religion and science, mind and heart are pitted against each other. In Arrival we see the fruit of something else; something the film calls a 'non-zero sum' game, a movement beyond linear, binary thinking in to something more fluid, more supple. If moving beyond the boundaries laid down by military and science gives humanity a breakthrough in communicating with the aliens, it's a departure from conventional 'zero sum', straight line thinking that is the key to the whole mystery and crisis that forms the heart of the film.Like Arthur C Clarke's classic 1950s novel Childhood's End (clearly an influence on both this film and its source text), the vision of humanity presented could easily be something so optimistic and naive as to be of no use. Certainly that's where Childhood's End left me; but I felt differently on rewatching Arrival. Of course, right and wrong, truth and falsehood and many others are binaries we need - too much blurring of the lines leaves with an epidemic of uncertainty and fake news. This time around, however, I was reminded of how I characterise my own thinking as someone with ADD and two learning disabilities; not neuro-typical, I guess you would say. I say that I don't think in straight lines; I think in blobs. Then I try to string the blobs together, make connections in order to form coherent thought and output (or not ... ). Straight lines can be helpful; but I find it very difficult to follow them.A valuing of intuitive, relational thinking can also make us a bit more humble, a little less keen to make it all about us. Especially useful when it comes to the 'other' - the other person, culture, lifestyle or God. Trying to build bridges with something or someone utterly different to us needs more than a straight line-rationale; it needs a humble willingness to take the long, winding road of presence, listening and submission. When it comes to God, it comes with the awareness that we can't build the bridge ourselves; we have to accept that all our rationality will only get us so far, and instead accept the invitation to the humble submission of walking across a bridge which we had no hand in building - and which for much of the time, we can't see the other side of, or even much more than a step or two in front of us.Arrival, in the form of Amy Adams's portrayal of a linguistics expert learning a new of way of speaking and thinking, presents us with a humbling invitation to engagement with others and the Other; a vision which requires us to step beyond the straight lines we naturally default to, a commitment to the long and winding road of another's design. It is in the letting go that we take up, the losing that we find, the dying that we live.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Lets communicate E.T.,"""Remember what happened to the aborigines. A more advanced race nearly wiped them out.""Science fiction is a genre that leaves room for ideological visions and fictional future scenarios. A technological fantasy story, as it were. In ""Arrival"" this is more applicable on a human level. In this case it's the effort of humanity to communicate with an alien civilization. That's fiction enough already. We're not even capable of communicating with each other as humans in a decent manner. Let alone with an alien race that speaks with the use of primal sounds. It's like having a conversation with a group of surreal musicians who produce ingenious sound effects with polyphonic synthesizers. ""Arrival"" isn't overloaded with graphical masterpieces what an average person would expect to see in a SF. No huge spaceships propelling through galaxies. There are no enormous space wars taking place with massive laser battles. No, just 12 black spacecraft, looking like huge black cashew nuts, floating seemingly motionless a few meters above the earth's surface, spread all over our globe.The central theme is the almost impossible task to establish a communication between humans and aliens. This mission is being led by the linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) together with the mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). For them it's a real challenge to fathom the semantics used by these aliens and to interpret the sprayed circles (with extraterrestrial ink), produced by the tentacles of the octopus-like aliens. And next to that, her work is also hampered by recurring memories of her deceased daughter.You could conclude very quickly that this would constitute a slow and über-serious science fiction. A film to which literary scholars would respond rather enthusiastically. But believe me, ""Arrival"" is so ingeniously constructed and compelling that your attention won't slack for a moment. Even if a Masai warrior would perform a ""jumping dance"" next to your couch. First there's the melodramatic beginning with a brief, modest overview of Louise's life and where fate hits merciless hard. Then we move on to the section where the visitors are introduced and Louise's help is asked so she would give these, as immigrants considered newcomers, an integration course. The fact that only the US apparently are open to a dialogue while other countries, such as China and Russia, would rather shoot these coffee beans to smithereens, is in my opinion a romanticizing of our current global situation.The emphasis is on the educational aspect with Louise and Donnelly working against the clock and trying to start a dialogue. Meanwhile we see flashbacks about Louise's daughter. A major event that runs like a thread through the film. However, when the disclosure becomes clear, the message behind the whole turns out to be much larger than the seemingly simplistic story-line. When the true reason for the alien is revealed and the implications get clearer, the film takes on a whole different meaning. ""Arrival"" is a SF with a philosophical slant that'll give you food for thought. Ultimately communicating is the central message in itself. And this on all areas. Hats off to those aliens. They made this miserable long trip just to point this out to us humans. Way to go.""Arrival"" isn't an action packed Sci-fi full of impressive CGI. But on the other hand, the shown images are incredibly beautiful. The concise fictional elements look minimalistic and at the same time amazing. Such as the entering of the spacecraft with it's tilting, confusing gravity. The mood of this film is immersive. And this also thanks to the supporting soundtrack. Add to that the rather superb performances and a thoughtful script, and you'll get a great movie. ""Arrival"" is not an exceptional SF, but still manages to impress thanks to a masterful concept. Villeneuve-worthy in other words.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Great sci-fi but why the polarizing geo politics?,"I liked the concept, storyline, production, execution but why oh why are the Chinese and Russians yet again the geo political bad guys? Why not just make a great sci-fi without politics?",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This movie is a masterpiece,"Arrival has a very small story which is also very tricky in the details. Stories like these are very difficult to work with. Villenueve presented in a even more complicated way. CGI, actors, acting, background score, everything is good and meet his work's standards I suppose. But this movie was all about his perspective. The movie jumps between different levels constantly and towards the end all the jumps are perfectly justified. If someone watched the movie really with all their attention, they will be mesmerized in the end with all the revelations and connections. For me this movie was a really complicated work of art which i solved, so it felt good. Highly recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Outside the box,"I've seen many ""alien"" movies in my time but this one is quite unique, it sums up for me what I think would happen if aliens came to earth. The story is a beautiful one, although somewhat somber at times. I was mostly impressed by the imagination used to create language; many writers have created languages for many of reasons, however this really takes our understanding of language outside the box, to try and create a believable non human communication system. It was also very well shot, and perfectly paced. Definitely underrated.Did not see that ending coming mine, ooof!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
good not great,"I was pretty turned off on this movie right out of the gate. It starts like a student film. With a really amateurish juxtaposition of someone 'saying' their emotions. If you have ever been to a student film fest you know what I mean. It was only missing a segment of sloppily putting makeup on to really nail that vibe. Then it gets better, mostly because Forest Whitaker shows up. Amy Adams does her usual great job. As does Jeremy Renner. And the story itself is very good. However the execution was just so gosh dang twee and precious. If you take away the foreboding alien ship and its occupants you have a pile of breathy flashbacks and washed out visuals. Don't get me wrong, I am not expecting every sci-fi film to be Rogue One. However the great core ideas of this story are underutilized. While this could have been a fascinating movie, it is instead boring. I could take the slow pace and precious presentation, if there was something in the way of character development. But beyond Amy Adams character everyone else are just cardboard cutouts that provide utilitarian roles. Even Renner and Whitaker. Maybe in 10-15 years someone will remake this into a decent film?I wonder if the director likes science fiction at all, or is just under contract.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

If Carlsberg made sci-fi movies.....,"I first saw this movie on Netflix in 2017 and initially thought it was probably the best Sci-fi movie I have ever had the pleasure of watching.

Beautiful SF movie,"I had a great experience, a visually beautiful film. I didn't watch the trailers at all, I avoided the spoilers, and the film went in a completely different direction from my expectations. And he totally surprised me and impressed me. A SF film with minimal use of CGI these days certainly deserves applause. The focus is on the story and the protagonists. The film is the total opposite of Independence Day. And then there's the plot twist, which I didn't even think of, and which is why you look at the whole movie with different eyes. Denise, every part of this accomplishment, bow to the floor. For all those who say that films are not made today as before, they obviously did not look at this top achievement. And now I wonder, isn't this the meaning of film, ie film experience? Don't watch 34 trailers that either reveal too much and ruin the viewing or misrepresent the movie and ruin the viewing. Watch visually beautiful movies, but put the emphasis on the characters and the story, not the effects. That feeling when you watch a movie and even a few days after that you think about it.

A weak imitation of Nolan's works,"The first hour of the movie is boring and doesn't have much to say. It remains the last 50 minutes, which does not have much to say except the last 20 minutes, which is the climax of the film and is made in the style of Christopher Nolan's works to arouse the audience and a sense of surprise through parallel editing and music. Amy Adams is good, but Jeremy Renner is a disaster and does not resemble a scientist in any way. On the other hand, the time of the film is too long compared to the story, and this has caused the slowness of the film's rhythm. It would be better if the movie was an hour and a half.

But also the storytelling pattern, the soundtrack, the general vibe.This movie reminds me of Jonathan Glazer's under the skin. Just only with a much smaller budget but the picture the directors wanted to create of the aliens, are quite similar in my opinion.This is art. Hats off to the director.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Interdependence Day,"As Amy Adams' opening voice-over speaks in sad lyrical strokes, and director Denis Villenueve's lens slides slowly through her empty home, and Johann Johannson's mournful music breathes in the background, we know we're not watching Independence Day.Adams plays Louise, a linguist seemingly grieving for her daughter. Louise is last to know that twelve colossal spacecraft have entered the Earth's atmosphere and are now hovering in various locations around the globe. Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker), who has a bit of previous with Louise, invites her to join a team who will enter one of the alien crafts and try to communicate with them.The rest of the movie is set largely in a military base in the shadow of the alien craft. The camera meekly moves beneath the huge hovering object, as if anxiously averting its eyes. The sense of awe is palpable and appropriate, filling the audience with a thrilling dread as the crew creep – and float – inside. The sparse design of the alien ship interior is fantastically foreboding, and the form of its pilots is convincing in its otherworldliness. I won't describe them; I'll just say they're named ""heptapods"".The humans attempt to communicate. While Louise uses words and gestures, the heptapods rely on a kind of hieroglyphic language made from ejected ink. It's pleasingly weird and graceful. These first encounters are the most engaging, successfully giving the sense of an impenetrable barrier between species.Fans of modern epic sci-fi won't be bowled over by the core message, but I won't name names for fear of giving away the mildest of surprises.The sombre colour-drained style may be standard these days, but Villenueve contrasts it effectively with Louise's memories of her daughter. The editing throughout the film is textured and nuanced, even if it does collapse into a malaise of generalised Big Feelings in the end. Still, the quality of craftsmanship and the doomy style bode well for the director's upcoming Blade Runner sequel.For all the heavyweight actors, the supporting characters – from the gruff, pragmatic military leader to the slimy CIA suit – are stock for the genre. Adams is typically soulful and skillful, while Renner, to his credit, tries his best in a role written to be playful, except he's under the thrall of a director who doesn't really do play.Arrival isn't completely cohesive. There's some of the hard sci-fi slog of The Andromeda Strain, but also the socially conscious grandstanding of The Day the Earth Stood Still. Both are great movies (and both by Robert Wise) – but are they great bedfellows?Tonally I was reminded of Another Earth, a similarly mournful, cerebral sci-fi movie with a metaphysical twist. But that movie wore its melon-twisting conceit on its sleeve, as opposed to the Nolan- esque puzzle box narrative gradually unveiled in Arrival. As twists go, this one is ambitious: a clever cop-out or a mind-expanding revelation depending on taste. Your capacity for feeling moved may depend on your feelings about the bow-wrapped ending of Interstellar.Along with Interstellar, a major touchstone is Robert Zemeckis's Contact, which also focused on a passionate female protagonist driven by grief. Contact's depiction of an invaded world swallowing itself whole through reactionary insanity was more fun and more convincing, although I guess the overblown public reaction in Arrival may speak more to the current feverish state of US politics.Arrival suffers from many familiar elements, and a script that can't match the sumptuous visual style, the committed performances, or the unique production design. Perhaps a little more lightness of touch may have alleviated the slippery slope of the film's neat-yet- divisive second half. But there's no denying that this is impressive, technically astounding filmmaking with an unapologetic intention to awe. Worth seeing – and worth seeing BIG.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly heartbreaking- but excellent film,"I'm quite surprised Amy Adams was not at least nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars for this performance. She delivers a believable, and flawless performance in this film about communication between humans and extraterrestrials who randomly show up on our planet without any explanation.The extraterrestrials were very intriguing- they look unlike any other aliens in any other film I've seen. This is also your atypical alien film, because it's not about them wanting to eradicate the human race, but instead... they want to communicate.Synopsis: Amy Adams plays Louise, who is a college professor of linguistics. After the extraterrestrial ships show up all over the world, hovering above the ground, the US forces ask Louise to assist in speaking with them to find out why they're here.Ian, played by Jeremy Renner, is a scientist who assists Louise in communicating with these new beings on planet earth.What Louise discovers is an intricate language that expands beyond the normal limits of time. The aliens show Louise things about the future she had never expected, and she learns she must decide on her future, despite knowing things no one would ever want to know.The acting, the visuals and the cinematography, and especially the music in this film all come together to create a visual masterpiece. It's an unforgettable film that should definitely go down as a modern classic and one of Amy Adams best performances.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Villeneuve has proven time and time again his ability to craft incredible, moving, and thought-provoking stories that keep you engaged the entire time.

In an amazingly emotional scene, Villeneuve ties together the themes of parenting and making devastating choices. The acting is top tier with Amy Adams stealing the show. Visually striking and ominous, Arrival's tone is perfect in every scene being further heightened by the eerie and beautiful soundtrack.

Robert Zemeckis's Contact (1997) would not be very far either, because Arrival also focuses on fragile yet brave female protagonist whose quality acting is one of the main pillars carrying the whole experience.

The big reveal about him at the end was totally nonsensical, much less clarifying. Plot points were treated like the mother's breast cancer in The Room (which was, in my opinion, much more entertaining than Arrival).

The Aliens Are Here. Now what?,"Thought provoking? Certainly. Deliberately paced and quiet in its intensity? Absolutely. In the end, though, ""Arrival"" is about perception. How we relate to the reality around us, and how we interact with others is defined by our view of existence. Perception is the foundation upon which communication rests. We cannot understand someone else when their perspective is foreign to us. For example, I'm an American. When I talk about aspects of our society that are uniquely ours, those with no experience with those aspects simply won't understand what is really meant if I say that ""Dave stole 2nd base."" A person with no exposure to the sport of baseball would think that Dave was a thief. Imagine, then, how would we learn to communicate with extra terrestrial beings who have absolutely no relationships with those things that are a part of the human experience? How to work around the differences in perception between homo sapiens and none terrestrial alien visitors lies at the heart of ""Arrival.""In the film, Amy Adams stars in the role of a world class linguist, Dr. Louise Banks. Jeremy Renner co-stars as physicist Dr. Ian Donnely. The two are tasked by the military to figure out how to communicate with aliens who've come to Earth, specifically to Montana and 11 other locations around the globe. All the countries where the aliens have appeared work simultaneously to decipher the alien language, but it is Dr. Banks who makes the most progress as the film moves along. I don't want to say anything more about the plot of the film, as to do so would give away those things that should come as a surprise to viewers.The film is directed by Denis Villeneuve, who also directed the 2015 film ""Sicarro"" among others. Besides Adams and Renner, other featured players in the film include Forest Whitaker (as Colonel Weber) and Tzi Ma (as Chinese general Shang). ""Arrival"" is based on a short literary work by Ted Chiang called ""Story of Your Life"". I have not read the story so cannot compare it with film.""Arrival"" is one of those movies that asks questions that apply not only to what would really happen if aliens came here, but how such a visitation might actually change the world in a remarkable and profound manner. In ""Arrival,"" though, there are more questions than answers. The reason for that is to make sure the audience tries to answer those questions for themselves. It is only through our own reflection that we truly find any answers that have meaning, after all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Arrival released a couple of years ago, I remember I watched it first on Plane from Istanbul to Frankfurt and was to tired to follow.
Now we have the year 2020, the corona lockdown gave us more time than we need to finish our watchlist and so it was time for Arrival.
it is not easy to tell how brilliant this movie is without Spoiler anything.
The music is deeply sad and lovable combined with the pictures and the arty storytelling of Dennis Villeneuve it will suck you right in and you have no chance of release before the end credits roll over your TV screen.
I know the most of us expect a ScFi flick with Aliens and Soldiers and saving the world stuff like so many times before, but here is much more under the surface.
It is a melodramatic palindrome that will you make think days after you have watched it, and delivers a powerful message about the importance of Communication.
Time is non-linear as this picture portrays.
In it's all simplicity it gives you an infinite possibility of past, present and future.

A Very Interesting Movie,"This movie feels like the Death Stranding of the movie industry. It's not an adventure, it's not an action, it's an experience.If you want to make a great movie you have to use the guns, the explosions, the battles, the fights, the roads, the movement. But this movie proves it isn't. How exciting can a movie be about trying to communicate with aliens? Well it is. The movie is like a complete puzzle, but you don't understand it very well. It also has a great background. Some people may not like that the movie is more personal than it should be, but sometimes you just need heroes, I guess.The movie chooses a simple cinematography with aliens, not technology that you might not understand. It's just a simple spaceship, and the interior is even simpler.

"Arrival is Superb Science Fiction, and More","Science fiction often works best when used as an allegory or a metaphor, compelling the viewer to become a participant in the story, and to examine his or her own feelings or reactions to the drama on screen or a similar situation which might be occurring in society.In Paramount Pictures' Arrival, released Friday, a linguist and a theoretical physicist are recruited by US military intelligence when twelve interplanetary vehicles appear simultaneously around the world. The objective of the two civilians is to discern the intentions of the alien visitors, in order that the country is able to respond appropriately. The mission becomes even more critical when the other countries hosting the unexpected visitors begin to react to them with hostility.Arrival was adapted by screenwriter Eric Heisserer from author Ted Chiang's award-winning novella Story of Your Life, which successfully interwove sentiment and science fiction with the notion that the course of one's life is pre-determined prior to birth. That Heisserer's previous screen writing credits are mostly in peripheral horror pictures such as Lights Out and entries in the Nightmare on Elm Street and Final Destination canons does not necessarily give the viewer an accurate idea of what to expect from Arrival.Which is to say, the picture works beautifully on all levels. Denis Villeneuve, the director of last year's superb international crime drama Sicario, works with Heisserer to lead the picture with humanity, allowing the science fiction elements to follow in a more effective fashion. Arrival with its complex structure lends credibility to a story which in more sensational hands might've become just another lurid interplanetary shoot-'em-up. As in Chiang's novella, two stories are told simultaneously, but flow together easily and effortlessly to create one large picture.And the picture's casts works with intelligence and a quiet forcefulness to deliver the message. Amy Adams is a remarkably talented actress who always seems to be standing just short of major international superstardom. Usually found delivering rich and credible performances in movies as diverse as American Hustle and Man of Steel, The Muppets and Disney's Enchanted, Adams as the linguist in Arrival delivers an eminently believable performance in a difficult role which might well be her most multi-dimensional and emotionally-invested characterization to date.At the time she's persuaded by the government to help determine the intentions of the visitors, Adams' Dr. Louise Banks is recovering from an acutely vulnerable point in her life, unknowing that the very sensitivity caused by a recent devastating experience will provide the key to her ability to communicate with the visitors.Adams gives persuasive voice to the languages and technical jargon required of the role, but allows her eyes to wordlessly convey a sense of wounded humanity. The viewer feels her emotional pain, and as a result not only wants to see her succeed in her mission, but also is willing to work along with her in order to do so. Intense concentration is required from both the actress and the viewer to realize the picture's considerable impact.Jeremy Renner, an underrated actor often found performing in action adventures and comic book adaptations, contributes a previously untapped dimension of bemused authority to his role. As the theoretical physicist working alongside Adams' linguist to interpret the intentions of the alien visitors, Renner does not simply don a pair of eyeglasses to suggest intelligence. Instead, in a role which might've become cartoonish or showy in less-capable hands, Renner works with quiet determination and sly humor to fashion from his role a characterization as vivid as Heisserer's screenplay allows.Equally persuasive is the always-reliable Forest Whitaker as the US military intelligence colonel who recruits both Adams and Renner to communicate with the otherworldly guests. Whitaker with his sleepy-eyed, good-natured countenance has often during his long career worked successfully as men of conscience struggling to comprehend a difficult situation before erupting into impulsive action.In Arrival Whitaker delivers another such characterization, and more. I found myself wishing Whitaker had more screen time, but such a wish seems to occur every time he appears in a picture. It's difficult to believe Forest Whitaker's been in films long enough to have delivered finely-crafted performances in such motion picture classics as Platoon and The Color of Money, as well as the title roles of Lee Daniels' The Butler, The Last King of Scotland and Clint Eastwood's Bird, the latter two of which earned him Academy Award recognition.Arrival represents the entire array of contributing artists working at peak performance, on all levels. The ultimate messages of the picture—that we're all here to help each other, every experience is a good one, and time is all we have—are a hopeful antidote to the pessimism if our times.Science fiction, when it works well, adapts itself to the age and allows the viewer to interpret the message in his or her own way. The Thing from Another World, It Came from Outer Space and several other alien invasion pictures of the 1950s mirrored the us-versus-them hostility of the post-World War II era. Invasion of the Body Snatchers in 1956 showed us the futility of McCarthyism and the Communist Witch-Hunt. And television's beloved Star Trek and The Twilight Zone during the 1960s mirrored in any number of episodes the dichotomy of advanced civilization juxtaposed with the intolerance and hostility of the times.It'll be interesting to learn the reaction to Arrival, with its message of cooperation, during a period in time when much of our world seems to be building walls of hostility rather than bridges of communication.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

An Affecting Tale of Humanity and Compassion,"I've been looking forward to this film since I read Eric Heisserer's screenplay nearly four years ago, previously titled STORY OF YOUR LIFE and adapted from Ted Chiang's short story of the same name. It was the first time I ever cried while reading a script, so to say I was worried the film wouldn't surpass my highest expectations would be an understatement. As you can tell from my rating, I absolutely loved ARRIVAL. It's easily one of the best films of the year and one of the most affecting sci-fi films I've ever seen.I've been a staunch supporter of Heisserer ever since I read his script, but back then, people only knew him for the A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET remake, THE THING prequel, and (the surprisingly good) FINAL DESTINATION 5. Since then, he's proved himself of being a capable writer with HOURS and this year's LIGHTS OUT. But it's with ARRIVAL that shows how skillful Heisserer really is, and I think it's time we finally give him the credit he deserves... I guess having Denis Villeneuve direct your script and Amy Adams deliver a powerhouse performance doesn't hurt either.With that said, I went into the film viewing it on a level most others wouldn't have until their second viewing. Despite knowing where the story was headed, the film remained compelling and emotionally involving throughout its runtime, and I cried buckets by the end of it. ARRIVAL is a thoughtful, poignant, and heady piece of work. It respects the audience's intelligence to put the pieces together themselves and involves themes regarding humanity and compassion that's very relevant, especially in the past few days. Overall, Denis Villeneuve continues to deliver stellar work, Amy Adams' subtle but captivating performance will move you, and Eric Heisserer proves to the world everyone should be paying attention to him.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Nice movie,"I like... its a good movie with a creative plot HUMAN communication is a tricky proposition. Even assuming that folks share the same language-out of the over 6,500 languages currently spoken on this planet-the chances for misstatements and misunderstandings are shockingly high. In texts, emails, phone calls, video conferences, and even face-to-face, people manage to blow their chances to meaningfully connect with their own species more frequently than any of us would like to admit.But what if you weren't trying to communicate with another human, but rather with a completely alien species from another planet? This is an issue science fiction has considered for a very long time. And yet, when it comes to film, first-contact communication has generally been, to use an American vernacular phrase, a piece of cake.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

If not anchored by such a strong performance by Amy Adams, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did.

An Intelligent Sci-Fi Thriller.,"Arrival is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Michael Stuhlbarg, Forest Whitaker, Mark O'Brien, Abigail Pniowsky, Tzi Ma, Jadyn Malone and Julia Scarlett Dan.A linguist is recruited by the military to assist in translating alien communications.With Sicario, Prisoners, Enemy and Incendies bringing his unique flair to the spotlight, Villeneuve takes on a new genre; Sci-Fi. This isn't your typical action-packed science fiction movie, this is an intelligent look at how we as human beings could interact with alien life.Amy Adams delivers a refreshingly relatable and emotional performance, with great depth and charisma. Jeremy Renner stars alongside Adams, presenting a new side to his acting abilities which strays away from his action hero characteristic. As the story flows consistently, so does the editing. With 'dream-like' scenes being used thoughtfully throughout to aid Adams' performance and overall character arc. Joe Walker proved himself worthy when he worked with Villeneuve on Sicario, presenting his distinctive skill, and so he shines furthermore with Arrival.The original score by Jóhann Jóhannsson is subtle in approach, yet intricate in detail. The introduction to the alien life-form is handled perfectly, using Jóhann's unique composition and eerie writing to punctuate the unusual entity. Having worked with Villeneuve before on Sicario and Prisoners, the familiarity is present, touching on the sparse and complex sound design that featured before. Highlighting the beautifully dark 'Heptapod B' which utilises unintelligible vocal lines, further exploring and expanding upon his talent. This sets Jóhannsson apart from all other film composers and has become one of the most influential people for me personally.Something that's always been so wonderfully attached to Villeneuve's work is the cinematography, which in Arrival, is undeniably beautiful. The locations and landscapes are captured with absolute care and provide a remarkable canvas for the story to be told. The special and visual effects are also appreciable and showcase an unearthly visual design for the extraterrestrial beings. There's one shot that gave me a quick flashback to the final scene in Enemy, which I won't go into. Bradford Young encapsulates this skilfully.The art direction, set decoration and production design is fluent and feels authentic. Everyone involved has done an incredible job to provide a genuine backdrop for Villeneuve and team to work in. I'd also like to share my appreciation for the sound department. Dave Whitehead, who has quite an impressive CV, has created an entangled and twisted language for the aliens, only to be experienced in theatres.Verdict; Arrival is not an action-packed Independence Day. This is a carefully constructed and well-directed story that keeps you thinking way beyond the closing credits. Denis Villeneuve's winning streak lives on.Arrival, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Fantastic movie about humanity,"I've never written a review on this site, but I've also never seen a movie like this, so I had to make an exception. I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked into this movie, and I was a little bit hesitant to see it. However, this is one of the most thought-provoking and emotional movies that I've ever seen. While the main plot concerns itself with the arrival of aliens on Earth, the movie never resorts to mindless scenes of action to entertain the viewer or add suspense. The writing and characters provide all of the emotional suspense that a person can handle. I found myself invested in the fate of the characters more than the threat of aliens. Without spoiling anything, the movie contains a twist that changes everything that you think you understand about the movie. The movie never holds your hand and respects the viewer enough to make their own decisions about the themes portrayed in the movie. I've never seen anything like this, and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to experience a movie that will explore complex themes in an approachable and understandable way. P.S.

"Thoughtful, contemplative...and boring","Do you see the contemplative, deep-thinking looks on the faces of Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner in the publicity still pictures from the new Alien landing film ARRIVAL?  Well, if  you go to this film, get ready to see this look on these (and all actors) over and over and over again.ARRIVAL has been called, by some, a ""thinking person's"" Science Fiction film.  Be aware that this is code for ""boring"".  There is precious little action punctuated by long passages of thinking and pondering.ARRIVAL tells the tale of what happens once an Alien spacecraft arrives on this planet.  Linguist Dr. Louise Banks (Adams) is brought in in an attempt to communicate with these Aliens.  Can she correctly interpret the intentions of the Aliens - friendly or hostile - before someone can mis-interpret and start a war?Adams has been getting Oscar buzz for this performance and I just don't see it.  Her Dr. Banks is taciturn, thoughtful and contemplative - qualities that Adams is very good at representing on screen with a look on her face.  This is good because Director Denis Villeneuve asks her to do this over and over again, in almost every scene.  Adams is joined in contemplation by Jeremy Renner (as a Theoretical Physicist) and Forest Whitaker (as the Military man in charge).  The three of them try to bring some life to the screen, but Director Villeneuve clearly wants us all to think about events in the film and come to our own conclusion.  Normally, this is fine with me, but in this film, it just makes this 1 hour 54 min film seem much, much longer.This film reminded me of riding a roller coaster - kind of.  The part of the roller coaster when you are slowly climbing the hill to start the ride, but, when we reached the top, the ride ended.  We were sent home to think about what it all means rather than enjoy the ride back down the hill.Ultimately, this film was a real departure in Science Fiction and I applaud Villeneuve, Adams et. al for attempting it.  I just wish the end result was worthy of all the ""deep thoughts"" that went into it.6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A good example of the thinking man's science fiction film. Early review.,"Arrival may be marketed as a creepy alien invasion movie, but rest assured, Arrival has more in common with offerings such as 1951's The Day the Earth Stood still, Contact or The Man from Earth than it does ID4, or something of that ilk.Arrival is the newest output from Denis Villanueve, if you are not familiar with his work, think of Christopher Nolan, if Nolan knew how to compose a beautiful shot and write endings.Amy Adams stars as the brainy linguist, brought in by Uncle Sam to attempt to figure just how in the hell to communicate with the alien race, who have inexplicably appeared out of the night and seem to be happy to more or less loiter in a number of creepy looking spacecrafts all over the planet.To get into plot points would be quite spoilery and therefore we'll suffice it to say that Arrival is a brilliantly crafted film with visually arresting camera work and a haunting score.At this point I'm comfortable in placing it into the top 5 of 2016.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"OK, but not an 8.5","Being a sci-fi guy who loves serious, well-conceived sci-fi (e.g. Interstellar, Battlestar Galactica (new one), Inception, The Martian, 2001, 2010, etc.) I saw this the first week out. And given the 8.5 rating and the director's previous work (Sicario, Prisoners) I fastened my seat belt for an intense ride, but alas, I almost needed a seat belt to keep from sliding out of my seat during the late evening showing. In fact, my wife did go to sleep on it. OK, so does that mean Arrival is a boring movie? For me, no, I appreciate elaborate, fairly plausible detail to create a story with authenticity that increases its impact.But, given my expectations going in (Sicario was a very intense, wild ride and Prisoners was also a white-knuckler) so I was surprised at the deliberate and ponderous pacing, which mixed with the disjointed narrative, never create any real narrative momentum--even at the end when it's time for a climax/crisis. By then, we're trying to get our bearings and decide if we care enough about the story and the protagonists.So, I would definitely classify this one as for sci-fi nerds only. Not bragging, but I also earned an MA in linguistics, so I was familiar with the overarching concept undergirding the story, which makes it intellectually interesting but ... Still, I found it to be a movie that needs some re-editing and more oomph!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the greatest pieces of modern science fiction,"As someone who has a great deal of affection for slower, more thoughtful science fiction, this film is about as great a piece of modern science fiction storytelling as possible.To begin, this is a Denis Villeneuve film. And, like all of his films, it is a movie which is first and foremost concerned with its characters and how the circumstances and overall narrative affect those characters. This isn't some big, dumb alien invasion film like an Independence Day which is interested first and foremost in using the characters as nothing more than tools with which to arrive at the action set pieces. Arrival is a very realistic and thoughtful take on the idea of a first contact scenario which any fan of classic Star Trek would appreciate.And with that all said, the story told here is fantastic. It manages to perfectly balance the necessary technical knowledge and political conflicts which involve the characters while never losing sight of Amy Adams and her expectedly wonderful portrayal of the main character, Louise. And the supporting cast, from Jeremy Renner as the affable Ian to Tzi Ma's subtle gravitas as General Shang, carry their weight across the board. And all of that culminates in a narrative about communication and the power of communication both with the unique, if not a bit Lovecraftian, heptapods and why they've arrived on earth and between ourselves in what serves as a very Star Trekian lesson regarding human nature and the socio-political and ethical challenges and consequences of a first contact scenario. All the while telling a very grounded, emotional story with a well delivered twist that lends more heart to this one film than some filmmakers manage in a career. The screenplay is, from beginning to end, a razor sharp exploration of its material both intellectually and emotionally.Add to this some truly breathtaking visuals, splendid cinematography from Mr. Bradford Young, and the direction of one of the greatest filmmakers of our day and you've got what could easily become a modern sci-fi classic. It certainly is to me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the best movies of 2016,Arrival is undoubtedly one of my favourite movies of 2016. It is very hard not to imagine what would happen in real life if we were visited by space ships from another planet. The scenario that plays out in the movie certainly seems plausible.Amy Adams is cast as Louise Banks who is a leading linguist that is brought onto the military operation. She is charged with trying to decipher the communication from the alien craft. Jeremy Renner is cast as Ian Donnelly a physicist who befriends Banks on the team. The pacing of the movie is excellent and you are never quite sure where the movie is heading. Very engaging throughout.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Poor Attempt,"Note: This is a personal review based on my preference and likes.I wanted to like this film, given I was hoping for a scifi film that didn't hang on the action to make it great. This wasn't that film.The film is slow, constantly throwing out flashes of depressing content and making loud, unnecessary noises to try to create an atmosphere. The audio effects especially put me off the 'big' moments, i'd have preferred mysterious or subtle effects instead of glaring ones the film used.It reminds me a great deal of the game Firewatch, where on one hand you have this amazing thing and on the other a constant reminder of pain and suffering. Perhaps some people enjoy this contrast but I didn't, it ruined the best parts of the film by constantly dragging you back in to painful parts.So for me this gets a 2 for: - Poor Audio - Sad Parts break up the story, take those out and it would be passable. At the very least just show them once.. - Poor Audio - Desire to leave the cinema before the film ended, felt bored + Thinking out of the box and being a little different + Special Effects and camera use, some very nice shots in the film",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"A scifi and also a strong and intelligent drama, which provokes relevant questions in the audience, but which, like the director's other films, deceives and moves","Despite presenting typical elements of blockbusters of the genre - the presence of the army, the military security procedures and the panic generated and documented by the media - this time, the film focuses on the attempt at communication and on the process of understanding the creatures, which gives a slower paced story. For Villeneuve, it is clear that, more important than fighting the heptapods, is understanding their nature and their way of communicating. The script and editing are also able to play with the public's perception of time, and perhaps that is where the projection's greatest asset lies. The experience of watching it for the first time is completely different from a second viewing, as the non-linearity of these elements surprises and gives the viewer a new view of everything that happened.While the means of communication between humans and aliens are developed by a huge group of people, Louise starts to have flashbacks (as we are led to interpret) of random moments with her daughter, who in the beginning of the film is presented quickly, in a harrowing moment where Louise witnesses her death as a teenager, which occurs due to the growth of an advanced leukemia. These moments appear, initially, to be played out only to expose the deep feelings of a single mother who lost her daughter not long ago (one can conclude from the appearance of the mother that not much has changed), but which assumes considerable importance at the end of the period. Second act, promoting a different understanding of the film.The first meeting of the two with the heptapods - the name given to extraterrestrials due to their seven legs and absence of a head - is one of the most impressive scenes in the film, thanks to the direction of Dennis Villeneuve who balances the performances of Adams and Renner with the spectacular work by Bradford Young in the cinematography of the film, together with the soundtrack by Jóhan Jóhannsson, creating an atmosphere that provokes in the spectator the exact mixture of fear and fascination that an experience like this should provide. Inside the ship, gravity is radically altered, sending all the physics that Ian believed he knew down the drain, just as the first exchange established between Louise and the heptapods (later named Abbott and Costello, one of the most delightful details of the script) ) - the word HUMAN written on a poster against a circle drawn like a coffee stain in the air as a response - affects the linguist's understanding of the structures of communication and, consequently, of thinking and understanding the world. It's a slow and delicate process that, contrary to what one imagines at first, is radically different from a traditional blockbuster, with shooting, beatings and bombs everywhere. While suspense and mystery are key parts of the narrative, the tension surrounding the story settles much more around the pressure to get results than anything else. It is a race against time where crossing the finish line means not only establishing communication between two very different races, but preventing the advancement of hostile approaches by other nations, which could trigger a real conflict and put everything to lose.The entire political and military plot that emerges from there is part of the adaptation that screenwriter Eric Heisserer makes of the original tale by Ted Chiang, a complicated job when you have an idea of how little visual the story that inspires the film is. The same happens with the argument that gives meaning to the plot, which Chiang explains in an elegant way using concepts of physics and linguistics that, however, do not help much in an audiovisual narrative. Despite the challenge, the conflict that Heisserer uses as a solution seems somewhat weak in the face of the sophistication at the heart of the story, mainly because he does not hesitate to place the United States - a country that, historically, has always been involved in conflicts against minority groups, a force central to so many horrors of war - as the moderate part of the situation in counterpoint to China, which in history acts in an openly hostile way against the invaders after a communication failure (ah, the irony), in a very stereotyped image of the country.This appeasing American posture owes much to the fact that the country has Louise Banks as a central figure in the course of actions. Not just because she is responsible for deciphering the heptapod language and saving the day, but because Louise achieves all of this because she is a woman. Louise, as we discover in the first scenes of the film, is a mother. Her intelligence helps her understand semasiographic writing (a form of language that has no phonetic correspondence, such as mathematics) of extraterrestrials, but the connection only happens due to the sensitive and delicate way she approaches unknown visitors. And if science fiction itself tends to reinforce problematic discourses about what is different, outside, unusual, the government's reaction goes against the notion that establishes the other as a threat, something to be feared. The relationship that Louise builds with the heptapods, although it starts timidly and fearfully, soon turns into a kind of partnership, where both she and the creatures themselves walk together a path of learning and enlightenment.Amy Adams is superb here and gives the best performance of her career. At first, her character seems like a fragile woman, but soon she proves to be a heroine teaching the military a lesson. Notice in the scene of his arrival at the military center, a certain look of disdain for a woman entering a male environment. However, she demonstrates something that they would never have at the moment of first contact with the aliens: empathy, patience and intelligence in not letting prejudice hinder their actions. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker are also worth mentioning. The performances of both are interesting, because each one represents a pole. Renner represents a scientist facing the situation as a true discovery and learning, while Whitaker represents a military man who needs immediate answers from his superiors and doesn't care what the alien visit is representing to the world.Communication and language: this is where social interaction begins. As if the philosophical starting point were not enough, screenwriter Eric Heisserer borrows notions from modern physics to proceed in the text. Again, better not to develop the idea, avoiding spoilers. The script is quite complicated and requires the viewer to be willing to think in order to understand the work - and perhaps rethink reality itself. More than an intellectual subtext, the narrative develops in a genial, unusual and insightful way. Ingenious, Heisserer leaves no loose ends and gives credibility to the script by creating a very realistic atmosphere. For example, aliens do not only arrive in the US, but in different countries around the world (Venezuela, Russia, China, Australia, etc.), which even react to the novelty in different ways. The construction of the characters, however, did not have the same care.Unfortunately, the context portrayed by the script is one of dread in the face of the unknown - and the film understands that, in the face of fear, the reaction of a large part of humanity is aggression. It is not for nothing that Louise thinks of the problems before her in terms of language, while her superiors evaluate them following the logic of war. In this sense, by the way, Villeneuve is able to build a strong atmosphere of tension through the deliberately slow camera movements, the always low tone of voice of his characters and even the absolute silence. On the other hand, he evokes Ian's amazed reaction when he brings up a close-up of his hand touching the uneven surface of the nave or when he contrasts his smile of anticipation for meeting the visitors with Louise's heavy and anxious breathing. To complete, the filmmaker creates a subtle visual logic when performing tilts (vertical camera movements, like a positive nod of the head) that go in opposite directions depending on what they focus on: from top to bottom in earthly scenarios and from bottom to top when in inside the alien ship, opposing the ways of each one of seeing the world.However, Villeneuve's most intelligent narrative strategy lies in associating the spectator's point of view with that of Louise. For this, the director invests in a sound design centered on the subjective perception of the protagonist: when she is in a helicopter, the mix is dominated by the noise of the engine until she puts on the headphones; when wearing the radiation suit, everything becomes stuffy; and so on. And more: if initially we only see the aliens from a distance, we are finally able to observe details of their anatomy when the character approaches them - and the identification effect ends up being complemented by the punctual use of subjective cameras. And why is this so important? Because, after being anchored to her, we are immersed alongside her in the daughter's memories that begin to flood her more and more after establishing contact with the creatures, which is fundamental to the structure of the feature.Overall, ""Arrival"" is a film that may disappoint many science fiction fans who go to theaters just to witness a strong action load, with shots and explosions everywhere, loaded with special effects that are there just to impress. The viewer.

I also think it's an amazing achievement, to be able to get a premise like that and make it work. This is probably the best leading performance that I have seen Amy Adams ever give. I was also hesitant on her casting but I would say that she was pretty close to perfect. I would say that the final scenes get a little too messy.

The additions to the original short story water down this scifi experience,"This is the first Denis Villeneuve film I've actually liked, and it gives me hope for the upcoming Blade Runner 2049, which is a sequel for the 1982 classic. It's based on a short story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang, and the basic premise goes that twelve alien ships have arrived to Earth. Each has seemingly randomly chosen a spot on Earth to hover over and after a certain amount of time a door always opens, letting explorers in. The movie is told from the point of view of Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a world-class linguist, who's been tasked with communicating with the aliens.On many levels it is an extremely refreshing science fiction experience. It focuses heavily on the protocols of first contact and the difficulties of trying to communicate with a new civilization that's so removed from our own as to make the task almost impossible. That might sound boring to some, but the film is anything but. Insert some unforeseen twists and difficulties, which I shall not spoil here, and we have a more than decent story in our hands.It's also technically superb, as well as well-acted all around. The film looks absolutely fantastic, which has always been Villeneuve's strong suit, but in this he really pulled out all the stops. The first slow shot we get of the alien ship hovering above a misty valley is some of the finest visual cinema I've experienced in years. The whole film has this gritty realism applied to some pretty outlandish visuals and concepts, and it works beautifully. Also huge props for Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, playing the other scientist in charge of communications. Both are really talented actors, but the show absolutely goes to Adams.Where the film unfortunately loses me a bit is in the additions made to the original short story. There was some military presence in the original as well, but here it has been brought into the spotlight, which doesn't make the film any stronger. The original concept and the original themes were already strong enough. Throwing in some inept criticism against redneck armed forces and strong arm negotiation tactics only takes our focus away from the main idea. The plot also moves around pretty clunkily. For example, there's this general mentioned early on in the film, seemingly casually in the background, but each and every member in the audience could instantly tell that he was going to return to screw something up. The film is full of moments like this, which also takes away from the central idea by pulling on our suspension of disbelief.Nevertheless, despite its flaws, Arrival is a good scifi film. It had the potential to be a great one and there are definitely flashes of that greatness scattered throughout the film. Unfortunately the task of telling a coherent and structured story is where Villeneuve drops the ball a bit. Still very much worth a watch for all those looking for something new in the scifi genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Unique Sci Fi Movie,"Arrival is an extraordinary and unique entry in the genre of alien movies, setting itself apart from typical Hollywood depictions. This distinction is likely why it won the Oscar for Best Achievement in Sound Editing. From the outset, the film establishes an unconventional tone, marked by a gradual and intriguing buildup of characters like linguist Louise Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly, keeping audiences engaged and eager for what's to come.One captivating detail is the presentation of the 12 alien ships that mysteriously appear around the world. These vessels hover a few feet above the ground without touching it-a subtle yet significant visual choice that draws attention.The film's central theme revolves around communication and the concept of a universal language, a notion expertly conveyed by director Denis Villeneuve. The story suggests that the universe shares a common language, an idea explored with depth and nuance. Another intriguing element is the depiction of the heptapods, extraterrestrial beings whose language vastly differs from human communication. The movie effectively illustrates how words familiar to us could carry entirely different meanings elsewhere, leading to misunderstandings that escalate tensions on Earth.Louise Banks emerges as a pivotal figure, working to bridge the gap between humans and aliens, calming international governments, and gradually resolving the crisis. The film also hints at the possibility of advanced technology wielded by extraterrestrial beings.However, those expecting fast-paced, action-driven alien battles may find Arrival outside their typical preferences. Instead, it offers a thought-provoking, idea-driven narrative that could compel viewers to revisit the film for a deeper understanding. The ending, too, stands out with an unexpected twist, defying the standard conventions of the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

But it's not.This developed a feeling of wonder and awe inside of me, as I eagerly waiting to see how this movie would finish, making this an effective and one of the best sci-fi thrillers in modern cinema.Now this movie is a perfect example on how a sci-fi story should be told.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Arrival is a thought provoking monument to the sci-fi movie genre.,"Arrival will tantalise the curiosity tastebuds that has been fascinating humankind for civilisations.

Without the bells and whistles of rocket ships and leaving earth, Arrival manages to grab the curiosity of the audience by simply landing twelve interestingly oval-shaped objects on earth, leaving us wondering, what are they, where did they come from? We are left in a similar position to the apes from Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Arrival delves further into our imaginative minds when exploring the enthralling and intricate details of these 'visitors'.

"Arrival : Language, time and life","Denis Villeneuve is a modern day Hitchcock, his heart wrenching unique thrillers and deep rooted character based story arcs reminds of films we loved and we missed, but he makes them in his modern tradition.His Prisoners (2013) and Enemy (2014) are very dark and is unique filmmaking, you only see in Denis's films itself.Sicario (2015) takes deeper roots into human condition relating to crime and drug activities which is also an addition to his deep and darker cinematic film making style.Arrival (2016) his latest film is a sci-fi based on an alien space craft appearance and it's communication through linguistics of the alien race translated by a language specialist Dr. Louise Banks played by Amy Adams. Her performance is remarkable.The depth of substance of the film is commendable. Aspects of civilisation and humanity like language, time and life are analysed and put to the screen in an amazing way by the filmmakers.This film is a Denis Villeneuve film with such expansion to his tradition. Unlike other films this is more filled with hope and love. He expands into the aspects of his slow swiftly camera work rather than being haunting like in his previous films into being a more poetic and like song of nature and humanity. It's a real upgrade in his tradition in my perspective.He explores femininity in his latest two films giving major roles to female leads.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Arrival is a modern Sci-Fi,"Arrival is a modern Sci-Fi. Both in the good and in the bad sense of the word. Arrival is spectacular and beautiful to attract a large audience, and moderately stupid not to scare away the mass audience. Excellent cast, one of the best roles of Amy Adams. Arrival should be watched only in the original, Arrival about linguistics, so dubbing completely changes the idea of the film. Arrival is a vivid example of popularizing Sci-Fi in wide circles, but only because it is a bad example of the genre. Arrival is too simple and stupid. If you want a real Sci-Fi, watch Annihilation. Of course, the Arrival movie is not worse, and it looks even better for most people, but when they say that this is one of the best Sci-Fi about exploring extraterrestrial life, you catch only irritation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Too many plot holes to go into without risking the making of spoilers. Just because the script is convoluted and about a very serious subject it does not necessarily mean it is good.

This movie is another masterpiece!,"Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is a cinematic experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional science fiction. The film's soul is its haunting meditation on time, language, and the human condition, masterfully woven together with impeccable acting, an emotionally resonant script, and a stirring soundtrack.Amy Adams delivers an astonishing performance as Dr. Louise Banks, a linguist tasked with deciphering an alien language. Her portrayal is raw, nuanced, and deeply human, capturing the essence of a woman navigating grief, fear, and hope. Adams brings an extraordinary depth to Louise, making her a character who feels as real as the emotional journey she embarks upon.The screenplay, adapted from Ted Chiang's short story Story of Your Life, is a work of art. It asks profound questions about communication, perception, and the inevitability of loss, without ever feeling heavy-handed or preachy. Instead, it invites the audience into a contemplative space, where time is fluid and decisions carry immense weight. The dialogue is sparse but impactful, each word contributing to the philosophical undercurrent of the narrative.The film's soundtrack, composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson, is a character in itself. Its ethereal, haunting score resonates throughout the movie, perfectly complementing its themes of isolation, connection, and the passage of time. The music moves in and out of the scenes like a gentle breeze, subtly guiding the emotional tone of the story without overwhelming it. It's the kind of score that sticks with you long after the credits roll.But Arrival is not just a film; it's an experience. It stays with you, continually asking you to reconsider your own life and choices. It's a film that demands reflection, and one that resonates deeply with anyone who has ever faced loss, wrestled with the unknown, or tried to make sense of their place in the universe.I couldn't stop crying. It's a movie that touches the soul, not just through its tears, but through its breathtakingly beautiful exploration of time and language. It makes you think - about communication, about connection, and about how every moment in life is precious, even if we can't always understand it. Arrival is a rare gem of a film that balances intellectual depth with profound emotional resonance, leaving you profoundly moved and forever changed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

We're so arrogant, we think our puny weapons could intimidate the aliens.There was a book.in 1958, The Ugly American, critical of our assumption that we know what's right for the entire world. This film perpetuates this. Each time I see it, I lose respect for the writer and director.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I just love intelligent science fiction films,"This film about aliens coming to Earth and our attempts to understand them amidst the typical human hysteria is pretty sensational. A renowned linguist (Amy Adams) is recruited to understand a ""language"" coming from these visitors. Directed by the awesome visionary, Denis Villeneuve, this is a visual masterpiece that rests on the shoulders of Adams giving one of her very finest performances. She has help with fine support from Jeremy Renner, but this is her film. The cinematography, special effects, score, sound effects are all exemplary. There are a few questionable moments, especially one involving the rather implausible placement of a bomb, but so much of this is so superior, it's hard to knock. Years ago I anxiously awaited Independence Day, a movie that turned out to be a silly blockbuster about an alien encounter, and was massively disappointed.

"Premier Contact: When Aliens Show Up to Talk, and We Understand Nothing","If you were hoping for aliens throwing punches à la Independence Day, with explosions and laser beams flying everywhere, do yourself a favor and marathon Starship Troopers instead. Here, Villeneuve takes you on a more cerebral ride than anything muscle-bound. Arrival (Premier Contact) is like a game of Tetris for your brain-each phrase and image slotting together until they form a massive mosaic. Miss a piece, and you're lost.Louise, played by Amy Adams, is basically Yoda but in linguist form-deciphering alien symbols like she's spent her life reading hieroglyphs on Tatooine. The point here isn't to punch aliens, but to figure out how they communicate. Language in Arrival is the key-it's the movie's Force, and you quickly realize that chatting with extraterrestrials is more complex than building the Death Star without a blueprint.Villeneuve doesn't hit you with Fast & Furious-style antics. He's all about crafting a finely tuned story where every detail matters. Miss a line of dialogue, and you've missed half the movie. The flashbacks? You won't understand their meaning right away, but once the puzzle pieces snap into place, it's like watching Jigsaw's plan unfold-bam, mind blown. You thought they were just memories? Nope, it's way deeper than that.No big spaceships blowing up like in Star Wars, but elegant, well-placed imagery. Villeneuve keeps it subtle, using special effects to serve the story, pulling you into this mysterious, weighty atmosphere. It's beautiful, it's classy, and it dazzles without going full Michael Bay.Jeremy Renner plays the perfect sidekick here-no super bow, no Hawkeye costume, just a scientist joining you on this interstellar mind trip. He lets Amy Adams shine, stepping back with a certain finesse. It's like playing co-op but letting the other player take the spotlight while you quietly do the heavy lifting. Respect.Arrival isn't for those looking for mindless fights or CGI overload. It's for those who want to leave the theater with an existential migraine. It's beautiful, it's smart, and it'll mess with your brain. So, if you're down for meditating on the nature of time, language, and aliens, dive in. For everyone else, there's always Transformers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Thought-provoking, but preposterous","This is an engaging movie with a few familiar themes: huge and mysterious spacecraft suddenly show up, first contact with aliens, science vs. military, individual effort battling group think. But what gives this film its real pizazz is the 'flashback' under-plot that starts early on and only becomes (moderately) comprehensible after various revelations and breakthroughs that emerge gradually from the main plot. Because of this, the story is quite complex and keeps the unraveling in progress all the way.Ultimately, however, the denouement is (to me) unsatisfying. No amount of arm-waving is going to convince me of the main premise, which shall remain unrevealed.A very interesting movie, but left me disappointed.

Very good but falls short of being great,"Arrival is a good film but not great. Watched it yesterday in the local movie hall and was immediately disappointed by how drab it looked, where did all the great cinematography and camera-work of the Director's previous work Sicario had gone? Rechecked the trailers and there was definitely problem with the print given to PVR, which is such a shame because this movie looked excellent in trailers and so bad in the movie hall. As far as acting is concerned everyone was decent and I think this is the first time Amy Adams has been the first lead of a movie and she brought her A game, easily career best performance. I thought the first half was quite weak, there are a lot of ""talky"" generic scenes which could have been cut, the extra effort to show the military protocol of isolation, immune system boosts, suits, etc. etc. got way more screen time than it deserved, Denis Villeneuve should have trusted his audience, we understand all the protocols, don't spend half an hour to forty five minutes explaining it to us with chitter-chatter and therein lies the biggest fault of Arrival, there are just so many scenes that a person who watches these kinds of films doesn't need, some aspects just feel a bit dumbed down. There is also one convenient, really bad story angle which just adds fifteen minutes to the runtime but was completely unnecessary. If I was the editor, this movie would have lost good half an hour if not more. BUT and this is a big BUT, the second half picks up momentum and where all the seeds the film planted start to take shape, and this is quite well done, I was impressed, the climax was truly the highlight of the film and so well done but can't be discussed without going into spoilers. The music and score is good but not as good as Sicario, and often feels forced and overused (especially in an otherwise excellent climax). All in all, despite it's rough edges, I still liked Arrival, I liked it more than the usual science fiction releases around this time of the year- Gravity, Interstellar, Martian, but this is not that great first contact film that we will be talking about for years like 2001 or Soalris, just a solid film for this year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

My other example off the top of my head would be the movie Contact.This movie is going to be hard to beat when it comes to the technicalities that make a great sci fi movie.

Beautiful and emotional,"Arrival is the kind of sci-fi that makes you think, and brings awe and wonder to the seemingly small moments in our lives. It features aliens, yes, but it's not *about* aliens - it's about communication, trust, and the price we're willing to pay for the choices we make.Amy Adams is Louise Banks, a reserved language professor tasked by the military to find a way to communicate with aliens who have come to earth for reasons unknown. Over the course of this work, Louise begins to understand life in the same way the aliens do, although she is confused about what is happening to her perception of reality. In the end this new perspective affects an important decision about her own path. Any more detail than that would be a spoiler; just know that the ending of this movie is emotional, bittersweet, and deeply exhilarating.It's also a visually astounding movie, even more so because of everything about the aliens is understated - their bodies are dark shapes in a white window, the interior of their ship is monochromatic but richly textured, and their written language (an important part of the story) is a hypnotic swirl of black in a white cloud.Overall I can't recommend this movie enough - definitely in my top 5 movies of all time.

Not quite my taste,"I really wanted to love Arrival. I'm a fan of so called ""smart"" sci-fi, stuff that manages to bend out of this world stuff with beauty. Arrival was one of those movies that seemed to tick all the boxes (female led, prestige cast and crew) but I found myself a bit let down.The movie is about Louise Banks, a university professor of languages who we first meet in the opening frames of the movie as her she takes care of and raises her young daughter, only to lose her when she is still very young. We then see Louise at her job when 12 alien space ships land at an assortment of random locations around the world. Because of some earlier work she did translating for the military, Louise ends up getting assigned a job helping the army translate and talk to the aliens (quickly dubbed heptapods). Louise and her partner Ian end up becoming close to the two heptapods that try to communicate with them, and they struggle to figure out what to say and how to say it before the trigger happy government attacks the aliens and starts a war they might not win.There's a lot to admire about Arrival. Amy Adams is great here as Louise (sadly snubbed for an Oscar despite the film receiving multiple nominations). The tech work is also very good. This isn't a movie that goes for intensely gorgeous visuals, but there is still eye-candy in the form of the written version of the alien language.The central story and the ""twist"" at the centre of it is really great too, and it's only something that will enrich the film in multiple viewings. And yet despite the intimate story there was something about the film that just didn't work for me, primarily the nitty gritty details of the script. Despite the elegant structure and ideas there's some dialogue that's too quippy and on the nose and there's this whole section in the middle that is just five minutes of information dropping voice-over over montage. It's a weirdly lazy technique for a film that sweats the details. There's also a relationship that ends up being central to the ending and the plot that I never quite bought and doesn't feel organic at all.Your mileage may vary. While I never quite succeeded in feeling that emotional connection that would have elevated the film from good to excellent I can see from the ratings and reviews that others just don't have that problem.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
The Importance of Clear Communication,"Despite my trepidation at the thought of watching a space movie with Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, I am so glad I finally saw Arrival - but also slightly irked that I waited so long.The story puts you in the driver's seat with Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a top linguist professor showing up to work on the day of the ""arrival."" Similarly to Dawn of the Dead (2004), we witness the breakdown of society in real time through the perspective of the protagonist as chaos unfolds. Making her way down the campus halls, large groups of students gather in front of a windows as people frantically murmur. Her classroom is mostly empty, there's something in the air, but Louise either hasn't noticed or cared to address it. As she attempts to start her lesson, student's phones start buzzing one after the other, then one of the students timidly asks ""can you turn to a news channel?""Louise slides the white board to reveal a black television and turns on the shocking news. Then a loud emergency siren sounds. I've seen apocalyptic depictions many times, but in Arrival it felt real.Without giving away the whole plot, Louise along with another field expert (Jeremy Renner), are recruited by an army colonel (Forrest Whitaker) to board an extra terrestrial ship that landed in Montana. Their mission is to communicate with the life forms aboard the ship and determine if they pose a threat to Earth (or if they have demands).Arrival is a brilliant nuanced approach to the old ""alien invasion"" plot trope. The moment that makes this film truly great is in the second act. When the research crew first board the ship, it's one of the most captivating and visceral experiences I've ever enjoyed on screen.Beyond the incredible CGI, gorgeous set design and solid acting, Arrival is enlightened. Clear communication is the key to understanding, and language is the most prevalent barrier in the entire human experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

The visuals and soundtrack are ok. All in all just a good sci fi flick, but not excellent.What makes ""Arrival"" special is the suspense. Really good suspense I must admit, because the director does keep this story thrilling. In ""Arrival"" there is this big mystery that has to be unravelled of how to communicate with aliens. And Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are the scientists who have to fulfill this task. The different attempts to contact the aliens are portrayed in a fascinating claustrophobic tense atmosphere. Villeneuve also directed the new Blade Runner and he knows how to glue an audience to a screen even when not much is happening. Villeneuve has a great talent for creating a contineous suspenseful mood. A strange thing happened the day after I saw it. The scenes with Amy Adams encountering the aliens stayed in my mind the day after. Somehow director Villeneuve's claustrophobic mood lingered on even the next day.In the end I felt the story was a little too much paranormal and a bit too sweet for my taste.But the suspenseful mood of the movie is impressive. It is a hit or miss depending on your preferences for paranormal stuff and how rational you analyse movies. Villeneuve's direction splits audiences in half, more so than any other director.However smart it is filmed and however suspenseful it stays, it becomes too irrational for my taste near the end, but I dont believe in paranormal stuff, maybe you do...The message of love however is what makes this movie heartfelt and warm in the end. It's honestly a feelgood movie, but you must be the patient type and have a very open mind to paranormal stuff to be able to appreciate it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
superior sci-fi,"Wow. I was blown away by this film. Intelligent, thoughtful, profound.
It's sci-fi, so you get spaceships, alien monsters, and testosterone-laden US military dorks trying to save the planet, but don't let that put you off. This is a beautiful film about the human condition (as all the best sci-fi films are), with the focus on language and communication. It deserves to be up there with 2001, Interstellar, and Blade Runner.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Nice Original Alien Invasion Film,"Arrival is basically a combination of Contact and Signs. It has the atmosphere and feel of Signs and the story of Contact. Though, I think it ends up being better than both those films. This is mainly due to the ending. Both Contact and Signs started out really interesting and engaging, but then started to lose it by the third act, and then the ending ruins it. With Signs the ending was just lame; with Contact the ending was both lame and confusing. With the amount of build-up this film gives us in the first and second acts the ending could have been a complete letdown just like those films were. Thankfully, this film does not drop the ball on the ending, which makes Arrival a cut above the rest. Despite that I would not call Arrival a phenomenon like most praise as. It's definitely a good movie, but I was not blown away by it.Like I said earlier, the story is very similar to contact where humanity finally has contact with alien visitors and the main character Louise, played by Amy Adams, is trying to find a way to decipher their language and communicate back to them. The differences that, unlike Contact where the characters are deciphering a message and we never actually see the aliens, here the extraterrestrials actually come to Earth and the humans communicate with them directly, which makes the film more visually interesting.The film also has a very gloomy atmosphere to it, very much like Signs or a Christopher Nolan film. If I did not know the director and people said Nolan directed this movie I would believe it, especially with the ending, which is something he would concoct.The movie looks great in spite of the gloomy atmosphere. The effects team did an amazing job with the visuals. The score, while not the most memorable, also did its job at setting the mood of the scene.The main thing about this film that prevents it from being a masterpiece for me is the characters. Amy Adams is fine but the rest of the cast I thought was lacking. The one thing Signs does better than this film and Contact, in my opinion, is the characters. I was invested in Mel Gibson and his family more than the cast in Arrival and Contact. You got good actors like Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, but their characters were rather bland. Jeremy Renner's character felt rather pointless in the film until the very end when his role becomes clear. Even so, the film does not make him a compelling character and his chemistry with Amy Adams felt a little forced.Plus, while you understand their importance by the end, there are many scenes that drag and drag down the pacing a little. Also, while the ending is good, there are a few scenes that feel odd or didn't really make sense with what the ending was going for, which I won't reveal to avoid spoilers. That's more of a nitpick, but it bugs me.Overall, if you enjoyed Signs and/or Contact, or even aspects of those films you'll like Arrival. If you like Interstellar, Inception, or just about anything directed by Christopher Nolan you'll enjoy Arrival. I'd say it's definitely one of, if not the best alien invasion film to come out in a long time. I didn't think it was spectacular like most did, but it's definitely solid.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Captivating,This beautifully acted and thought provoking film is supported all the way by a superb score. The ending is genuinely poignant and deeply moving.An intelligent script and superb lead performances by Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner with classy support from Forest Whitaker makes this a truly satisfying film experience.My only gripe is with the extraterrestrials themselves which I found rather weak and unconvincing.The Sci-Fi genre is not one which usually interests me but this film sets the bar very high indeed.,8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Fascinating meditative film,"I begin with saying that the best part about this film are the single star rated reviews. Some of them are so hilarious and I can relate to them. The thing with this film is to treat it as a meditative medium on notions such as past, present and future (time and space)where they seem to merge, where one is to appreciate the present and let go of the future, on our bonds that unite us or divide us as humans etc. In this regard I found it spiritual and serene. Apparently the director goes for this approach because even with some tension that arises during the film, this is dealt deftly and 'outside' the canvas so that any excitement is squashed before our mind registers what is going on. I did get frustrated sometimes especially in the first half with the dialogue which is very absent and sometimes unintelligible and not revealing and the silence that permeates the film, minimal soundscore, characters are not developed and seem to be in a permanent state of suspension. But then I reckoned this is that type of film, where one has to let go any preconceptions and just absorb with what is going on on screen . That way I enjoyed it and kept me thinking afterwards",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
When Aliens are Bad at Communicating,"I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. Oh, I get the movie, but what I do not understand is how this movie was so highly acclaimed. Was it because we had an alien movie devoid of mass destruction? Surely we've seen that before.Some aliens that look like giant hands in which they use their fingers as feet have parked their hover crafts in various places throughout Earth. Of course, the U.S. was one of their parking spots (you can't leave us out). The military engages these visitors and wants to know their purpose but they can't communicate with them. In steps Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a professor and language expert (which is weird because the aliens make animal-like noises yet the U.S. grabbed a human language expert instead of an animal biologist or even an animal trainer). The bulk of the movie is then spent trying to establish communications with these odd creatures.The film is so pretentious and esoteric. We have to watch the movie interminably drag on with Louise trying to forge a bond with the extra-terrestrials. While the cliché military does its cliché job of following cliché directives, the sensitive and astute Louise is there to make a break through that no one else can.These beings are so advanced and so intelligent yet they can't clearly communicate their demands. Arrival moves so slow and intertwines exposition in there that leaves you wondering what--if anything--it has to do with the main story. I finished watching the movie feeling completely vacant and void of any emotion about it besides indifference at best and a mild disgust at worst. Arrival did nothing for me. It wasn't thought provoking, it wasn't innovative, it wasn't even entertaining. Yes, it took itself very seriously and I don't know why. I think the movie Abyss and E.T. did far better jobs of bringing us aliens to teach us lessons.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Arrival is a SF feature film with linguistic and geopolitical accents.,"Carried by a three-star cast, this original and captivating film not only offers a moment of rare visual ecstasy (the photograph manages to create from just a few nuances a simple but spectacular perspective).In the foreground, Amy Adams is undoubtedly taking the lead with her role and Jeremy Renner lives up to his consistency, while in a supporting role Forest Whitaker brings a welcome experience. Jòhann Jòhansson signs his third collaboration with the Canadian director with a modest but not devoid of depth soundtrack.It is nevertheless a pity that, in such an object of cinematographic and above all scientific curiosity, there may be a lack of consistency in the scenario, the finale being rushed (while the pace is slow) and the ending quite irrational. However, Denis Villeneuve delivers, after three distinct thrillers in just two years, a daring and ambitious science fiction film. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"Gorgeous, simple, meaningful.","I don't go for that many artsy films, nor ones with very little dialogue usually, although I loved Paris, Texas.However this film means so much to me. When my children were old enough I showed it to them also, and they were very absorbed by it and found it - eerily soothing or something.It's very hard to describe without spoilers but I thought it holds a mirror to the very best and very worst of humanity / universal life.I found the score very apt for the telling, and it just wrecks your heart a little and reminds us of some very important facts that it is so easy to forget in our short time here. I think it's especially relevant for us in these times of road rage.I read about 100 of the bad ones here, and have decided that most of the terrible reviews on this site about this film are from people that Did Not Get It or don't seem to have much of a spirit or soul. Which is tragic for them as it would have given them the reminders on what is life? that they needed.I strongly disagree that it is trying to be 2001, I found this a way more mature film.If you were the kind of teenager that could dangle your feet in a river during the pouring rain, then I recommend this beautiful and poignant film for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Didn't draw me in like Villeneuve's previous work,"Denis Villeneuve has proved himself to be a very thought-provoking and intelligent filmmaker. Both 'Enemy' and 'Prisoners' were terrific films that left you thinking long after the credits rolled. Now, he has delivered us 'Arrival' and gone down a similar path. There's certainly a lot to think about and consider after leaving the cinema. The problem is that unlike his previous films, I'm not sure I care enough about the story to bother. This one didn't hook me in like the others. I wasn't enthralled with every scene needing to know what would happen next.The concept of aliens in film always seems to be a popular one. People are fascinated by them and I suspect they genuinely crave the experience of aliens coming to Earth. So a film that explores that prospect is always going to be popular. I do think it can lead to some lazy film making in places though. Because aliens don't exist, or are at least not yet discovered, there are no rules that you have to follow. Anything goes. If you want time travel to apply, it's as easy as saying that it does. You can have them look however you want, have their ship look however you want and give them any physical abilities you so choose. Whatever suits your story best I suppose.'Arrival' is a very well made film. It's beautifully shot and terrifically acted. It's a sci-fi film that also tries to be a drama and draw on your heart strings. In some places it tries to be too smart for its own good and just ends up getting messier than it needed to though. I think the biggest problem I found however was the characters. They were dull and seemingly unhappy people. If your characters aren't any good it's hard to care. Altogether I think 'Arrival' is a middle of the pack alien flick.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

An Intelligent Sci-fi Look at Communicating with Aliens,"""Arrival"" depicts the arrival of multiple spaceships that land at various places on Earth (including Montana), and the resulting attempts of each nation where the ships have landed to communicate with the extraterrestrials and ascertain their intentions. The U.S. military authorities hire a Professor of Linguistics and a Professor of Theoretical Physics to identify the vocabulary and meaning of the aliens' strange language of complex visual configurations, and the linguist (Amy Adams) becomes the center of focus in this film. ""Arrival"" is decidedly not a ""space opera"" as it is a thoughtful, well-researched exploration of communication ""mediums"" between living beings who know nothing of each other. ""The day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951) took the easy route by having the lone alien communicate in English (presumably picked up by monitoring radio traffic); ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" used musical notes to get the terrestrials and extraterrestrials in synch; Carl Sagan's ""Contact"" used a repeating sequence of prime numbers to signify a living intelligence (It is fun to note that the Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977 contained the ""Voyager Golden Records"" that contained, with much input from Sagan, mathematical formulas like the derivation of Pi, plus chemical structures, not to mention 55 ancient and modern languages).The Aliens do not apparently use a phonetic alphabet as their written language, featured in the film, is distinct from their spoken language. I have three final comments to make about this film: (1) I give intellectual heft to this film by its invoking the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, namely that the structure of a language determines how you think and experience the world. The Aliens' language moves in circles and thus they have a circular, not linear, view of time. The irony is that this hypothesis is now discredited by Noam Chomsky and modern linguists who argue that all languages have a common grammatical structure. But of course, who's to say how our extraterrestrials' brains evolved? (2) Why do these films, including ""Arrival,"" have military types who think early 21st century weaponry is sufficient to destroy creatures who are capable of interstellar travel? (3) For that matter, what on earth do these aliens, presumably so far advanced beyond our capabilities, think we could do for them in 3,000 years?",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Bloated but watchable.,"Arrival is an earnest film, but could have been shot with a 20 min run-time, and have been equally effective. Neill Blomkamp's collection of sci-fi shorts. For Oats Studios, achieves far more with far less - for example.Despite some excellent shots and effects, there is very little in the way of a plot and the actors are relied on to stretch the runtime. I found the insertion of PTSD flashbacks to be somewhat trite.Despite oodles of screen time for the leads - the script is paltry and so the actors engage in spartan dialogue - surprising considering the thematic emphasis on communication via language.This was my second viewing, 5 years after the first and I have downgraded my original rating from 8 to 6.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Really???,"8.2 Rating the date I purchased and watched the movie and wow, how could so many have got it so wrong? Upset I spent money to purchase instead of waiting for it to come on cable, Netflix or regular TV. In reflection this was like a soulless failed M.Knight S. like imitation film lacking charm or style. The movie falls flat and is actually a failure with an 8.2 rating? Captain Marks whom u will see little of is the only person of interest and that is because when u see his face u instantly know he is going to do something...eventually. Again the film fails, had they only shown more of Captain Marks and managed to have scripted and built a little suspense in his role around his actions. They could have cut many of the scenes with Amy Adams and made that happen. Towards the end of the film it is over the top obvious that u have not seen the husband so u know who the husband will be as the film has bored u so long, has to be near its end and it is too late to introduce a new character.A slow slightly boring movie doesn't bother me if overall it has a great story. I have not acted since 7th grade when I faltered over memorizing my lines after a star turn in the 6th grade when a 3 person classroom play was accidentally aired locally by a group testing new equipment but if I had been inserted in the movie and acted badly stumbling over my lines, it would have added some drama and interest. All the immensely competent actors in this film looked and sounded they were all on a lot of Prozac! The dullness of the movie is related to both directional and screenplay issues. Amy Adams tries to create a mood and aura with her acting but she is just a person too much in their own head and not fully interacting with anyone around her. Too bad they put everyone else in the same head space.

A Film That Requires Thinking,"Wow. I just reviewed a bunch of the ""1"" ratings. I find the low ratings are for a couple of reasons. One, it was a pure ""talkie."" No action and no threats from aliens. The other reason is, they didn't understand what was going on.When I originally saw this movie in the theater, I spent several minutes afterwards in the lobby explaining things to my friends (e.g., how Amy Adams kept seeing her future and how Amy learned from the alien that they do not experience time in a linear fashion). Some strangers came over to me to also hear my explanation and I realized how difficult it was to understand. I thought the best scene in the movie was when she's looking into her future and gathering information that she needs immediately in the present.I've probably seen the movie 4 times now, kinda' looking for ""nuances"" but mainly because it's among my favorite sci-fi/alien genre films.I guess the movie just isn't that everyone.

"Never Blew Me Away,","Arrival is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. It certainly shines in terms of its elements of Science Fiction, the special effects, sound design and cinematography are breathtaking, truly deserving of its Academy Award nominations and win in those categories. These elements come together to create truly engrossing spectacles of cinema.However, it failed to really engage me in to its story, trying to combine so many Sci-Fi elements while also remain grounded in reality. I never became certain of what this film was trying it be or what it wanted me to feel.The character development is also poor. While Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner certainly deliver top notch performances, because of the muted vibe this movie was going for, I was never given a reason to care about them, to want them to succeed or get together. We learn very little about them, trying to intrigue its audience, I merely become uninvolved with them and stopped caring about the story all together.Tries to shock, but instead tires.

A MASTERPIECE,"SPOILER-FREEAttention to anyone who's planning on watching this movie. If you going into this expecting the movie to be like Independence Day, Edge of Tomorrow (a very good movie regarless), or Battleship, then you will be deeply disappointed. This is not your typical alien invasion movie filled with non-stop action, and a gun-toting protagonist
who shouts profanity and spout random pop culture references. But that's okay, it doesn't need to be that kind of movie. There's plenty of movies out there to fill that void. This movie is more closer to something like 2001: A Space Odyssey, or Interstellar. It is movie full of concepts that challenge our mind. Yet, it somehow display a bigger simple theme than most movie. And really, that where it shines best.I was already a fan of Denis Villeneuve ever since I saw Sicario (another movie with a female protagonist). Sicario was my favorite movie of his. That is, until Arrival arrived (pun intended). This was his first big budget movie and it definitely catapulted him to become today's top new Hollywood director (his next project is Blade Runner. The movie is a slow-paced drama. Imagine it being like an onion. Until all the layers are peeled off, you won't really know what's really going on. Sure, there are hints around (I managed to figure out what the plot is about almost a 3/4 of my viewing), most would really just be scratching their head throughout the movie. But
the events that take around during the final few scenes, or after you have figured out what exactly happens, it is one of the most satisfying scene ever. Yet, somehow it can make us feel even sadder. And might even us question some of these ""bigger picture"" concept.The movie proves that us humans have these fundamental programs built into our minds. We will always fear what we don't understand. It is a notion that we can't deny or escape. It also have a very simple theme, yet we can all agree that we haven't been able to fulfill that very theme throughout most of our entire human race existence. The concept of the main heavy subject is even more applaudable when it is compared with the same concept in Islam. It has almost the same idea. But with a more imaginative execution. It also managed to fill just enough space for a fanatic sci-fi to watch it again. The scene where they first enter the heptapod is one of the most memorable scenes in sci-fi movies recently. So there's definitely enough discussion provided for just about the most of us.The first and final scenes were very strong, emotionally. It made us not just sympathise with the characters, it also made us feel like we're there with them because the theme is very universal. How would you feel if you have the same knowledge as Amy Adams' character, Louise Banks? The technical part of the movie is sublime too. The cinematography is mostly consists of these ""a sight to behold"" shots. It doesn't rely too much on CGI. So it definitely will stand the test of time. The score (sountrack for those not familiar with the term) are also gripping and catchy when it needs to. Particular for the first and final scene. It definitely contributed to those few teary eyes.Ultimately, this a must watch movie for most of us except for the hardcore popcorn cookie-cutter movies fan.

The Invasion of the Giant Octopi,"Amy Adams plays a cunning linquist who is so smart she's one of only two people in America, the other being a super scientist, to decipher the mumblings and groanings of giant octopus-like creatures like the kind you'd see in an aquarium, only much bigger. Be prepared for lots of interminable flashbacks between Adams and her dead? dying? comatose? daughter who plays with clay animals and whose name is a palindrome, Hannah, which is supposed to be deep, profound and significant.The octopi, whose are supposedly super-intelligent but can only write the letter ""O"" -- or is it zero? -- with some inky swirls are apparently benign and get along with Amy really swell. They're dubbed Abbott and Costello and any moment we can expect they'll do a who-s on first? routine in the heptopod language, which is briefly captioned so moviegoers can glean what's really on their minds.Amy not only learns to speak heptopod but also knows the leader of China who is fluent in English and whispers sweet nothings into her ear. She even has his personal cellphone number, which she eventually uses to save the planet from misunderstanding what the creatures really want: to give humanity a ""gift"" of some kind, apparently a promise not to do bad things to the earth.How this stinkbomb gets a 93% rating on RT and 8.5 on IDMB just goes to show how stupid human beings really are and need to be saved.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Sci-fi doesn't need lasers,"There's so much to say about this movie. It combines a great story with well-executed and intentional filmmaking. The black and gray palette contrasted with the warm orange shows up so much you can't help but feel the way they want you to, as the emotion is literally in the colors. Its sounds are so perfect and powerful that they stick with you. They add so much to the film and are so much more than just a layer of soundtrack. The use of silence, deep bass, and the canary all show up repeatedly, and they set the tone for each scene without standing out. My only complaint is that some of the exposition is handled clumsily.
As far as conclusions go, the way it ramps up to the denouement is very powerful and one that leaves you thinking even after the movie ends. It's complex, but after it's explained, it makes sense.

So try to open your mind a bit while watching this if you're not so interested in these two concepts.

Close Encounters meets Solaris meets 2001,"Sorry for the cheap shot title but basically that is what I am left thinking about Arrival upon viewing it. What is it with those bright directors that they feel compelled to do a philosophical movie about the meaning of life looking at the bigger picture of our place in the universe?In my mind you will never outdo Kubrick at that game. I know a lot of people find 2001 too abstract and are proud of calling it boring because, hey, they'd rather go philistine full-throttle than being mistaken for a snotty intellectual.Trite of passageTarkovski found 2001 lacked human emotions, so he did his sentimental take on it. Spielberg was interested in the topic and did his Capra-esque take on it. Denis Villeneuve might have wanted to do SF on a modest scale, so that script was an enticing approach. Fortunately he went on to make ""real SF"" and not the social science bookworm version of it.References aside Arrival is nicely wrapped up, a tad too full of itself but the topic requires it unless you want to take the risk of having your story bogged down. It is not a great movie for me, certainly not one I would watch again (and frankly I only watched it because it was directed by Denis Villeneuve). The linguistic aspect is remotely interesting, I mean you won't get the Indiana Jones thrill with linguistic puzzles. Now I am thinking of it I wonder why intelligent aliens would wait for someone to be able to communicate with them, so I would say the whole premise is not that clever.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I love everything about space and Aliens,"that said, I was so excited about this movie, but after watching I got a little disappointed.Don't get me wrong, the movie is really good, but I expected something much better. First of all the music feels so out of place, the prolonging in some scenes (I will not get into spoilers) gave me the feeling of boredom, the story is so exciting until you learn about the reason why the aliens are there, and how easy it was for them to just ""connect"" with humans, it makes the whole movie feel pointless.Denis Villeneuve is known for his slow paced movies, and his style feels somehow artistic in Arrival, but it could have gone better if he improved the way the story unfolds. I do not blame him though, I just expected something much better.eventually, I recommend this movie to everyone, it is a movie where all of us will understand the same thing, but each of us will feel differently about it, it has a nice touch of humanity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Phenomenal Masterpiece,"A good science fiction film with a twist that is not easily identifiable is an every day struggle to find for an educated and dedicated sci-fi fan. In comes ""arrival"" beautiful, poetic, and romantic with its stunning cinematography and the scores that take you back to classics like ""contact"" and ""sphere"". Amy's performance was breathtaking, I mean, I was literally hyperventilating with her. Her reactions are perfectly human and not at all ""hollywood-ised"" she is utterly relatable and her chemistry with Jeremy is beautiful. This film is the perfect mix of all the good things of an 80's sci-fi movie, partnered with beautiful CGI and a well written script coupled with stellar performances and a perfect twist. I will not spoil anything, but I will recommend this movie to everyone with highest praise. Happy watching",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Awful , boring and dull","An 'alien' film to leave you totally alienated! This is so self-important and ponderously dull that it makes Ingmar Bergman's depressive dramas seem like comic farces. The screenplay is all garbage and pretension in which Amy Adams' language specialist amazingly deciphers the black ink vocabulary of the extra-terrestrials in record breaking time. A feat that only ever happens in the movies. The creatures themselves look like a cross between giant squids and an elephant's foot, and it's no exaggeration to state that their presence is underwhelming. The first ten minutes promise much but we never get that film. Instead as soon as the alien pods arrive degeneration in to boredom is immediate and sleep inducing effective. Praised by the highbrow critics, make no mistake this is alarmingly over rated. A totally confused and uninteresting example of the sci-fi genre. Arrive? It certainly did. However, I couldn't wait to leave! Collapse",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Masterpiece, maybe not for everyone","I wasted an hour reading some of the negative reviews. Most of the 1-stars fall into a couple of buckets:A) They didn't pay attention, asking questions or pointing out ""holes"" that are clearly addressed in the movie. These people are just wrong and/or don't like movies that require focus.B) They don't understand the actual point of the movie. These ones are more understandable - but still wrong, IMO. In their defense, the marketing did make this seem more action-oriented.The point a lot of folks are missing is that this isn't really a story about aliens. Aliens and first contact are used to tell a story about how humans conceptualize time.The great tragedy that we must experience time linearly.The realization that experiencing time non-linearly would come with its own heartbreaking consequences.IMO, Arrival is fundamentally a thought-piece on Kierkegaard's famous quote: ""Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.""I can see why it'd be offputting to expect an action-packed alien flick and instead get a cerebral contemplation on the nature of time. That doesn't change that it's a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Excellent movie for those with brain power,"This is a well written and acted movie. Characters are very well thought out and pull you into their world. The plot is complex and younger viewers may have difficulty understanding the nuances even after it is over. This is definitely a rung or two beyond Doctor Strange and the other ""turn your mind off and watch"" types of movies. You really do need to pay attention in order to realize what is going on during each section of the movie. If you think scientifically you pick it up about 60% of the way through the movie but others never seem to really ""get it"". If you liked Momento, you will like this movie. The two have things in common with regards to a single aspect (Memory) yet nothing in common outside that one aspect. We noticed a number of adults also confused and still scratching their head at the end of the movie. Those with an average IQ may enjoy the movie but those with a bit more brain power will absolutely LOVE this movie's complexity.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Arrival: A Thought Provoking Film For Sci-Fi Lovers,"Dennis Villeneuve has created yet another excellent feature to add to his growing list of hits. Arrival is a visually stunning, thought provoking film that will keep the audience captivated from beginning to end. If you've seen Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, you'll notice many similar elements that have come to be a custom of the Sci-Fi genre.Arrival follows the protagonist Louise, a college professor and a leading figure in language translation, as she attempts to understand an alien language in hopes of answering one simple question, what it is that brought them to Earth.12 alien ships, giant black totem shaped stones, spread throughout earth with its' intents unknown to the world. It starts off as a race between nations to discover the secret of communicating with these beings. I would best describe them as tall octopus like creatures, with each of their long tentacles being used as their way of communication, releasing ink to create shapes and figures. There's a concise message on just how important language is to civilizations, and how the slightest misinterpretation could lead to devastating results.My last take away will be to praise Villeneuve's pacing of the film, he does it in such a way that reveals nothing too soon, but at the same time just enough to let the audience decide for themselves what the culmination of everything they've seen is leading towards. I look forward to watching the future work of an incredible film maker.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An interesting take on a very common theme,"Despite the marketing suggesting the idea that the film is more of a thriller, Arrival is actually more of a psychological drama centered on humanity.Amy Adams plays Louise, a linguistic professor, who is enlisted by the Army to communicate with an alien species that mysteriously arrived on earth in 12 ships spread across the world.The film is directed by Denis Villeneuve whose previous films I haven't actually seen but he definitely seems like a capable director. His style resembles that of Christopher Nolan due to his use of minimal lighting, shallow depth of field, and epigrammatic storytelling. But just like Christopher Nolan's films, sometimes the story can get weighed down by all of its complexity.The beginning of the film is, in my opinion, the strongest section. The director does an excellent job of approaching this common story of aliens in a very pragmatic way. We feel the uneasiness of the sudden situation that mankind finds itself in. When Louise is approached by the Army and becomes involved, we understand her desperation to be a part of it. This eventually leads to the first contact, which was an incredibly suspenseful collection of scenes. But once that moment finally came, the rest of the film started to feel sluggish.The bulk of the film is Louise attempting to tactfully communicate with the aliens in order to ask the big question: What is your purpose on Earth? The problem is that despite how interesting it was to see how a linguist would break down a language, the film comes to an absolute stand still. There is montages, narrations, and random visions that push the story along but the scenes felt dragging and out of place. It isn't until towards the end that everything starts to pick back up again. Once the big question was finally answered by the aliens, I found the outcome quite grandiose. Then when the twist came, despite figuring it out beforehand, I felt like I was misled. Don't get me wrong, it connected everything. But in the end I just didn't really understand certain character motives.Even though the film has its share of small flaws, Arrival is still deserving of a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This Movie Broke Me,"From all of the excellent reviews and the enthralling trailers, I had incredibly high expectations for the movie Arrival as I was walking into my local theater. I left the theater almost on the verge of a panic attack with my expectations obliterated after the movie ended. Arrival was the most breathtaking and powerful films that I have ever seen, and I can honestly say that I have never had so strong of a reaction to a movie in my entire life. From the heartfelt cold open, to the appearance of ""Arrival"" signaling the ending of the movie, I believe that it was as close as a film can come to being perfect. The emotional perfection of the movie's climax was almost too much for me to handle, and it brought out a reaction in myself that I've only experienced when reading books (mainly from Robin Hobb and Patrick Rothfuss).It was a joy to see a true Hard Science-Fiction story on the big screen, and Denis Villeneuve has proved once again to be a masterful director. Every frame of this film is incredibly gorgeous, and I honestly don't know how some of it was filmed, as things that have to be CGI look so real. There is so much I could say about the movie, but I want to avoid any chance of spoilers. However, I will say that the design of the aliens and their language was incredibly interesting, original, and beautiful. I loved how the creators of the movie embraced the fact that if we do ever meet any alien species, they are not going to look anything like us or immediately be able to communicate with Humanity. It's very interesting how the movie handles deciphering the Heptapod's language and teaching them our language, and while some could find these moments boring, for me they were engrossing. I wouldn't have minded even more scientific examination of linguistics and translating the language that bears no resemblance to anything created on Earth.This movie may not be for everyone, but depending on how it holds up after multiple viewings, I might have a new movie in my personal Top 10 Films of All Time. I highly recommend it, and if you want to see a video of my full review where I go into spoilers for the second half, it can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95ofAsrVZ6g",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Good film with cheating story telling,"This review is spoiler free, so I have to be wary of saying too much. I hope anybody who has seen the film gets my gist. I liked Arrival and it is a good film. Amy Adams is stellar throughout and she really carries the film. The concept is intriguing and thought provoking and I enjoyed it, but I was left with a few ""why"" questions so I needed to watch parts of the film again. Some people have said they had some problem following the ending of the film and that is their fault. The film makes very clear what has happened. However if you remember the beginning, that's where your confusion will come. They surprise us by using nefarious tactics to ensure that we are surprised by the film's end. Considering how strong the topics of this film are, it's a shame they copped out with tricky story telling to add to our suspense, especially considering how suspenseful the story is. It's not smart sci-fi as a result and it should have been",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Hollywood CAN make straight-up sci-fi!,"Most of the 'sci-fi' from big studios feels more like watching someone playing a video game, with maximum action per-frame. Not that there's anything wrong with that. To my mind, great sci-fi makes the viewer think about stuff they never considered. Or ponder mundane things in unimagined ways. I found Arrival immensely satisfying in the way my favorite sci-fi books did. Like Clarke's Childhood's End or Card's Ender series, the scope of the story continues to build - as do the repercussions. The story ends at a very different place ....or at least with the attentive viewer in a very different place than they were likely at when the movie began. I must say, the quiet yet unsettling way the film begins had me hooked from the start. I admit I had flashbacks to the chills I had on 9/11 when it finally hit me that 'everything has instantly changed in ways I couldn't imagine. What do I do now?' And I ended up going through the mundane motions trying to internally digest this profound and jarring paradigm shift. If you want an action flick like Independence Day or Armageddon, look elsewhere. If you want a film that stays with you and haunts you - like Children of Men... then maybe you'll like Arrival. Everyone in the cast and crew deserve every accolade and award they're nominated for. Above all, if this film isn't nominated for 'best adapted screenplay' there is no justice. I have not seen a film that lived up to my unrealistic anticipation in a long long time. Arrival is truly special and I hope becomes a classic of the sci-fi genre. It's too soon to tell, but I would not be surprised if it ends up at or near the top of most folks' top sci-fi films (or simply story) lists. Profound thanks to everyone who had a hand in making this haunting, eye- opening film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Arrival will become a sci-fi classic,"Arrival was my most anticipated movie of 2016 and upon seeing it I can surely say that it was definitely not what I expected, but it certainly impressed me.Denis Villeneuve is one of my favorite modern directors and has an admirable track record including Sicario, Prisoners and Enemy. Being a fan of all three of these films, I was very excited to see Denis tackle the broad spectrum of sci-fi. But Denis took a very different approach to the ""alien invasion"" genre and it completely paid off. Arrival is a much needed fresh breath of air within the science-fiction world and will be among the year's best films.To start, Amy Adams' performance is Oscar-worthy. Her character goes through so many stages of emotions throughout the movie and Amy Adams perfectly captures these emotions, mostly without dialogue. This is very impressive. Jeremy Renner did a good job as well, even though his character wasn't really necessary within the movie. He isn't really given much screen time to really develop and he lacks ""the scene"" that solidifies his position in the story. The same can be said for Forest Whitaker's character. Because Arrival is more focused on these characters rather than our otherworldly visitors, this could be seen as a glaring issue, but the character's interactions are well done when they have to be.All of Villeneuve's other films are beautifully shot using many different methods of angles, colors, symbolism and scale. Arrival follows this template and is one of the most stunning films of the decade. The circulating shot in which we see the visitors for the first time is utterly spectacular, with rolling fog briefly disguising the alien monolith. It is one of the most memorable and breathtaking scenes from any film in recent years. The entire movie looks visually stunning, from the green Montana valley where our story unfolds, to the ancient alien architecture. The ""heptapods"" also look awesome, but not overdone. Many sci-fi movies want to show us too much of their alien creations, which usually leads to eye-rolling when our expectations aren't met, but Arrival gave us just enough to satisfy our curiosity without going overboard and destroying the feeling of intense realism. Arrival is overall a visually breathtaking experience with it's immense beauty reflective among the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey.The music is also fantastic. From unsettling, soft choir hymns to bold and bombastic strings, the music is not present throughout the entire film but kicks in at just the right moments to accompany the films best scenes.The films story is simple overall but takes an unexpected twist during the last third. This twist is brilliantly done and doesn't even feel remotely gimmicky. Once you figure the twist out, going back through the movie in your head to notice new little details is fun and even goose- bump inducing. This twist gives a whole new feeling of humanity within this alien ""invasion"" story and propelled the film so much further than I would've ever have expected it to go.Arrival is just as much about human nature and psychology as it is about alien study. Unlike many other films within the genre, the human aspects of the story are just as good as the alien's.I had only a few minor gripes with Arrival and that involves the galactic tourists showcased within the film. The ""main question"" that Arrival revolves around is never fully answered, and when it was, it seemed to be glossed over quickly as just a minor plot detail. There should have been a little more explanation on the ""big question"" because it seemed to be more of a marketing scheme that was never fully addressed within the movie itself. Another small issue was the process of learning their ""language"" and specifically how fast it happened. It seemed like one second we were trying to figure if the aliens even knew what words are, and the next they're speaking fluidly with the creatures. While it probably would have been impossible to explain the decoding of the language to the audience, it would have been nice to see the movie try.Overall, Arrival is a visually stunning and beautiful story of human nature and our interaction with otherworldly beings. It feels extremely realistic in a way no other science-fiction movie has managed before, almost so real it could pass as a documentary. Arrival is a sci-fi classic, not just for our time, but for the times to come. Future generations will see Arrival as we see 2001: A Space Odyssey. And it totally deserves it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Not enough entertainment to me,"Without honest Arrival is a kind of movie that critics like. To me it is too familiar and feels old fashion. The theme of Arrival has been be tangent in some Star Trek episodes and because of that it doesn't feel fresh idea to me. Arrival is a good movie, but somehow predictable and way too slow. As an episode of a television series it might work, but as a two hour movie it is simply too long. Even plot feels somehow clumsy. If you want to make serious science fiction film sappy romance won't be a part of it. Especially when chemistry between lead actors doesn't feel right in any level. End scene of the movie is also stupid and hasty. There is no real meaning for the aliens and suddenly they just disappear???. Beside all that Arrival is a quite good movie. It is not bad, simply too long and slow. It is a kind of movie that make movie critics pee honey. I am sorry to say that Arrival is not movie to me, even probably many people likes it.

Movies like this are so hard to finish, and perhaps it could have done more, but it would have run the risk of turning more toward the action-sci-fi. I don't think I would have minded a bit of that, but it's not what the movie was about. The acting is understated but on point.

Just amazing...,"Screenwriter Eric Heisserer originally read this science fiction story. It had a profound effect on him, and he pushed for it to be made into a movie.I can see why. This is a great story. The idea of a human first contact story with aliens is incredibly hard to make. We have some many pre concieved ideas about it, its sort of corny, there are really limited things that can happen...are we dealing with rubber aliens, etc.Despite this, the movie is a complex story, about human emotion, love, family, and humanity.Amy adams, Jeremy Renner are both excellent in this, expecially Adams, the film largely centres on her.

Undamaged & Superb Insurrection For Hollywood Science Fiction,"The vastness of human pragmatism that science fiction can encompass is unheard-of. It's been circumscribed erroneously with the epigraph about the impossibility of its acts, it's paradoxical to look back and itemize any minutia of our history emerged with a ""that never will happen"" or a ""this is impossible"". And here we're, where was such a the conception of logic and fairness when a group of German Jews and Aryan citizens decided by 44% of utilitarian votes that a midget beast to head up Germany and the selfsame world into a cyclone of blood to the unforgiving netherworld? Or, where was equal, liberating and fair American people who asserted equality and pluralism when they elected a Republican Presbyterian with a citrus wig to lead the crux of the universe?, There is where the literary and film well-known adage glow to its highest expression: ""reality surpasses fiction"". Although modern events are or were influenced by constraint, opinion disparities, ambition or vileness, the other piece has invested us partially as equality organisms in terms of race and eliminator of misogyny. We've got over cataclysms, world wars or an everyday interpersonal uproar, we've interred pride and unified us as human beings in a universal manner; at present, we shouldn't look beyond the stars, we have to plan to get beyond them.Sci-fi genre takes the Maremagnum of a discipline to the extreme in a context in which there may be a high, medium, or minimum probability nature, having the chance to provide certain bi-dimensional items to the work called fiction. It can either derail astray by slated and mostly deficient burial of science opportunities and overflowing imagination until the chimeric (""Star Wars"" & ""Star Trek""), or otherwise, it can avail itself a global thesis supported by foundations with scientific sustenances to a greater or lesser extent, relegating the creative freedom. Big exponents have sprung up in recent decades since Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg gave terror and erudition in the obligatory sci-fi classics of the past (""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Alien"").As its title suggests, the plot revolves around the unplanned landing of twelve alien spaceships, which are likened the 2001 monolith of ""A Space Odyssey""; spectral figures, extraterrestrial resources, those who have arrived with own aim. The ship in which the story focus is one that touched down a few meters away from the greenish surface of Montana, USA. It's so like the American people to first examine and then proceed, using the head rather than the force; thus the US government decides to hire seasoned in dead and alive languages, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) in order to investigate succinct stimulus of its visit. However, they stumble on more unknowns than elucidations due to the harsh context where they're. May do ""they"" use some kind of informational exchange? How will ""they"" discern what they want to express? May do ""they"" grasp human reasoning? It's right here where previously treated space-time works, blended with a linguistic atmosphere which portrayed, in the background, paranoia, and informality of human reaction facing a critical contingency. We're involved in Louise's circumstances, but suddenly, we may feel reflected as in her indigo eyes as in Ian's or anyone's eyes who may be experiencing such an event; the film is about finding a ""why"" about ourselves, not about them. Will we be the threat?""I don't believe in starts or finals"", with this direct thought in voice-over is shaped in front of us a so-called muddled narration; the confidences were within our reach, however, the only thing we did was continue to attest the shortcomings of our language, cemented in times as yesterday, today and tomorrow. Everything makes sense with the concluding scenes of diegetic meaning, clearing up the general purpose of its arrival, donating a gift as harmful as utilitarian for a society who is at Apocalypse's edge. In that moment, we noticed that in the same way she did in ""Nocturnal Animals"", Adams has teased our intellectual coefficient, has attained that we continue under a spell the MacGuffin for, in the last snap, reveal us that was something more intimate, something about you and I that exceeds the rational, something more complex that one invasion; It's a musing about humanity breaks points, and that actually, is the role of Villeneuve's fiction: elucidating by its semiological proposal, the flaws of communication and understanding of the human race, our contraction against fate, our damaged governmental organization, our lack of sensitivity; We're human because someone gives us such seal, but in the cruelest truth, we're primitive societies adorned as organized.A calm pace, measured action, and limited literal entertainment; they want we read about above-mentioned by the language of the celluloid in a noticeable way, it's said that ""reading is work"", the speaker sets a code to which the speaker and receiver assign it the same meaning, there's no a common code, the listener shall decipher the code of the way in which the statement reveals it. They don't want you go to see a film, they demand you watch a reality.An experience that must be pressing for that sci-fi fan who based its passion for rational causes and effects, besides, it ratifies Amy Adams' overwhelming acting ability and thrives on the potential of its director and team resulting in a work worthy of being appended beyond fiction stories, where's the raw essence of cinema. A story glides through few settings with meager lighting, giving priority to the language and the context, discarding dispensable technical terms and CGI sequences to reveal caustically in the last five minutes that nothing has a start and a terminal; paraphrases aren't always put on the table. Why are they here? The gift bequeathed to us was a simple tool, which serves as a duct to carry out sublimely moral, emotional, political, human, philosophical and, at the last stay, cinematographic choices.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Amongst the best movies of the year,"The year 2016 has not been a very good one for any avid moviegoer as it is filled with mediocrity. It has not been a complete disaster though and there were still quite a lot of movies that were worth the watch. The ones that can be considered as the cream of the crop however have been few and far in between. For these reasons it almost feels like a small celebration when a movie releases that appears to fit into the last category. In a lot of ways this seemed to be the case for 'Arrival' as almost everything surrounding this movie seemed to suggest that this was going to a modern- day masterpiece or at the very least the greatest movie of the year. It featured an amazing cast and all of the media released beforehand was beautiful to look at. If the past has thought us anything it is almost a fact that movies with sky high expectations like these can only be a disappointment. Can 'Arrival' live up to the hype?The story of 'Arrival' is centered around Dr. Louise Banks, a world renown linguist played by Amy Adams. The life of Dr. Banks changes dramatically when aliens land in twelve different locations around the globe. The United States calls upon Dr. Banks to find the answer to one simple question: ""Why are they here?"" At the helm is the critically acclaimed director Denis Villeneuve who has been on fire in the last couple of years with movies such as 'Incendies', 'Sicario' and one of my personal favourites 'Prisoners'. Once again Villeneuve, together with cinematographer Bradford Young, has managed to create a gorgeous looking movie. Almost every shot is simply mesmerizing to look at and a few made my jaw figuratively drop in amazement. All the shots merge together into one interwoven web of beauty and it isn't hard to argue that 'Arrival' is the best looking movie of the year. Ever present throughout the film is a great sense of tension that will keep many sitting on the edge of their seat. This tension paired with the relative slow pace of most shots and a soundtrack that is often oozing with theme represents a firm grip that never lets go once it has gotten a hold of the audience. My eyes were simply glued to the screen wanting to take in everything this movie had to offer.Part of this can also be attributed towards the story this movie tells. The idea of aliens landing on the planet is not very unique, however the manner it is presented in is anything but. Following Dr. Banks' journey in understanding these aliens was incredibly fun and the manner they interacted with one another felt very realistic. Most events surrounding Dr. Banks also feel very real and it isn't hard to imagine that should aliens visit us in real life it'll look similar to how it is presented in this movie. The story 'Arrival' tells could easily have been one of the best we've seen in recent years, but there are certain elements which keeps it from reaching its full potential. Certain events feel forced or are simply glossed over, present are a handful of potholes and quite a few characters feel useless in comparison to Dr. Banks. There's also a bit of narration present in the middle of the movie which feels very awkward and misplaced and when the story of 'Arrival' meets its end it wraps up a little too neatly. A bit more polish should have gone into the storytelling however as it stands this still is one of the most interesting stories you'll be able to see in cinemas this year with a final act that makes the entire movie appear in a different light.Something I cannot speak highly enough of is the superb acting from the main cast. Amy Adams in particular really gave her all with a performance that was absolutely stellar. Often without words she shows that there is more to her character than meets the eye and there is always a sense of an emotional struggle going on within her. Jeremy Renner, as Dr. Banks' love interest and physicist Ian Donnelly, also brought a great performance and the only real criticism would be that Renner does not always convey the sense that he understands what he is saying when he's talking about science related topics. Given his performance it is sad to see that the movie did not give his character the attention it deserved and that, in the grand scheme of things, his character did not attribute to all that much. The performances of Renner and Adams on their own are superb, what's even better though is the great chemistry between them and overall it was a lot of fun to see them interact with one another on the big screen.Ultimately 'Arrival' did not achieve my unrealistically high expectations and it certainly wasn't the masterpiece it very easily could have been. It still is a very solid movie that most definitely deserves its spot amongst the best movies of the year. The acting performances 'Arrival' has to offer are incredible and the visual style of Denis Villeneuve is even more amazing. I do think that this is a movie that can only be fully appreciated after a second watch and as of right now I can only rate it a slightly conservative 8 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Not an invasion movie,I have just seen the arrival and overall it is a good movie. If you are expecting to see some serious fights and mind blowing action scenes between aliens and humans well this movie is not for you. The arrival is a very human movie around 12 alien space crafts showing up overnight and the events fallow the incident. It allows the audience to be able to see the human nature and all our primitiveness behind our technology and science. Throughout the movie one can see how hostile and paranoid we can be towards each other as humanity and as nations. We have very little faith in unity and almost every time we prefer fighting over reasoning. The story is good and catchy. Acting is also good. A good sci-fi movie with a story to tell...,8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A psyche-centred sci-fi work of art!,"A very thoughtfully made and thought-provoking movie. It balances extremely well an intimate look into the heroine's psyche with an original sci-fi premise. The heroine makes an enticing and touching character. Amy Adams' sensitive, even subdued (yet not muted!) performance is aided by a calm and supportive role played by Jeremy Renner, and a piercing performance from Forest Whitaker. They all help to create a low-key and very convincing atmosphere. Director Denis Villeneuve shows great skill in combining drama with a small and highly believable selection of visual effects which is done with the utmost attention to detail and show a true sense of aesthetic vision. This aspect of the movie is very impressive especially when considering the many temptations and over-the-top results out there nowadays... The design department and especially the conceptual artists who created the ships, aliens and visual symbols are worthy of praise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Too much drama, not enough sci-fi elements.","Arrival follows the same line of sci-fi movies that in recent years has infected Hollywood.The studios hold up known actors (we know how they will react or act in each situation - to ensure a fat box- office), a director known to the general public and who has a few well received films on the critics, and try to create these supposed sci-fi movies very close to the scientific aspect of science and reality. But without ever representing science or scientists as they really are. Putting thus absurd ideas, nothing to do with reality, and in the middle of the film, transform it into a drama (sometimes in a melodrama - Interstellar), in order to try to manipulate the audience, emotionally.Arrival is the other of this new sci-fi wave, it is beautifully photographed, with great special effects, excellent soundtrack (which does not represent the quality of the technical team at all, only that the director and the producers have a big budget to spare at will), but in the background these new movies are not sci-fi movies in any aspect.But things are starting to fall in the last act of the film, when filmmakers have to appeal to the emotional side. How can you make a movie about an alien invasion, and in the middle of the movie, turns it into a drama? That is right, because of that there is not enough tension, and the movie fell into the middle.The sci-fi elements are few and far between. The sci-fi aspect of the film simply disappears, and the film itself becomes a basic drama with a political aspect of not offending anyone. At the end of the film the main character convinces a political leader in such a simple way, without proof.Not only that, but the Aliens aspect also bothers, the aliens do not even look like aliens, but sea squid and use oil to communicate, is this a joke.This movie has more holes than a Swiss cheese. Seriously, a soldier tries to explode with the spot where the aliens appear every eight hours, after seeing a t.v. report on the TV show. Such an important act and then this same character left the narrative of the film, after provoking an event as important as an explosion, without any explanation.A feather, an annoyance without size. I do not recommend. This movie will certainly be a hit at the 2017 Oscar. Because of the message of the Political correctness that this film tries to pass.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Thinking person's sci-fi.,"Villeneuve indeed has taken advantage of the latest trend of Alien's obsession with Amy Adams in which is, perhaps, the best film of either one's career. Building slowly and potently into the viewers mind, although slightly marred by a somewhat disjointed second act, Villeneuve's approach easily overtakes previous films with similar plot points by making the best use of an impeccable technical team in service of a sharp emotional script by Eric Heisserer. To further discuss the film without spoiling it is next to impossible. Everything from the premise, to the title and to the imagery are clues and spoilers to the film's purpose. Here's hoping, and it certainly is looking like it, that this venture into the sci-fi genre is justly rewarded come award season in more than the technical categories. Villeneuve, Adams and Heisserer certainly deserve so.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A been-there-seen-that movie with substantial flaws,"This decade has made happen dozens of sci-fi movies with activities in a limited space and time, with slow pace and lengthy speculations about mankind's present and future. On the usual line, I am not into similar productions, but the reputation of the movie and it awards ""urged"" us in a group to pick the one in question.We all watched the movie in full, but all of us had several misunderstandings and indistinct places solved only afterwards, when reading about its plot... Vague flashbacks, strange behavior of characters in clear situations, and settlements based on Western approaches made this a topsy-turvy watch, with trivial ending and naive conclusions. And as a linguist, I know that one is unable to figure out a totally different language/pictograph in a way we see in this movie. Bringing the Western wishful thinking into the minds of non-human aliens may flatter some part of respective audience, but it is neither scientific nor logical approach... And if the basics is totally odd, then the following events do not make any good sense, particularly when bearing in mind a sci-fi movie.Therefore, for me, Arrival is above mediocrity due to the direction and leading performances only (Amy Adams as Louise Banks and Forest Whitaker as Colonel Weber, above all). The overall concept is unreasoned and necessitates to refer to its plot description later on for some of its angles and ideas.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"The Arrival is an entertaining well made film, until you get to the ending.","The First thing that i like in the movie is that i like the depiction of the aliens. How they tried to interact with them using a certain language. I was trying to imagine that perhaps if this scenario happens in real life we would be facing similar problems. I also like the mystery in trying to understand their language and i felt that part was executed well and the cast were outstanding.What i don't like however is that on paper the story is very thin and it lacks substance. What i like most about the film about the aliens weren't as fleshed out as i would like to know more about them and their predicament after 3000 years as they said. Near the end, it feels like it was rushed and that the time-travelling part was quite out of place. It felt like it was a cheap way of using deus ex machina in order to put the protagonists role in the story..I enjoyed the movie for the most part.

How a 'First Contact' Would Really Go...,"This movie shows exactly how a 'First Contact' of an alien species would probably go here on Earth. All the military, mostly male gendered, persons around the world would want to kill the aliens at first sight because men destroy as a general rule. Most women however would want to do as Amy Adams' character did, communicate with the alien species. Try to figure out a common ground, because this is what most women do, they create and choose Harmony and peace over War. No matter how benign the aliens seem, and these aliens seem benign in just their physical form, most of the world would want to harm them versus helping them. After all the alien takeover/ invasion movies, it was nice to see one who showed how a 'First Contact' should be, that is if it were up to us women.

"Very good, if a little on the slow side.  Thoughtful and thought provoking Sci fi.","If you are looking for Star Wars levels of excitement stop right here. This is the wrong movie.If you love Terence Malick step this way.OK, so we have hopefully established that this is thinking man and women's sci-fi. By that I mean it's quite slow.But it's beautiful and crafted and emotionally engaging. The Aliens that arrive on earth in 12 seemingly unrelated locations do not appear to be warmongers, but are they? What is their motive? To find that out humankind will need to collaborate globally in finding a common language or means to communicate.That's gonna be tricky when three of the countries involved (Russia, China and Pakistan) are not commonly associated with collaborative political working (a bit too much Cold War/Axis of Evil rhetoric here for my liking) and indeed these are the three countries that prove most troublesome and potentially trigger-happy in the plot.Throughout, I was wondering what would happen here if this was real and Donald Trump was in office. It doesn't bear thinking about frankly.Anyway, thankfully for humankind it's Amy Adams as a poly linguistic professor called Fiona that's in charge of negotiations with the Montana located spaceship full of Heptapods (7 legged floating Octopi). Beautifully and sympathetically rendered.Her accession to the post is a direct result of her in depth understanding of the Sanskrit word for war and its meaning (A desire for more cattle) unlike her potential competitor.(Blink and you'll miss that.)Forest Whitaker recruits Adams, playing a passable General in charge of alien negotiation, and Adams is joined in her quest by mathematician Ian played in a nicely understated fashion by the always excellent Jeremy Renner.But this is Adams' movie (she's a n increasingly class act) and it's obvious why she is receiving Oscar nods (I doubt this is a winning role though).Like everything about this understated movie the cinematography and special effects are designed to seduce rather than excite, but for me Bradford Young's Dickensian lighting underwhelmed rather than understated.Johan Johannson's music is a big plus. It underscores beautifully and clearly takes some cues from Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Indeed this is the movie that it most resonates with; that and 2001 A Space Odyssey.The back story of Adams' life has a brilliant twist that uncoils slowly but surely and makes the whole a deliciously complex tale to unravel.It's worth it in my opinion; but not my companion's, who opined that it was ""two hours of my life I won't get back, even if Jeremy Renner is nice to look at"".Way above average, thoughtful, slow moving but grown up sic-fi.Just don't expect Jedi forces.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

In fact, the intention is also scrutinized by other researchers and analysts about the arrival of alien, a painstaking examination and broadening the insights of the people and helping them uncover the esoteric facts about the purpose.
Moreover, it was the movie drawing the attention with its gloomy atmosphere, protecting its mystery till the end. It is definitely the distinguished masterwork of Denis Villeneuve. He knows how to shoot science fiction and mystery sorts, having plenty of competencies and skills concerning the production of science-fiction.

Very High Anticipation Factor,"12 elliptical spheres come to Earth and settle down in 12 geographical locations worldwide. All know they are UFOs and why are they here? What do they want? Are they friendly? What do they want? Why are they here? What do they want? Is there an echo in here? Linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and Theoretical Physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) are brought in to communicate with the aliens to find out if they are friendly and why they are here and what do they want?We can be somewhat thankful that the US Army doesn't bring all their tanks and fighter jets to confront the Alien ships as we have seen in many Sci-Fi stories of the past. No, we see a more civilized approach, but Louise and Ian are as confused as we are.This is slow-going, and we keep waiting for something to happen that will benefit mankind. Isn't that why movies are made? Ooops, my mistake.Okay, long story short the Aliens are here to give mankind a gift now because in the future - in 3000 years - they will need our help in return. When you find out what that gift, is email me so I will know. One could say the gift is for the nations of the world to find a way to work together to avoid destroying themselves. You buy that? Louise does ask them how do they know the future? How indeed?We see Louise struggle with trying to communicate with aliens who look like giant squids and we see-flashbacks with her daughter Hannah leaning about language and emotions.

Best Movie of the Year?,"Arrival is the story of first contact between humanity and alien life, and how this first contact affects and shapes the globe. It is both epic and intimate in it's scope, focussing primarily on a linguist, Louise, as she attempts to communicate with the creatures. The whole movie is based around an element of first contact that is all-too-often glossed over entirely; communication. It evolves into a tense cat and mouse as eleven different nations try to figure out why the Heptapods are here and what they want, but refuse to share information with anyone but their political allies.The very first thing that surprised me about Arrival was it's emotional resonance. The movie opens with a heartbreaking string arrangement and a series of scenes that shows Louise's relationship with her daughter, leading to the tragic death at a young age. The movie had barely even started and I was already on the verge of tears. As Louise starts to unravel the mysteries of the alien writing she's given, she starts to see more and more of her daughter as they broach closer and closer to flat out hallucination (without going all the way, I might add).Being a Villeneuve movie you'll know, especially if you've seen Sicario, the level of tension he is able to create, and it is used here in spades. I mean this is very first contact with an alien species. This is a humanity-changing event. Arrival doesn't let you forget how monumental an occasion this is, and it puts you right in the characters shoes as they first encounter this new, unknown life. The first ascent to the ship is one of the best scenes I've experienced in a long time, and it is an experience. It harks back to Kubrick's 2001 in it's marriage of music and cinematography, amping up the suspense bit by bit as more and more is slowly revealedTalking of cinematography, the whole movie is breathtaking to watch. Louise's first glimpse of the shell, surrounded by rolling clouds flowing over the hills is captivating and perfect for setting the mood. But it doesn't let up, using times of day really well, like sunsets and sunrises to show not only the passage of time, but offer a glimpse into the character's feelings at the time. The use of composition and framing is not lacking either, especially in that first ascent into the shell, with long slow shots of the dark exterior framing the white wall at the other end.The visual effects as well are on another level. For the most part at least. The design of the Heptapods is harrowing, making their first appearance a sight that truly takes your breath away. As we see more and more of them, the sheer attention to detail employed by the effects team is nothing short of impressive. Even as Louise hallucinates to one appearing in her room, it looks so life-like and real. I had to constantly remind myself that they weren't real, because without knowing otherwise, I would've had no idea. Even the way they move is trance-like. The only criticism I had with the effects, and in fact the whole movie, was one sequence late in the movie where Amy Adams' hair is CGI'd to flow and move as if underwater, or without gravity. It was the only time the effects just didn't work and actually looked unbelievable. They should've just filmed her, at least partially, underwater to get that more realistic sense of how hair looks and behaves in that environment.The music was another massive strength of Arrival. The score by Jóhann Jóhannson is haunting, filled with alien sounds that sound like nothing that could be recreated on this plane of existence. It massive sounding horn sections burst in and out with such urgency that they make you sit up in your seat and pay attention, and the amount of tension brought in by the deep drones of cellos and tubas is palpable. There's also great use of a choir that adds a new dimension every now and then, just to underscore the orchestral arrangements. The film is also bookended with a very emotional piece by Max Richter called On The Nature of Daylight, and it punctuates and enhances the emotional resonance of those scenes perfectly, while also tying into something the movie references a lot, which is loops, circles, palindromes. It brings the end back to the beginning, showing that the music is not an afterthought when it comes to Villeneuve's approach to filmmaking.Arrival is a big contender for my movie of the year so far. Once the credits rolled, I was overwhelmed with feelings and thoughts and couldn't move for a few minutes. I spent the entire journey home in complete silence reflecting on what I had just witnessed. This is an alien invasion movie unlike any I have seen before, promoting peace and unity and hope like no other. It throws you in the deep end immediately with a heartbreaking tragedy that goes on to define the whole, breathtaking encounter. It makes a point not to answer every question you might have so as not to dilute and distract from the main focus of the story. And that twist in the final act genuinely blew my mind. Wow. I give Arrival a very high 9/10, and I'd be lying if I didn't say I was tempted to give it a full 10. Maybe on subsequent re-watches I'll have to come back and bump it up a bit. This is sci-fi at it's strongest, and I urge everyone to spare some time to go and see this. The big screen and top-notch surround sound of a cinema is absolutely the best way to watch this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"""Arrival"": A ""Little Green Men Land on Earth"" Saga for the Thoughtful","""Arrival"" is the story of a global alien invasion. Though this is far from the familiar fodder of ""our planet is in peril from intergalactic creatures intending malice and mayhem"". Instead, Director Denis Villeneuve (""Sicario"") has fashioned an intriguingly different approach, one of a foreign force from the far reaches of outer space whose primary intent seems to lie in occupying and manipulating the human mind and soul.And while it is about 25 or 30 minutes too long, the dialogue is often muddled (not counting that of the giant intruders) and several of the scenes are so dark it is a real struggle to distinguish what exactly is happening, I found ""Arrival"" to be a mostly creditable use of nigh on two hours of my earthly existence.Amy Adams (""Nocturnal Animals"") is quite good here as Louise Banks, a linguistics expert who is charged by the U.S. military with the monumental task of attempting to ascertain what it is that these who have trespassed against us are efforting to communicate. What she ends up learning will profoundly change her life. This discovery is viewed almost as a blessing in the context of the narrative.

Why are they here and how do we communicate with them?,"""Arrival"" (2016 release; 116 min.) brings the story of a group (12, to be exact) spaceships arriving on earth, and how mankind deals with it. As the movie opens, we see a woman (Louise, we later learn) with her daughter over the years, with her daughter passing away due to a rare disease. What is going on here? Louise turns out to be a linguist, and when a spaceship arrives in Montana, she is recruited as a translator. Turns out the aliens are ""talking"" through complex symbols. At this point, we are less than 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, one of my favorite film makers of this generation. He is on an amazing streak of quality movies. His movie from last year ""Sicario"" was my No. 1 movie of the year, and before that he brought us ""Enemy"", ""Prisoners"" and ""Incendies"". Here, he goes sci-fi, with the arrival of aliens, and leaving us wonder ""why are they here?"" and ""How do we communicate with them?"". If you are expecting an all-out sci-fi action movie (think ""Independence Day""), you will be sorely mistaken, as this is more the ""brainy"" type of a sci-fi movie. Think more ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", minus the action scenes, and with tons more of ""attempting to communicate"" scenes. Despite the mostly serious tone of the movie, there are some lighter moments too. After the very first attempt to communicate with the aliens goes nowhere, Louise asks the Army Colonel ""Am I fired?"", ha! Amy Adams (as Louise), Jeremy Renner (as the scientist) and Forest Whitaker (as the Colonel) are fine in the lead roles, but really take a backseat to the overall sci-fi setting of the movie. The photography is outstanding, and sometimes pure eye-candy. Last but not least, there is an outstanding soundtrack, courtesy of Johann Johannsson (who also provided the score for last year's ""Sicario"").""Arrival"" opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (but wasn't anywhere close to a sell-out). If you are in the mood for an 'intellectual' sci-fi that takes another look at the eternal issues confronting mankind when aliens come to earth (why are they here and how do we communicate with them), then this movie is right on target, and worth checking out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.

"Life Arises in ""Arrival""","""Arrival"" is beautiful. The first 3 minutes tell the heartfelt story of Mother and Daughter with few words. It fondly reminds of the movie ""Up"". The story resonates to our very souls. Here crying at the beginning of a movie is a good thing. All is not exactly what it seems, illuminating untold possibilities to come. That is part of the beauty of ""Arrival"". Amy Adams as Louise narrates, ""There are days that define your story."" ""Arrival"" embraces life in absolutely surprising ways.Eric Heisserer wrote the screenplay based on Ted Chiang's ""Story of Your Life""; its title starts making sense. This is much more than an alien encounter movie. Director Denis Villenueve's ""Arrival"" is about the power of stories to inspire and define life. Amy Adams is amazing as Dr. Louise Banks, the linguistics professor, who must decipher the language and intentions of alien visitors to Earth. Adams embodies graceful humanity as Louise in her transformational journey from fear to wonder. Life is created and exists in our language. ""Arrival"" reminds us.The sights and sounds of ""Arrival"" awe. Composer Johann Johannsson's score effortlessly captures the currents of emotion. Bradford Young's cinematography is brilliant. From the enormous scale of the Alien monoliths around the world to the isolation of Louise's room, he seamlessly fuses the story with clarity. Villenueve orchestrates these sights, sounds, and authentic performances to tell a story that moves us.Dr. Louise Banks (Adams) is a single linguistics professor at a university. On the day that defines her story, 12 alien onyx monoliths about 1500 feet tall hover around the world. Their locations include China, Russia, and Montana. The aliens come from another world. Do they come in peace? Literally landing at her doorstep, Army Colonel Weber played by all business Forest Whitaker inquires whether Louise is the right person to decipher the alien language and their intentions. He soon determines she is.Soon Louise finds herself on a military helicopter flying to Montana with Alien Team lead physicist Ian Donnelly, played by Jeremy Renner. Ian tells Louise that science is the key to civilization, not language as her book proclaims. Yeah, they're going to bond.The monolith pods open every 18 hours, and Louise, Ian, and Weber must discover as much as they can. The strange creatures have seven tentacles; thus, giving them the name heptapods. Their oral language is indiscernible. However, their written language is like Japanese calligraphy circles with telling attributes. Watching Louise and Ian decode the language is mesmerizing; however, the story slows to a narrative crawl. Perhaps, the only downside. The upside is amazing. Paradoxically, the alien language is nonlinear: There is no past or future, only the present. Or maybe they are collapsed and all the same? All the while Louise is haunted by visions of her daughter. The Aliens possess a technology that may be a threat or a gift.Life arises out of our language. Villenueve and Heisserer guide us with lyrical focus, and a welcome sense of humor. Louise tells a killer ""kangaroo"" joke. Amy Adams makes ""Arrival"" special. She has power. Adams instills in Louise the vulnerability and compassion that speaks to the hero in all of us. Renner is deceptively strong and tender in what could have been a predictable role. His authentic partnership with Adams generates the eloquent and sublime epiphany. ""Arrival"" invites us to make the story of our lives wondrous. ""Arrival"" is one of the best movies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Sci-Fi movie full of mystery,"'Arrival' is the Sci-Fi movie that we have all been waiting for; it doesn't follow similar story lines that is typical of most alien films, whereby the plot simply comprises of aliens descending on Earth, find out that humans are dangerous and destructive to themselves and them, thus causing all out war - we have seen this time and time again, but 'Arrival' really sets the bar high in modern times for the genre.This movie straight from the beginning shows off beautiful visuals and cinematography, courtesy of the bright cinematographer 'Bradford Young', which really resonates with the unique plot this film has to offer.English and Science are the two subjects that are significantly key to the plot of this film, giving a sense of realism as to what we do as the human race to understand ourselves from a language perspective and our place in the galaxy and the universe, as well as our voyage for other intelligent life and how they might communicate.'Arrival' will keep you guessing and mentally put you on the edge of your seat.

It tells the story of Louise Banks(Amy Adams, A linguist who is entrusted with the task of trying to communicate with the visitors, at least the ones located in the United States. Along with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly(Jeremy Renner) Banks must find a way to decode a language vastly different from ours, and figure out why these ""Shells"" have come here.Lets start with the cast. While a bit top heavy those at the top are all such good actors you don't have to worry about the rest. Amy Adams is a true blue leading lady. She commands this role perfectly and turns in one of her most impressive performances. Full ranges of emotions and a real truth in her eyes that truly draw you into her character. Jeremy Renner has become one of the most reliable second leads in the business. His character is strong and opinionated, but really plays off Adams performance well and boosts this movie up. Forrest Whittaker plays Colonel Weber, the head of the team involved with the U.S. branch of the Arrival. While almost playing the spiritual villain in the beginning, he really is just a guy who has orders to fill and Mr. Whittaker is able to both keep you on his side, but also not fully trust him.The writing of Arrival has ups and downs but really it is mostly ups. The plot is fantastic with several moments I did not expect at all. The way that the heavy science portions are explained helps just enough for you to understand why the characters are doing what they are doing, but not spending a large portion of the movie giving complicated linguistics lesson. The way the world reacts and then deals with the arrival is more realistic than I have ever seen before. It felt as if this could happen tomorrow and Arrival would become almost like a documentary. My only problem with the writing is that at times it could be contrived. Some of the dialogue was not perfect but really overall I can let it slide.All of these things together make a great movie, but in my opinion it is the director Denis Villeneuve who makes all of these parts into one brilliant movie. His previous two movies Prisoners and Sicario were quite a bit darker, and honestly when I saw Arrival was rated PG13 I got a little scared but this guy continues to show he is one of the most talented Directors out there. The tone he sets with Arrival is so strong and pulls you into this world. The pacing of the movie is great and every scene has something to provide. I can say with full confidence that without Villeneuve this movie would have been a whole lot worse, even with everything it has going for it.Arrival can be slow at times but it is really in the humanity of this movie that gets you sucked into it. The extraterrestrials add some wonder and fear into Arrival but the way we respond to them and the importance of some of the things we as humans have forgotten. I don't think it is any coincidence that Arrival was released the same week that we had a historic election, and above all the politics and who won or lost Arrival has a statement to make about the way we treat each other. I don't want to give too much away but I implore people who are feeling a strong emotion this week on either side of the ticket to see Arrival. I think humanity is about more than all of these petty disagreements and I believe Arrival properly portrays this sentiment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
By far the BEST 2016 SCI-FI FILM,"I watched the trailer of this film and i didn't know what to expect except a movie that's similar to Contact (1997), about aliens and contacting them. So i went in with that in mind, and boy i was absolutely wrong.First of all, This movie IS a slow burn so don't just go in expecting an action movie with aliens attacking Earth and our powerful army just send them back to space, YAAAY. NO, that's not it, it's a smart movie about Humans.The movie starts slow, a professional linguist (Amy Adams) is being called for help when the army found a mysterious object flying in the air, so she tries to contact them and from there the plot starts to get going.The movie raises many questions: Why do we always imagine the extraterrestrial as aggressive beings? Why do we human just terminate anything we don't understand? Why our ego let us control the fate of others? Why can't we understand peace?The Acting, The visuals, the soundtrack, the story are what make this film this year's InterstellarThe pacing is a bit slow, but it's done to grab you into the movie then lets you enjoy it as it unwraps its secrets slowly in the end.It's a twisted film about humanity and fate, go in with an open mind and just sit back and watch closely.. It's a beautiful movie",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
They are among us.,"From the many I have heard that the film ""Arrival"" with Charlie Sheen in the title role - is something that is better not to watch. However, I rarely listen to advice, so watched this movie.The first impression from the initial scenes - is surging memories of childhood. Before, I watched movies about aliens arriving on the planet, and I realized that I really want again watch something like that, because then a child, he made a spectacular impression on me.Further, even when viewing, I received only the fun of the film.Everyone knows masterpieces of science fiction movies about aliens on our mortal Earth. However, I would not want to ""Arrival"" was forgotten due identical films. This picture is not enough in what them concedes. Everything is removed and done on the level.At that, many moments reminiscent of the moments of the movies that were filmed later. But with the presence of only one stars, the film - a brilliant representative of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Phenomenal film!,"Incredible film, but I didn't expect anything else from Denis Villeneuve. And Amy Adams carries this cast on her shoulders with her performance, I wouldn't be surprised to see some award nominations next year for this. A very thought-provoking, intelligent film about alien contact that doesn't rely on explosions or an action hero to get its point across. And with a superb ending and important message, I HIGHLY recommend this film to you, along with Hacksaw Ridge this weekend. If you want something loud, an Independence Day or some cheesy 90s action flick, this won't be for you. This is more Contact, or Close Encounters. And probably the best film score I've heard all year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
I'm worried,"This is an interesting movie. Trailer is deceiving, though. I expected something else. After watching this movie, the feeling I had was similar to the one I had after watching Only God Forgives (starring Ryan Gosling). Although this is much better film. I liked the concept of how the aliens were presented and there were many interesting and intelligent details but not them per se, i.e. the looks of aliens. Even better comparison - with movie The Tree of Life (starring Brad Pitt), but there the trailer was not so misleading. Anyway, I'm writing this to express my worry. Coming close to ten lines minimum. So, here it comes. I have to say that, after seeing this movie, I am (a bit) worried about the Blade Runner 2049. For sure movie fans will know why.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
So much right about this film,"I went to see arrival today. I had heard and read nothing but good things about it, without knowing much more than I had seen on the trailer. I honestly think the less you know about this film before you see it the better it will be. It is superbly acted in particular by Adams who so much of it rises and falls. The film is superb at showcasing the flaws and the strengths of the entire human race. It follows a similar suit to many films of the genre, in that the fate of humanity seems to rest on a couple (but mainly one) unassuming hero(ine). That is where the cliché ends. I found the whole thing much more believable than the majority of 'Aliens have landed' films. It was emotional, incredibly human and totally believable...to a point.As the title says, there is so much that 'Arrival' does right but the scientific theory behind how the whole resolution is reached is largely nonsensical and a bit silly.The notion is nice but it was just a leap too far for me to get on board with.After that blip in my viewing delight though I was thrust back into the film.It ended with me asking moral questions of myself, trying to empathise with the main character and admiring the choices that they make, whilst still wrestling with the question 'What would I do?'A really good film that I felt utterly drawn into.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Still not sure what I watched,"Had it not been for Amy Adams, would not have given any stars. She is still a phenomenal actress but this was a bad choice for her. It had no substance for even a basic sci-fi film. The other Arrival with Sheen was cheesy but still a better film. Sorry was very disappointed after the hype.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Must See From 2016,"There are many films coming out this year that far exceeded my expectations but Arrival is at the top of the list. This is not only arguably one of the greatest films of the year but one of the greatest science fiction films ever. The story follows linguist professor Louise Banks-played by Amy Adams- who is assigned to help the military communicate with a group of unusual extra terrestrials. However, the situation is slowly falling apart as many people are starting to worry that the aliens might have sinister motives. The premise alone doesn't sound like anything too great but it is truly the execution that is what makes the difference. Amy Adams and Jeremy Reiner play well off one another as both colleagues and love interests. The special effects-even the CGI-are also beautiful and completely realistic. But that is the great strength of this film: it's ultra-realism. The scenarios, the dialogue, the science, the language, all of it could possibly happen in real life. That's what makes it so absorbing. It's not a feel good movie like Independence Day but a thinking man's film that's still very entertaining like 2001 Space Odyssey. But the best part is the ending. It might be confusing at first but if you think about it, you will begin to understand it. Arrival is definitely one of those movies you need to see twice in order to fully understand it. If you enjoy films that make you think twice about what you saw, then Arrival should be at the top of your list. With great acting, direction and special effects, Arrival is totally worth a second look.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Uplifting, Intelligent Science Fiction","I'll resist giving any spoilers. This was an intelligent, well crafted film that kept the audience spellbound for its nearly 2 hour running time.The film draws you in, and when you think you know where it's going, it surprises you. Amy Adams gives an evocative performance. You feel her character's anxiety, joy, disappointment, her love and grief.The cinematography and special effects are impressive, but the script and the direction of the great cast stood out most to me. Others have compared this film to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and I agree that this film shares some of the same sensibilities.This is an uplifting, intelligent science fiction film, which is all too rare. I urge people to see it. Thought provoking, and at times tender, it will leave you in a reflective mood. I'm so glad I went to see it, you will be too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
It is an extraordinary film,"People who noted that less than 8 this masterpiece has serious cultural means and a modest QI. It's a real success Ted Chang's novel screening. It was wrote a lot of fiction and films were cast about non linearity of the time. Up to a point, I thought Interstellar led the top but this movie, Arrival, is even higher. And the end, absolutely extraordinary, accepting with joy and resignation of a future already known constitute an appropriate and surprising final. In this particular case, I think that the director Denis Villeneuve's is appropriate adapted to the Chiang's novel and the actors Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner are undoubtedly Oscar worthy",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
excellent example of 'aim for utopia' sci-fi,"Remember Abyss? Where the benevolent - but still threatening - aliens showed the human race that war was futile and we wept at the (cut in some versions) montage of awful things that the human race was capable of? Arrival was similar without being so dramatic.Amy Adams lead the film well. In all honesty she carried the film as the other characters (other than her daughter) didn't really have much of a look in. It was interesting seeing Forrest Whittaker play very much the second fiddle, although he played it very much to type. Other characters were more or less obsolete, with the exception of a few nagging mozzies flying around to provide a little tension and the necessary conflict, much of which was - like a mozzie - just in need of a sharp slap. She was excellent as Linguist Louise, very understated and sedate albeit a a little too ""monotone"" and ""internal."" The whole film was a little laid back, never quite enough tension to feel any real threat, and the characters other than Amy weren't deep enough to really care about. That said, Jeremy Renner was nice, but it was never really explained exactly what his purpose was, or rather what input he achieved, in terms of the First Contact, and was in a subsidiary role to Louise.That all said, I loved the film and I really enjoyed how it weaved the convergent narratives neatly and beautifully and kept you guessing. I wasn't surprised by the twist, and had suspected as much, noticed the little clues, but it was still really well achieved. The story was clever, simple (premise) yet intelligently brought to the screen. I think the quietness brought a strength to the simplicity but I think there wasn't enough emotion or variety of activity to make the film truly epic; not enough tension in the international political scene, or from the aliens themselves. The teaching/learning scenes were cut too short/too staccato and too much was implied and glossed over, it was if the editor was too heavy handed and trying to go for intrigue, just omitted some of the plot. There was too much process that I felt needed to be put back in, not for explanation (the plot was clear) but for interest. The learning of the language, went from ""my name is..."" to sentences without actually showing the process - it needed a little delineation, more explanation of the circles, as I was interested.Mention must be made of the SFX - reminiscent of Independence Day - and faultless. The aliens ""Abbott"" and ""Costello"" were excellent; their mode of communication beautiful and the real first contact was really quite special. The (for wont of a better word) 'space ships' that the heptopods arrived in were beautiful too and some of the best SFX were their departure and their existence and presence on the screen with helicopters/ships etc, and the gravity scenes were well done.Overall a watchable, beautiful and intelligent film, and whilst on the surface it seems perfect, and I don't need linear story lines or over-explanation of things, and it did what it was meant to do in terms of storytelling, I feel that it was missing something, the profundity of gripping emotion and heart-pounding tension. It had more scope but just fell a little short. Less is more, and I like how that is generally employed here, going against the grain of Hollywood overkill, and also how America weren't perfect, and China (the great Tzi Ma) were the heroes and leaders of the conclusion (with Louise of course). An awesome experience of cinematography that I would recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
For those who don't understand the movie,"I've read some negative reviews below and they just don't understand. They're criticizing the way Amy Adams tries to communicate and how our government reacted etc and the movie's point is that the aliens did that on purpose to unite the humanity. That obviously is necessary for humanity to help them in 3,000 years.The plot is something scientific community was theorizing for many years and people who are not familiar with the concept may have issues comprehending it. I suggest watching it again. This is actually becoming popular movie plot as movies like Interstellar, About Time, and few others dabbled on but Arrival is the best adaptation of it.One complaint I have about most science fiction movies that feature aliens is that they always assume the aliens have similar intelligence as ourselves. All aliens are just more advanced version of humans. Just look at our own planet, we have thousands of levels of intelligence from a chicken to a dolphin to a monkey to humans. One thing people need to understand is that suppose we someday venture into space and find an alien race with a dog's intelligence. That would be marvelous discovery but that alien race will not understand our behaviors or motives. So if an advance alien race who can travel space and time visits us, what makes you think you can understand their motives? The directing and acting were superb. I'm glad they didn't turn it into an action flick as this movie will be remembered for a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Arrival's human elements outshine its speculative ones,"Arrival is the kind of major Hollywood movie some sci-fi fans have been eternally asking for. It's a story of alien vessels descending on Earth that doesn't present itself as an excuse to blow up the White House, or immediately turn into a cheap thrill ride. Its main focus is on something technical (linguistics), and it doesn't immediately turn into faux-mathy quantum-this relativity-that technobabble but instead lets it drive the plot. It involves nations colluding and high stakes, yes, but it also is consistently a very personal story that never loses sight of its main character. It leaves plenty of room for imagination while not resorting to magical excuses. But something's still missing for me. Arrival is a sparse, thoughtful, beautiful film that I just can't love, mostly because it's payoff simply didn't entirely work for me. To go on much further would be clearly spoiler territory, but suffice to say that the movie doesn't cheat with any twists nor does it betray its tone. In fact, its payoff is incredibly affecting dramatically. While the viewer in me interested in human stories left satisfied, the world- investigating nerd in me felt a bit let down.Arrival's sparsity and humanistic elements come to the forefront immediately, starting with flashback's to Dr. Louise Banks' (Amy Adams) daughter dying young, and allowing the landing of the aliens to happen entirely offscreen. We only see what Dr. Banks sees, and only get a full-out effects shot once she's brought in by the military as a linguistics expert. Twelve crafts have landed sporadically around the world, and while Dr. Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) try to figure out just what they want, they must work with the other eleven nations while also staving off aggression towards the visitors both foreign and on their base. It's timely that international mistrust plays such a large role here, considering the current nationalistic trend in politics, but Arrival mostly shies away from that form of commentary. It has more sympathy for the aliens themselves, and condemns those who see mystery and respond with fear. Alt-right- esque commentators make brief unsavory appearances, panic spreads through a literal game of telephone, and when Renner notes that they're having ""Coffee with some aliens"", it's possible to mishear as something very politically relevant today.For all that it has to say about how we treat those deemed ""other"", Arrival is more interested in it's sci-fi elements than its political ones. And while they don't entirely land for me, they take big swings and hit home emotionally. A lot of it's successes have to do with its score, beautifully subdued and often incredibly sad, and Villeneuve's command of mood, painting the movie in a washed-out blue haze on Earth and surgically cold blacks and whites on the vessel. Its alien design is fairly minimalistic, with the gravity- bending trick seen in the trailers as its lone flashy moment. Otherwise, it's content with its giant black obelisks of vessels, remarkable for their unremarkability. Amy Adams gives a career-best performance in the middle of a fantastic career, important as the movie rests entirely on her shoulders. No amount of disappointment in the end result can erase the fantastic buildup, and if you're able to go with it all the way, the reward is memorable and touching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Arrival is a Beautiful Surprise,"Went to see ""Arrival"" tonight: If you are only a Sci-Fi fan for movies that have lots of action, this movie is not going to be for you and I do not suggest you going to see it as you will find this film very slow and boring....However if you like Sci-Fi movies such as Interstellar, Predestination, Contact, etc.....you will want to give this movie a go! ""Arrival"" was beautifully shot with a refreshingly non traditional look for an alien specie for the big screen. The movie has a thought provoking take on communication and the possibility of a greater ability once comprehended. Keeps you thinking throughout the film and well afterwards. Amy Adams is brilliant as usual and though a strong support cast was not really needed for this one, Jeremy Renner & Forest Whitaker were both solid and complimented Adams nicely.......If this sounds like it might be up your alley, I definitely recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Arrival is a profoundly affecting, deeply philosophical love note to humanity","Arrival is a profoundly affecting, deeply philosophical love note to humanity and all of its strengths, when the word needs to hear it most. It uncovers the difficulties of communication and the importance of language in building an important rhetoric regarding with ideas, concepts and beings we don't understand. It resonates emotionally because of the compassionate script, stunning acting, tight direction and magical score that feels enchanting when they all work to the very best of their ability - particularly in the film's first and final acts - which strikes and conjures the emotional depth found in the film. I cannot speak highly enough of this film and, if like myself, your faith in humanity is beginning to waver, take the time to remind yourself of what we can do when we work together and fight to understand.

Magnificent - That is it,"We tend to overrate old movies. The older they get the more buzz they get and we idolize them.This movie is, in my honest opinion, perfect. There is art in every aspect.

Especially the sensitivity in Adam's character is very convincing.The plot itself is well paced. There is no crazy action sequence, not crazy shooting or any wild and typical sci-fi element which is can be off putting to non-genre fans.I enjoyed the movie greatly because and foremost of its witty and smart writing.

"A thought-provoking, kinder first contact film","Reading through some of the other reviews, it's apparent that many people don't understand what science sci-fi is; this movie was, to me, quintessential science fiction. If you're expecting a movie that doesn't make you think too hard while entertaining you with lots of mind-bending special effects and action this isn't the film for you. On the other hand, if you enjoyed movies like Contact, A.I., Gatica, Ex Machina, Interstellar, or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, then you're likely to enjoy this film too.Another reviewer, 'Bikesloth', summed the movie up well: ""The point of this movie is NOT ABOUT ALIENS, it's about soul searching and reaffirming that it's the quality of life over the quantity of time that we humans spend here."" This movie uses the arrival of alien beings and the question of their purpose only as a vehicle to explore the much more personal question of whether we'd chose to live our life the same way if we knew in advance how it would end. Good sci-fi should make us think, both with our heads and our hearts, and 'Arrival' succeeds at both.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

But Arrival is clever, contemplative and dreamlike, and not short of surprises. Amy Adams is wonderful and her character carries the entire film.

"That one damned loophole which deteriorates the entire theory, otherwise a Sci-Fi Classic.","Arrival (2016) :
Brief Review -That one damned loophole which deteriorates the entire theory, otherwise a Sci-Fi Classic. I'm little late to watch it and may be that's why i was able to find some problems. I watched in early 2021, that's after Christopher Nolan's Mind-blowing 'Tenet' and i feel that's the biggest reason to find couple of big loop holes in this complex storyline. However, i admire Villeneuve for going out of his barrier and attempting a multi layered sci-fi drama with intricate carvings. In the film, A linguist works with the military to communicate with alien lifeforms after twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world. It goes against all sci-fi theories and becomes a multiverse fiasco to give you some unexpected chilling scenes. But theoretically there are couple of big loop holes while justifying that multiverse of non-linear time dimensions. I am not gonna spoil anything here, and not even talk about performances, direction and others things except the Loophole, but i found that Climax scene illogical. The woman fixes all the problems by making just one call to that China Defence minister but she uses the future elements to survive in the present. You see, in future she was supposed to behave as she knew what happened in past, and that's obvious too but she acts weird as if she didn't know what happened in her past which is gonna fix the things in present. What a non-sense theory it was. Any person living in present knows the past and she here doesn't recall that most remarkable thing she did. The other big disaster in writing was, the time was said to be non-linear for Aliens but how the hell it works for that woman who is a human soul? Well, this loophole can be forgiven under the excuse of Cinematic Liberty otherwise the entire narrative would collapse. But that earlier one is a big blunder and cannot be overlooked at all. Overall, Arrival is Great Attempt but misses a landmark by very short margin.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A Thinking Person's sci-fi film,"It would be unfair to neatly divide sci-fi cinema into mindless action flicks and intellectual futurist dramas - many movies have elements of both - but if you did make that division, Arrival would be very far into the latter category. This is, after all, a movie about a linguist learning to communicate with aliens, and if that sounds boring to you then you probably will be bored by this movie, because that's very much what you get.But as I say, sci-fi doesn't categorize that neatly, so you also get some suspense and a good deal of deep emotional content.I thought this movie was terrific. It is a movie that tries to create aliens who communicate in a unique, powerful way. I felt it did a pretty decent job of showing the challenges and possible ways to approach learning to communicate with an alien species (although the film acts as though linguists don't already have set protocols to learn new languages, which annoyed me).I can understand people not liking this, because it is pretty slow moving. On the other hand, the one-star user reviews here usually raised all sorts of dumb objections that suggest they just didn't understand the movie. I'm not saying that there aren't legitimate reasons for an intelligent, thoughtful person to dislike this movie, I'm just saying that there are a lot of hostile reviews here by half-wits. So you should ignore those.Amy Adams is excellent, the special effects are well done, the way the arrival effects the world is persuasive, and the movie is clear without spoonfeeding the audience. All in all, an excellent, thoughtful movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Another Close Encounter,"Arrival scored big at the weekend box-office and is muscling its way into the awards race. It has been almost 40 years since Steven Spielberg made Close Encounter to the Third Kind. That is not a Spielberg film that people tend to revisit the way they do Jaws, Raiders or E.T. In its time, though, Close Encounter cast a spell of majestic awe that still reverberates through pop culture today. This film with its obsessiveness and mystery, its spaceship of light that seemed as big as a city; made the prospect of an extraterrestrial visit look as wondrous, eccentric and spectacular as we imagined it might be.Amy Adams is the film's quiet and luminous heart. Jeremy Renner's role is rather modest but he also seems to understand that, while Amy Adams draw on her gift for making each and every moment quiver with discovery. The actress is alive to what is around her, even if it is just ordinary, and when it is extraordinary the inner fervour she communicates is quite transporting. She is more respected as an actress than bankable. The film isn't a sequel nor is it a superhero film, it is not an Alien invasion film like Independence Day Resurgence that basically exists as an excuse to blow up stuff. Sci-fi isn't just for boys. Amy Adams is front and centre in this film, a performance that surely owned her all this Oscar buzz. The film also gives her character a personal tragedy to live with and a one that grounds the fantastical story in human emotion. As a woman, I really do believe that there is a genuine emotional storyline that can speak to women, either mothers or daughters.This film has been made by the godly gifted director: Denis Villeneuve, who crafted Sicario and Prisoners. He manages once again, to ground this story in a hyper- realistic way. By hooking us with the news of spaceships hovering over Earth in the most random and unsensational way possible. Denis Villeneuve builds our anticipation with great flair. Discovering what the Aliens look like, sound like and how they communicate is the dramatic heart and soul of the picture. That kind of suspense is pretty rare these days. Plus, this film has an obvious poetic grandeur. The images are stately and vast, with an almost super-earthly clarity.Indeed, there is a pleasing circularity to the structure of this movie and also a circular logic to it. True to its title, Arrival makes an absorbing spectacle of the initial Alien set- up. Though the Aliens don't quite have personalities, there is still something tender and touching about them. There are also, frankly, elements of familiarity. The sounds they make, and the way they look. The point being that even if Denis Villeneuve is a bold and brilliant filmmaker, when it comes to this subject, Spielberg's vision is hard to get away; it still somehow infuses everything. Finally, this notion that if you learn a new language it can rewire the way you think and that the Alien language is their big gift to Humanity is beautiful. Add to it that when learning this language, then you are able to rewire your brain and it actually alters the nature of time: it is mesmerising. The film ties it in with *SPOILER ALERT* a back story that forms the action about Louise and the daughter (in a prologue) who she watched grow up and die.Overall, like all the best sci-fi it has something pertinent to say about today's world, particularly about the importance of communication and living in the moment. An ideal that shouldn't need any translation. It grips you with the strength of its ideas and the quality of its execution.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
This really leaves a lasting impression,"It's your classic tale of alien visitors; where are they from and why are they here? But there's a subtlety to ""Arrival"" that makes it stand out, even while it's drawing comparisons to the wonder and mystery of grander films (""Close Encounters"", ""2001""). The military maintains a sizable presence in the movie, but it never really gets to that hysterical point (sure, the planet's armed forces are ready to go to war, but there's also a surprising level of restraint). And I liked that the real focus was on communication, not just with the aliens, but also between our sovereign nations.There is a surprise at the end (I don't think twist is the right word because that evokes Shyamalan, and this isn't that movie), and to a certain extent, that's really the point of the movie - even though it's handled with depth and sensitivity. But up until that point, this is Amy Adams' show. I've always liked here, but of her performances, this is one of my favorites. I could compare this to ""Gravity"" and that'd give a good sense of the maternal subject matter - yet it isn't apt because that's not what happens. It's complicated in the best sense of the word.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

An amazing and original film!,"I just caught this movie on Hulu. I must admit I don't recall this movie's theatrical release. But when I saw the high rating on IMDB and Rotten tomatoes I thought I would give it a try.While I do agree with other users that the pace was slow for a movie about aliens, I learned the pace was intentional in order to deliver a poignant, original and thought-provoking film. Like others, I shook my head in disbelief when Amy Adams pulled out a white board, wrote her name and tapped on her chest to make first contact with the Aliens. I thought, ""oh no"" please don't tell me your doing the ""me Tarzan, you Jane"" thing. I also read reviews about plot holes. Now, I don't approach movies with the emotion of a wooden stump and methodically dissect their logic. If you do, then maybe heed the warnings of others in your camp. For me, that's where the faults of this movie ends, and the rewards of experiencing this film are far greater.I like films that surprise me, that make me care about the characters and provide a journey. And that doesn't happen that often. Many movies today are so unoriginal. But ""Arrival"" aims to be different. Based on a short story ""Story of Your Life"" by American writer Ted Chiang, director Denis Villeneuve and the rest of the filmmaking team managed to present a poignant, original film unlike any other that I have seen in the science fiction genre.In the end, this isn't a movie about an alien invasion. You'll be disappointed if you expect Will Smith to pop out of an aircraft and knockout an alien with his fist. It's a movie about the human experience and explores such themes as interpersonal communication, life, loss and unconditional love.I had to give this movie it's high score because it deserved it. But also because it definitely does not deserve an extremely low score of 1, 2 or 3. Armageddon, Pearl Harbor and Green Lantern deserve low scores of 1, 2 or 3. This is a much watch for anyone who likes films that make you scratch your head and wonder in utter amazement.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
One of the best films of the year.,"Louise Banks (Amy Adams in the role) is a linguistics Professor. She appears to be living alone leading a quite life devoted to her profession and teaching. Occasionally she recalls vaguely memories of a young child growing up and playing with her. We assume that the child is her daughter but we do not see her in real life.The arrival of a number of spaceships from extraterrestrial beings shutters her existence; she becomes the leading consultant of the US government in an attempt to communicate with the alien visitors. Banks discovers their enigmatic language (based on circular rings) and learns an unexpected truth about time and her own life.I liked very much this film. Not your average sci-fi adventure. It is a deeply personal movie about the essence of time, loss and rebirth. Based on a short story by Ted Chiang it tells us a lot about time in our lives and how language signals can give meanings and sentiments that can mark our existence for ever.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
flawed film still worth seeing,"I went into this film expecting something along the lines of Contact meets Close Encounters meets Independence Day, and instead found something very different. Now that I've seen it, the film it reminds me of most is Sixth Sense, where the last few minutes entirely re-maps what you think you've just seen. Arrival has plenty of flaws-- the Jeremy Renner character is woefully underdeveloped (and what exactly does his team DO?), the Forrest Whitaker character doesn't seem to serve much purpose, and as many other reviewers have noted, the method used to learn to communicate with the aliens is just silly--although to give them a little bit of credit, they do give the impression that what we are shown is only the tip of the iceberg of the round-the-clock work that was going on.But if you can let all that go, this film isn't really about aliens at all. It's a meditation on grief and pain and the limitations of human knowledge. If you knew how much pain was in your future, could you bear to face it? If you knew how something would end, would you still go through it? It's heartbreakingly poignant.Also want to add that I am not much of an Amy Adams fan, primarily (and oddly) because of her lightweight voice. It suited the princess role in Enchanted perfectly, but in every other role I've seen her in since, she's seemed miscast. So I was not expecting to appreciate her in this film. But by the end she had won me over. I can't think of another actress who could have played this role.So, yeah, it's flawed. There are tank-sized plot holes (as there were in Sixth Sense), and either they ignored huge swaths of what would really happen in an alien invasion, or (to give the film-makers the benefit of the doubt) they chose to leave that stuff off-screen. But it's still worth seeing: fabulous mood-building, solid acting, great soundtrack, thought-provoking and touching story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

"The Sci-Fi Drama the World Needs, But NOT the One It Deserves","There's nothing scarier than the unknown, yet the unknown is the only sure thing. All that's real is what has already arrived; luckily, the truth of love can never fully depart. Though time causes the pain of endings, the love we experience is always worth it. What does all this have to do with alien-invasion-drama Arrival? Everything. A visually mesmerizing, aurally overwhelming, emotionally disruptive, narratively surprising, and thematically pulsing sci-fi film for the ages, it's not to be missed. The setup is familiar: a group of UFOs appear over different cities all over Earth, and a small group of disparate humans must lead all humanity towards an understanding of their purpose. However, Independence Day this is not. More suspenseful than thrilling, it's high-minded science fiction whose slow and steady pace only emboldens its immense engagement. Think the best aspects of Kubrick and Spielberg: brainy ideas and complex visuals, mixed with spectacle and humanism. For example, on first entering the alien ship, we experience: characters' shifting sense of gravity, fear giving way to wonder then back again, the prescient difficulty of communicating across impossible boundaries. Villeneuve, who's becoming one of the greatest directors of our time, embodies such meaning into each of these moments. Even lines like, ""I forgot how good it felt to be held by you,"" carry meaning beyond their clichés. Its intelligent sci-fi style brought to mind Close Encounters, Tree of Life, Interstellar, and fourth film I won't mention. Just know that time and awareness are huge throughout, leading to a final montage that brought me to tears for the first time this cinematic year. Arrival is an absolutely stunning achievement from beginning to end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

It is one of my all time favorite movies and I thought I would hate it in the beginning. It takes awhile to see where the story goes, but is worth hanging in.

An epic journey exploring time and the human condition.,"Arrival is the newest entry in the science fiction genre from director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) starring Amy Adams (Batman v Superman) and Jeremy Renner (The Avengers). The film follows Dr. Louise Banks (Adams), a renowned linguist professor, and Ian Donnelly (Renner), a theoretical physicist, as they work together to communicate with extraterrestrials that have arrived on Earth. The stakes are high as the two scholars race against time to uncover the reason for the arrival of twelve enormous, oblong, black vessels and prevent a catastrophic war between humans and aliens. However, this is no ordinary alien invasion bursting with violence and bloodshed. Instead, this story adapted by Eric Heisserer (Final Destination 5, The Thing) and based on the story ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang focuses on the communication and rationality needed to prevent disaster. Villeneuve, with aid from cinematographer Bradford Young (Selma) and composer Johann Johannsson (The Theory of Everything), creates a vibrant, suspenseful world on the brink of global conflict. The vessels and aliens (named heptapods) have eerie, naturalistic sounds created by sound editor Sylvain Bellemare. The vessels sound like moving mountains, while the heptapods sounds like subaquatic creatures. These mysterious creatures have their own circular hieroglyphic written language that Dr. Banks must translate in order to dispel the tension and reveal the heptapods' true intentions.Amy Adams drives the story with a spectacular performance. The long shots of Dr. Banks walking around the empty college campus post- invasion suggest the distinguished communicator has shut herself off from the world after the tragic death of her daughter. However, her curiosity and courage take center-stage as she challenges Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) and Ian to approach the heptapods using a humanistic approach instead of militaristic or scientific methods. This is emphasized when Louise erases a portion of Ian's mathematical equations without remorse to write the simple statement: ""What is your purpose on Earth?"" There are close-up shots of Louise and Ian as they venture into the strange vessel with their orange radiation suits. The camera focuses on their faces as they experience the fear of changing gravity, and their erratic breathing resonates as they approach the antechamber where the heptapods lie shrouded in mist behind a transparent glass barrier. Unlike her colleagues around the globe, Louise takes a simplistic, yet time-consuming approach in order to teach the heptapods English and understand their language. Her approach is criticized by Colonel Weber who wants quick results. However, she gains respect as she begins to understand and translate the language. As China and Russia threaten to start a war, Louise must uncover the truth behind her dreams and the alien language to prevent catastrophe in a shocking twist that only a small portion of viewers will decipher.Arrival is an emotional, philosophical sci-fi film reminiscent of The Martian and Interstellar. Its use of the nonlinear storyline and ambiguous ending reminds us of Christopher Nolan's The Prestige and Inception. The beginning and ending of the film show a beautiful lake scene enhanced by the somber song ""On the Nature of Daylight"" by Max Richter. Villeneuve constructs a sociopolitical film on globalization, the media, and language. He creates a science fiction film based on people, not technology and highlights the importance of the humanities during a time in which the arts are under siege. The emotional story also explores time, life and death, love, and happiness. In one of the film's final lines, Villeneuve challenges the viewer with an ethical dilemma: ""If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant movie with a few loopholes,"SPOILERWhat initially was supposed to be a linguistics based movie, turned to be a thought experiment (with shaky foundations of course, since it is a thought experiment!) about non-linear time! The entire movie is based on, arguably an extreme exaggeration of the sapir-whorf-hypothesis about the linguistic relativity (The way language affects our perception of the world). So essentially it is also about emotion and what it means to live if we already experienced time, both the past and the future! Somewhat like Eidetic memory(not a good comparison but somehow came into mind). When I first saw it, I was disappointed with the ending and thought that it was so random Time-travel stuff at the end. After pondering upon it for a while, I understood that it was a thought experiment trying to interpret what it means to experience something. Questions remain but still a brilliant thought experiment.A few things were impractical like just having 2 scientists and a bunch of soldiers headed by a captain deciding almost everything and also plenty of time-paradoxes but still a very interesting thought experiment. The struggles to understand the language initially was also pretty good, and different from a lot of other old alien movies, where we just fight the aliens from the get-go!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

An excellent story of the psychology of first contact,"Eight stars. The biggest ding from a cinematic standpoint is the characteristic
flaw in Villeneuve's films. It's too dark. Maybe he thinks that makes it
moody. But it really just makes it too dark. There's also some fundamental
violations of basic science that, technically, moves this from ""science fiction""
to fantasy. But I still include this in my list of ""first contact"" films for
my Life in the Universe course. Because most of it is spot-on. Of course the
official reactions would be militaristic. Of course they would be dominated by
paranoia. And, of course, the essential problem is one of communication. So
hinging the film on the attempt of a linguist to get her own people to
understand the situation is the key to the whole story. And Amy Adams does a
magnificent job of playing that character. It's the most honest portrayal of
an academic I've ever seen in cinema. Renner does a fine job as well, at least
after the staggeringly bad cliche' of his first scene. Adams has to confront
the problem of the Heptapod language, but her essential challenge is the
behavior of her own government. That's why it is so important that the
military chief and the CIA operative were also played by brilliant actors at
the top of their games. Forest Whitaker has been doing excellent work for 40
years now, and Michael Stuhlbarg for at least 20. Even though it's shot WAY
too dark, and even though the science veers into outright nonsense, it's an
insightful study of the response to first contact, with superlative acting at
the top of the bill. This is very much a film worth watching. 6 May 2022.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A High Ceiling,"As a fan of science fiction, there are occasional movies I absolutely must see in the theater. I would include Arrival on this list, and really had high anticipation for this viewing.Arrival does not disappoint those looking for quality film making, and a story well told. But I left not being amazed by a science fiction movie, but seeing another fine example of Denis Villeneuve's film making. He has a unique skill of handling the specific details of one or two characters, while placing them in a chaotic/dangerous environment. Prisoners, Incendes, Enemy, Sicario - You really get to know the main characters in his films though their stress and hardship - that are a function of the environment, and story being told.Once again Villeneuve nails a consistent visual look, that somehow works from exteriors, interiors, close, long, and even shots with special effects. I'm sure like Nolan, his films have color schemes and strict design to maintain visual consistency. I didn't feel like the environment was a character like in Sicario, but Arrival is beautiful none the less - especially in the atmospheric vistas which include the alien craft.The visuals and unique content are matched by a jarring, yet somehow completely fitting and even beautiful(?) music score. Might be one of the best parts of this movie and it is clear Jóhann Jóhannsson and Villeneuve have a solid working relationship.I read a ton of science fiction, and rarely do movies even come close to the concepts and ideas presented by the best authors of this genre. Arrival comes close. Like Nolan's Interstellar, Arrival presents challenging ideas through clever editing, sound design, and visual presentation. But there is nothing like Interstellar's tesseract sequence. Everything is done with traditional film techniques. Yes there are special effects for obvious elements regarding the aliens and their craft, but the vast majority of deep ideas are not attached to visual effects. Not only that, but not all the answers are spoon fed - the viewer has to bring a bit of intelligence to the experience for understanding. This is comprehensive too. What does the title mean? Why are certain camera shots repeated? What exactly is happening with the main character?These questions are answered over the films two hours.Critiques. Recreating TV news broadcasts must be difficult in film, because rarely is it done well. The background sets never look quite right, the actors don't behave like news anchors and when they use real people to play themselves? Almost the worst stylistic choice, because it always feels contrived. Arrival uses a lot of created media footage to help set the world stage of an international event. It's acceptable in terms of presentation, and works - but its not great. Speaking more generally, this lack of polish could also be the result of this film being a bit rushed. I noticed the same thing with directors Blomkamp's films. District 9 is stunning, but each successive film he has made seems less complete and polished due to scheduling and less of the ability to make each film a labor of love. Hopefully this won't become a trend with Villeneuve's films.Worth mentioning: This movie is not Interstellar. Arrival doesn't have the mega budget, or explosive entertainment. The Arrival has a slow pace, heartfelt emotion regarding difficult parts of the human condition, and a complex conclusion that requires some thinking. A group of people walked out of the showing I wend to... five minutes before the film ended, and really I can't blame them. If they were looking for pure entertainment, action or a hyped science fiction film? Probably not the movie they were hoping to see.But me? I'm a huge fan of this director and I fully enjoyed this movies theater experience. It pleases me to see him working in this genre, and I'm excited for his future work.Expectations met 8-10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A sci-fi makes you think about nature, time and life","This Sci-Fi film is not really about special effect and actions, but rather about using a speculative scenario to examine the human condition, explore our understanding about human life.The movie alternates and merges two parallel stories together, which is somewhat challenging for the audience to figure out the connection between them and their time order: 1) present story with the aliens. 2) Louise's life with her daughter Hannah. The surprise ending will make you feel it is a rewarding watching experience.One major theme of the movie is collaboration between countries, as aliens' arrival demands better behaviors from us.

Thoughtful and Beautiful,"Science fiction films tend to stratify into 3 categories, in my mind. The most commercially successful are really just adventure films set in a science fiction universe. These focus on action and fantasy, with futuristic or high-concept elements. They leverage classic story archetypes and superlative visuals to produce enjoyable escapism. Star Wars is the exemplar of this sub-genre, and although Star Trek aspires to greater scientific rigor, it belongs here too.The second set similarly uses science as a backdrop for noir. These are the darker films, the dystopian adventures. They may not be as hopeful or as fun, but they tend to be more pointed. These films typically propound on a ""what if"" premise, plumbing the dingy depths of possibility. The best are often imaginative, twisted interrogations of human nature or society. This is Blade Runner, The Matrix, Dark City.Finally, there are what I like to call ""thinking"" films. They are headier, and explore ideas that fundamentally change reality or alter our perception of it. They eschew spectacle and adrenaline to allow the audience to dive deep on a single premise. These films are typically smaller in focus, slower, often centering around the journey of a single character. Usually less accessible movies, Hamlet might opine that these ""pleased not the million, (but) 'twas caviar to the general"". I would count 2001, Interstellar, K-PAX and others as ""thinking"" sci-fi. Arrival fits securely in this group.Arrival is a big budget take on a small story, focusing almost myopically on Louise, a linguistics expert who is conscripted to help communicate with extra-terrestrial beings who arrive suddenly above the Earth. Her journey of consciousness as she learns to comprehend the aliens serves as the plot, using the events of the story more as context than narrative. Director Denis Villeneuve deftly uses arresting visuals and frank, realistic sensibilities to relate a story that might otherwise be esoteric. It's fantastic elements are believable because of his steady hand, and even the few quibbles i had in hindsight melted away while watching the screen.Arrival is an experience. It is thoughtful and beautiful, and has lingered in my thoughts since viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
How Arrival completes a circle,"Dennis Villeneuve steps away from darkness for one hell of a ride into the light.In most of the work we know him for, the Canadian-born director uses the worst that surrounds us to tell the story of a world beyond repair. The human desire for revenge in Prisoners or the corrupt underbelly of law presented to us in Sicario to name only two. Yet the minute it begins, we feel Arrival is going to be told through the paradigm of love.So why did he choose to attack things with a different perspective this time? Why forsake what you know so well and risk engulfing yourself in a game you don't seem to know the rules of? The answers are there. The key is to listen.Arrival's main focus is communication. When Amy Adams' language expert Louise is assigned the gargantuan task of translating an alien species, collaboration seems not only necessary, but impossible to avoid. Not one, but twelve alien vessels have arrived in as many distinctive places on earth. Teams of scientists and linguists alike join forces to uncover their intentions. Ranging in both geographical and political climates, the need to put their differences aside is inferred with astute meaning.Denis Villeneuve has a knack for making metaphor clear as day. His movies do not only tell stories we can connect to emotionally. He also possesses an effortless ability to make us understand their symbolism, like no other.When her colleague, the astrophysicist Ian, played by Jeremy Renner observes that she uses mathematical formulas to uncover the mysteries of heptatod (the alien language), we notice a bridging of the ever present gap between the creative, and the analytical. Two entirely different worlds collide to give birth to a new and necessary understanding.It is here that we find the answer.No amount of the same is going to produce different results, to paraphrase Einstein. No body of work can shine unless it is scrutinized by itself. And what better way to do that than flip it on its head? By tuning in to another voice, Villeneuve proposes we have the cure for the cancer that is our world.However, assuming the worst is what people do best, and traces of it are also present here. We are certain the aliens are out to get us, and will sometimes stop at nothing to prove so. Using language as weapon seems to be one of our ""strengths"".To communicate wholly with others is to first be able to communicate to ourselves. The portrayal of this process takes place through vignettes that show Louise' life ""before"" the arrival. She first has to mend the broken pieces that she did not know were there. Only then can she save us from ourselves.By pitting Arrival against his best opus up until now, Denis Villeneuve created something bigger than himself. He manages to question everything he has ever believed in before and make us find hope in the process. After I've left the theater that evening I've often asked myself: whom else who thinks different than me have I shut out, and lost a world of treasure because of that?",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
An excellent surprise,"Yesterday I had no idea this movie was ever made. And I was skeptical. Aliens. Already seen that many times. Trying to communicate. Seen.

I was really wanting to know what goes next.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Failed to meet expectations,"I was so excited to see the Arrival when it started to show in theaters. After a long wait I got excitedly took a seat in the cinema. But the film was filled with confusion from the beginning. Then I continued to watch with patience, thinking that my time cycle would be within in time.There was still no excitement when the first half of movie was over, but there were many question marks and a boring stasis. Unfortunately, this situation continued in the second half, even when the movie was over, we were left alone with many questions.The questions that asked in the movie and the rationale in the fiction were nice, but the gaps in the script were extremely making me uncomfortable. It will be a disappointment if you watch Arrival with an expectation of full satisfaction as in Nolan movies, but if you do not question every detail, you can still enjoy it.Unfortunately this situation is the one that disturb me the most in movies. Apart from fiction and script, the music and visuals were beautiful. I am giving #6/10 point by being so generous.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Must watch for sci-fi fans!,"Those who are criticising this film are basically Steven Seagal fans. This film is neither about action nor about 'messages' or 'morals'. Simply enjoy it for what it is...a well made, interesting science fiction film that's not too heavy handed on effects. Perhaps a bit light on the plot as well, but interestingly made and engaging.My only criticism is way the aliens are conceived. Could definitely be more imaginative. I can understand taking cues from around us to create a creature, such as in Alien, but this was a bit too obvious, in my opinion.If you are looking for laser blasters and light sabres, stay away. This is more in the lines of Contact. Fantasy that's rooted in reality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A hole ridden plot stretched too thin,"I had several problems with this film, but I think the biggest was something I found out from someone who loved it - it was based on a short story. Yep, not enough plot to stretch out for a two hour movie. To say the pace is a little slow is an understatement of the highest order - things move so slowly in some spots as to make glaciers look at their speedometer to see if they are speeding. This explains all the long silences, the endless scenes of people looking off into the distance maybe at the shell (what they call the alien spacecraft - why, never explained like so much of this movie).However, there are some good parts to the movie. The CGI is really well done, the aliens themselves are fairly well conceived - I would have liked it if they actually floated and perhaps came from a gas-giant environment but this is sort of spoiled by one scene. I thought the alien language wasn't too bad. It was different enough from Earth languages to seem alien - although again later when it is revealed to have a 'spoken form' that the heroine somehow understands the shine is somehow taken off.The second biggest problem I have with the film is the premise that our heroine can look into the future because she immersed herself in the language. This led to a second plot that is essentially a mother-daughter story which didn't interest me in the slightest. I swear, I would have found a documentary on toe fungus of greater interest. To make this worse, this whole story is intersperse throughout the whole film - it starts with a 10 minute montage of this story.Finally it is presumed that she shares this concept of looking forward and back in time with others and while she doesn't change things in her life, what about her students? Really? Wouldn't at least one of them, try to change a mark they got in class, or stop their mother from being hit by a car, or hell, going all Groundhog Day and changing their approach to a girl they really like until they get it right. There is a saying, ""to know the future is to change it,"" and I will swear to all I consider holy that if I'd known this film would be like this, I wouldn't have watched it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Mind-bendingly suspenseful,""" Now that's a proper introduction.""This mind-bending sci-fi is simply amazing. From the visuals and the music, to the acting, writing, and fine details like the fact that a whole visual syntax was developed for this film.""Arrival"" has to be one of the best films of the year, so if you see it, and I recommend that you come prepared for the cast and story to draw you into it, from it's painful if somewhat enigmatic opening, to it's tense climax, to it's beautiful, bittersweet finale that makes you rethink yourself, humanity, and our universe.One detail I really enjoyed was the design of the heptapods' craft was the resemblance to the similarity to the obelisks in Stanley Kübrick's film adaptation of 2001: A Space Odessey (originally a series of novels written by Sir Arthur C Clarke) The heptapods' unique design was also a welcome break from the average humanoid ETs commonly featured in Hollywood.Also, the recurring Abbot and Costello reference helped add just the right amount of humor to an otherwise serious film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"A film about humanity rather than the ""Arrivals""","Arrival is a beautifully complex film that centers on the role of humanity in this world rather than the ""arrivals"". With this, the movie brings a new look to the sci-fi genre, as it deals with themes and emotions that many can relate to in the modern world. Arrival proves to be one-of-a-kind and one of the best in the genre, not just for pure action or the clichés we tend to see in such movies, but for its creativity and thought-provoking ideas it presents to the viewer. It is a movie that does require utmost attention, however, the experience is truly rewarding, as director, Denis Villeneuve continues his run of exceptional movies. Amy Adams, who plays a linguistic professor, leads the movie with a strong performance, yet playing a vulnerable character who succumbs to the events that unfold. The 'arrivals' themselves are wonderfully designed and their language particularly is a topic in on itself. Crafted with great cinematography and moving music, this was a deserved Oscar-nominated film, and truly one for the ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Thought-provoking and emotionally engaging but sometimes dull..,"Arrival is definitely a thought provoking science-fiction film to say the least. With a real, rich development of its central character, Louise Banks. Visually and sound-wise it also excels to a certain extent, from slow gliding shots through fog to beaming white brightness accompanied by an eerie score by Jóhann Jóhannsson. However the film does suffer from a little too much melodrama, as almost every scene (some fairly uplifting) has a depressing side to it. Most of the time, this is Amy Adams who gives a very good but depressing performance. Denis Villeneuve's color pallet is also quite dull. Even in some of the happier scenes, a sterile, modern light is ever present.By the end of it, I was amazed but really wanted to stick on a Wes Anderson film (I'm not even a big fan).",,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Powerfully emotional,"This is an intelligent, entertaining and powerfully emotional movie about an international close encounter of the third kind. The film's catharsis released a flood of emotion in me - it's that good. Definitely worth seeing. The Canadian director straddles the art-film and commercial film worlds. As a commercial enterprise, the film is unusual in that it is devoid of guns, explosions, chases, fistfights and the other tropes of alien visitation movies, that it has a female protagonist, and that gives precedence to feelings of love and loss over those of terror and aggression. Can't say enough about Amy Adams' performance. The score by Johann Johannsson adds immeasurably to the film's effectiveness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"spindly aliens arrive, we discover they have circular memory, America saves the planet again.","Ever since the silent film A Trip to the Moon was shown in 1902 audiences have turned to Science Fiction for creative images of life beyond earth. Some Sci-Fi's emphasise alien threats, their appearance, or their technology. The film Arrival (2016) takes a different approach by looking at the challenges of language when first contact is made. Under a thick layer of American propaganda, the film also offers a sermon about global cooperation.The central storyline is simple: twelve huge elliptical extra-terrestial objects arrive on earth and hover just above ground level in twelve locations across the globe. While each nation carries out its own threat assessments, the Americans opt to explore how to communicate with the visitors rather than default to military options. Our heroine is accomplished linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) who leads a team assigned to enter the spacecraft and assess if humans can communicate with the visitors. Paired with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) they represent the soft and hard faces of science. When contact is made with the tentacled aliens via a glass-like wall it becomes evident that dialogue is possible using a form of circular symbols.Global panic erupts when linguistic trial and error decodes a symbol for ""weapon"" and China prepares to attack even though Louise believes the translation is ambiguous. In the midst of the crisis, she is haunted by visions of her daughter who died of a rare disease. The visions gradually transition from memories to predictions. Unlike human linear memory the aliens have circular memory that connects the past, present and future. Her flashbacks and flash-forwards are the key to understanding the film but they add a layer of narrative confusion in the process.The film's unsurprising message is that when alien contact occurs the future of the planet will depend on global cooperation. This theme is packaged inside a story that is told with digital effects that are modest by today's standards. Some will feel let down by the unimaginative spindly alien forms that are kept at a hazy distance within the concrete bunker-like spaceship setting. The back- story of Louise's personal life is a distracting melodrama and the concept of memory circularity is a weak idea on which to base the plot. That the Hollywood dream-factory makes America the global saviour again is not new. Unlike other visually ground-breaking Sci-Fi's this one is more about ideas than spectacle. But it is a thought-provoking film about the technology of language and it works well at this level.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

It has arrived,"Another year, another highly anticipated film from acclaimed director Denis Villeneuve, the director of ""Prisoners"" and ""Sicario"" is back at it again this time in the science fiction genre with ""Arrival"" starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner.

Do they want war? Or maybe something else? Well that's for Louise to find out, but ""Arrival"" isn't really about that, it's a love story, it's a sort of coming of age story, a film about healing and revelation, beautifully told by Denis Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer.

A little sadder. A little wiser.,"What would happen if you took a film like Contact, deconstruct it into the most archetypal questions that we face as humans, and then piece them together in a style that rivals the iconic cinematic mastermind of Stanley Kubrick? Add an actress who has never before been given the chance to show physical fear, the devastation of loss and the gut wrenching, gall drenched intensity of motherhood. Add imagery of possibly the most cerebral effort ever to portray extraterrestrial life, very cleverly delayed so that when you finally get to see them, your hairs stand up as they would when a growling lion walked into your bedroom. Add a soundtrack that is in a word primal. I kid you not. It sounds like it's been accidentally stumbled upon from a godly source. It blends perfectly with the sounds already produced by the alien life, and it is beautiful. It is beautiful! It bloody made me cry. It is thick and heavy like Wagner in places, and unearthly and hellish as Ligeti, and it spoke to me and fried the marrow in my shuddering spine. Then, take a surprisingly tricky theory from the mind of Jacques Lacan, create a fascinating linguistically sound writing system, and build a non-linear plot around that. And then show that to unsuspecting audiences across the globe, and make them walk out a little changed from when they walked in. A little sadder. A little wiser. A movie has crashed into my number one spot previously held by Iñárritu's Biutiful and has broken all previous records in my mind.

Proof that sci-fi can have great quality,"Having heard about this movie and seen part of the trailer I had written it off as yet another sci-fi movie featuring aliens. There were people running around and being violent and aliens talking about weapons and an explosion and everything was frantic and I just did not feel like it was my cup of tea and that other similar movies have been made.I could not have been more wrong and I am so glad I read a review on IMDb that changed my mind and made me want to watch it because that is so not what it is like. This is not just another movie about aliens. It is so much more than that. It is absolutely stunning. Mysterious and heartbreaking and everything comes around at the end. I honestly don't understand why try to pass the movie as something it is not.There are very suspenseful scenes indeed where you can feel the sense of urgency and it is totally justified but ultimately the vibe of the film is awe-striking and somewhat dreamy, which has a reason why and is made clear as the movie comes to a closure.The close-ups are incredible, moving, and the soundtrack blew me away. Oh my gosh. It gave an entire new dimension to the movie and completely involved me and intensified the alien atmosphere.There is only one scene that I did not like because it felt like it did not belong, and the slow pace was a struggle sometimes, even if it was part of the movie's charm, but overall this was an absolutely incredible work of art and I hope you will watch it.

Good Sci-fi - but trying too hard to be 2001 space odyssey and fails,"The movie is good - and perhaps better than good. If you like sci-fi it's a must-see movie.

The humans are boring and I really just wanted to know more about the aliens. The movie is trying to give us insight into the ""main character"" life story – but it's difficult to care.Of course, this movie is more about humans and human behavior and communication – and the aliens work as a metaphor. The main problem is that the metaphor has a personality, while the ""main characters"" has none.The visuals and music is Excellent. The movie would have worked very well as a music video.Due to very boring main characters the movie is not even close to 8 stars.

Another Masterpiece from Top Director Denis Villeneuve,"WARNING:Do not go into Arrival without an understanding of director Denis Villeneuve. Some of his movies are extremely complex (Enemy), and all of his movies are slow paced. None of them go easy on the viewer.Pros:Amy Adams is excellent- her relationship with her daughter gives the movie most of its emotional weight. She is intelligent and interesting, and never feels like a Mary Sue.Cinematography- Each shot could be a painting. Every. Single. Shot. It's hard to get bored when something so beautiful is on screen!Structure- The best part of the film. The structure of Arrival ties perfectly to the plot, especially towards the third act.Creativity- The aliens in Arrival are like nothing seen before. What is this! A new idea in a sci-fi movie!? Um.. how long has it been?Flaws:Characters- Amy Adams is the only substantial character. Jeremy Renner didn't work as well with Amy as I had hoped. He simply isn't interesting- he's funny, but never really goes beyond that.Second Act- A plot device in the second act is a little lazy, and the audience doesn't really get to see how things play out. It doesn't hurt the film too much in the end, but it is the only part of the movie with plot-based flaws.Overall:Arrival is a fantastic film by a fantastic director. If you let this movie play out, and wait for the payoff, you will be well rewarded. Arrival, for me, doesn't quite beat out Prisoners (a nearly perfect movie), but takes second place away from Sicario. Follow this director; he is reliably interesting and fresh. Even though it has a few flaws, they don't take away from all of the excellence throughout. 9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A thought-provoking surprise,"At first glance, The Arrival presents itself quite unremarkably, but as the narrative unfolds, it reveals its true brilliance as an intellectually stimulating science-fiction piece that transcends the boundaries of the genre.At its core The Arrival is not your typical alien invasion film. It has little to no action, and frankly a quite cliché plot of ""humans stupid and bad, want to hurt aliens who are good"". While the film lacks the typical action sequences, the artful editing and stunning visual effects by Joe Walker compensate for the deliberate pace, ensuring a captivating cinematic experience.The heart of the film lies in its exploration of communication and language, with the main characters representing opposing views on its significance. However, it is worth noting that character development remains somewhat shallow, consistent with Denis Villeneuve's storytelling style.In essence, what sets The Arrival apart and contributes to my rating is the ending, and the slow realization what the movie really is about. It's a film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll, leaving the audiences with a profound sense of wonder and reflection.

There is another way,"When alien vessels land across the earth, a grieving linguist is brought in by the government to establish communication.Something special about this movie. I've had trouble with a couple of the director's previous works - heavy and obscure - but this was so lively and clear, the entire experience so full, that it passed by without having to dwell on its mysteries.The story turns on the notion that, while time is the thing that stops everything happening all at once, it can be separated from its linear progression - you just have to have the language to conceive of it in that way. And early on we're given the conflict between language and science as organizing principles of the world, so there's a great deal of thought to bring to life on the screen.Well, it helps to have Amy Adams in the lead role, giving emotion to thoughts and memories. But every other element of the story telling is light and assured: editing, cinematography, and my favourite is the score, with a bit of Max Richter to round things off.The climax is a cascade of emotion for a life lived and not yet lived, something only a masterpiece of cinema could achieve.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

A clever psycological drama about how language shapes the way we think and a critique not of society as a political entity, but as a linguistic construct detatched from the meta dimension.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Fresh and mind bending.,"Being interested in the genuine search for ET life, this is something very welcome. A thoughtful depiction of developed aliens with an appropriate multidimensional twist. Things would probably not play out in reality as they did in this film, but it's the closest scenario as to what could actually happen which I've seen recently.Good contribution to alien contact mythology.The romance that happens towards the end would have been well served will better foreshadowing and development. This is a sizeable fault in the story for me - they're suddenly romantic with almost zero development getting there. Scripting in this development would have created a more emotional film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

First contact done right ! Stop what you you are doing and watch it now (again) !,"A well crafted movie with a dense thrilling atmosphere and an emotional story delivered by an brilliant performance by Amy Adams.The story (without spoilers) is a mix of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Contact, but also adds something new and modern to the sci-fi genre.The music helps to create the dramatic and dense atmosphere and also supports the emotional moments. (won Academy Award for Best Sound Editing)All in all one of the best (when not the best) Sci-Fi movie of the last decade and a must watch for all movie fans. The director Denis Villeneuve knows what he is doing and set a very high bar for movie making in general and is probably in the top 3 best directors of the 21th century list (eg. Prisoners, Sicario and the only other competitor for Arrival what a suprise Blade Runner 2049).",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Not for you if you're into *scary* aliens (you'd give it 1*), so stay away","It seems a lot of the reviewers that gave this movie 1 star were expecting to see a typical *scary* Hollywood movie about aliens. By typical I mean something that features incredibly ill-tempered creatures with goo dripping out of their every orifice, whose only purpose in life is to hurt, eat and destroy us puny humans. Usually they are after our incredibly precious resources (which apparently are very rare in an almost infinite universe), really anxious to investigate the intricacies of our body parts, or some such ridiculous nonsense.So, if you happen to be one of those people, you better stay away because you'd be really disappointed and bored (and there are no big explosions too).Don't get me wrong, I like ""Alien"" and movies in that vein which are really well made (definitely not ""Prometheus""). But ""Arrival"" is not this type of a movie.""Arrival"" is mostly a (philosophical) drama with elements of sci-fi. It is a thinking person's movie and a lot of the reviewers really didn't understand some parts of the movie - and I don't mean metaphors or *deep stuff*, but things that were really there. Maybe they were bored or didn't care, it doesn't matter.If you're into asking big questions and you really enjoy thinking about why things are as they are, you'll probably enjoy this movie. It is really well made. The original story of Ted Chiang is also quite good...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Loved it!,"I don't understand the bad reviews, I guess they wanted a regular alien vs the world movie?! We loved it! I don't want to give anything away, but I found it intriguing the whole time. Sure, I can see why people say slow, but for us we were glued and enjoyed it all. We usually like suspenseful movies, thrillers, all those kind, I'm not into lots of other slow movies, but this was so good. We loved the ending! I'm so glad I didn't read the reviews, as I'll often listen to the reviews and often agree if people say a movie is slow and boring. Not this time!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Such an original movie,"This movie is no action flick. It's a thought provoking, carefully woven together piece of cinema, from 'beginning' to 'end'. From the start and all throughout the movie it shows glimpses for what later turns out to be the biggest plot point. And those glimpses aren't just simple teases because it actually connects to said plot point. That's brilliant.Also, this movie looks amazing. The alien spacecrafts have such a unique design, and don't get me started on the aliens themselves! They look so mysterious, so alien, yet very much like something realistic. It wouldn't surprise me if we discover something looking like that in our own ocean in the years to come. (In fact I reckon we already did, octopuses are our very own aliens man!)This is now the second time I have watched this movie, the first being many years ago. I remember really appreciating this movie. Now, when I got to the last 30 minutes or so I was confused, because I didn't remember them at all! I'm still confused as to why I don't remember. My theory is that I never finished the movie, which is quite odd of me to do back then, but I digress.I highly recommend this movie. But remember, this movie is no action flick.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Mind Blowing,"I don't understand why people stuck at the minor policies between countries, or why this actor didn't have more lines in screenplay and stuff, and I'm not talking about the small details that relate to main story, just affects the plot. Even if it's a problem for you, just cuts few points. Don't give 1/10Anyway, I think this movie was one best movies in last years and maybe even better than the Interstellar. If you like Interstellar stuff, It's really for you, except spaceship and stuff.The story itself is really mind blowing. Right after finishing the movie, you finding yourself thinking what you just watched. You start thinking and jump from branch to branch relate to what you just watch like movie in 'Butterfly Effect'But I think best part of the movie is that it plot. I mean how scenes are line up and how plot is making a smooth climbing to the top. It doesn't give you too much information at the end, or it doesn't keep everything to the end.Just right amount.Great movie, must watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Stunning & Consuming First Contact Film,"You know you've just seen a wonder of a film, when mid-film revelations, post-watch conversations & probing, send shivers down your spine. And that is exactly what Denis Villeneuve's stellar piece of science fiction is, a wonder, as it boasts of heady themes, told through genuinely affecting drama & filmmaking marvel.Arrival deserves acclaim from its sophisticated themes alone, that touches on theories of language & its meaning, meshed perfectly with extraterrestrial communication. With its compelling themes, the film demands appreciation of its thought provoking messages rather than be glossed over. Once the intricacies behind the first contact is realized, audiences are then rewarded with mind blowing insights that delves in the importance of dialogue & semantics. Amazingly, the film takes advantage of its absolutely moving drama & commentaries on society's tendencies & human potential, to emphasize its lessons, while elevating the intrigue exponentially.Apart from its riveting storyline pieces, Arrival also benefits from Villeneuve's masterful filmmaking craft as from start to end, the tension & ominous tone never ceases. Whether through the eerie, alien designs, the perfectly framed & staged interactions with the heptapods, or the mystery that is Louise's memories, the paranoia surrounding the ETs & their purpose effectively builds, until the jaw dropping revelations. These of course, are held together by a breathtaking score by Jóhan Jóhansson, that effectively directs our senses to each scene's supposed mood. On the other hand, the cinematography of Bradford Young deserves mention as well, as his stellar visuals ups both the beauty of Arrival's settings & grants a somewhat dark splendor in the film's fantasy, complimenting its tone of uncertainty.On the acting piece, Arrival is Amy Adams' film through and through. As the story unfolds under her character's POV, the emotions of regret, tragic loss, fear, fascination & hope are conveyed through Adams' elegant subtlety. It is through this same graceful restraint, that Louise Banks' magnetic feats of intelligence, fragility & warmth effectively emanates as well.Arrival then, cements its spot in the echelon of science fiction triumphs. Yes, to grasp its themes means to be in awe with the importance of language. Yet its masterful exploration into the personal, into what is tangible, is its own achievement, spotlighting once more the filmmaking brilliance of Villeneuve, Adams stellar acting range, & the exemplary work behind the camera. 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
"Beautiful, Philosophical, Slow Burn","To fully appreciate this movie you have to have an appreciation for concepts around free will and determinism. It is a beautiful story. The sounds and photography all make for a gorgeously display as well. If you are into high action sci-fi this might not be for you. It is more technical and nerdy in some ways, which I loved. If you like Christopher Nolan movies (inception, interstellar), then you'll most likely enjoy this. It has a deeper question that its posing to viewers, if you understand the movie. I truly loved it and don't know why I waited so long to watch. 10/10 recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

Simple concept but good script,The concept isn't that complex. Doesn't try to be like Inception or Tenet but the script is pretty well written & the scenes shot artistically for them to seamlessly fit together. Maintains a good flow that doesn't seem forced. Gets a bit cliched with the Chinese general at the end but that part can be forgiven because the rest of the execution us pretty seamless.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyable until it becomes predictable,"Having read quite a few really positive reviews for this movie and watched the trailer I was very much looking forward to watching it and I really did enjoy it for the first half of the movie but......sadly there is a but.The direction, sets, cinematography, special effects, acting everything in fact is just fine and even great in some aspects I'm sure but.....I'm not going to spoil the movie and explain how it ends but I will say that the movie gets to a certain point and it becomes very obvious where it will end and the direction the movie is heading in which doesn't make it a bad ending as such it just becomes a predictable one; at least it was for me. This spoiled what was an otherwise enjoyable film.This is very much a thinking mans/woman's science fiction movie; I only wish I had switched off and not figured out the ending to what is a very different kind of sci-fi flick from star wars or star trek.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
A People's obsession with War,"I have been postponing this movie for a while now and reading all the reviews led me to have great expectations while still managing to go in blind. The approach of an ""alien invasion"" which we've seen multiple times is unique as there is no use of the generic action of such a setting, but instead we focus on the communication of two species.From start to finish, director Denis Villeneuve manages to make us wonder what their intentions are, where this may all lead while also making it look like a walk in the park to keep this level of interest for the viewer. Looking in retrospective, there may have been some moments which should've been cut shorter as they feel a bit overused towards the end (the repeated walks to the spaceship which aim for both the fear and desire of our characters).I felt Christopher Nolan's Memento vibes all throughout (maybe not the best analogy) with all the glimpses of our character's memories, but couldn't put my finger on it all until the end finally revealed itself and it was worth the wait. The suspense is there, but the depth of the characters, with the exception of Amy Adam's Louise, just did not click with me. Renner pulls a great performance, but the character feels flat, especially with a very cheesy and out of character line at the end. When we are greeted with the climax, it hits, but misses at the same time as I was waiting for a better portrayal of a dialogue from our main character instead of that monologue (which is great, but never shows us the reaction of the other characters to the reveal). Patient with it and even though the pacing may feel slow from time to time, you will see the credits roll in awe.Bradford Young does a great job with the cinematography as it is quite literally stellar, but I could not wonder how it might have turned out if Villeneuve managed to collaborate with Roger Deakins on this one as well. The whole situation may seem as a life of death anxiety inducing one, but it transposes itself into a more ""understanding"", peaceful one through each shot of the spaceship which maintains an interesting vertical stance for most of the movie compared to the usual horizontal UFO one. The audio score provides us, even when terrified, with a pure sense of hope and connection with this advanced species and encourages us to take a leap of faith and trust them. It also reminded me a bit of Interstellar.The backgrounds, color palette, be them lit or pitch dark never make you feel the full scare which the population of the world seems to be facing given the dangers they are presented with, but rather view it as a long awaited gift. A simple fear of the unknown, our nature of never appealing to anything else other than conflict when faced with such circumstances, being so desperate for answers without putting in the effort such as the Colonel remarks in the first few minutes of the film when recruiting Louise (wanting a resolution after just 2 days) characterize this world's flaws. Communication is focus and we are, unfortunately, faced with such a challenge in a society filled with disagreement which must overcome selfish needs until the movie rolls credits.Am I labelling this movie as good or bad? Definitely not and I can see why some consider it the best SF movie of all time, but we should not always associate originality with perfection as there are several levels which a pyramid must fill before it reaches top excellence. I think we should all contemplate on the film's message, but an idea perfectly blended with cinematography, score and great acting skills may not be enough to cover generic characters, a lack of more in depth dialogue and repetition with moments of slow burns.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"
Awe inspiring,I just watched it a second time after 2 years I think and all the pieces clicked together.

Modern Science Fiction masterpiece,"Arrival was directed by Dennis Villeneuve and stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forrest Whittaker. When 12 alien spaceships land on Earth, linguist Louis Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly are recruited by the U.S. Government to find out the intentions of the aliens. They attempt to decode the complex alien language amid escalating international and domestic tensions. I think that it should be included in the pantheon of great science fiction films. While packed with complex ideas and themes, Arrival is also a deeply emotional and contemplative movie. Amy Adams is great in the lead role. She excellently depicts the wonder and shock that her character experiences. The musical score is also brilliant in heightening the complex emotions experienced by the characters. Most of the movie is deliberately paced with long-takes and wide shots showcasing the beauty and the immensity of the aliens. The film expertly connects communication, language, time and human existence in a thoroughly absorbing experience. One of the best movies of the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"

An enjoyable sci fi film,"The film tries to tie in two big concepts, one about communication, and another about time. In the end those concepts get somewhat muddled and open a number of plot holes that were obvious even on a first viewing, and would be positively glaring on repeat viewings.

"Interesting plot & twists (no details), but hard to follow","I have seen many ""puzzle"" movies, including Memento, Cloud Atlas, Inception and many others. This was one of the hardest to follow, not least of which is because many lines were spoken softly with loud background noise and/or musical soundtrack. I left wondering what it was about, and didn't feel comfortable that I had even a basic idea of the ""point"" of it until after a long conversation with the friend I saw it with.It was certainly interesting, and well done. I just wish the filmmakers gave us a little more help in following it. I would have left the theatre with more than a sense of ""I think I liked it, I just don't know for sure.""
