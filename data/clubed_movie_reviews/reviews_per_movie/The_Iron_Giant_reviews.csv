"What more animated movie should be: a thoughtful, funny, touching story.","After seeing this movie, I was overcome by a strange feeling. I realized that I had found a treasure where I had least expected it. The Iron Giant is intelligent, funny, touching, and visually superb, and should show the world that an animated movie does not need to be A) computer-animated, or B) based on a fairy tale to be successful. One of the best American-made children's movies I have seen in a decade:8.5/10.0Now, I'm a 17-year-old who is slowly transitioning into the domain of movie buffdom, which basically means that I am watching a stream of movies based on recommendations from friends, critics, and the IMDb Top 250 list. I got this one almost by accident after the local rental place could not find the movie I was really after, choosing it basically on the knowledge that it was the previous project of Brad Bird, director of The Incredibles (a personal favorite). After watching it, I felt like calling up every mother I knew and telling her to have her children (and herself) watch this.The Iron Giant revolves around an adventurous young boy in 1950s small-town America who discovers a gigantic robot out in the woods that has arrived on Earth from goodness-knows-where. He befriends the robot, while trying to keep him safe from a nosy government agent. The story seldom lags, with a series of comical adventures connected by the boy's growing relationship with his friend.This movie is very appealing as entertainment. The voices are well-done, and the scenery is also terrific. Most importantly, though, is the animation, which is a bright spot from this time period. The characters are well-drawn, especially the Giant, who through terrific design, lifelike movements, and clever small touches (i.e., the eyes) seems both alien and human, imposing and childlike. Furthermore, the animation is comical. I don't know when I have ever seen slapstick or punchlines so well-complimented by the animation. The script, written by Bird and based off the book The Iron Man, is also very well done. Though the movie relies upon a few minor crutches common to children's movies, it is still very original and clever.One thing that I must point out about this movie is its morals. Throughout the movie, the main moral of the story, about the Iron Giant learning and choosing to be good, is actually fairly adroitly handled. At no point when the subject comes up, including standard sentimental climax, does the idea seem contrived. Throughout the movie, evidence of Bird's influence by comic books is quite evident, and his ultimate message about heroes (variations of which will resurface in The Incredibles) is relevant and sincere. However, I do have to say that the secondary moral, about the evils of xenophobia and paranoia, both of which are embodied by the movie's antagonist, the government agent and the military, are very politically charged. While this may sound initially controversial and politically charged for a kids' movie (the second of which I do not deny), I noticed that it was in large part a thoughtful spoof of Cold War America, with jokes as well as valuable lessons about ""duck and cover"" and 1950s nuclear edginess that I found very clever.On a final note, I do have to point out that this movie had me laughing hard, but more importantly, it brought me closer to tears than any animated movie I can remember (including Bambi), closer than I like to admit. I wish that I had discovered it sooner, and I hope that everyone gets the chance to experience it the way I did.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie,"I have only just recently rewatched this classic and it is as good today as the first day I saw it.I love the setting of this, back in the 50's during the height of cold war tension and fear of alien invasion.This movie has a great balance, just enough character development, enough action scenes and enough tension to keep you glued for the hour and a half play time.It is aimed at kids for sure but adults would enjoy watching this one just as much.The characters are all endearing that you really get attached to them. The bad guy is less evil and more of an authoritarian trying to do their job regardless of emotions involved. It makes for a fun movie for all ages.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Much More Than a Cartoon,"Sometimes when watching an animated feature, I spend my time saying, ""What great animation."" When this happens, I wonder if I am doing what the producers wanted me to do. Like so many things, should I be so enamored with the technical part of the movie that I am distracted from the content. As I watched ""The Iron Giant"" I realized I had forgotten it was an animated feature. Don't get me wrong. I knew the enormous title character was animated, but the relationships among the characters and the intelligence of the script caused me to forget that these weren't actors. The movie is filled with tender moments, especially as they relate to our feelings of our own mortality. What I enjoyed is that the grownups aren't treated as garden variety bad guys. Even the military, which is nearly always portrayed as evil, finds itself in a contradictory position--having to go on faith. The animation is wonderful, but so are the ""performances."" No spoilers here, but I think the ending is a lovely tribute to the spirit of the life force in all of us--even those of us not made of metal. See this. It is one of the better movies of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"a masterpiece, plain and simple","I'm 25 years old.  I have no children.  So why am I praising a 'kid's movie' which nobody saw?  Because I have never seen a film pack the emotional wallop 'The Iron Giant' provided.The film's plot is similar to 'E.T.' - a young boy meets an alien robot from outer space, who is stranded on earth, and runs afoul of paranoid government agents.  Not to knock the Spielberg film, but what makes 'The Iron Giant' the better film is that the young boy is the teacher.  It is he who has to teach the Giant about the beauty of life, the difference between good and evil, and choices we have to make.  The Iron Giant, it turns out, is a weapon, who has to struggle against his own nature.  The film has an obvious (and timely) gun control message, but its real message is about the choice we make when dealing with other people.  We can use our powers for good or lash out at everyone around us.I dare not give away the climax.  All I will say is that it features a sacrifice absolutely breaktaking and emotionally shattering (albeit somewhat blunted by the ending).  The animation is gorgeous, Michael Kamen's score is perfect, and the film beautifully evokes the 1950s.Sadly, poor marketing kept audiences away in droves.  All I can say is, to heck with the box office gross.  Despite Warner's appearant desire to pretend the film never existed, the word is getting around about what a magical film this is, and I have no doubt it will join 'It's a Wonderful Life' as a film which bombed in theatres but became a classic over the years.  See it now, so you can say you discovered it before everyone else did.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A delightful surprise,"""The Iron Giant"" is the kind of animated film you wish there was more of. It respects the audience's intelligence, it has genuine emotion without resorting to schmaltz, and best of all it balances fantasy (well, science fiction) with believability.  I think Warner Brothers animation has out-Disneyed Disney by adding thoughtful writing to clean, understated animation.  What a concept!The story is deceptively simple: Iron Giant falls from the sky at the dawn of the Space Race and befriends a young boy.  But within that framework we get a double story, one for the grown ups and one for the kids, but the message is essentially the same one: paranoia and violence begets violence. I appreciate very much, as others who have commented, that no one burst into incongruous song and that there were no cutesy animal sidekicks.  I should add that there were no clever yet implausible plot twists, nor were there any stock characters.  The bad guy gets a little overheated, true, but he is never the embodiment of all things evil.  The townspeople are your average small town Americans, not bumpkins.  Mom is, well, mom-ish, caring but neither shrewish nor prone to whimpering outbursts.  And our hero is plucky but not annoyingly precocious.A BIG plus for this film is how well it weds the computer animation to the hand-drawn animation, a feat that the Big Mouse hasn't mastered yet.  Even as recently as ""Tarzan"" it is glaringly apparent what parts are computer graphics and which aren't, and the contrast is very distracting. ""The Iron Giant"" makes a virtue of streamlined animation that draws your eye to the beauty of its color and motion.It was a very VERY distinct and unusual pleasure to be treated to a film such as this.  Give us more . . . please!",,Anonymous,Animation
The Best of Two Worlds: Adult and Kid,"All too often, ""family films"" are only infantile, simplistic formulas with a few self-referential and pop-culture jokes thrown in to try and keep adults awake.  But then along comes  something like ""The Iron Giant"", which is sophisticated enough to demand respect while maintaining a mythic and pure-hearted tone that actually does appeal to the kid in everybody.""The Iron Giant"" is refreshingly non-Disney in no end of ways.  Characters seem real and chosen to fit the story, instead of being a superficial reshuffling of an old formula.  The animation definitely has its eye-popping moments, but there are also scenes of great wonderment, pathos, and humour that only top-drawer animation can convey.  The Giant itself is a great character, who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues (another huge break from Disney).  No scene is wasted in this film, either; every set piece, even the really funny ones, helps either to establish the ""world"" of the movie, or to advance the plot.  At no time do you feel that you are merely waiting for the story to crank up again.""The Iron Giant"" is funny, exhilarating, and touching as well.  It's sad to see it failing at the box office, as a blunt reminder that the success of films is often in direct proportion to their publicity budget.  Hopefully, though, word-of-mouth will come to its rescue.  Go see it!  Tell your friends!  Then go again!  (Repeat as necessary.)P.S.  I find myself comparing the Iron Giant character to Martin Donovan's character in ""Amateur"".  If there is anyone else on earth who has seen both films you may wish to entertain the notion yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
YES!!!!! NO SONG OR DANCE NUMBERS!!!!!!,"What a GREAT movie! Not just for kids, but adults as well. Kids will love it on one level, and adults will love it on another level. Even adults who are not parents will love it!There's humor, there's action, there's nostalgia, there's the perfect capture of being a child, there are positive messages (be yourself, don't kill, etc.), there's satire, there are adults who are not stupid and not comic relief....there's GREAT WRITING!AND NO SONG AND DANCE NUMBERS! Also, there are NO COMIC-RELIEF ANIMAL SIDEKICKS! Take that, Disney!I know some people might be resisting this movie, because it looks like it's aimed for kids - and they might be expecting a Disney clone (and we all know the bad results of Disney wannabes).....but TRUST ME. Give this movie a chance - you'll love it!Is there ANYTHING wrong with it? Well, the only thing that bugged me (just a little) were some close-ups of the characters - these certain close-ups had a ""sketchy"" look a la the movies ""We're Back!"" and ""Balto"".Fortunately, there's very little of this. Other than that - this is a PERFECT MOVIE!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Absolute Wonder Which Cherishes Its Influences - The Best Animated Feature Ever !,"Animated movies have long been considered strictly for children.  The old Disney classics that started it all are indeed aimed at kids, but are still very watchable, even for adults.  With the advent of TOY STORY and its countless mimics,  animated feature films have taken long strides to be considered worthy of serious attention.  THE IRON GIANT is just such an animated piece.  The 87 minute wonder is, to put it mildly, incredible. Everything about it is good.  I've also never seen so many influences and references in an animated film before.This is a movie with a heart the size of the title character.  A gentle, gigantic robot is rocketed to earth and befriends a 10 year old boy.  The kid has a single mother (voiced nicely by Jennifer Aniston) and he is just looking for a friend, whether it be a squirrel, or even a 50 foot tall machine.  The familiar premise is obviously out of Spielberg's E.T.  One scene even has the giant reaching out his finger to the boy in much the same way ET did to 10 year old Elliott when he departed this earth.  E.T. was an out of this world fantasy that took place on this earth.  Here, it is animated and almost just as effective.IRON GIANT takes place during 1957 in a small town in Maine.  The 1950's was a time when the American public was fearful of atomic bombs and the possibility of alien life off the earth.  Live-action sci-fi films of the 1950's always depicted the arrival of ""dangerous"" alien life and our efforts to destroy it.  THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is an influence on this film for evident reasons.  Ultimately, the characters in that classic learn from the extra-terrestrial being and realize the dangers of the A-Bomb.  It is amazing to see an animated feature which can relay this same type of message some 50 years later.A beautiful and touching ode to BAMBI is witnessed about halfway through. It also brings back some tearful moments from the key scene in that great, hand-drawn film.  Here, we see both hand-drawn imagery coupled with a computer-generated ""iron giant"".  The title character is actually a 3D composition done digitally, mixed with the 2D action surrounding him.  There are some highly imaginative shots of the robot mixing in with the film's environment.  At one point, he appears to be a lighthouse until the lights begin to blink.  I guess robots must blink too.Enough analysis.  I loved this movie.  It is ranked #81 on the top list by other user authors for a reason.  Not only is it escapist, fantastic entertainment for kids, adults, and seniors alike, it is an animated picture like no other.  It combines the joy of SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO, the commentary of 1950's science fiction, and the wizardry and laughter of TOY STORY and its sequel.  Do not miss this enchanting flick.RATING: ****",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Outstanding on all levels!,"The Iron Giant was a beautiful, funny and touching movie, that is one of the best non-Disney animated movies I have seen along with The Prince of Egypt, The Secret of NIMH, Watership Down and Castle of Cagliostro. There wasn't a single thing I hated about the movie, for me it was outstanding on every level. The animation was absolutely gorgeous, with stunning colourful backgrounds and brilliant character animation especially on the Iron Giant himself. The music by Michael Kamen was consistently excellent, and never overpowered the story. In fact at times it even enhanced the drama. And the film has a beautiful message not to mention a sweet story. The characters were delightful, Hogarth isn't annoying at all and the Iron Giant isn't scary in the slightest. Strictly speaking he has to be one of the most gentle and poignant characters in an animated film. There are plenty of effective scenes like the explosive climax and the scene with the dead deer is a real tear jerker. I will admit I was worried initially when I saw the voice cast, but everybody involved did a superb job. Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jnr were perfect, in their most understated performances. Both get stick about being untalented, but for me their vocal contributions in this film suggests otherwise, while Christopher MacDonald almost steals the film as the FBI agent. Eli Marienthal is very sweet and likable as Hogarth too, and watch out for John Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. All in all, an outstanding film, that if you mind me saying so is the best animated film of 1999 and one of the best films of that year too. I may be wrong but I do think it is highly underrated on IMDb. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stunning and magical,"I had heard many great things about the iron giant in the last few years but was one of those films I never got round to seeing. I picked up a copy of the special edition DVD expecting an entertaining animated film. What I actually got was not just one of the best animated films I have seen but one of the best films ever. It takes you to another world but never strays from reality and when watching it you forget it's animated. The characters are so well written it puts most live action films to shame. If you pass this off as a kids film you will be missing out on one of the most immersing and emotional experiences you can get from a film. The voice cast are perfect, the animation stunning and the fact this film flopped when released is nothing short of criminal. I urge anyone even with only a passing interest in cinema to watch this film and prepare to be amazed. Brad Bird must be one of the best directors working in animation and after seeing the incredibles the iron giant was no fluke.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Didn't Get It,"I was flipping through the dial and saw that the ""Iron Giant"" was coming up next.  At first I got excited from all of the positive word of mouth I had heard about the film.After 30 minutes of this movie, I was completely baffled. I would have to say this was okay at best.  The little kid was so happy and enthusiastic that it made me nauseous.  I sat there dumbfounded that adults would be so swept away with this.  There was the obvious symbolism that can I am sure is mentioned by other users.  Making a cartoon artsy doesn't make it good.

Exquisite.,"The Iron Giant is a critically acclaimed piece of animated cinema. I wasn't expecting it to be that good, but The Iron Giant was an amazing movie, it is easily the most exquisite animated movie I have ever seen.Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marenthal) is obsessed by the opportunites offered by science fiction, the possibility of an alien take-over or, at the very least, an attack from outer space. The original story, which the late Poet Laureate had set in England, saw the innocent Titan of the title emerge from the sea; here he is a visitor from another galaxy.The Iron Giant is an amazing piece of animation, the voice-overs were done perfectly, the actors obviously enjoyed themselves, the animated art direction and cinematography was beautiful and the giant itself is just...breathtaking.The Iron Giant is not just another silly little kiddies movie, it is perfection in filmmaking. Please, for the love of God, make your life better and see this brilliant film.I rate The Iron Giant 10 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Animation
A very good movie....,"Hmmm, what to say...well....  it was really good.  I've seen it several times, and I've enjoyed it immensely each time for different reasons.Analytically I find the animation incredible.  The characters are extremely alive and quite realistic, not because of incredible drawing, well, actually, yes: the way the characters are drawn, and animated, is incredible.  From the jerking, swaying and swooshing of body parts to the magnificent and CONSISTENT use of eyes, eyebrows and cheekbones to show real emotions, it's definite that this movie is a masterpiece in terms of animation.  The backgrounds are wonderfully lush, and evoke a wonderful sense of everything that shows fall for the beautiful season it is.  I love animation, and I love good looking landscapes, so the artists behind this movie are making a fan out of me very quickly.I admire (analytically) most of all the enormous apparance of little details in the film: the season sublty changes from fall to winter; the characters are always doing something, even if they aren't directly in focus (the best ad-libbing a director could dream of); I also think in some parts of the movie the little details actually become crucial to the movie's strength and validity (the time and setting of the story help it to make more sense, also, the ""duck and cover"" scene)You know, I think it's amazing when sometimes a movie can move you so much, talking about it's good qualities seems like child's play.  This is the kind of movie that you can watch over and over and take a long time to get sick of. We all have movies like that, very few can do that to us, but we have them. I'm realising as I write that I like this movie very much, because I've written two or three paragraphs and have not even started talking about the iron giant yet.The animation and expression of emotion in the giant, who is a computer graphics animated character, a hundred feet tall and with a certain old time sci fi persona to him, equals and even surpasses it's traditionally animated companions.  There were scenes in the movie that the giant almost made me cry because of his expressions.  The director, Brad Bird I think, should earn good credit for his work bringing the giant to life.  The giant was very organic and fluid, always animated and extremely alive, without really trying to be. After a while it obvious he's not your average rigid robot.It's hard not to give away details when you write a lot, but thankfully I haven't really given anything away.  I will say this...the movie is about not prejudging things you are unfamiliar with, big or small, and it's about doing what is right and not using gray areas and politics as an excuse not to do the right thing. The movie explores the strange concept of finding friendship, love, and innocence inbetween past guilts and prejudices. It is one of the most well rounded, enriching, thought provoking movies I have seen in my lifetime, and the best part is that it wasn't the visual effects that made me say that...something other feature animation companies have used a a string to lead me on for almost a decade.  I feel like I just recovered from an extended brainwashing experiment.  I've learned my lesson. No longer will movies that use stunning graphics to redeem themselves be an interest to me.  Rather I will watch movies for the messages they give and the depth those movies have. If anything Brad Bird must have tried to make the giant as close in simplicity to the regular animated characters as possible, because you CANNOT tell the difference between CG and traditional in this movie.  Exceptional stuff.I can't imagine anyone I know not liking this movie.  I've shown it to a LOT of people, college students mostly, of all races and religions, with different prides and prejudices, the result, amazingly, always seems to be the same: I have some after movie comments here, and I quote:""Wow!"" ; ""That was NICE!""; ""That was SO...GOOD!"" ;""That giant is crucial, dog!"" ;""It was good...yeah...I liked it!"",; and ""Dang man, that joint TIGHT!"".  If you actually read this review all the way, that's nice. Now forget everything I bumbled about and go see this movie, that way you can spent less time writing your own review than you did reading mine.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A new classic,"""The Iron Giant"" is simply one of the best animated movies ever made. Brad Bird, the talented man that worked in shows like ""The Simpsons"" and directed the great animated film ""The Incredibles"" is the man responsible for this masterpiece. That man is a genius who is able to turn the simplest stories into gold, having an entire career of very good films. Even his ""Mission Impossible"" film (A franchise which I particularly don't like)managed to be worth-watching.Now ""The Iron Giant"" is one of my favorite films, and it is the best movie directed by Brad Bird, having not only a great animation style, but also a memorable story (Which shows that kid's films could have deep and complex stories)and many intesting characters, The Giant itself is a fascinating creature, which could be easily considered one of the most endearing figures from the entire animation history.Movies like this are enough proof that making a ""children's film"" is not a excuse for a lack of quality.

"Beautiful Animation, But It Didn't Captivate Me","The Iron Giant is often hailed as a modern animated classic, known for its heartwarming story and timeless themes of friendship, sacrifice, and understanding. The film, set during the Cold War, tells the story of a young boy named Hogarth who befriends a giant robot from outer space.Despite the praise this film has garnered, it simply didn't resonate with me. While the animation is undeniably well-crafted, the story felt a bit too simplistic and predictable for my taste. I found it difficult to fully engage with the characters, and the emotional moments, which many find touching, didn't have the same impact on me. The narrative, while solid, didn't capture my attention, and I found myself losing interest as the movie progressed.For those who enjoy heartfelt animated tales, The Iron Giant might be a favorite, but for me, it fell short of expectations.

Guns kill.,"An ambitious take on Ted Hughes' 1968 children's book The Iron Man, director Brad Bird's The Iron Giant works well as both archetype-infused allegory and heartstring-tugging tale of friendship.  Set in small town Maine in the 1950s at the height of Cold War paranoia, the film explores the relationship between a lonely, fatherless boy (a photo on a nightstand hints that the father was a combat pilot killed in WWII) and a monstrously huge, hulking metal behemoth (the origins of which are brilliantly left to the imagination).  The animation marks a welcome contrast from the virtually ubiquitous Disney template, with the human characters bearing a stylized, comic book exaggeration that fits perfectly with the story material.  The Iron Giant has more than enough imagination and sparkle to interest kids and adults, and nicely balances its action-adventure aspirations with a solidly-crafted sense of moral purpose.",,Anonymous,Animation

It's not just a great action movie with great writing it will also touch you on an emotional level as well. I have been waiting and watching for a sequel, but I don't think anyone involved in this production intended to do another (even though the ending leaves that wide open).

Timeless Cult Masterpiece,"This was one of my favorite films growing up and it holds up extremely well. Apparently, this bombed during its initial release, as it was caught between the old ways of animated films and the new breath of fresh air in Pixar. Brad Bird will become well known for the latter's stellar films, but his directorial debut may be his crowning achievement.Set during the height of the Cold War in the '50s, the story follows a young boy named Hogarth, who lives with his single mother in a small town in Maine. He's obsessed with science fiction movies and comic books and finds a paternal relationship and friendship with an otherworldly giant robot. The film balances its obvious E.T. inspired storyline with its Superman-esque inspiration as well. It's seeped with 50's iconography and mood too, giving the audience a lot of insight into the Cold War and the red scare that was so prevalent at the time the movie was taking place. Its period piece offers much more subtext than a traditionally animated film.Every character is charming and well rounded, whether it be Hogarth himself, Annie, Kent Mansley, Dean, or the Iron Giant himself. All the voice actors do extremely well too, especially Vin Diesel in the titular role, whose soft-spoken giant's relationship with Hogarth is the emotional backbone for the film. The animation and art style is beautiful, and adds to the depth of each character with exaggerated facial expressions, and offers a lot more focus on the emotions of the characters. The computer animation of the iron giant gives it an otherworldly perspective.The Iron Giant is one of the best-animated films of all time, and a classic that can be enjoyed by anyone. It's an emotionally warm film full of vibrant animation, great characters, and a story that offers much heart and joy.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Who and outer space enter Stephen King's possible childhood,"Yesterday was the 60th anniversary of Sputnik's launch, so it was probably appropriate that I watched ""The Iron Giant"", which indirectly deals with Sputnik. The movie has a plot similar to ""E.T."", with a lonely boy befriending a being from outer space. In this case, the setting is 1957 Maine (so could this accidentally represent Stephen King's childhood?) and the being is a giant robot whose origin and purpose never get revealed. Sure enough, a government agent starts prying.I was surprised to learn that the executive producer is none other than Pete Townshend of The Who. The last person whom you'd expect to be involved in the production of a movie that pokes fun at 1950s movies about aliens (the movie also has a scene where the kids are in school watching one of those duck-and-cover movies). The whole issue of a possible nuclear war looms large in the background (and nowadays, it looks more possible than ever).When the movie got released, the ads made it look like something to avoid at all costs. It turns out that the movie isn't half bad, despite the occasional crude humor. Not any sort of masterpiece, but still OK.The cast includes Jennifer Aniston, Vin Diesel, Harry Connick Jr. and Cloris Leachman.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Message Hurts An Otherwise Great Animation,"The premise of this movie is about the paranoid nature of the cold war and the imminence of nuclear bombs and the suspicious actions of agent provocateurs, but it falls apart when it is revealed at the end that all of the agents fears and worries were true. The animation is great and the silhouettes and framing are nearly iconic, unfortunately its story forgets all of what was mentioned in the first sentence of this review and its political messaging falls apart and makes you see the seams in its logic. It then turns to frame itself as being about ""choice"" and ""free will"" despite everything else up until that key moment having signified it was about something else entirely. Fun, but it lacks the script polish that would have turned it into a classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Overrated and Forgettable,"The Iron Giant is an overrated animated film with a weak storyline, average animation, and shallow characters that lack meaningful development. The pacing feels unnecessarily slow, making it difficult to stay engaged throughout its runtime. While the movie tries to deliver heartfelt and emotional moments, they often feel forced and fail to resonate on a deeper level. Despite its cult following and widespread praise, the film feels outdated and offers very little substance. It lacks the originality, charm, and emotional weight that make animated classics stand out. Ultimately, The Iron Giant is an underwhelming experience that doesn't live up to its reputation.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly Good Fun For Anyone,"It's nice to see an elegantly crafted piece of animation come out of America.  How did they manage it?  The writing is great the animation is excellent and the voice acting is superb.  I don't think I've liked an English animated film this much since The Plague Dogs.  The film doesn't talk down to it's audience, and instead tells a simple story very well.  My only complaint would be that Hogarth is somewhat of a smart-alec at times, but I guess this is the era of Leave it To Beaver.Many of the situations are standard movie-fare, the ex-lax in the food, the helmet on the bed, but it's nice to see them in an animated film for a change.  As an anime fan, the realism of the movie didn't impress me as much as the quality of the writing, voice acting, and the music and sound effects.  I particularly remember the sound of the power lines snapping and the musical score building up to the climax of the film.The character design for the giant is excellent, it's amazing how they could draw out very subtle emotions without noticeably distorting the face.  I bawled like a baby near the end.Finally, most importantly for me, there are NO CHEAP LAUGHS in the movie. One of the best moments in the movie for me was when Hogarth is running through the woods and he slams his face into a low branch.  The theater full of kids raised on recent Disney crap bursts into laughter, but wait, there's no stupid sound effect, he's not hopping back up to his feet instantly with a ridiculous lump or distorted face or little birds flying around his head, he's still on the ground ... and what's that coming out of his nose.. it CAN'T BE.. it IS, a trickle of BLOOD.  The kids (and parents) quickly cease their laughter.  I couldn't stop smiling because I knew then that like me, they actually cared about the character on the screen and frankly that doesn't happen very often.Tarzan was a small step in the right direction, and near the end of the long path beginning with that step is The Iron Giant.",,Anonymous,Animation

A powerful film,"I am a fully grown adult who was not allowed to watch this movie as a kid so there is no nostalgia speaking when I say this is possibly the best film ever created. The funny parts are extremely funny and the emotional parts are extremely emotional. I think if I watched this as a kid I would have enjoyed it but definitely not as much as I do as an adult. I also believe that this is a very important film for kids to watch. It is rare for a children's movie to have such a strong message that isn't just a shallow ""guns are bad"" movie. There are obviously low points (as there are with every movie) but the high points are so high that they make up for the low points and then some. If you are an parent who is hesitant about showing this to their child, just do it. But don't just show them this movie, sit down and watch it with them.

"Who Is the Iron Giant, and Why has he Come to Earth?","Neither of these questions is answered in this charming movie, based on a novel by Ted Hughes, but it doesn't seem to matter. The Iron Giant is highly emotional film, but in an understated way. The scenes of 1950s small town Maine were highly evocative without being overly nostalgic. Hogarth is a great role model for young boys, even if he can be a bit impulsive and doesn't always listen to authority figures: he cares deeply for animals, and in this case, his robot friend, whom he looks after and instructs as if a young child. Not having experienced that era myself, the depiction of the Iron Giant nonetheless reminded of postwar Science Fiction covers, as in Tales to Astonish, etc., even if his gentle character did not. And I liked the anti-gun theme: Hogarth's toy gun ""triggers"" the self-defense mechanism in the robot, who gradually learns of his strength and automated programming, and, with the help of Hogarth, fights it: ""I am not a gun."" I also appreciated the ambiguity of the robot: is it aliens? Russians? Does it matter?Watched in February 2021, all three of us really enjoyed it.

One of the most underrated films of all time,"This certainly ranks as one of the finest examples of cinema in recent pop culture memory. Intelligent, funny, tragic, and deeply moving, we'd be so lucky to ever see an American animated film strike such chords again.The look of the film is superb, and it's underlying themes and messages resonate even more strongly today. Containing a boldly pacifist theme, the film tells a story of a mechanism of war--meant to destroy--that, through the innocence of a little boy, learns to sacrifice in the name of peace and understanding, as apposed to killing in the name of ownership and power.I hope,as years pass, more and more people come to discover this gem so that they can share their experience with the Iron Giant, as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"As touching, funny and timely a film as any committed to celluloid","Having to compete with Disney, Dreamworks and Pixar, Warner Brother's animation has never been at the forefront of the animation industry. Apparently all they needed was the brilliant Brad Bird to quell any doubt about their capabilities. The Iron Giant is one of the final films to be presented in the traditional animation form, but even this flick had begun the transition to computer generated visuals. A number of characters, including the giant, were inserted digitally over the hand drawn background, taking special care to perform this imperfectly so as to contrast the rougher backdrop. The finished piece is a visually flawless and captivating film and ranks among the best animated features to ever grace the screen.Brad Bird who began with significant role in The Simpson's cartoon, marks his feature film debut, and would follow up with the even superior films The Incredibles and Ratatouille. The Iron Giant is part political statement, part satire and part family fare, but contains more substance then most children's films, containing passionate and is reminiscent of classics such as ET and The Lion King. Based on the book by Ted Hughes, the tale tells of a young boy in Rockwell, Maine named Hogarth Hughes voiced by unknown Eli Marienthal who, if you must put a face to the voice played Stiffler's younger brother in American Pie, in Cold War era 1958. His mother voiced by Jennifer Aniston, works late shifts at a local diner, his father has been killed (presumably in combat, as we see from a photograph he was a fighter pilot) and Hogarth who has been moved up a grade, finds himself lonely and misunderstood.On a stormy night, a mysterious object crashes off the coast, which to Hogarth's surprise (and everyone's for that matter) is a giant metal eating robot. Finding the creature to be as harmless and confused as a young boy, he befriends the behemoth, stashing him away in a local scrap yard, who the owner (voiced by Harry Connick Jr.) is not especially pleased about. After the giants shenanigans begin to be noticed, a federal agent, brilliantly voiced by Christopher McDonald, comes to investigate ands comes to suspect Hogarth may know something.The scenes where Hogarth attempts to hide the creature are the most hilarious, one sequence after the giant loses his hand (which can walk on its own once severed) our young protagonist attempts to sneak it out of the house. But don't be fooled, the iron Giant is less comedy then it is bold statement, but don't let this turn you off either.Bird's piece is riddled with political commentary on the Cold War and its effect on America and the society's obsession with warfare, weapons and at what cost freedom can be obtained, issues such as morality and death, and explores the human gift of free will, as both a blessing and as a means to do harm. The Giant, despite having every few lines is surprisingly layered and human, and has an innocence covering an inner evil turmoil. The message that you are who you chose to be is reminiscent throughout the whole film, but it never for a second feels preachy. The climax is a thrilling as any action picture, which I will say may be slightly too violent for younger children, and the closing act is as touching as any committed to celluloid.The Iron Giant is a dazzling tale and complex experience which is bound to keep you involved, entertained and will give you something to think about after leaving the theatre. Ranking as one of the best films of 1999, if The Iron Giant marks the end of the reign of the traditional animation style, I say that no finer adieu could be given in this world, or any, dare I say it, beyond this Earth.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A beautiful 90's classic,"Taking place seemingly in the 1950's, this film literally has a little something for everyone. It's supposed to be for children, yes, but even older audiences can appreciate a film like this. It has aspects of wonderful science fiction action and adventure. I would say its a somewhat emotional movie as well. The giant is obviously sent to invade the earth and attack humans, but because of the ""bump on his head"", he has forgotten his mission and is, as a child, slowly exploring the world around him and beginning to understand the facts of life. I've seen this film literally about 50 times since I was a kid, to the present day, and I can safely say, even watching it as an adult, that its a wonderful movie for the family of all ages to enjoy together.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nostalgia brought me here...,"A timeless animated gem that still resonates with me after all these years. Revisiting this classic, I was reminded of the power of storytelling and its ability to transport us back to our childhoods. This heartwarming tale of friendship and understanding between a young boy and a giant alien robot evokes a sense of nostalgia that's impossible to ignore. The film's themes of innocence, trust, and the fear of the unknown make it a must-watch for both kids and adults.This film is a testament to the brilliance of Brad Bird's storytelling and the emotional depth that animated movies can achieve. It seamlessly blends humor, action, and heart to create a memorable experience. The relationship between the two main characters is beautifully portrayed, teaching us valuable lessons about acceptance and empathy. Vin Diesel's voice work as the Iron Giant adds an extra layer of charm to the character.

Attention to Detail,"Having been nine in 1957 myself, i appreciate the incredible amount of attention to verisimilitude that this film exhibits -- even the wide turn-ups on Hogarth's jeans, for example.Another thing i was interested by is the fact that we are never told *why* Hogarth's mom is a single parent... but i seem to recall a framed photo somewhere in the house showing a pilot standing by a jet fighter. I knew a couple of kids my age whose dads had never come home from a place called Korea.There are some glitches -- a 1959 Cadillac in a scrapyard in 1957, for instance, or going skinny-dipping in a lake in Maine in late October; and i'm fairly sure that (a) There was no ""Spirit"" comic in publication in 1957 and that (b) the ""Spirit"" comic cover shown is actually a painting ""Spirit"" creator Will Eisner did in the late 70s/early 80s for a reprint series.The references to films of the period -- the sand pit from ""Invaders from Mars"", the tank disintegration for ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and the animated ""Brain from Planet Arous"" on teevee are neat, too.Looking forward to next Friday's opening of Brad Bird's new film, ""The Incredibles"", though i suspect that ""Iron Giant"" will prove to be the stronger of the two...",,Anonymous,Animation

Animation the Old-Fashioned Way,"'The Iron Giant' is a very loose adaptation of Ted Hughes' 1968 children's classic 'The Iron Man'. Whereas the original novel was a poetic and lyrical fairytale that read like modern mythology, Brad Bird's movie is a straight up sci-fi movie in the vein of 'E.T.' Set during the era of the Soviet launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 and the ensuing Cold War panic, the whole thing looks like the kind of movie that Disney used to make at the time, all beautifully painted backdrops and hand-drawn characters. The evocation of the era is very well done, with a careful and detailed eye for period ephemera and styling. It's a gentle and affectionate movie with a distinct lack of the knowing, adult-oriented, pop-culture referencing attitude of most recent animation. But this back-to-basics approach, while refreshing, seems a little too simple, too naïve, and too superficial. It's a good movie, and one I would encourage children to see, but a lot of rich potential was sorely missed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly Mature,"The most unfortunate thing about this film was how underrated it was when it came out. To be honest, when I heard about it, I thought the animation looked simplistic and was another straight to video deserving flik.But when I actually got to see it finally on TV it blew me away. Not only was the animation actually an artistic and in a few ways a technical achievement (nicely handled discrete use of CGI), the story and dialogue were far more sophisticated than the usual strand of kid's animation. So much so I became far more intrigued emotionally by the characters and the major plot twists then I have been by many live action movies. The humour was also subdued to short well timed bursts, not completely unbearable like some tripe i've experienced. The story is also told in a way that is logical; characters react accordingly to events and everything happens in a way that can't be questioned and is completely understandable, not overly simplified for the younger audience. Plus the ending was satisfying and a great way to round off an unforgettable experience.It's a shame therefore that such an emotionally vibrant and surprisingly mature animated movie has to be judged on how good it is just by how much cash it rakes in, a dire fate that many a movie has been subject to. 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

An Underrated Animated Masterpiece,"I'm going to say one thing. When I first saw this back in 2016, it did seem interesting to me. I thought it would be just an enjoyable sci fi film. But honestly, I did not expect this to be one of my favorite animated movies. The Iron Giant may possibly be the best animated movie Warner Bros has produced worldwide. At first, it seemed it was just gonna have a little cheesy giant monster film. But this is more than that. The story was incredibly written that's about a giant robot that is taught to be a civilized monster. It has profited a lot of character development. And this has presented top notch animation with some of the best effects for an animated film. It's not enough to make a reason how I consider this a masterpiece. It's how heartfelt it is. If you have actually seen monster movies, the setting is in the 50s. And you'll see they normally either take over cities or destroy the world. But this is a lot different. This is about how the giant learns about the world, what happens in life and why everyone would be afraid of him. I'm not gonna spoil it, but let's say that the ending has been a true example. No matter what, you got to watch this film. The one thing that shocked me is it wasn't much successful at the box office. And now many people has given so much attention many years later. Not only is this one of the most underrated movies I've seen, but also one of the most feel good movies I've seen. As the giant himself said it best, souls never die.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The greatest animated movie ever created,"This is the greatest animated movie ever created. It takes state-of-the-art computer graphics, excellent animation, old-school character design, and a compelling and truly modern story. I believe this is based off a book called 'The Iron Giant' or 'The Iron Man' or something. I'm not too sure - never read it.By the production studio _not_ being Disney, it really is a no-holds barred scenario. No cushy wide-eyed animals singing in dewy meadows, or bad guys in epics fights missing every blow almost as it were blatant. No, this movie has an extreme sense of emotion, realism, and feeling I only ever felt in one other animated movie (Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust). The absolute jolt in the `emotional quotient' at the end of this movie is a mental roller coaster, it's a hill you know is there but it 'gets' you every single time.If there is an ""animated movie gauge"" this should be what the rest measure up to.It's a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brad Bird at his best!,"I, unfortunately, didn't get to see this movie until six years after it's release. What a misfortune indeed! This film truly is a masterwork of art, direction, script, and artistic vision. The voice acting is top notch here, Aniston and Harry Connick Jr provide a fabulous and perfectly toned performance. Vin Diesel, even though not saying much, delivers the voice of the Giant with heart, passion and conviction.And I have not yet touched on the humor! There were many parts during this film that had me laughing in hysterics! Bird truly has a knack for making us laugh.Lastly, this movie truly has a message to it that I firmly believe in. Passive to some, obvious to others, the message of The Iron Giant rings true to us all as The Giant gently says ""I am not a gun"".A true tear-jerker in the best way, The Iron Giant is a film of greatness that all should experience and enjoy.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hits the mark for adults and children,"The story is well constructed... a significant departure from the Ted Hughes original which I rate very low.

The camera angles and  moves were excellent; if this had been a live action movie it would have been superb to watch.In summary: Subtle, cool, funny, involving, moralistic, sad, fun, exciting.... this is one to buy on DVD and hand down to the kids as they grow up.When my 2 year old climbs up on the sofa, opens a cupboard, searches out the VHS tape of Iron Giant, rewinds it and puts it on the TV, for the 5th time, you know he likes it.

Family entertainment takes a dive for the worst.,"At the preview for ""The Iron Giant"", my kids could barely hold their excitement.  They've seen the commercials and knew several of the characters already.  In advance, I had warned them that there weren't any sidekicks or catchy songs as they've been accustomed to.  By the end of the film, their eyes were downcast...and it wasn't from sleep-deprivation.The film isn't all that it was hyped to be.  Much of what you see in the commercials is the whole film...why go to the theaters?  The commercials tell you everything!  Moreover, the story isn't widely original, either. If you've ever watched ""We're Back"", ""Pete's Dragon"", ""All Dogs Go To Heaven"" or ""E.T."" (all children/family movies) then you've already watched this film.  It's the typical plot about children who find an amazing discovery, keep it a secret, abuse its powers, and learn to extend beyond their own feelings.  For my children, probably the most damaging to the plot, however, was their dislike of the giant itself.  There wasn't enough to connect him with the audience which undermines the emotion the rest of the film builds on.  Without the connection between such a key character, the audience loses interest.Furthermore, the movie's animation barely matched with current releases. There weren't as many lush color tones or smooth-running lines to make the film visually appealing.  Don't get me wrong, Warner Brothers has had great animation in the past (although its last ventures ""Quest For Camelot"" and ""The King and I"" were complete flops).  If they'd only stick with Bugs Bunny, they'd have the works played out in their hands.  ""Space Jam"" was wildly successful, plus the shading and colors of ""old"" characters brought new life to their persona.  In several aspects, ""Space Jam"" was far superior from animation to plot, aesthetics to witty lines when compared to ""The Iron Giant"".  Where past Warner Brothers animation aimed toward the family, ""The Iron Giant"" aimed for the commercial.  Several times, the topic of Superman (a character which Warner Brothers owned) was brought up.  Soon, we'll see Superman figures lined up with the corny Iron Giant banks and toothbrushes.Lastly, there's the objectional material.  For the first time in my life, I saw the main character of a cartoon, feature-length movie use the restroom. The use of the bathroom is all too common in live action films, but they've begun to pass surreptitiously into cartoons.  Why does such a scene need to take place?  All in all, the film relays an anti-government atmosphere. The main characters are always on the run while officials heartlessly chase its ""victims"".  I admit, several children's books are perfect for Hollywood. This one may have been one if taken from a different approach.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Best of all, it's nice to see an animated film without distracting musical numbers (don't get me wrong, I like musicals as well as the next guy) because done wrong they will handicap a movie (Prince of Egypt comes to mind.

One of the Best Kid's Movies to Exist,"The Iron Giant really lives up to its hype. It's full of great, wholesome moments. While it has a pretty serious tone for an animated movie, it still has a great vibe, and I really couldn't see it as a totally childish movie. I love the giant and Hogarth's dynamic, and the animation. It's got some amazing visuals for an animated movie from 1999. I really wish there were more with that style. As far as storyline goes, it's amazing. It's perfectly paced, and the movie isn't very long at all. There is one extremely sad scene, another reason why it's isn't real good for a childish audience, but it's amazing. This is definitely a top pick for an animated movies list.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Predictable and dull, but kids will like it","1957, the Russians have just launched Sputnik and Cold War fear and paranoia is the order of the day. Hogarth Hughes lives with his mom, Annie, in the small town of Rockwell, Maine. One day a very large robot lands on earth from outer space. After some adventures, Hogarth befriends the robot. However, the US government has sent a special agent to investigate the strange occurrences in the area (unbeknownst to them, caused by the robot) and his intentions towards what's causing the phenomena are less benevolent.Predictable and dull. Quite conventional, linear story with an overused, unoriginal story line. Replace the robot with any other harmless creature that a kid might befriend but the authorities will be suspicious of and you have the plot for heaps of children's movies. Doesn't add anything new or profound and is only mildly entertaining.Kids should like it though. Is essentially a made-for-kids movie and they won't be disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
a truly great movie!,"The Iron Giant is one of the best movies I have ever seen, if not THE BEST--all genres considered. My 3 yr old son absolutely adores it, and watches it about 3 times a day. Therefore I watch it about 3 times a day, and I can tell you honestly, I never get tired of seeing it, even after the 75 times I've watched it so far. Every time I still laugh out loud, and tears swell in my eyes. My husband actually introduced us to it, as he loves it as well. Not surprising; it is one of the best written, most touching movies I have had the pleasure of watching over...and over...and over.I don't know why this didn't do well at the box office. Too inconsequential for the public I guess, most likely passed off as another Disney rip-off. There are no cheap tears here, or cheesy gags of any kind. This movie is the real thing. Just take a look at the robots for sale on Ebay (I was going to buy one for my son but $200 is a bit pricey) People are finally realizing how wonderful this film is and it is slowly becoming a cult classic. Buy it up while you can still find it!",,Anonymous,Animation

The Best Animated Movie Ever,"I remember I watched some bits of this movie as a kid, but thinking about this movie now, i barely remember anything. I remember the boy, the Iron Giant and the woods, that's it. With the release of Multiversus, where Iron Giant is a playable character, I decided it was about time I rewatched this classic masterpiece of a movie. And this is probably the best animated movie ever. I love the look and feeling of this movie. It's a world you want to be in. The characters have depth, the animation is classic and the story is emotional and just fantastic. About the animation, I know that now we are experiencing the peak of animation, everything is realistic, we have realistic fur, crazy details in the animation and the line between real life and animation is almost barely visible. But I still prefer this kind of animation. It's animation, it isn't supposed to be real life. But anyways, the story is just fantastic. I never really cry with movies. This movie did cause me to shed a tear at the end. And that's special. This movie is special.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
We need to go back to this type of film,"I remember seeing The Iron Giant for the first time as if it were yesterday. I took my 5 year old son and since it was a cartoon, I was expecting your standard song filled, goofy side kick, and simple minded story lines many cartoons have. I was expecting to take a nice nap in the cool theater, but that immediately changed when we showed up to the theater. We were a couple minutes late and we came in during the boat in the storm scene. I was immediately impressed with the animation and the very first shot of the the Iron Giant. Any thoughts of a nap went by the wayside and both my son and I watched the movie with complete wide eyed awe. The characters were simple, real, funny, sad, and just perfect. The animation is what really made this movie so great for me and yes, I shed some tears at the end.It's amazing that this movie was considered a bomb but it was due to the total lack of marketing and the commercials gave you no idea what the movie was about.In 2019, we went to see the 20 year anniversary release at a local theater and it was so great to see again on the big screen. Leaving the theater, I chatted with a long haired, bespectacled older man and I mentioned how amazing the animation was. He said he loves to hear that because he worked on the movie. I asked him what he did on it and he said ""The water"" He did the water in the storm and tidal wave scene. I remember how cool I thought it was when I saw it in 1999, so it was really cool to meet someone who not only worked on the film, but did such an impressive job.This movie is one of those films guaranteed to make me cry and it does for pretty much anyone I know who has seen it. I have a running joke with a friend when we have both been drinking and pretty drunk, I will turn to him and say ""You stay.....I go.... No following..."" and every single time he will say ""Oh, you SOB....."" and start tearing up! Lol.Anyway........",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Superman,"I don't know why, but I feel everybody has a ""blacklist"", which is a list of films that a person will never see, for various reasons, and a ""greylist"", which is a list of films that this same person wants to watch, but always delegates, and consequently, never watches. And I'm saying that because for unknown reasons, ""The Iron Giant"" was in my greylist. I was missing a gem!I watched the whole catalog of Pixar and Studio Ghibli, but I think no film portrayed better the pureness and the innocence of a child than this one with Hogarth. What an adorable boy, who builds a genuine friendship with a 15-meter tall robot. A robot that could (or should be) a military weapon.Hogarth's mother doesn't appear much but she's a very difficult character to write: a good fool (I think the only other one I ever saw was the matriarch of the rich family from ""Parasite""); Dean is one of the coolest adults I saw recently in movies; and Kent Mansley is a sociopath Ed Warren, I can't remember to see this level of obsession in an animated film.The story is very simple, it's true, but first, this film is from 1999, it was almost impossible for an animated feature to have a complex story, as this type of production rarely lasted more than 90 minutes; and second, simplicity was not, is not, and will never be a demerit. What makes a film good is its efficience on what it purposes, and I think it's the case here. One of the best anti-war movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not Just For The Kids...,"THE IRON GIANT (3+ outta 5 stars) Fantastic animated movie about a young boy who forges a friendship with a giant metal robot that comes from outer space.

A mirror held up to humanity,"The enigma of the Iron Giant's complex nature is a literary device to make us look at ourselves.  The Giant is a mirror of humanity; making him a space alien is a way of bringing another perspective to our human nature.  On the one hand, we humans seem to be programmed as death machines.  On the other hand, we have compassionate souls.  Which will predominate?  The key to the whole story is simply ""You are what you choose to be.""  Your innate compassion can override your death program.The character of Mansley the bad guy is so malicious as to be actually psychotic.  His only function is to show the madness of the human death programming taken to extremes.  It makes us look back on the Cold War and wonder what the hell went wrong.  The name ""Mansley"" symbolically reflects on Man, who has allowed this insanity to run away with the human race.  The Giant's choice of compassion over death programming is inspiring and uplifting; to get that across in a movie any more you have to disguise it as a kid's movie, but this one is equally enjoyable for kids and adults alike.The technical side of this film shows the impressive advances in conventional animation, to remind us that computer animatronics are not necessarily the last word in this art form.  The most stunning light shows, however, involve weapons of mass destruction.The Giant's seemingly miraculous ability to regenerate himself as well as whip out a mind-boggling array of destructive devices reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke's dictum: ""Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great cartoon for children,"A little boy makes friends with a robot, insisting he's gentle even when the government suggests he's armed and dangerous. Although it doesn't sound like a normal premise for a children's cartoon, The Iron Giant is actually really delightful for kids and parents alike.Cartoons nowadays are sometimes just flashy and noisy, and absolutely torturous for parents to watch. And you'll be hard pressed to find one that actually teaches kids good lessons! The Iron Giant teaches good things. I won't spoil any plot points, but trust me, the lessons are ones you'll want your kids to learn. The last portion of the movie does have some violence, but compared to the loud, flashy scenes of today's movies, it's nothing your kids haven't seen before. And the animation is regular 2-D style, which I believe is better for kids' brains and developing attention spans anyway. When I watch a cartoon, I like it to look drawn by a person, not by a computer.If you particularly want your children to be shielded from on screen violence, you can wait until your kids are a little older. Otherwise, it's a really great movie to watch with your sons and daughters!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

One the most powerful anti-war films ever.,"Rewatching this film brought back so many good memories. Thankfully, I not only appreciate it as much as I did back then, but there are new observations that have inspired me.Specifically the fact that this film chooses to tackle the subjects of war and violence. With a maturity that beautifully captures the importance of discussing these issues. Which respects the younger viewers as well not minimizing the reality of these themes. What makes this so important, is that younger people will eventually be the one's making the decisions. Whether they are voters and lawmakers.According to the reality of our species. Teaching them important life lessons is the primary reason why quality children's entertainment is so important. The Iron Giant embodies this perfectly.With beautiful animation, a charming cast, and a remarkable maturity. The Iron Giant easily is one of the greatest animated films ever. Along with being one of the most powerful anti-war films as well. Truly this is one film that everyone should watch. Regardless of age, because this in every sense, is timeless.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Brilliant animated feature, easily one of the best animated films of the 1990's","The Iron Giant is one of the best animated films of the 1990's. It has everything you could ask for in a movie and it covers some great topics. It covers topics such as cold war tensions, childhood, and it even has an underlying message about anti violence and being yourself.The story follows a gentle robotic giant who befriends a young boy. The giant has no recollection of his origin, or what he was designed for, but the young boy, Hogarth Hughes, tries to teach him about things, similar to how a parent teaches a little kid. At the same time, Hogarth also tries to hide the Giant and protect him from anyone who wants to destroy him. Unfortunately, not everything is well. A shady government agent is bent on trying to find the giant at all costs.The animation is very colorful and very well drawn. The voice talents are all very good. What's interesting to me is how Vin Diesel, who later went on to be in action movies like Fast and the Furious and xXx, was the voice of The Iron Giant before all of that.This movie has a great story, and there is a good message underneath it all.Kids should definitely see this, and adults should too. Even though it looks like a kids movie, adults will be able to get something out of it and enjoy it as well.Another thing this movie pulls off that many cartoons are unable to is to make you feel certain ways. When Hogarth and the giant are playing around and doing fun things, it puts you in a good mood. Later in the movie, when certain things happen to certain characters, you feel the way they feel.Director Brad Bird later went on to make the excellent animated movie, The Incredibles. He has made some good movies, so I hope he can make even more good movies.The Iron Giant is a brilliant animated movie, and as I said before, it has great animation and a great story, along with memorable characters, and a great underlying message. This is easily one of the best animated movies of the 1990's, and it has great elements. There is humor, but smart humor, not mindless fart jokes. There is never a dull moment, or a dumb moment. At certain points, there is action. Normally action at the end of a movie makes it that much more entertaining. It's very rare when you find a cartoon with all of these elements, and when everything works out perfectly. I recommend this for anyone, kids or adults, even teenagers.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Regarding the ""gun"" issue . . .","Just watched this movie again on DVD with my 4- and 6-year-old boys. Truly this is a great movie for raising all sorts of moral, ethical, and religious issues with youngsters.Which leads me to the reason for this post:  To respond to the many viewers who are obviously concerned about the ""negative"" portrayal of guns as being ""heavyhanded"" or ""politically correct.""Several of these viewers quite accurately point out that the depiction of guns is uniformly appropriate.  Guns *do* kill, after all, and no one should be shocked to see a hunting rifle used to kill a deer (the hunters themselves are not in the least negatively characterized) or military weapons used in combat (and again, the uniformed military - in contrast to Kent Mansley - are depicted quite positively and professionally).  Even Hogarth's numerous toy guns are given realistic treatment.Regardless of your position on hunting, gun ownership, foreign policy, or whatever, please don't miss the opportunity to use this movie to discuss these issues with your children in context.  The Iron Giant, after all, is himself a (the?) super-gun -- that's the whole point of the movie.  It's not the gun itself that's good or bad, but the use to which it's put.  Guns don't represent evil in the movie, they represent power.  And each one of us has in us the power to do great good or great harm, within our families, our workplaces, our communities, and so on.  Teach your child to recognize his or her own powers and understand that he or she has the freewill to choose how they are used.  Teach your child to be Superman.And of course, like other posters, you will find political and religious themes in the movie, or any number of other things.I'll say it again -- what a great movie for kids to see.  Please don't automatically conclude its message is simply ""anti-gun"" just because guns are depicted being used as intended.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fun 1950s Alien Robot,"A boy makes friends with an innocent alien giant robot that a paranoid government agent wants to destroy.At first, I wasn't really sold on this film because I thought the animation style was a little bit cheesy.

Not that Bluth made bad films, but by 1999 we were expecting a lot more from our animators.Anyway, my concerns on animation were overshadowed by a genuinely good film with some fun characters. Not a great film, but one that light-heartedly looks at the 1950s and 1960s Cold War era. This is a satire on a child's level. In some ways, it has a similar feel as Joe Dante's ""Matinee"" (1993) and could make a good double feature.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Brad Bird's Greatest Achievement,"I have seen many promos with this movie on television, and was curious to see it. Sadly, I didn't, so I guess you can say that I was lazy for not seeing it. No matter, I did see this on HBO and watch this many times as it aired as a 24 hour marathon on Cartoon Network when Warner Bros and Cartoon Network were promoting ""The Powerpuff Girls Movie"" with a music video during the end credits of ""The Iron Giant."" The movie itself feels timeless, and I know this movie will continue to find an audience despite of its failure at the box office when it first came out in theaters. I am more than happy that this movie has a cult following, and there many fans that are embracing it. With that said, ""The Iron Giant"" its about a boy named Hogarth Hughes who lives with his mother Annie a waitress has discovered a giant metallic robot, who fell from space and befriends him. A beatnik artist Dean McCoppin looks out for the Giant at a junkyard, but federal agent Kent Mansley wants to find the Giant and destroy it. The movie is itself is like Steven Spielberg's ""E.T. the Extra Terrestrial,"" but it acts very much its own movie. I continue to love this movie as I watch it, and I see nothing wrong about it. The movie does look gorgeous in widescreen as it gives it a much epic feel to it in a CinemaScope format. As much as we love animated movies in CGI like Pixar or DreamWorks, but I do think its beautiful to see an animated movie to be all done traditionally by hand instead of having it all done by a computer. The animation is again beautiful with all the rich colors, and details that were all put into this movie. I do love how the movie looks as the movie takes place in 1957. The movie does have some funny moments, and I guess a bit edgy for an animated movie that features some curse words. The movie is made for kids, but its something that adults would enjoy. Hey, when I first saw this movie, I didn't expect to hear any curse words in an animated movie which I thought it was going to be a clean animated movie like what Disney did with their animated movies. I guess both Bird and Warner Bros. want it to take it up a notch. The movie is rated PG, and nothing to be worrying about. Or shocking for that matter. I do love the characters, and really love the way they're designed. Also, I thought it had great voice acting. Jennifer Aniston; Harry Connick, Jr.; Eli Marienthal and Christopher McDonald were all really good for their own roles. Vin Diesel, I thought, was perfectly cast for voicing the Iron Giant, and can't imagine any one voicing it aside from Diesel. Michael Kamen's score to the movie is very good, and nothing more that I can say about. I love its story and the direction that the filmmakers went, and I think its perfectly executed. This is Brad Bird's greatest achievement, and should be given a lot of credit for making this wonderful movie. I have heard that Bird and Warner Bros. are both working on bringing this movie for a limited release this year on September the 30th, and October the 4th for remastering it and presenting two new scenes for the movie. This new cut will be called ""The Iron Giant: Signature Edition."" I am very excited about it, and would love to see this on the big screen like I never had before. I love ""The Iron Giant,"" and I am giving this movie a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Iron Giant stomps all over the competition.,"Based on the poem 'The Iron Man' by Ted Hughes, Brad Bird's first feature length movie, The Iron Giant, tells the story of a huge alien robot who crashes to Earth, where he is befriended by a young boy named Hogarth, but also pursued by a paranoid US government agent.Hogarth proceeds to teach his newfound metal pal about the wonders of life, the tragedy of death, the difference between good and evil, the joys of dive-bombing into water, and the all important moral 'we are who we choose to be'. However, when the boy innocently aims his toy gun at the massive mechanoid, the robot's true purpose is revealed: he is a walking array of extraterrestrial fire-power programmed to respond to aggression. And with the army on its way to apprehend the giant, it looks like the proverbial is about to hit the fan.Will the robot destroy his enemy with a series of high powered energy blasts from his in-built armoury? Or will he choose to fight his basic programming and become a hero?Featuring breath-taking CGI-enhanced animation, flawless direction, and a script that brilliantly and intelligently mixes comedy, action and drama in equal doses, The Iron Giant is an unmissable treat for all ages.In true kids' movie tradition, the story has several important messages to tell and a couple of tear-jerker scenes, but it thankfully never resorts to the heavy-handed moralising and saccharine sweet schmaltz of many an animated feature. Instead, Bird delicately handles his themes of anti-violence, freedom of choice, life and death, and sacrifice for those you love. And he does this without once feeling the need for a song and dance number. Nice one, Brad!The film also succeeds in feeling very 'real', despite its fantastical premise. This is undoubtedly down to the well developed and likable characters (brilliantly voiced by a talented cast) and the incredible attention to detail in the animation, which not only includes loads of authentic 50s design, but also throws in some great references to the sci-fi movies and comics of the time.If the majority of animated features of the past few years have left you less than impressed, do yourself a favour and track down The Iron Giant. Charming, exciting, and ultimately uplifting, it's a film that'll leave you grinning from ear to ear.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Succeeds brilliantly as entertainment...fine animation...,"There was a preoccupation with paranoia about invasion from aliens that permeated all the science fiction in the '50s. This story builds on that fear by giving us an E.T. sort of encounter with an alien, in this case a super-sized piece of metal called THE IRON GIANT, who is saved from extinction by a little boy who pulls the ""Off"" switch when it appears the Giant is about to be electrocuted.It's stunning right from the opening scenes, animated with fresh originality and voiced by some expert actors (HARRY CONNICK, JR., VAN DIESEL, CLORIS LEACHMAN and the little boy voiced by ELI MARIENTHAL).Not only is the story engrossing, but there's a humanization of ""the creature from outer space"" that defies description. The animators manage to make his thought process apparent with minimal dialog and you can really feel for his emotions when he is asked to perform a noble act (at the climax) in order to save mankind from a fate worse than death.There's an effective background score by Michael Kamen, without the songs that seem to irritate some devotees of animated films, and it moves briskly at a pleasing pace that should keep young and old riveted to the sometimes magical events.Briskly entertaining and well worth watching--among the best of the animated films based on pure fantasy.

Overrated,"The Iron Giant is just a naughty,little, box office type of movie. It may have changed the way people see the animation genre, but it offers only little. The story itself may not have enough imagination to carry on this movie. Dirty, useless, non-unique are the words to describe its animation. These are the lows of this film but there is more. The highs for the Iron Giant comes to its script and voice acting, but this may also be its weaknesses. It is not too great, it is not too good. But the Iron Giant is a very good sci-fi film, its about a robot helping this boy, it is really a good plot. Unfortunately, the film does not depict this kind of genre, it slows to a kiddie PG cartoon, that's why I did not like this film.

Toy Story 2 and Shrek are my all time #1 CGI movies, but The Iron Giant (which I thought would suck) turned out to be the biggest emotionally affecting 'cartoon' I have ever seen, its even more of a tearjerker than the ending of Monsters Inc.Beautifully animated and expertly executed, I was in both tears and perched on the edge of my seat for the last twenty minutes.As of writing this review the movie is ranked #235 in the top 250, I strongly agree with its placement among the best movies of all time, but strongly disagree why it's not within the top 100. I have noticed one or two people (mentioning no names) have rated the movie a 1/10 simply because they disagree with its ranking, despite admitting they enjoyed the movie. Henceforth I have voted it a 10/10. Which incidentally is my rating for the movie :)Please just buy the DVD, for a mere £10 or less (or $12 if you are in the US) get this movie. I can't possibly imagine anybody would not like it, it's superb.10/10 - AN ABSOLUTE CLASSIC!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best American animated feature of the last 20 years,"Since the release of The Little Mermaid in 1989, Walt Disney Pictures has produced a cavalcade of animated masterpiece after animated masterpiece. That movie's success and the subsequent efforts from the same studio ushered in a renaissance of American animation. Megalomaniacal visionary Steve Jobs' belief in a small computer graphics studio, Pixar was directly responsible for the birth of the computer animation feature movie. Their list of accomplishments reads like a who's who and gave impetus to other creative forces to do the same. Since the seminal Toy Story, DreamWorks and Fox, among others, have followed Pixar's lead in that genre of animation. Yet, given Disney's pedigree and Pixar's mastery, one would be incredulous to learn that the best American-made animated movie of the last 20 years was directed by a virtual unknown (at the time) and was distributed (if you can call it that) by Warner Brothers and not any of the aforementioned masters of the art. That movie is the Iron Giant.The story of the Iron Giant is a cross between Beauty and the Beast and ET. It opens in space with a shot of Sputnik panning across the screen and something hurtling from space towards the planet. That something is the title character, a giant robot. Once on earth, the Giant proceeds to dine indiscriminately on the earth's varied cuisine of metal and steel. The Giant is befriended and spared electrocution by a young boy named Hogarth Hughes. The rest of movie tracks the two main characters on their quest to evade detection, have fun, and munch on all the metal that can be had. Along the way, the viewers are treated to a terrific parable about the futility of violence. Set against the backdrop of the early days of the Space Race, the reality of the Cold War helps to contrast the message the movie is sending.The day may be fast approaching where computers and animators can replicate the entire gamut of human emotions and characteristics and render a digital ""actor"" as realistic and compelling as any Academy Award winner. What the computers may not be able to ever do though is replicate the raw emotion that can be discerned from the human voice. In The Iron Giant, the emotions that come to the fore more often are joy, exuberance, and wonder. It is a testament to the actors involved in this feature that the characters are so compelling. Eli Marienthal voices the character of Hogarth with such delight that we can't help but wonder what has gone wrong in our world that we can't feel the same level of enjoyment. The fact that the young Mr. Marienthal is given such tremendous material only helps. Hogarth is an optimistic young man; he thinks the best of everyone and everything and one can't help but wonder if such open-mindedness is as a mechanism erected to keep out the rigors of growing up as a latch-key kid in a single parent home. And, his understanding of death as a part of life makes perfect sense when one considers the fact that this child has been subjected to the ""duck and cover"" instructional in school every year of his short life.If joy and optimism define Hogarth, then wonder defines the Giant. ""Voiced"" by Vin Diesel, the Iron Giant starts off as a enigmatic brute and transforms into an amalgam of childhood, best friend and parental figure. The young thespian gets very few lines of understandable dialog but those that he does get, he delivers with a tenderness that contrasts the mechanical nature of his character.Along with the two protagonists, the rest of the voice work is also excellent. Jennifer Aniston does a good job as Hogarth's single mother, conveying the exasperation a mother must feel when she has to deal with a bright child with an overactive imagination. Harry Connick Jr. is amusing as the beatnik scrap dealer, Dean who Hogarth befriends and who in turn befriends the giant. It goes without say that, given his philosophical tendencies, Dean is the first to accept what Hogarth has to say about the giant's benevolence. Finally, John Mahoney as General Rogard and Christopher McDonald as federal agent, Kent Mansley are also very good. The former comes across as the same sort of caring realist he played in Say Anything without the pen chance for fraud. The latter is positively delicious as a fed that has bought in to all the hype of the Cold War; he is truly drinking the McCarthy Kool Aid. In fact, if he weren't such a despicable guy who does some pretty despicable things, you can almost feel sorry for him.Technically speaking, the Iron Giant pales somewhat when compared to some of the other animated features that are its contemporaries. Even from a traditional animation standpoint, there are contemporaries whose craft stands out more than that of this film. And the main story itself is also simple. What makes this movie terrific is its heart. It gives us characters that we care for, human and otherwise and along the way of the story, it tries to teach it's audience profound lessons on fear and on violence as a solution (or, in this case, non-solution).9 stars out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

This was great,"You will like this one, I knew it would be good but was surprised at just to what a high level they have raised the stakes in animation with Iron Giant. Sure it borrows from ET a good deal, but then that borrowed from Lassie and a hundred other Boy and his Dog stories before it, too.I was knocked out by the animation, characters(Beatnik Man was good-Connick was right on the beam), so was the kid, the govt baddie and Jennifer Aniston. Thought that they modelled her character's looks after her a little, and that helped.They got the '50s look to it right, the music, cold war era paranoia, Maypo ads and what not. I felt that they put a lotta heart into it, and enjoyed the scenes with the boy explaining a soul to the Iron Giant on the starry rooftip quite alot.So it used a little Christian symbolism and themes, so what? A huge chunk of the country is exactly that-and will agree with what is being said.Being from Maine orig, I got a kick outta them setting it in my state, too.I am sorry Warner's kinda threw this out there without pushing it the way they oughta, it is a classic and will be around for some time to come I think.***1/2, very very good, right there with Tarzan and Beauty and the Beast.",,Anonymous,Animation
Gentle giant.,"'The Iron Giant (1999)' focuses on the friendship between a young boy and a giant machine after the latter crash-lands near the former's small town. Arriving from an unknown place at a time filled with post-war fear means that most people immediately fear the giant, even though he's as friendly as can be thanks to a bump on the noggin and a heavy dose of electricity. It isn't just his initial trauma that keeps him kind, though; it's the teachings of our protagonist, who firmly instils a sense of self in the being and tells him that killing is wrong. The first half of the flick is basically about the blossoming relationship between its two leads, which is charming and well-paced. The second introduces some resonant themes - regarding choice, discrimination and, even, what it means to have a soul - and brings its antagonist, a selfish and nationalistic government agent, further to the forefront. This all builds to an effective finale that successfully pushes the movie's message of tolerance and the ability to choose who you are. Its final emotional punch really is as impactful as its reputation would have you believe. In general, the film doesn't seem as though it panders to kids at all; it tells a relatively grown-up story that should appeal to all members of the family. It's a beautifully animated adventure with a giant heart at its core. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Brad Bird gives an extra push to the evergreen stories of King Kong and ET with his mechanical-animated-classic.,"The Iron Giant (1999) :
Brief Review -Brad Bird gives an extra push to the evergreen stories of King Kong and ET with his mechanical-animated-classic. Mercin Cooper's timeless classic ""King Kong"" (1933) and Steven Spielberg's groundbreaking classic ""ET: The Extra Terrestrial"" (1982), have been loved by the critics, audiences and even kids. We know the basic stories of these two films: a monster/creature arrives in human society and then humans try to beat him up, despite the monster/creature being harmless. King's tale had a girl factor, ET had a kid factor (along with his family and friends), and even Brad Bird's Giant Iron Man story has a kid again, along with his mother and an adult companion. Just like in those two stories, we have a creature here who enters human society, becomes friends with the kid, and then the defence system tries to attack him for no apparent reason. But there is an emotional boost in the climax, which is quite an intelligent mix of Kong and ET's endings. As we know, Kong dies and ET leaves, and here we have a sort of mix in The Iron Giant. Bird actually plays a smart trick of having a happy ending just after the sad one, which leaves us emotional, especially the kids. It was for the sequel. Yes, I get that. ""You are what you choose to be. You don't have to be a gun. Gun kills,"" says Hogarth. That was some quote for a small kid, no? I also loved the aggressive factors shown by the writers that the robot is ready to destroy the one who harms him. He is not too soft like the regular protagonists we see in such stories. The human belt is terrified to see it, and that's what shows us our lameness. The voice cast is fine, and so are the visual effects. Overall, a superb adaptation of timeless tales with a beautiful machinery touch to it. Much much better than your popular ""Iron Man"" from the Marvel Cinematic universe.RATING - 7.5/10*",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Does a familliar story equal a bad movie?,"The short answer is I think not. This is the story of a young boy named Hogarth that grew up in the 1950's. His dad is not in the picture and we can deduce that he dies in world war two from a picture Hogarth has. Essentially friendless, Hogarth has a vivid imagination and a sens of wonder that we all lose as we age. He discovers a giant robot and befriends him. Yes, in similar fashion to ET, the Hogarth tries to hide the giant from the authorities. Also like ET, he fails. However unlike that movie there is a great conflict between the giant and the military.This is a very heartwarming story and I am forever sad that there was never a sequel made to it, as it was worthy of another visit, yet the box office earnings were too low. My only problem with this film is that it is clearly meant to dissuade people from owning guns. Typical Hollywood bull, jamming their beliefs down our throats. All in all, this was a great movie though.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

This is the best animation film I have ever seen. I loved Nemo, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc etc, but this film offered so much more in terms of emotional ties. I had tears in my eyes at the end of the film and had to hide my face from the family.It is such a wonderful simple story and I cannot believe it did not get the commercial success it deserved.For any people with kids or without, please give this film a chance and either rent or buy it.

Best Animated Film of All Time,"I watch almost any kind of movie, and when it comes to animated features, they have to be truly heart-warming to capture the real spirit of a family film. There have been plenty throughout the years that deserve immediate and all time praise; Toy Story (1, 2 and 3), How to Train Your Dragon, Aladdin, Sleeping Beauty, Shrek, Wall-E, and Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (underrated Dreamworks cartoon). But no cartoon deserves more praise and acknowledgment than Brad Bird's The Iron Giant.The Iron Giant is set in 1957 and stars Vin Diesel as The Iron Giant, an alien machine that crash-lands on Earth and is soon befriended by a little boy named Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal), who discovers that ""Giant"", as Hogarth calls him, eats metal for food. Not long after all this, a government agent (Christopher McDonald) arrives and begins to cause trouble, and soon chaos as he believes Giant to be a foreign weapon sent to destroy America. I have never seen anything like this movie before; constantly heart-warming, family-fun comedy moments (which are great), and an emotionally shattering climax that is truly memorable. If you really love to watch movie and, not only be entertained, but moved, then The Iron Giant is one you have to watch. I would also have to say, Warner Bros. should be ashamed for the bad marketing they did for this movie; just like Brad Bird said, ""They had no idea what they had in their hands."" This should have won a few Oscars and Golden Globes; it deserves it. 10/10 Stars***",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
personal responsibility in a fable,"Pete Townshend of the Who must have had a good reason to work on this. Watch it and you will see.Every boy wants to be the Hogarth, Every man, to be Dean. Every one wants to hate Kent, and all that that implies.Whether you relate to Hogarth, his mother Annie, the beatnik Dean or the General, you will find a reason to relate to this movie. The stereotypes from the 1950s America are not so blatant as to make this movie stilted. It pulls off the era with the same smooth aplomb as Back to the Future. The staging is professional, the soundtrack excellent. The only tragedy is that they did not go on to make more with this tight production team.Watch with your son, with your father, with your heart.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Even a Geezer Likes It,"After so many responses, there's not much left to say. Except that as a geezer who lived through the 1950's, I enjoyed seeing a send-up of the paranoia of the time. If it wasn't commies menacing us, it was aliens in Roswell, NM. Plus, it may seem like a joke now, but Duck and Cover didn't when annihilation could come any moment from The Bomb. Ordinarily I wouldn't watch an animated feature since I grew up thinking that meant cartoon. However, this edition was recommended, and I ended up thoroughly enjoying it. Strange how unreal characters quickly become real.Anyway, this film reminded me of a classic in my day called The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951). Except the gentlemanly Klaatu and the laser-eyed robot Gort, the two main alien visitors of Stood Still, are combined here into the single character of the Iron Giant. However, in both movies, the adversity to be overcome is a paranoid American defense establishment. That was a pretty darn touchy topic for a Cold War 1951. The moral here seems something like getting over our cultural hostility to The Other, whatever form that might take. Here, of course, it's a giant metal robot, whose goodness turns out to embody something eternal, as its parts survive destruction. All in all, the animated story amounts to a happy surprise and a compelling one even for a geezer like me.",,Anonymous,Animation
"High-art, thy name is Iron Giant","""The Iron Giant"" had to be the best of the first three WB animated movies. I liked the flawed but enjoyable ""Quest for Camelot"", (hadn't seen the WB animated ""King and I"", was that movie any good?) but ""Iron Giant"" is now the one to best.The story involves a young boy named Hogarth Hughes (voiced by Eli Marienthal) who likes science-fiction, late night movies and MAD magazine, and later, befriends a 100-foot tall, metal munching machine, and needs keep him safe from those may report him.  Meanwhile, Agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald) is aware of a giant metal beast and believes it might be a threat (designed by who?  The Chinese?  The Russians?  Martians? Who?)It's not a silly little kids' movie.  It's one the whole family will grow into liking.  Also, I can't picture Disney making this movie, at least, not w/o (some or any of) the following: retro '50's stuff (ie. sock hops), Hogarth wanting to hide the giant and impress a girl he has a crush on, Hogarth having an obligatory comic relief in the form of a pet (his mom doesn't want one) and presence of heart.  All current Disney movies seem to have all of the first three, but none of the last one.What angers me, though, is the fact this movie bombed at the box office.  I hate it whenever an animated flick bombs just because it seems like the only reason being is it wasn't made by either Disney or DreamWorks.  Maybe if only a LITTLE bit more advertising was put in...However, I contain boasting rights to this movie.  In August of 1999, I could've been a sucker for hype and Happy Meals.  I COULD'VE seen the snoozefest ""Blair Witch Project"".  I COULD'VE paid for that Happy Meal disaster ""Disney's Inspector Gadget"".  What did I pay for?  WB's ""The Iron Giant"".  And I know I got my money's worth.  If you haven't seen it, my suggestion is to buy it.Rating: 12 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A magical film with stunning characterisation - unmissable,"An enjoyable and inspiring animated film for all ages. This modern fairytale is a story of a great friendship - that of a lively yet warm-hearted boy and a 50 foot iron robot with some very human qualities.In 1950s America, post-war suspicion and paranoia give rise to a fear of all things different. A huge robot from outer space is seen as the ultimate threat. Yet one perceptive child discovers that the Iron Giant has the ability to combine superhuman powers with the best qualities of human nature. With the encouragement of his young friend, the gentle giant discovers his soul and learns about trust, friendship and respect for life. But will his true dark purpose lead to the destruction of all he has come to love? Is the power of friendship strong enough to save him not only from the prejudice of others but also from himself?This intelligent and moving film has much to offer to anyone who can put their own prejudices against `cartoons' and `kids films' aside. While being good fun for children, The Iron Giant has a depth that adults will appreciate. This is a more `grown-up' kind of animation - no singing and dancing animals and attention-stealing backdrops, no caricature sidekicks or too bad to be true villains; instead we are treated to a fully developed characterisation rarely seen in feature animations. The result is a small cast of believable and engaging characters who draw you into what could have been a predictable plot and who leave you caring about what happens to them. The story is by turns amusing, touching, dark and inspiring. The animation is clever and seamless, but understated, letting the wonderful characters take centre-stage.A talented cast breathe life into the characters, without turning them simply into animated versions of themselves - unlike some  actors in rival films. Hogarth Hughes, the boy who befriends the giant, is given a spirited and natural performance by young X. The powerful voice of Vin Diesel, by turns frightening, funny and heartbreakingly emotional, gives the mysterious yet lovable giant his soul. Jennifer Aniston is utterly convincing as Hogarth's mother Annie - a hardworking single mother desperately trying to be a responsible parent to her imaginative, energetic son, yet secretly in need of some magic in her own life. Harry Connick Jr. gives warmth and humanity to trendy beatnik Dean, a scrap-metal yard owner who turns junk into `art' and works hard at seeming a cool laid-back kind of guy, but hides behind the smooth exterior a caring, fun-loving personality who needs others more than he would admit.  Y is the villain of the story, as Kent -, the government official on a quest to destroy the `monster'. Driven by fear, misunderstanding and most of all the opportunity for self-advancement, Kent poses a real threat yet is also amusing and thoroughly believable. It is this thoughtful characterisation that makes the film so special - there are no extremes of good and evil, simply characters not very different from us, with a range of emotion and the potential to become what they choose. The films message, `You are what you choose to be,' reflects not only the inner struggle of the Iron Giant between the desire to do good and the instinct to destory, but the struggle inside of us all to be the best that we can.I was pleased and not at all surprised to see this animation voted number one in the Children's category on IMDb (April 2000). Kids will love it, and will maybe learn from it's message of non-violence and shaping your own destiny. But, whether you have children or not, I highly recommend this heart-warming and intelligent film. It is so much more than just another feature animation. In The Iron Giant, Warner Bros. has succeeded in avoiding the all too common pitfall of turning an animation into a poor imitation of Disney. They have instead combined their talents to produce a deeper, more intelligent story with a magic that is completely their own.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sentimental, predictable but entertaining E.T.-mecha hybrid","Back when Sputnik ! was still orbiting, young Hogarth Hughes (v. Eli Marienthal) tries to hide a giant, extra-terrestrial mechanical man that he has befriended, first from a smarmy government agent (v. Christopher McDonald), and then from the U.S. Army. The whole story is pretty trite and features most of the typical sentimental tropes supporting a simple pacifist message (which is a bit undermined when it is established that the Giant only resorts to force when immediately threatened, a response that many people might consider appropriate). The animation and the voices are fine and the titular mecha is a pretty good example of diesel-punk design. Fun film for the kids with a young hero frequently putting one over on the grown-ups, numerous amusing or exciting images, some minor poop-humour, and a satisfying, up-beat ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Quite simply, this is the best non-Disney animated movie.","I'm so glad that I finally found this masterpiece five year after this movie has been released. This is a really great movie and in my opinion it's one of the best animated movies ever made. I think the biggest flaw of the Disney animation is the complete lack of human characters. Disney and now Dreamworks made movies about fishes, sharks, bears, lions, dogs, bugs, ants, toys, superheroes and many other animals and creatures but you can hardly find single movie with human character from a real life . Well, all their characters can talk, feel and behave like humans but it is not the same. Most of their recent movies were good, funny and entertained but at the same time they look a bit childish and not so emotional, even cold. They are typical commercial stuff and with strong marketing studios often get good box office returns. The Iron Giant is a different case. This is a very intelligent, good-feeling and enjoyable animation with powerful and clever moral messages in its core. At first sight it looks like a kids movie but it's a wonderful movie both for kids and adults. In fact the movie idea could have been unnoticed for small kids. The story happens in 1957 in small town in Maine. It was a years of the cold war and military paranoia, a period of total fear and misunderstanding from both sides. It was really amazing to watch how brilliant was recreated the atmosphere of that period. All begins than the Hogarth, a young fatherless lonely boy found near his home mysterious Iron Giant. I think it was s a clever idea what we'll never know where this giant come from. Different and unknown doesn't always mean bad and enemy. Hogarth helped him and they become friends. He gave Iron Giant some moral lessons and even taught a basic English. But when in the town comes paranoiac special agent Kent Mansley they friendship now is in a danger. He wants to kill the Giant without any reasonable reason, just because he think what this strange robotic Iron Giant can be dangerous. Most surprising and intelligent element in the story was the fact that this movie didn't become a cheesy childish anti-gun propaganda. The message is more wise and intellectual. As Hogarth said we are what you we choose to be. Our acts are always our individual decisions and some things can't be simply bad or good, and only our choice can decide how we can use them. Also you can find in this movie many other strong philosophical ideas and thoughts. Overall, the story of friendship between young boy and The Iron Giant is very touching and emotional.Now about animation. It was absolutely fabulous. All movie is an amazing work of art. The Hogarth character so perfectly drown that you can easily forget that it's an animated movie. He looks like a real, well acted boy. I have seen almost all famous animated movies and I suppose he is a best animated character I have ever seen. The rest of main characters also very impressive, landscapes, sky and all minor details like ships and tanks were beautiful and looked absolutely real. The Iron Giant was the only computer-generated character and he didn't look as a soulless machine. He becomes a very warm and likable character.With excellent characters development and interesting story The Iron Giant is an extraordinary intelligent movie. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's sad but it's always enjoyable, touching and entertained movie. If you haven't seen it before just go and buy, rent or borrow it. I recommend The Iron Giant to all people irrespective of their age. A solid ten. Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Well-meaning, partial success","We all like happy endings, but this one is an insult.  It's so obviously a blight on an otherwise fine story that we can't even take pleasure in it. Why is it there?I said it's a fine STORY; as far as the telling of it goes, something is lacking.  I'm not sure animation was the right medium for it.  It's fashionable to decry Disney's reliance on such things as fairytales, fantasy, anthropomorphic animals and musical numbers - but these, after all, are the kind of thing that can indisputably be done WELL with animation, and there's nothing wrong, surely, with making sure that form matches content. But animated science fiction like ""The Iron Giant"" never quite works.  (No, not even when it's done by the Japanese.)The giant itself is a masterpiece: the precise angles of every spring and hydraulic chamber have been calculated by a computer, then outlined so as to match the hand-drawn characters ... indeed, I get the feeling that the giant could not have been portrayed any other way, which, I'm afraid, means that the film was doomed, since when the humans are drawn and animated and characterised so as to match him, they don't have any life.It's a noble, honest attempt (apart from the ending), pleasing to look at and certainly worth seeing.  The extravagant praise heaped upon the film at the time of its release is probably due to the fact that it HAD just been released, and people hadn't had time to forget it.

"Not for KIDS, but still an OK movie.","This movie surprised me. After reading the reviews online I thought this might be a great movie for the kids. Wrong!

Check the ""Parental Advisory"" page here on IMDb for the exact words and occurrances. You'll be surprised. We watched about 15 minutes of this till the first ""who the hell"" popped up then decided it wasn't really the show for us. No wonder it bombed at the box office. I'd have walked out had I been sitting in a paid-for seat with my kids in tow. It's sad too, because the wife and I watched it later and it was a decent movie.

It does make changes to the original story but this creates a separate tale which can stand on its own. Its very entertaining, with jokes for kids and adults. Featuring excellent voice acting, a strong plot with good pacing. The animation, using the more traditional approach, is impressive and most importantly adds to the story instead of becoming the story. The ending will make you get that tingly feeling that I believe tells you that the emotional story is effective.

You are who you choose to be.,"It's the 1950s and young Hogarth Hughes happens upon a visitor from space ..... in the form of a giant iron man.Delightful animation adaptation of Ted Hughes' much beloved 1968 novel ""The Iron Man"". Set during the period of time when Cold War and sci-fi paranoia was prevalent, The Iron Giant embraces these themes and stokes them with lessons of friendship, hatred, death and pertinent reminders of pacifism. Directed by Brad Bird and scripted by Tim McCanilies and Andy Brent Forrester, The Iron Giant is one of those rare animation animals that delights the kids as much as it does the watching adults. Though the actual giant himself, with all his dazzling weaponry, is the star attraction on show, it's the iron colossus' inner conflict that gives the film its heart. Aided by his friend, young Hogarth, good old iron decides he doesn't want to be a big weapon, but the authorities, as is nearly always the way, just can't let it be. The unflinching attitude that ran through many of the 50s sci-fi schlockers was one of being ""because we don't understand it, lets destroy it"" is something that Ted Hughes and the film makers here capture perfectly. Sophisticated and intelligent in its approach and delivery, this is definitely one of the better animated film's from the modern age. 9/10Voice work comes from Jennifer Anniston, Harry Connick Jr, Vin Diesel, James Gammon, Christopher McDonald, M.

"A delightful surprise, this is one of the best animated films ever made and is as good as anything put out by the House of Mouse.","Warner Brothers' only previous half-way decent full-length animated film was [Space Jam - a animation / live-action mix that saw Warners' greatest stars (Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, etc.) team up with the world's highest-paid sports superstar Michael Jordan to entertaining though easily criticisable effect. Aside from this their efforts have been somewhat useless. Content for a long time to release other peoples animated movies such as [Thumbelina] and [The Pebble and the Penguin] (go on, have you seen them?) they decided, on the strength of [Space Jam]'s success, to reopen their famous theatrical animation department in the hope that they could recreate the legendary success of their 50's short cartoons with full-length animated features. Their first effort, [The Magic Sword: Quest for Camelot], boasted as many words in the title as there were famous names in the voice cast but, sadly, boasted almost nothing else. Except that there were almost as many words in the title as there were people who went to the cinema to see it.So, it is somewhat of a surprise to find Warner Brother's Feature Animation department releasing this upon an unsuspecting movie world, for this is the finest animated feature-length film to be released that has nothing to do with the mighty Disney studios (as of February 2000 and, it should be noted, that the key animators on this movie are all ex-Disney). Forget DreamWorks' glossy but botched [Prince of Egypt], forget Steven Spielberg's over-rated executive-produced [An American Tail], forget the excellent [Antz], forget even [Toy Story] and [Toy Story 2] (both co-financed and released by Disney anyway). The Iron Giant is cinema's finest non-Disney animated feature length film. It is a real shame that so few people saw it. Here's hoping that the home video market will discover this real gem.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Though it is done with right intentions, it is strictly a kids movie.","Reviewed August 2011I had great expectations on this from hearsay but doesn't quite live up to all of them. Since I am watching it quite late, it felt like a combination of 'How to train your dragon' and 'Super 8'.A huge robot descends from the sky and has a rocky landing that makes it forget what it is. It reaches a small sedate village looking for metal to eat when a boy stumbles upon it and saves the giant from getting electrocuted. The giant grows an affection towards the boy and the boy teaches him words and general human stuff. When the government comes to know of it and comes with it's big guns, the giant has to remember what the boy has thought him.The animation and mannerisms of the characters are very Disney like swaying away gaily. The story centers a lot on friendship and righteousness while the robot structure is too corny. It has to eat metal to survive, shows those funny expressions while showing emotions etc. Some action sequences at the end are pretty decent though.Though it is done with right intentions, it is strictly a kids movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Superb,"The Iron Giant was one the best movies of 1999 combining great animation with a strong story, that of The Iron Man written by Ted Hughes.The basic plot is that a mysterious robot crashes to Earth from outer space, becomes friends with a small boy and junk-yard owner, learns important issues about life before being discovered by a paranoid army officer who is intent on destroying the giant.This film more than lived up to my expectations, I could hardly find any faults with any aspect. The voice talents are well cast with Vin Diesel doing a great job voicing the giant. The animation of the giant is also good with the last act of the film, when the giant shows a new side, being easily as good as Disney could manage.For me, the film is made by the story and the issues raised, especially the ending which always brings a tear to my eye.All in all, go and rent this film, it not just for kids but for the whole family.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of if not the Best Animated Film of all Time,"First and foremost, let's talk about the animation. Released in 1999, ""The Iron Giant"" still holds up beautifully today. The attention to detail is simply astonishing. From the intricate character designs to the breathtaking landscapes, every frame feels like a work of art. The animation team truly brought this world to life in a way that captivates audiences of all ages.Now, let's move on to the heart of the film-the story. ""The Iron Giant"" is a masterclass in storytelling. It weaves together elements of science fiction, adventure, and even a touch of comedy to create a truly unforgettable experience. At its core, the film explores themes of friendship, acceptance, and the power of choice.The relationship between Hogarth, the young protagonist, and the Iron Giant is the beating heart of the film. Their bond is beautifully portrayed, and it's impossible not to be moved by their journey. Through their interactions, the film teaches us about empathy, compassion, and the importance of looking beyond appearances.The voice acting in ""The Iron Giant"" is another standout aspect. Vin Diesel's performance as the Iron Giant is nothing short of remarkable. Despite having minimal dialogue, Diesel manages to infuse the character with a wide range of emotions. His deep, resonant voice perfectly captures the gentle and innocent nature of the Giant. The supporting cast, including Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr., also deliver stellar performances that add depth and complexity to the film's characters.What sets ""The Iron Giant"" apart from other animated films is its ability to tackle thought-provoking themes. It addresses the fear of the unknown, the destructive nature of war, and the power of choice in a way that is accessible to both children and adults. The film encourages us to question our assumptions, challenge prejudice, and embrace our capacity for growth and change.It's worth mentioning that ""The Iron Giant"" was unfortunately overshadowed upon its initial release. However, over the years, it has gained a well-deserved cult following and critical acclaim. Its themes and messages have resonated with audiences, and it has become a beloved film that continues to inspire and touch hearts.In conclusion, ""The Iron Giant"" is a cinematic gem that stands the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Captivating for all ages,"An animated movie with so much to offer all ages, and so well done that you'd be hard pressed not to be in tears!Set in the 1950's, it captivates not because of the animation itself (which isn't bad, but isn't anything we haven't seen before) but more because of the great script, the perfect sense of the time in which it is set, and ultimately because the filmmakers haven't pandered to the kids. They have told a wonderful story, and they have achieved what is rarely achieved in animated features - characters that you really can believe in...even if they are 100ft metal monsters!Gimmick-free and with real heart. You'll forget Disney ever existed!",,Anonymous,Animation
Definitely one of the best animated films I've seen in my life.,"I was quite young when I saw him for the first time and I have to admit I was thrilled from the first second.
I was very young when I saw the movie for the first time and I have to admit that I probably did not understand half of it. Because some things simply fly over the heads of the youth that's why it's so much fun to watch such films again a few years later when you can enjoy them again with a completely different look, but it was still presented interesting enough that he aroused the interest of one.
(PS: For a change we have a movie without a villain but just people with different opinions and views)I'm pretty impressed with love, music and animation. I do not think it's too bad that we have too much 3D animation movies but most movies and I mean films in general are bland and they're just too different.
This topic already looks like a lost art because such films are no longer made these days.
If you made a live-action movie out of it then only Steven Spielberg would have the talent and experience to get close to this result. With a ""PG-13""? I'm not 100% sure because we know that Spielberg can also press on the violence Tube, when I think of the scenes in which the robot goes rampage, I wonder if Spielberg would hold back nowadays.Brad Bird is just an artist and a genius. Not only do we have a movie with a realistic kids character that is not a bit annoying, but we have real family drama but not the embarrassing way of today's reality TV of all Kardashian scrap, proper social criticism but the message of the movie is not going to be that extreme beaten whit a Sledgehammer so that it is the movie enjoyment in the way. And I was fascinated as a little boy by the mother (Annie Hugher).
As a child, I have seen very few animated films because I find them just too childish, uninteresting and too good. Besides, the constant musical numbers just annoyed me. Thankfully, this movie has none of this * and I love it *.
(Of course not every movie needs sex, violence and cussing
but not every movie has to be like a fairy tale)I have never had to cry at a movie, but this is one of the few movies where not much is missing to open my locks.However, my heart always is.This is one of the smartest movies I've ever seen in my life.
Unfortunately, he is a dying race, both in terms of style and genre, one more reason to keep the movie in his honor and show it to as many people as possible.I thank you for your criticism and your super interesting videos quieter more often videos about movies from the nostalgia department I'm curious what other people say about it and if maybe there is not one or the other movie of which I have not heard.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

What an amazingly talented cast of voice actors- (Jennifer Aniston as a working class single mother? who knew!) Along with the animation, and the fun music this makes for a real treat for the whole family! It's a fabulous movie and a joy to behold.

Brings tears to my eyes,"This is perhaps the best animated movie I've ever seen. Iron Giant is a no name robot who's origin and purpose for creation is unknown, but is surprisingly innocent and powerful. It has a sense of purpose and has loyalty and decency we don't even see in ourselves until it is provoked and shows what it might have been created for - weapon of mass destruction. Who created the Iron Giant with its heart of gold and body as indestructible weaponry ? Was it part of an unknown robot army from another planet that got strayed from its squadron ? The story leaves lots of plot holes that beckons us to know more about this character. Would the writer of this story do a sequel that fills in all the gap in the robot's back ground, and help us look deeper into its character ? It seems to be one of the best character to come along in many years. Although the scope and the period setting is similar to ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" this animated character is much more lively, and thought provoking.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Iron Giant saves the day,"Seeing the Iron Giant makes one realize just how formulaic and tiresome most movies (especially kids' movies) are.  Fortunately, it also makes one realize how wonderful movies can be.  The Iron Giant does not have an extravaganza of special effects (a'la The Prince of Egypt), yet still is visually magnificent.  It does not have a plethora of sound-alike songs written by a big name in sound-alike songwriting, instead it has a pleasant background of songs true to the setting.  It does  not have the ""Disney Romance,"" a major relief.  Most importantly, The Iron Giant does not talk down to its audience.  The characters had multiple dimensions to their personalities, a feature rarely given to animated characters, details of real people (note Hogarth's crooked tooth), and even *gasp* realistic dialogue.  The Iron Giant  even has a good moral, something I can't seem to find in most other animated features. I can only hope to see more movies as worthy as this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Could All Animated Films be this Good?,"This was another film from last year that was under advertised and yet was an amazing accomplishment.

The art and the pacing of the film really gave it a wonderful feeling.  I wish all animated films could be written and created this well.The worst thing was that no one saw this movie.

The Iron Giant,"When a ship is caught up in a storm, it's captain finds the most unlikely of saviours - but nobody back in the town of ""Rockwell"" believes him! Hardly surprising as he claimed to have been rescued by an hundred foot robot with bright yellow eyes. ""Hogarth"" is an enthusiastic young lad who wants to keep a pet. His mother (""Annie"") is having nothing to do with this, especially after one of his candidates manages to just about wreck the diner where she works and turn scrap man ""Dean"" into ""Deana"" in the process. Dejected at home alone, he hears some strange noises and armed with his pop gun and a torch, sets off into the forest to find the source. When he discovers that the fisherman's tale wasn't so long after all, the pair begin to bond and the story takes on a familiar look. It does have shades of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" as it shows clearly the typical reaction to something strange, new and big - the government and the army are soon in hot pursuit with little intent on diplomacy but with plenty of tanks, missiles and ultimately the ""bomb"" - just as destructive to them as to the ""monster"". It's really the characterisations that help this stand out. The style of animation is simple yet potent, the creature positively emanates a degree of decency and charisma and the relationship with the young boy that manifests itself to us is one that amiably resonates whether that be with a real friend, an imaginary one - or one from outer space who doesn't much like guns and has an almost infantile approach to life. Proof that when you have a solid story and tell it well, the gadgets, gismos (and there are a few, here) and visual effects don't matter so much as the soul of the thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant movie,"But it should have been longer. I distinctly remember an entirely different ending in the book. I also do not remember any 1950's communist paranoia in the book or the character of Hogarth being so young. But the changes do not harm the movie and the ending this film has is just fine. There are obviously no opening credits to the film so guessing the voices is cool fun. But it's impossible to guess who plays the Iron Giant.But the Iron Giant himself is a wonderful hero. It's cool to watch him learn simple things and having him eat cars is a neat little characteristic. I like when he's bored and he plays with the hood with one of the cars in the junkyard. You cannot dislike the Iron Giant.I think it was a wise and creative decision to make this cartoon in 2.35:1. Most cartoons by Disney are in 1.85:1 or even worsein 1.66:1. Warner did a great job with this movie. These days it seems that Dreamworks SKG and Disney seem to do all the feature length animations. But Warner beat them all in 1999 with this movie.My only gripe is that it should have been longer. At 87 minutes, it's all over too quick. But it's still cool.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Very special little film.,"Earth 1957. It came from space. A giant metal-eating robot crashes to Earth.In films like 'E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial' the little alien's goal was to get back home again, and he was trying to contact his kind. In 'The Iron Giant' there seems to be nothing driving the robot/The Iron Giant.Wandering through the forest, the robot stumbles upon a power station and starts eating the metal tower. However, he gets electrocuted. A young boy, Hogarth Hughes, who went into the woods after seeing strange lights, saves the robot by turning off the power.As a result, the robot follows Hogarth. Hogarth teaches the robot to talk, and they become inseparable friends. It is a beautiful story of a most unusual friendship, but I still felt the film lacked a driving force. It was fun seeing Hogarth and the robot together, and it was absolutely hilarious when Hogarth tried to hide to robot from his mother in their home.The film's antagonist is Mansley - a government agent who wants to destroy the robot. Being an animated movie, I expected it to be cartoonish at times, but luckily it never was, nor was it slapstick. 'The Iron Giant' is actually a very special little film with a message of friendship. The third act is action-packed and heartfelt. I found it exciting and definitely entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Perspectives,"This ran a big risk of going horribly wrong, but Brad Bird shows in his first feature that he knows how craft a new whole out of genre parts, while keeping his eye on the big picture. The opposite of this movie would be the execrable ""Independence Day"", where the whole decidedly was a good deal less than the sum of the pieces.Part of his crafting solution is to take a story set in the past, that's about the past, and keeping the feel of the visual and vocal expression in the past -- no referential pop-culture hokum.Obviously, this is composed from parts of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", ""E.T."", ""Terminator 2"", ""Godzilla"" and countless 50's B movies. What matters is that this is smarter than all those put together. The way this shatters old perspectives is placed directly in the visual narrative -- the part where the kid watches the brainlessly stupid movie about the man-eating brain -- all intended to point out the superior intelligence of what we have here.Secondly, the use of the Giant's exaggerated height gives Bird the advantage of exaggerating the perspective of the 'camera'. He gets to play with focus and composition -- this is superbly detailed from every angle and in every trajectory...Anime without the losses in translation.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Some thoughts on ""The Iron Giant""","Everyone's done the spoiler alerts and given some really good reviews, so I'll just share some thoughts I had. 1. What was Warner Brothers thinking when they marketed this work of art so poorly? 2. After about 10 minutes, the animation just fell away and for the rest of the movie, these were real people (and a real robot!) engaged in, and engaging me, in a marvelous story. 3. Any student of animation should make sure this work is on their list. Brad Bird is a genius, a master storyteller. It is no coincidence that he supplied the heart and magic of the early Pixar works. 4. During the last 10 minutes or so, there were so many emotions at play amongst the characters. As others have noted, I too was in tears by the end of it all. This is a story worth watching repeatedly. 5. The attention to detail is amazing; listen to the background sounds, there isn't just quiet in the background, but sounds that would be appropriate to the surroundings. Similarly, I noticed a number of nods to past animators, particularly Jay Ward with his simple hand-drawn characters (which were necessary because he had almost no money to work with) - like Jay Ward, and for that matter the South Park creators, Rankin-Bass, Hanna-Barbera, and others I cannot think of at the moment, Brad Bird fully understands that it was the story that mattered, not so much the animation.",,Anonymous,Animation

The direction which was made by Brad Bird was very good and he presented very well how friendship would be no matter the differences of each other.

"Had giant expectations, but still pretty good","From the great director Brad Bird, The Iron Giant it's a good family-friendly movie. It does have some appealing, an emotional plot and a good ending, but, for me, it stays at 8/10 because I feel I have seen this type of movie before. A kid that founds ""someone"" that is very unusual or big, no ones believes him. Then people discover that he does exist and are afraid can be harmful, so they decide to eliminate him. Then at the end, that creature confirms he is good and it's a happy ending. So it was very predictable for me, but it doesn't mean it was bad. Another thing is that it let me with some questions like, where does the robot come from? How does he understand so well English? But I think that the movie let that to the audience to think.

A Giant Heart,"The Iron Giant is a deeply emotional and timeless animated classic that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. Released in 1999 and directed by Brad Bird, this beautifully rendered film is a masterful blend of heartfelt storytelling, striking animation, and thought-provoking themes that leave a lasting impression.Set against the backdrop of Cold War-era America, the story centres on Hogarth Hughes (voiced by Eli Marienthal), a spirited and compassionate boy who stumbles upon a colossal robot that has crash-landed from outer space. Voiced by Vin Diesel, the Iron Giant is a towering figure with a gentle soul, who befriends Hogarth despite being perceived as a threat by the paranoid society around them. Their bond grows as they navigate an increasingly dangerous environment, with government agent Kent Mansley (voiced by Christopher McDonald) determined to destroy what he doesn't understand.The voice cast is outstanding, with Marienthal capturing the wide-eyed innocence and bravery of Hogarth, while Diesel gives the Giant an endearing humanity through minimal yet impactful dialogue. Their relationship forms the emotional heart of the film, exploring themes of trust, individuality, and the power of choice. Christopher McDonald excels as the overzealous and manipulative Mansley, embodying the era's pervasive fear and suspicion.Brad Bird's direction is exceptional, seamlessly weaving moments of humour, action, and profound emotion. The animation, a harmonious blend of traditional hand-drawn techniques and early CGI, brings the story to life with a unique charm that still holds up today. The Giant's design, both mechanical and expressive, conveys an impressive range of emotions, making him an unforgettable character.Michael Kamen's evocative score elevates the film's emotional depth, perfectly underscoring both its quieter, reflective moments and its thrilling, climactic scenes. The story's themes of non-violence, self-identity, and courage in the face of fear are timeless and universally relevant, offering lessons that feel as important today as they did upon the film's release.The film's exploration of humanity's tendency to fear the unknown is poignant, while its ultimate message of compassion and sacrifice is profoundly moving. The Giant's declaration, ""I am not a gun,"" is a moment of cinematic brilliance, embodying the film's core message of self-determination and the power of choosing good over destruction.In conclusion, The Iron Giant is a shining example of the power of animated storytelling. Its heartfelt narrative, stunning visuals, and timeless themes make it an enduring classic that continues to inspire and captivate. A truly monumental achievement in cinema, it is a must-watch for anyone who cherishes meaningful, beautifully crafted films.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Brilliant social commentary,"This movie is simply extraordinary. It gives us a fresh and innovative view of the McCarthy era, when paranoia dictated politics and fear motivated overwhelmed our sense of responsibility and accountability.By framing the story as a cartoon and presenting it to us from the point of view of a child, the viewer is able to judge the other characters objectively for what they are. The naivete of Hogarth and the seeming innocence of the plot is a stark contrast to the probing cynicism and paranoia of the CIA.The movie does indeed oversimplify some major issues to make its point. The Iron Giant, as a symbol of ultimate good, and the CIA as the symbol of pure evil is certainly unfair. The rigid binary of good/evil, right/wrong is problematic. But it nevertheless forces us to ask questions about ourselves and about how we take the authority of those who claim to be looking out for our best interests.The Iron Giant is a refreshing tale of moral accountability and a brilliant social commentary on a dark time in American history",,Anonymous,Animation
One of 1999's ten best,"I don't ever want to hear a parent gripe again about the lack of quality family films these days. Brad Bird's ""The Iron Giant,"" an animated triumph about a 1950s boy who befriends a 100-foot metal giant from another world, was a complete box office failure, suggesting that unless it bears the Disney name, parents won't bother. The few people who did bother with this enchanting adventure were rewarded with the best family film of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best,"Like most of the people to have commented on this film I can find nothing bad to say about it.  It was certainly a breath of fresh air from all the Disney-ish cartoons out there.  The animation is of a classic style and goes together with the actors voices perfectly.  The setting, which is in the cold war culture of the 50's, is also an added bonus to the story as the fear of the Giant gets out of hand. The bottom line is that it is very enjoyable and teaches a lesson about violence and intolerance in a way that isn't sappy.  Enjoy",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Definitely a solid animation,"The Iron Giant boasts great animation, which incorporates both 2-D and flattened 3-D animation. The story is good, the setting and characters are interesting as well, and yes there are no songs, which is a daring move, but opens this one up to older audiences as well. I really enjoyed this film from start to end and frankly, I can't see why anyone wouldn't.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderful imaginative film,"A film reviewer on NPR said it best: this is the kind of film that conservatives are always calling for Hollywood to make more of, and when they do, nobody comes to the theater.Why is this?

The Iron Giant (1999),"I watched this for the first time in 13 years just now. Saw it at the cinema originally, and it was truly a sight to behold. It still holds up today and the animation looks incredibly fresh. The Iron Giant sees a large robot land on Earth in the 50's. A young boy soon makes friends with it, while a government agent investigates the sightings. The robot has forgotten who he is, but trouble arises when his built in defence mechanisms may be a danger to the small town. The Iron Giant is base on the book The Iron Man written by Ted Hughes. A book I remember from primary school. This adaptation has Americanized it, as well as making it more of a space themed Sci-Fi. The book had a battle with a space dragon, something I would have actually liked to see, even if it didn't work. The 50's setting is perfect for this kind of film. It's all about friendship, and being able to make choices no matter how we were raised. The giant is both sympathetic and cute, as well as being dangerous. It's the age old case of violence begets violence. I did find certain moments rushed in the film, as animation is usually short, but most of all I had trouble associating with Kent Mansley. He just goes too haywire towards the end. This is great stuff though, with strong animation, good vocal performances, exciting action sequences, and messages about friendship, peace, and sacrifice.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An absolute must see,"The Iron Giant (1999) is a movie that I recently watched on HBOMAX with my daughter. The storyline follows a young boy on the coast of Maine who one day thinks he saw a shooting star; but upon exploring where the star landed he discovers he has seen much more...he has found a robot from outer space. He will do his best to make friends with the robot and teach him the ways of Earth. Meanwhile, the robot eats metal things to survive and the more he eats the more at risk he is of being caught. If someone discovers the robot its life, and the boy's life, may be at risk.This movie is directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles) and contains the voices of Vin Diesel (The Fast & Furious), Jennifer Aniston (FRIENDS), Cloris Leachman (Young Frankenstein), Christopher McDonald (Happy Gilmore), M. Emmet Walsh (Blade Runners) and John Mahoney (Moonstruck).This picture has a lot of the cool science fiction elements that will be a big hit to fans of the 1950s era space movies. I loved how those elements were spun into the unique storyline. The robot was awesome and it is easy to root for the kid and robot. There's a swimming scene in this that's awesome and always makes me smile. The animation is very mediocre compared to other gems released during this era, but the storyline makes up for it. The ending is triumphant and grabs your heart.Overall, this is a unique and worthwhile addition to the family animated genre and an absolute must see. I would score this a 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It's so great because it doesn't use the ""Disney Formula""","I wasn't sure I was going to like the Giant.

An animated robot.It's not drawn in the Disney style, it's not preachy in the Disney style, and NO SONGS in the Disney style.  It's just a great story put together in a near-perfect manner.The only reason I didn't give it a perfect score was because there is a question that you have throughout most of the movie that never gets answered.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A very realistic animated movie packing an emotional wallop,"I, for one, have tired of the typical Disney formula movie. The movie that has the same rags-to-riches plot, the search for self, the romantic culmination, the comedic sidekicks, etc, etc. And Disney has watered down its moral message so much to prevent offending anyone that there is hardly a moral message at all. The Iron Giant is the movie you WISHED Disney would make.The Iron Giant is set in the late 50's. The dual optimism and fear so prominent in that time period is reflected in the movie and used to great effect. Young Hogarth represents countless boys who have grown up wistfully dreaming of space fantasies. Mr. Mansley represents the fear of the Soviet Union and nuclear annihilation of that period.The boy finds the Iron Giant and is at once scared and sympathetic. The movie goes on to show how little boys are actually more adept at looking past fear than adults.The relationship shown between the boy and the Giant is one of the best demonstrations of friendship I have ever seen in the movies. This is a relationship you care about, far more so than in any of the Disney movies.And, unlike Disney, this movie takes moral stands unambiguously. The wildly careening and inappropriate grace is hysterically funny and very much believable for a young boy. And the thoughtful conversation between the boy and Giant about having a soul is filmmaking at its finest. The Giant's uncertain status-- Is it alive? Does it have a conscious? Does it have free will?-- makes one think more about the afterlife as a result.The confrontation between the Giant and the military is the one part of the movie that is action-oriented. And, like the rest of the movie, it is well-done.Unlike the Disney movies, or most any others, this is a movie that you do not know how it will end. I thought this as the confrontation started-- and wondered, will I be disappointed? Not to fear-- wow, the ending is super! It packs an emotional wallop. In fact, this ending will have you and your friends talking for days.I've been frustrated all too often at Hollywood movies for such technical brilliance but lame plots-- here is a sterling exception. The plot is what makes this movie so memorable. And not only for what it says, but for what it doesn't. Questions such as Where did the Giant come from?, Does Hogarth have a father and, if so, where is he? are left unanswered-- and the movie is all-the-better for it.The excellent story, emotional resonance, and wonderful moral messages make this a movie not to be missed (unfortunately, too many have since no Disney marketing campaign backed this film). Here's a movie truly for kids and adults.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I hadn't been moved by a movie so much in my life let alone a 'cartoon'. The next few weeks was me racing against the clock to get everyone I knew to see it before it's short theatre run was over.

A great film for both kids and adults,"""The Iron Giant"" wasn't a big hit in the theaters, but hopefully it will find a larger audience on video, since it deserves one. This is one animated film that doesn't resemble Disney's output very much, which is refreshing. It's just a wonderful story told very well. Set in 1950s Maine, ""The Iron Giant"" is the story of Hogarth Hughes, a bright, only child with an active imagination who is being raised by a single mom. He meets an enormous, child-like robot from outer space who may or may not be a danger to the people of earth. The actors voicing the characters are all great (especially Harry Connick, Jr. as a Beatnik scrap metal dealer), the story is very touching, and the film incorporates just enough reminders of '50s Red-scare paranoia and sci-fi influences without letting them overwhelm the story. This is a great film that viewers of any age should enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best Animated Feature Since Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,"I don't have enough positive things to say about the Iron Giant; I just want to say that right now.  It was a beautiful film that reflects the Communist paranoia of 1950s America through a boy and a metallic alien in rural New England.  This movie is a genuine treat.  It is something that adults can relate to with the myriad of reference to 50s culture, and both children and adults will love its innocence.The film is drawn in a classical animation style like early Disney films to give the audience a feel of the time in which it is set.  Unlike recent Disney films (thankfully), The Iron Giant does not have any cutesy little ""friends"" that serve as comic relief or to create nausea for the viewer. Instead, the filmmaker respects the audience's intelligence (both children and adults) by giving us a simple story that does not rely on embellishment to make itself more viewer friendly.  It doesn't need it.The author started with a concept - what if a gun had a soul? - and created this brilliant animated feature in the same vain of Spielberg's E.T.-The Extra-Terrestrial.  It stands as a testament to what animated films should be (it is possibly the best in over 50 years), but what's more, it stands as a testament to what FILMS should be.I can't stress this film's greatness.  Just see it for yourself, and be a kid again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly Wonderful,"THE IRON GIANT-- 11/26/99THE IRON GIANT was a total surprise. I usually skip animation at the theatre, but I made an exception on this one and I am glad that I did. I would even go so far as to put this film in my Top 10 list for 1999.THE IRON GIANT not only had a positive message, but was funny and heart-warming too. As a guy who is totally at odds with the unduly graphic, formulaic, impersonal and dumbed-down movies of this era, it was a unique experience for me to walk out of a movie feeling good about what I just saw. For example, although FIGHT CLUB (8.5/10) is easily one of the top five movies of the year, I must admit that I did not feel particularly good when I left the theatre that day. Shocked is the word that comes to mind, but ""good"" is not one of them.After thinking over the films I had seen so far this year, not unsurprisingly, almost none of them made me feel good. Oh, I may have been intellectually stimulated, but was I encased in a field of positive energy? No.If you want a big, warm fuzzy, this film, THE IRON GIANT, is certainly the one to watch.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Cute, charming and funny","This film is about a young boy (between the ages of 8-10) who thinks his family is a loner. So... he goes off to do what he wants to do, and suddenly feels something strange. He goes off out of the house in disguise and finds a giant (which happens to be the iron giant) who eats up metal. He then talks to his students about it, his mom, and then sometimes he just wants to teach it some things and make it stay out of the house (to not let his parents know).This movie is slow at first, but then in the middle, it's hilarious. It's really charming and a great reference to Superman. Despite all that action, language and angst, young children would enjoy it too. While the movie is endearing, beautiful enough for adults and is as entertaining and funny as it is to kids, this Sci-Fi adventure filled with angst, spies, film noir and detective themes is a joy to all ages!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Cinematic Landmark that Stood the Test of Time,"Back in the late 90s, when most theatrical animation was trying to emulate the success of the Disney renaissance, along came a smaller albeit unique feature from Warner Bros. called The Iron Giant. Despite receiving critical acclaim, it was a box office flop on its original release due to poor marketing. However, thanks to a growing cult following on VHS and DVD, and the film's director Brad Bird creating Pixar powerhouses like The Incredibles and Ratatouille, the film eventually went from an underrated gem to one of the greatest animated features ever made. After over 20 years in its existence, I think it's time to owe back its debt.Set in 1950s America during the Cold War, the film follows Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a giant intergalactic metal robot. In response to the U.S. military, Hogarth must fend them off from destroying the Giant. The movie's main plot is a mix of the common young child meets strange creature narrative and the old fear of beings beyond our worlds common in 1950s sci-fi films. What makes the otherwise familiar storyline fascinating though is how it develops the Giant as a legitimate character, from letting its monstrous size tell many scenes themselves and Hogarth mentoring it like a father teaching its son all the advantages in becoming good, as if a machine could actually have a soul. As for the sci-fi aesthetic, the film cleverly plays around with the themes of paranoia from nuclear war common back then with a supernatural twist, since what's beyond their world was too much for them to even comprehend. Of all the films to blend thrilling sci-fi, atomic fear and heartfelt tenderness together, this movie knocks it right out of the ballpark.As this is a character driven story, almost every figure in the movie plays an important part in some shape or form. With Hogarth being a rebellious albeit responsible kid, he also has the misfortune of his single mother working overtime, which makes his role to the giant as a teacher all the more engaging. In fact, because the Giant is often curious about the new world of Earth, he learns more from the values of friendship and life through Hogarth and the beatnik artist Dean, making their bonds all the more sincere and heartwarming. Speaking of Dean, he's more of a hip outcast to society that makes his own artwork from scrap and junk, yet that all leads to him reluctantly becoming part of the Giant's presence. Then there's the antagonist Kent Mansley, who perfectly represents how the government wanted America to think in the 50s, as he believes anything outside the U.S. and Earth is a threat and must be destroyed for the ""good"" of humanity. Rarely have animated characters been this relatable and this human before, including a giant metal robot.Even for a movie that strayed away from the Disney formula in the 90s, the film is animated nearly as well as any product from the Mouse House. Brad Bird is known for his exaggerated and stylistic character designs, and this film is no exception, as every character sticks out based on their physique and personality. The character animation adds in smooth movements, realistic attributes common in human anatomy and bold gestures that sell the performances. However, the film's true highlight has to be the CG work done on the Giant itself, as the crew created it with a cel-shaded approach that helps it blend extraordinarily well with the hand-drawn characters. The lack of overly detailed lighting also helps, since it keeps the contrast of the Giant simple and easy to look at without coming off as distracting. Also, major applause must be given to the cinematography and shot composition, as every color and every single frame conveys what the scene is communicating emotionally, whether it'd be completely visual with no dialogue or an intense thrilling scene with quick cuts and frightening glares.Needless to say, The Iron Giant stands the test of time thanks to its heartfelt story, themes of acceptance over fear, lovable characters and wonderful animation. If you're yet to check this film out for yourself, then this is a must watch for anyone, not just film and animation buffs. It's not common that a feature communicates the idea that supposedly dangerous weapons could actually have a soul to them, yet this film found a way to do so through humor, pathos and ideologies that are still common today. Remember, even things we might take for granted can have more substance than we give them credit for.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the movies that made me fall in love with animation.,"The Iron Giant is an animated film directed by Brad Bird in 1999. It tells the story of a young boy discovering an out-of-this-world giant in the forest. We are led through their relationship and the journey to the giant's societal acceptance. It is a charming tale of choosing your own destiny, alongside others who are rooting for you.The story takes the fable of a gentle giant and adds an American twist. The Cold War aspect is an interesting addition. The film is set during the 1950s, with propaganda being a large part of midwestern American culture at the time. It serves as an outline for the increased paranoia surrounding the giant. The film could have been done without, but I believe it adds another level of intrigue. Read into the propaganda related content as you will. I'm personally fine with it because in the end it sends the message of choosing to be good and promoting anti-violence and anti-governmental intervention. When I watched this for the first time as a child, the idea of nuclear war went over my head, but I still understood the general concepts of the film, which is arguably the most important. A child does not have to understand the idea of nuclear war in order to understand the movie's message and enjoy the film.The voice acting in this film is brilliant and well cast. My favorite voice actor would be the governmental agent, Kent Mansley. He is voiced by Christopher McDonald, who has consistently played a villain incredibly well. His voice is strong and just condescending enough for Agent Mansley's character. As a kid, I remember being slightly afraid of him, just as Hogarth is in the beginning. As for the Iron Giant, his voice is done by Vin Diesel. It is hard to explain why it works so well, but he finds a way to create a gentle voice while still sounding like a robot. The gentle hums of the giant make him feel safe and kind, which is what he and Hogarth are trying to prove to the world.The animation style in this film is so artistic and beautifully done. Even as a Warner Brothers film, it strays from Disney's mainstream and original animation style. It adds another level of depth to the characters and their environment. On a technical note, the color palette is not overstimulating, which makes it clear that this film isn't simply animated ""content"" with the only job of entertaining children. Which I deem as important because much of today's mainstream animated content are fluff pieces with little depth. This is a lovely contrast.There are so many reasons to watch this film. For one it sends the message about choosing your own destiny, wanting to be good, and the distaste for violence as an immediate response. It is simply mesmerizing to look at, with the animation style as strong but not overpowering. It was refreshing to see Warner Brothers take a new look at their animation. I know many people are hesitant to watch animated films because they don't want to see a loud musical, or too childish of themes, but this film truly challenges that. This is one of the movies when I was little that made me fall in love with animation in the first place. The Iron Giant is a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Sublime animation with strong message on violence,"Lonely kid Hogarth Hughes (Marienthal) discovers a giant metal man which soon becomes the friend he as always wanted whilst a government agent seeks to destroy it.The Iron Giant brings together a sentimental story of a young lad with no friends but a vivid imagination and when The Giant comes down and the two share their first meeting, humour and sentimental emotions are flying around to make a wonderful film that is as sharp as many Disney pictures and is the first full length animation for the then relatively unknown Brad Bird.Bird would of course go on to win 2 Oscars (and possibly more) with so far The Incredibles and Ratatouille that had a subtle blend of humour and family magic, and this is where Bird began his magic in the animation industry.Based on Ted Hughes' book, The Iron Giant is scripted with an imaginative realism. It is designed around a lonely boy who unfortunately causes trouble with every pet he owns and his mother comes down hard on him when he tries to express his repressed feelings.Hogarth is a cheeky character that generates plenty good comedy in this picture. His imaginative nature makes you wish you were young whilst his enthusiasm at tackling exciting new opportunities, such as jumping in a freezing lake and going on his own adventures brings that accurate youthful mind that is scripted so exquisitely you will be flashing back to your own childhood.Like all Disney pictures, this Bird film has a strong message to portray to the younger generations. Lion King was the circle of life; Monsters Inc was child security whilst Robin Hood looked at the rich and the poor. Iron Giant has perhaps one of the strongest natured meanings at looking at life and death since Bambi. When The Giant is targeted he is triggered with a defence mechanism whilst Hogarth preaches to him about violence. It is powerful stuff that is all relative to the development of the young mind as this script looks to develop itself by looking at how to use violence and the context in which it is appropriate and when it is not. It is quite strong stuff, even for perhaps an older audience. When the Giant encounters the deer and the aftermath is very shocking. This by all means portrays the hard aspects of real life, blended with a sharp intake of science fiction.The means by which The Giant communicates and discovers the world's systems shows the contrasts with our world and the outer realms. The scope of technology the Giant brings is vastly different and we see a shocking look at other worldly technology versus the U.S Governments.The picture has its drawbacks. The humour is by no means on par with Pixar being awkwardly crude and in bad context.But significantly the rightful message is portrayed and it is a wonderfully made picture",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
You don't have to have been born in 1950 - but it helps.,"My 7 year-old daughter loved it, my 10-year old daughter told me she's too old to see it, and I'm just the right age. I was born in 1950, so I appreciated the ""Maypo"" TV commercial, I remember Sputnik being launched and I was one of those kids who was taught to ""duck and cover"" if the bomb were to drop.

There's so many words I can use to describe this film!,"Outstanding, colorful, emotional, moving and fantastic. Those are just a few of the words I can use to describe Brad Bird's Iron Giant Movie. This man clearly has a knack for making movies. Let's start off with the first thing::CASTING- The casting on this film is so great you can picture these voice actors doing a live-action interpretation of this film.ANIMATION- A unique style of animation that gives realism and quality.HUMOR- Brad Bird is good at this. Kent Mansley is the type of villain you dislike, but love to make fun of, especially when he is on his craziest moments.And Lastly:CHARACTERS- The Iron Giant himself is a very emotional and well written character, Hogarth is a likeable protagonist and you feel for them both when they are in danger or apart.I remember seeing the Iron Giant on VHS. And loving it, now that VHS is long past, I've purchased it on Blu-Ray and love the signature edition of the film. If you haven't seen this movie, you're missing a great deal. Watch it, I guarantee you that you will have a good time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The ""solid"" heart","Imagine ""E.T."" as a towering metal man, and you have some of the appeal of ""The Iron Giant,"" an enchanting animated feature about a boy who makes friends with a robot from outer space. The giant crash-lands on a 1957 night when America is peering up at the speck of Sputnik in the sky, and munches his way through a Maine village, eating TV antennas and cars, until he finds a power plant. That's where young Hogarth Hughes finds him.Hogarth is a 9-year-old who lives with his single mom (Jennifer Aniston) and dreams of having a pet. She says they make too much of a mess around the house, little dreaming what a 100-foot robot can get up to. One night Hogarth discovers their TV antenna is missing and follows the Iron Giant's trail to the power plant, where he saves the robot from electrocution after it chomps on some live wires. That makes the giant his friend forever, and now all Hogarth has to do is keep the robot a secret from his mom and the federal government.""The Iron Giant"" is still another example of the freedom that filmmakers find in animation: This would have been a $100 million live-action special-effects movie, but it was made for a fraction of that cost because the metal man is drawn, not constructed. And here is a family movie with a message: a Cold War parable in which the Iron Giant learns from a little boy that he is not doomed to be a weapon because ""you are what you choose to be."" The movie is set in the 1950s because that's the decade when science fiction seemed most preoccupied with nuclear holocaust and invaders from outer space. It includes a hilarious cartoon version of the alarming ""Duck and Cover"" educational film, in which kids were advised to seek shelter from H-bombs by hiding under their desks. And the villain is a Cold Warrior named Kent Mansley (voice by Christopher McDonald), a G-man who of course sees the Iron Giant as a subversive plot and wants to blast it to pieces.That political parable is buried beneath a lot of surface charm; the film's appeal comes from its ""E.T.""-type story about a boy trying to hide an alien from his mom. The Iron Giant is understandably too big to conceal in the closet, but there's a funny sequence where Hogarth brings the creature's hand into the house, and it scampers around like a disobedient dog.Like the new Japanese animated films, ""The Iron Giant"" is happy to be a ""real movie"" in everything but live action. There are no cute little animals and not a single musical number: It's a story, plain and simple. The director, Brad Bird, is a ""Simpsons"" veteran whose visual look here, much more complex than ""The Simpsons,"" resembles the ""clear line"" technique of Japan's Hayao Miyazaki (""My Neighbor Totoro""). It works as a lot of animation does, to make you forget from time to time that these are moving drawings, because the story and characters are so compelling.As for the Iron Giant himself, he's surprisingly likable. He can't speak English at first, but is a quick study, and like E.T. combines great knowledge with the naivete of a stranger in a puzzling land. His voice is by Vin Diesel and sounds like it has been electronically lowered. He looks unsophisticated--something like a big Erector Set construction with a steam-shovel mouth--but as we get to know him he turns into a personality before our very eyes--a big lunk we feel kind of sorry for. By the big climax (which, also like ""E.T.,"" involves a threat from bureaucrats and technocrats), we're hoping Hogarth can help save his friend once again.It must be tough to get a movie like this made. Disney has the traditional animation market locked up, but other studios seem willing to throw money at Disney musical look-alikes (like ""The King and I"") even though they might have a better chance moving in the opposite direction--toward real stories told straight. ""The Iron Giant,"" based on a book by the recently deceased British poet laureate Ted Hughes, is not just a cute romp but an involving story that has something to say.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Still holds up,"Some years before The Incredibles and Ratatouille, Brad Bird directed this animated film, which was apparently a box office bomb (despite great reviews) and has since went on to become a cult classic. Even if this isn't quite as good as those later films, it's close (and it's definitely different, being a little more low-key and not fully computer-animated, of course).The story is very simple. It is essentially E. T but with a giant robot befriending a young boy being raised by a single mother instead of an alien. Naturally, the government don't like the idea of some kind of potential threat, and both movies ultimately portray the government and/or army as the bad guys.The Iron Giant is just really charming. It's got a good heart, and even if the story is familiar, it's told well. The end is quite emotional, and the characters are fun throughout, and easy to care for or dislike. It works well as a kids movie that can also keep the interests of older viewers, making it among the best animated family films of the 1990s.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The closest American animation can come to Miyazaki,"In 1999, ""The Iron Giant"" was a box office failure, due in large part(if not entirely)on Warner Bros piss-poor advertising campaign. Which is a shame, because this is a unique, outstanding movie.Unlike most of the animated films made in the States, TIG relies on characterization rather than on insipid humor(not that there ISN'T humor in it because there is)to propel its story, which in itself is constructed on 50's paranoia,and the damaging effects of fear. I also enjoyed the music by Micheal Kamen,the voice acting(Vin Disel actually has been in a good movie) and the ending, which I will not reveal.With a new DVD release, hopefully ""The Iron Giant"" will get some of the recognition it deserves.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""It's bad to kill. Guns kill. And you don't have to be a gun. You are what you choose to be. You choose. Choose.""","Could I expect any less from the fantastic Brad Bird? This was a tremendous feature which was very emotionally driven towards the end, which is what made it so special to me, and hence shot my rating up to a 9. But even if the ending wasn't so emotional I was still planning on giving this movie a 8, as it was enthralling throughout. Whilst it may have been a tad too cliché, even for a children's film, it was not only brilliantly entertaining, but also laugh-out-loud hilarious! And despite the relatively staid and uninspiring animation (although I do understand the limitations which the animation team had to deal with so I won't scrutinize this aspect), Bird manages to convey a beautiful and delightful story about the heartwarming bond between two very different beings. That may sound very generic, but it is Bird's execution of such a plot that elevates it from a simple, boring one to one that is utterly riveting and compelling.Additionally, it's funny how much Vin Diesel suited the role of The Iron Giant, his voice was bizarrely ideal for playing this robot!I do want to talk a little bit more about the ending, as it was perfect for a family picture. Sad enough to stir the hearts of adults yet happy enough to not leave children in mourning for days on end! Thoroughly impressive.Overall, this is a magnificent animated movie and one that I would definitely recommend for those of you looking for something to watch with your kids, or even just for yourself!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Charming and incredibly powerful fantasy,"The roaring success of Disney's The Lion King (no pun intended) in 1994 inspired something of an animation boom, during which various production studios attempted to cash in on the trend to varying degrees of success. Warner Bros. Feature Animation had a moderate hit with Space Jam, but underperformed with the likes of Cats Don't Dance and Quest for Camelot. They had one bona fide hit with The Iron Giant, a truly wonderful little feature adapted from Ted Hughes' 1968 novel The Iron Man. It didn't leave much of a dent at the box-office, but found a loyal audience on home video. In the 19 years since its release, The Iron Giant is fondly remembered as one of best animated features of the 1990s, and saw director Brad Bird poached by a little up-and-coming studio called Pixar.In the fictional town of Rockwell, Maine in 1957, the residents are busy gazing up at the sky in fear of the Soviet Union's satellite Sputnik spying on them, and school children are shown Duck and Cover style educational films to prepare for a nuclear attack. In the surrounding forest, a huge object crashes down to Earth, alarming local fisherman Earl (M. Emmet Walsh). 9 year-old Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal) spends his nights watching cheesy sci-fi movies and dreaming of owning his own pet. His mother Annie (Jennifer Aniston) thinks they cause too much mess, a point that seems to be proven when young Hogarth accidentally releases a squirrel into the local diner. With his mother working late one night, Hogarth wanders into the woods and comes across the object Earl insists he saw: a giant alien robot (voiced by Vin Diesel) that enjoys munching everything from train tracks to the local power station.This kind of allegorical coming-of-age tale has been done before (think E.T. but with an adorable weapon of mass destruction), but rarely with such charm and genuine emotion. It's influence can be felt in everything from the recent Pete's Dragon remake and A Monster Calls, and it's no surprise that the film continues to attract new fans. The Iron Giant questions what would happen if a gun could feel. The titular giant occasionally turns aggressive in the face of possible danger, as the alien's true purpose becomes increasingly and unnervingly clear. But with no memory of his mission, it's down to Hogarth to teach metal hulk kindness, and the youngster does so in a way that only an innocent could. A moment in the woods sees the unlikely friends come across the corpse of a deer. At first, the giant cannot comprehend death as he can regenerate, but Hogarth manages to teach him about the finality of death. It's incredibly powerful, and it's message is even more relevant today than it was almost 20 years ago. We all have choices in life, and sometimes simple human kindness and empathy can be infinitely more powerful than brute force.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Brilliant Movie,"The Iron Giant - what can I say? This movie, starring Friends star Jennifer Anisten and Harry Connick Jr, is a heartwarming movie not only for children but adults.

One day, a giant metal man falls from the sky, scaring everybody witless, except Hogarth who befriends the giant and hides him away from the US Army when the investigator is looking for him.The giant - voiced by Vin Diseal - is a beautifully made character who you grow to love more and more as the movie goes on. The end is heartbreaking and the last scene is a fantastic way to end the movie.Laughs are made all the way through the movie and my personal favourite part was when Hogarth was trying to get the giants hand out of the bathroom, in doing so, creating so much noise that his mother and Kurt - the inspector - run upstairs and storm in on him on the toilet.This movie is fantastic and no one should miss the chance to experience such a marvellous film.

In the world of animated flicks this one gets five stars.,"Iron Robot is a well crafted film and I'm not surprised to see Brad Bird knocking it out of the park for Pixar with the recent hit The Incredibles.Obviously this movie is about a Giant Robot and a little boy in Smallsville, USA, so I'm not sure why someone would write 5 paragraphs about it. But I will say this; it is a perfect movie for children and even an old dude like me.Most of the time animators and directors don't have the talent to breath life into animated characters without exaggerating their actions and reducing them to cartoons.

An intelligent and entertaining film with plenty for adults and children,"1957. When a Maine fisherman reports a sighting of a giant metal device from outer space, nobody believes him except for Special Agent Kent Mansley  always one to hunt out any communist plot involving invasion from outer space. However the robot remains elusive to all but young Hogarth Hughes, who finds it in the woods and manages to befriend it  even teaching it basic English. But with the origin and purpose of the robot unknown, is Hogarth right to accept it as a friend or should he fear it? Regardless, Mansley intends to kill it before it kills 'us'.It has been so many years since I read the book as a child, that I was pretty much coming to this with no knowledge of story or what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised by an intelligent film that is wholly entertaining and will please kids and adults. Set in the later fifties, the plot uses the iron giant as an allegory for the unknown and thus presents adults with a well-written criticism of the 'shoot first, questions later' mentality. Being a kids' film it is hardly a debating stand point but it was still intelligently enough done to keep me interested. The main plot is also interesting, with issues of death, birth and purpose all having a bearing on the story and giving food for thought later if you let it. These elements work to make quite a touching film where the giant is taught like a child by Hogarth and it becomes a very warm and likable character.None of this takes away from the film's first function as a kids' movie and as such it produces enough humour, visual excitement and energy to keep the kids happy even if the reference to the Cold War will be almost totally over their heads. The film is moving as much as it is humorous, intelligent as much as it is entertaining and the end result is a very well rounded film. Of course it has problems in that it does go where you expect it to at points, and it does lose its nerve towards the end and ducks the dark but satisfying ending it should have had, but these are minor complaints because the rest of it all works well together to form a really enjoyable animation.In a way I found it quite refreshing to have a kids' cartoon that provided warmth and intelligence for the adult audience to share in; I love stuff like Toy Story etc but their adult stuff is a little knowing and cynical at times (albeit hilariously so!) whereas here I felt that I was being given the same story as the kids and not having separate levels for them and me.The voice cast is good on paper but only a handful of them really get much to do. Marienthal is not the usual sickly sweet kid and he does a good job to make his character come across as convincing. Connick jr is very funny and provides a lot of laughs to the film; likewise McDonald's paranoid agent pretty much steals every scene he is in. I was concerned by the fact that Diesel was the voice of the robot, how would I warm to a character played by a man who struggles to bring any charisma to his other roles I wondered? However the limited dialogue and depth of his voice works well and he did a good job (although I'm sure it amounted to no more than a day in a recording studio). Aniston has little to do and her voice is not that distinctive but minor roles for Mahoney and Walsh add a sense of class with their very well known voices.Overall this is a very enjoyable animation. The plot is intelligent, interesting, moving and humorous at different points and, although some of it go over the kids' heads, it tells the same story to both age groups well.It's all over a bit quick and kids weaned on Pixar may complain about the traditional animation used for the majority of the film but there are only a few minor quibbles about this film and it is definitely worth hunting down. An interesting and entertaining family film that will stick in your mind for what it does and the talking points it leaves.",,Anonymous,Animation
"An entertaining and heartfelt cartoon version of ""E. T."" and ""Star Kid. *** out of ****.","THE IRON GIANT (1999) ***Starring the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Christopher McDonald, and Eli Marienthal Directed by Brad Bird. Running time: 87 minutes. Rated PG (for animated violence and mild language)By Blake French:""The Iron Giant"" is much like a cartoon version of ""E. T: The Extraterrestrial"" and ""Star Kid."" It is an effective, empathetic journey into the life of its characters. Although the film is animated, it keeps a mature edge on its concepts. There are no outrageous characters, over the top musical numbers, or a bombarding number of shallow, unbelievable happenings. This is an animation in which children will enjoy for its message, but also adults because of its qualities and depth. If we were to replace the cartoons with real people, that would be possible here. That is how down to earth this movie is.The story details the life of a lonely boy named Hogarth Hughes, who is about nine years of age. He lives a very dual and boring lifestyle with his mother, Annie. He has made a hobby of gathering animals from the wild to be his household pets. His mother is a very busy individual, working full time as a waitress for a small town coffee shop.This is a fabulous, descriptive opening. We learn several elements about the characters, structure, as well as the movie's style. We learn that Hogarth's single mother is extremely busy and has little time with her son. We also see that due to the significant time this child spends alone, he has a great imagination. This is the internal problem, that Hogarth is somewhat lonesome spending all this time by himself. This film has well-developed characters, better than some more adult movies.One day, while alone in the house watching television, something happens to Hogarth. His electrical power supply to his TV set goes bad. In a desperate attempt to fix the problem, he climbs on the roof of his house to discover half his antenna has been bitten off. What could have done this? The first clue is the massive footprints leading into the woods. Whatever made these prints destroyed everything in its path.The thing that caused the destruction, technical difficulties, and placed colossal holes in the ground, is a massive iron giant from space who has recently crash landed on earth. Hogarth quickly greets the robot and makes friends with it. The story propels from there after we see the humanity and gentle attitude of the android whom we share empathy with and are able to understand and relate to. The first act is solid and clear cut, proving to us that this is not only a well-animated cartoon, but also a well structured one.The film introduces the external problem when an insane detective places his nose where it doesn't belong and discovers the gigantic metal creature. Hogarth is forced to keep his robot secret so that it is not taken away. This detective's purpose in ""The Iron Giant"" serves as more than meets the eye. His motives are understandable and developed, although shows signs of existing as a plot device rather than a real character. Also, he is used to increase the line of dramatic tension as he grows closer and closer to finding the robot. This is a very sufficient and well-written character who contributes to a lot of positive material and many possibilities for the film.The only problem I had with the film is how it never actually explained what the iron giant was. It is an amazing creature, able to heal itself, shoot out lasers, contribute in conversations, and yet we never know how it is able to do these things. Did it come from another plant seeking help for its dying race? Is it on a mission to gather important materials for its existence? Perhaps the android was built by a cruel human inventor on earth but was overtaken by the size of it ands thus allows it to escape into space and become lost--leaving the iron giant no choice but to return to his home where he discoursed along the way and crashed. The possibilities are endless. Too bad the filmmakers took such a shallow look at our title character, otherwise, this would have been one of the year's most entertaining family films.Brought to you by Warner Bros.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A wonderful piece of film making,"It is a tremendous shame that this film has reached such a small audience as in my humble opinion, its one of the finest animated pictures to come out of the US. Sure, it does not pack the epic scope of The Lion King, but it is a very touching (but not schmaltzy) work and is one of those films that can literally bring a smile to your face that will not leave for days.Set in the 1950's, it tells of a young American boy obsessed with science fiction comics and movies, who befriends a massive, alien robot that has crash landed in the countryside surrounding his home. The two form a bond as he gradually teaches the giant about his world and the story then focuses on his attempts to keep the giant hidden from a US government official and the military. Not easy when you're a 30 feet tall, clanking mechanical marvel with footprints the size of cars.Along the way, there are plenty of sly touches. The feel of the 1950's is perfectly realised with milkshake shops, bad horror films and the sense of paranoia that came from being one of two super powers dominating the world. The animation too is beautifully done, with even the metallic eyes of the Giant displaying tremendous emotion behind them. The story at times is very sentimental, but it's also loaded with a knowing sense of wry humour and though this may be a film with a child audience squarely in mind, I defy even the toughest of souls not to feel a little choked up come the ending.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
If  only Transformers were so good.,"Iron Giant is one of the movies ,which stick to me as a kid and now in my adult life I remember it finely. What really bothers me is the fact that this flick bombed at the box office, WHY? Did the Giant suffered enough already? Any way this is also one of the last hand drawn animated movies to be made before their type ,when close to extinct in the twenty first century. For just think how many animated flicks were in theaters(video movies don't count) in last decade and a half, which weren't made with computers, I am sure that three to five is the maximum number for most of us, for by experience know only five! FIVE, in Fifteen years !Now I don't for any reason hate Nemo, Toy Story ,WALL-E, Ice Age and Schrek, no are some of my favorites and Lego was hilarious. What I am saying is that Iron Giant apart from its great story, images and moments ""You stay ,I go, No following"" ,man I still cry when I think of it, had also the ""luck "" to see its kind in its last days of glory, before Pixar and Dreamworks took over the industry. #MOLOPOLY!To the film itself ,at the high of the space race a robot from space crash land in the USA and befriends a boy, which teach it, who to be like superman. The effects are great and even the setting look accurate for the fifties period, why it earn 23 million to a budget of 70? The answers are ,the Six Sense which opened the same week, with the Giant and blew audiences away and the themes were judged by many parents as too adult. For real I feel go to an adult in the twenty first century and see an animated film and not be laugh at for that, in the end a good flick, is a good flick, end of story, because that argument of 1999 is obvious stupid!If you haven't show it to your kids yet, do it, JUST DO IT!

Beautiful and Delightful,"Now first off, I must set the table before we can dig into the meat of this review. This movie was not made by the likes of Disney Animation or their then-fledgling affiliate and now property, Pixar. It was made by Warner Bros. Now, in the 90s, particularly the late nineties, there were a rush of animated movies not made by Disney or any real animation company that won't happen again. It was an interesting time for animation. Not a good one, perhaps; other than this film, the best of these so-called second-string animated movies (not counting TNBC, which is stop-motion) by common judgement is Anastasia, a movie that I professionally dislike and personally despise. But an interesting one.This movie is a great example of why it never happened again. Here is one of the best movies of the year in a year that was filled with great movies, and yet it completely flopped at the box office due to legitimately horrible management by Warner Bros. Seriously; this movie was not relatively expensive (though it looks the part), and it has a very marketable premise. How do you screw that up? That's not rhetorical; I'm confounded. Yes, I'm aware Warner has a history in animation. But that's mostly in television; they should leave movies to the experts.Wow that was long-winded. Thankfully, this movie is not; at only eighty-six minutes, it flies by. You often want it to stay longer; not because it does anything incorrect, but because you don't want it to leave you. This is the kind of film where, if I saw it at the cinema, I would stay during the credits and afterwards. I would stay until they forced me to get out; that's the sort of film it is.If the animation is not as well-funded as Disney's, it does not show it. There are ambitious scenes in this film, scenes that seem to be the lovechild of 70s Disney, 80s Ghibli, and 00s Pixar. You can't honestly say that Tarzan looks like it has more money poured into it than this movie. The motion is especially eye-catching. Speed is one of the hardest things to get right, really right in animation. And yet when it is done right, there is nothing on planet Earth that looks prettier.Miyazaki is the best at this; the first time I watched a scene in the third act of Porco Rosso, one where Porco flies his plane for one last long sequence over the land and to the sea, to meet his final challenge, my life was forever changed. I'm not exaggerating; those were some of the most invocative, most profound minutes of my life. But Bird clearly takes cues from, and shares interests with, Mr. Miyazaki. It does not surprise me that the two of them are friends. And of course, thanks to him helping bring Miyazaki's works over to the West, I'm glad they are.This is a movie that gets darker as it goes along, but it does it in a smart way, a sensible way. And a way that can still get a kid-friendly rating. When I first-watched this movie, the first thing I thought of was eighties Spielberg (though without some of the sappiness.) If this isn't already, (I don't know) it should be one of those films that is in everyone's house, along with Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story, Totoro, Finding Nemo, Kiki's Delivery Service, etc. Kids deserve to have this movie be a part of their childhood. If I have kids, I'm showing them this.And of course, it is a gift to us adults as well, whether or not we believe that we deserve it. After the first ten minutes, the transition from 2D to 3D, doesn't feel weird at all. Even more, it feels magical, like it were conjured out of some fantasy world that we only by chance get to see. The writing is stellar and shows a lot of that quick wit that would latter become a staple of his. You get a lot of great lines without the sense that they're trying too hard like you do in The Avengers.I wouldn't say the music is spectacular aside from a few pieces, but it does fit the tone of the film well. The same is true to some extent with the characters, who are my one grievance with the film. They feel too cliché and used. The good acting, particularly from the stars, Connick and Aniston, helps, but overall, he doesn't play enough with the characters. That's the main reason this film isn't as good as The Incredibles and one of the reasons why it isn't as good as Ratatouille (which also could have used stronger characters (except Ego, who was brilliant) but it is not as big of a problem and the rest of the movie is ambient enough to cover for it). And it's the reason I would give this film a 4.5 out of 5.But that's just me comparing Bird to the ridiculously high standards he has set for himself with his era-defining work. I will go as far as to say this is the best American animated film of the late nineteen-nineties not including the Toy Story movies. Better than Hercules or Mulan or Hunchback. It's a whimsical film, it's arguably the essential 'Boy and His X' film, and it is a film with something to say. If this was made after 9/11, it would be the essential post-9/11 movie. The military are the villains and its clear they are acting out of misery instead of 'For the Evulz.' But above all this, I say that I look forward to watching it again. And I believe that's one of the endorsements I can give to a film.And remember: sentient robots are not guns.(P.S. This movie takes place in Bird's birth year, 1957)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
My All-Time Favorite Film,"I'll admit it, I am beyond biased when it comes to The Iron Giant. I first saw the film when I was four back in 1999 and I immediately fell in love with it. I wanted to be Hogarth, I wanted my own Iron Giant, and quite frankly I wanted to be a filmmaker. This movie was my first real introduction to Superman, it was my first introduction to the Cold War, and it showed me the kind of America that I wanted to live in.I know that's heavy and seems like a lot, but honestly The Iron Giant is one of the best, if not THE best, animated films of all time, as well as just straight-up science-fiction masterpieces of all time. Just recently the film was re-released into theaters for two days as the ""Signature Edition"" with two additional scenes that they fully animated for this re-release. I was so excited to go but seeing as how I got to school in Bozeman, MT I was afraid that we wouldn't get it at our theater and I would have to drive to find one, but nevertheless it was there for two nights, and I went both even taking my 11 year old sister to one of my viewings.The Iron Giant teaches you the moral lessons you need to survive childhood and develop into who you are. ""You are what you choose to be"" is the main quote from the film and it certainly rings true. The Bible says, ""For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he..."" (Prov. 23:7), and this is exactly the message that this film points towards. It's funny, it's exciting, it's entertaining, it's compelling, and it's over-all original in the sense that the magic of this movie has never been re-created on the big screen, in my opinion.The Iron Giant is my all-time favorite film, so I'm obviously biased, but beyond the emotional attachment I have to it from my childhood, as I continue to watch this film throughout my adult life, it always brings out the child in me, and I always tear up at the end (don't worry, I won't spoil it). This movie rocks, and I can't thank Brad Bird enough for bringing to life Ted Hughes' ""The Iron Man"" in the form of The Iron Giant.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Forgotten Jewel,"A 2-D animation movie with a great script, characters and old-style animation.The Iron Giant tells the story of the fall into Earth of an alien giant robot, and his relation with a naughty child who lives with his single mother in a small town in the States.The movie is set in the 1950s, during the cold war period and the space race, when aliens and robot populated TV shows and comics, and the imagination of the population. The movie is able to reproduce the mood and style of the era, even the animation style, but with all the improvements that technology has brought to animation.The characters are psychologically drawn with great talent, as it couldn't be otherwise by a Warner Bros's movie, and it is just them, their human qualities, what makes the viewer click with them and believe they are real. Moreover, the cartoons have a superb body movement, facial expression.The script is engaging and very entertaining, very funny and lovable. At the same time, the film address serious social and political issues in a simple approachable way, without lecturing: You are who you decide to be, if you respond to violence is your option., it is in your hands to make your own destiny no matter what your past is, your heart is always a great power to connect with others, no matter how different they are. Great messages to pass on to children.Eli Marienthal is terrific as the little hero Hogarth Hughes. Jennifer Aniston is extremely lovable as his mother Annie (perhaps Aniston's best performance ever...),.Harry Connick Jr is very likable as the quirky Dean McCoppin, Vin Diesel very sweet as the ""brute"" Iron Giant, and Christopher McDonald terrific as the annoying paranoid Govt Agent Kent Mansley. In fact all the voice actors are terrific, and the movie is never dull, but cheerful and full of life thanks to them.The Iron Giant did not have success at the box office when first released, due to poor marketing and a lack of promotion, but it has proved to be one of the most charming, entertaining and lovable animation movies of all times, to be put together with Miyazaki's and other classics of animation because of the quality of its animation and story.A classic for both children and adults",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
one of the best of the modern animated movies,"Brad Bird's ""The Iron Giant"" is, in my opinion, a flawless and superb animated film that is well suited for the entire family. I saw it once in the theater and loved it from the start. A few years passed by before I saw it again and I loved it even before upon my second viewing. As I've gotten older, I've come to respect it even more for being a film of quality substance, excellent animation, humor, voice casting, and even great action sequences. It's a film that's not afraid to get violent from time to time, not even to show a tad bit of blood, but it doesn't go over its head to disturb the kiddies too much. That's why parents are recommended to view it with them.The animation designs of the characters and the voice actors who made them come to life verbally was absolutely perfect. The voice of Hogarth, our main human character, fitted very well with the animated design of the character. The character of Dean was just as good at being humorous and was not under-developed. The character of Kent Mansley, our main antagonist, was very well designed and acted. His overly large and forward-jutting eyebrows as well as his slender head and relatively calm voice was perfect for an animated villain. But who really steals the show is the Iron Giant himself, a giant hundred-foot-tall extra-terrestrial invention made of metal but containing a vast array of emotions, feelings, and thoughts somewhere within his several-ton metal body.Like I stated earlier, this film is not afraid to show a little violence or hard action. In fact, there's a lot of it. And it does not become overly powerful to be frightening, except maybe to young kids. Another thing is that it's not afraid to use a minimal amount of vulgar language, which is another reason why parental discretion is advised. But we have gunshots, explosions, and plenty of destruction on screen. But with no carnage. As far as I know, there is no body count in the entire film, which is appropriate. It makes the film suited for everybody.Aside from the action sequences, we have an extremely well-written storyline and plot. And it knows exactly which subplots of the film to emphasize and which ones to keep a minimal level, such as a small romantic subplot. It is shown enough to make the story compelling, but does not become too involved to distract us or slow the movie down. ""The Iron Giant"" almost seems a little bit too short for its brilliance, but nonetheless, it does play at a very reasonable running time.Bottom line, this is one of the best animated films there is out there. I highly recommend it for its brilliant animation styles, lovable characters, somewhat original plot, and overall style. It works out very well.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Perfect, jackpot, bullseye, 10/10.","I am 31 years old, i watched this movie the first time when i was around 26 and i still love this movie. It is made with heart and has a lot of messages while being entertaining at the same time.Im not a huge fan of the latest cartoon movies because they tend to have singing scenes in them, or some comedian sidekick that it suppose to be funny in some strange way.When everyone loved Hercules, i hated it. Sure... i liked Beauty & the Beast, but i didn't care much for the singing part of it. This movie, it is perfect in all aspects. Unless you are a fan of cartoon musicals. Then you'll hate it.The Iron Giant is a movie i will show my kids when they get old enough to watch it and understand it. But until that day, i will enjoy this movie myself several times.

It's not one of those sappy little kid movies...it really has meaning to it. Eli Marienthal was an excellent choice for the voice of Hogarth, also, and who knew that Vin Diesel could sound like a robot? I can't tell how many times I've watched this movie with my little brother now...it has to be on of the best animated movies ever created. It can get one very emotional also...::sigh:: I almost cried when the robot quoted Hogarth and went to stop the bomb.

Another ignored classic,"One of the most frustrating things about Disney's stranglehold on the animation industry is that when a truly great animated film does come along, fans ignore it in droves. Such a case is The Iron Giant. Many people are blaming its poor showing on Warner Bros lack of advertising, which is ridiculous. I dislike the idea that unless we're inundated with Happy Meal tie-ins and action figures, the film is under-advertised. There certainly was adequate advertising for this film; it simply wasn't in titanic Disney proportions.The Iron Giant is, no exaggeration, one of the best animated films of the last ten years. As a childhood fable, as a view of fifties foreign paranoia, as a statement on violence, it works perfectly. There isn't a single flawed scene from beginning to end. And it proves conclusively that animation can work without cute animal sidekicks or overwrought musical numbers; just a great story, brilliantly timed comedy, and some truly touching moments.The combination of cel animation and computer imagery is seamless, with each technique used to its best effect. The voice-acting is top-notch, with Christopher MacDonald particularly good as the paranoid government agent. Having not read the book myself, I can't vouch for the film's adherence to the original story, but I highly recommend it to any lover of animation.Incidentally, lest you think it's purely for children, I watched it with a group of men over thirty, and we all loved it. Let's hope this film gains the recognition on video it was denied in the theater. A solid 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
My review to use for your magazine.,"Set in a small town in Maine during the height of the cold war, this film is based on Ted Hughes' children's book ""The Iron Man"" and brought to you by The Simpsons' Brad Bird. It tells the story of a giant, amnesiac robot who falls to Earth, and is eventually befriended by a local boy, Hogarth Hughes. Hogarth must hide the robot from a paranoid government agent who suspects it a Soviet weapon of war. The truth is that the robot is indeed essentially a giant gun, but hails from a distant planet and bears unbelievable firepower! Ultimately, it is the friendship with the boy that brings out the robot's compassion and humanity, and saves the town from annihilation.I liked this film so much that after I saw it, I emailed everyone on my many contact lists and practically begged them to put on their shoes and hit the theatre to support this amazing film. Why should I care? Because I am an ardent believer in supporting cinematic--or any other--efforts that one feels strongly about. And I do feel strongly about this film. The Iron Giant is one of the finest, well-written, non-formulaic, intelligent pieces of animated film I have seen in a long long time, and I watch a lot of cartoons. At the time, just a few weeks after the film opened, it came to my attention that it was not doing so well at the box office. My bulk email was a modest campaign to boost awareness of the film, because in Hollywood there is just one truth: the success of a movie is based on its gross. If a piece of s**t movie does well, more piece of s**t movies like it will get made. Conversely, if an intelligent, well-written movie does not make its financial mark, that kind of movie will fall out of favour with the fatcats who make the decisions back at the studio. I personally would hate to see the entire genre suffer because The Iron Giant is recognized by a wanting dollar return and lack of ubiquitous Happy Meal tie-in claptrap. The Iron Giant is an inspiring movie that can be appreciated by adults for its genuine characters and solid story (not to mention its welcome lack of ill-placed Disneyesque singalongs) and by children for its well-executed animation and springboard for the imagination. If you can still find The Iron Giant in theatres, go see it (again). If not, it's coming out on video shortly.And if you don't want to take my word for it, I can send you the barrage of reply emails I received, with subject lines like ""Thanks for the great recommendation...I loved Iron Giant.""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A parable of the 90s set in the 50s,"When I first heard about this film, I assumed that it was just a kiddy movie. But then I heard that it was much better than the usual ""family film"" grool. I finally went and saw it, and I am glad I did.Combining elements of stories like ET, BLADE RUNNER, and WARGAMES, it is a great parable about anti-violence. Set during the paranoia of the 50s, it shows how humanity creates humanity and how violence creates just more violence. It has a message for the 90s and for all time. I am glad to hear a movie be so bold as to tell us the truth -- guns kill, and none of us have to be guns. We can be people.The animation in the film is beautiful with rich colors and believable characterization -- unlike the over-done wide-eyed stereotypes we keep getting in the assembly line Disney cartoons recently. This is a real family film -- both the kids and the adults can enjoy it. And to top it off, we have a robot who becomes a Christ figure. GO SEE IT!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderful for kids and adults,"Even years after its release, I still find The Iron Giant to be a captivating movie. Animated films are making a comeback to mainstream cinema, including Hollywood big-budget computer-generated films (Shrek, Toy Story, etc.) and ""westernized"" anime films (Spirited Away, Cowboy Bebop, and others). In the midst of this, I find the retro style of Iron Giant to be familiar and comfortable. The story is a straightforward one of friendship and growth, with an ending that speaks to love and sacrifice.

Not enough films like these.,"There simply aren't enough films (not movie, FILM) like this around today.  Much like this year's other great underdog, the Sixth Sense, the Iron Giant truly comes out of nowhere in a once commercialized or stupidized genre.  And both have similar storylines, namely about a boy who has something very special about him. In the film, young Hogarth Hughes of Rockwell, Maine, finds a giant robot in the woods behind his house.  With the robot apparently having lost his memory from a bump on his head, he befriends young Hogarth....actually, Hogarth befriends him. As most reviews have stated, there are no stupid Disney-used traits at all in this film.  NO dumb sidekicks, no stupid songs, and excellent characters, including the Giant himself.  Hogarth, his mother, and the rest, all feel and act like they should from their respective backgrounds.  So no one here is exceptionally heroic, or sarcastic. I have endless praise for this film.  It is bold and grand in every aspect.  It is my favorite film of all time, tied with the Matrix and South Park: Bigger, Longer, And Uncut. And on one last note, it would be a tragedy if this fine film is overlooked by other underdogs from this year such as the Sixth Sense and....well, so far, these are the only 2 movies this year that I have seen (with the possible exceptions of south park and the matrix) that deserve to be nominated this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Inspiring,"Scrolling through the comments for ""The Iron Giant,"" I found so much praise for this simple, beautiful film that it seems unnecessary to add another glowing review. So why am I writing one anyway? Because it's the kind of special movie you feel compelled to rave about, no matter how many others have already done so.What Disney has done to animated film the past decade is evil. They've churned out increasingly soulless, formulaic movies that exist solely to bleed every last penny from parents. They take their children to the theater, pick up cheap tie-in toys at the fast food joint, trek to the toy store for more shoddy ancillary crap, and buy the video so their little drones can sledgehammer the pointless sludge that Disney has to gall to call entertainment into their skulls by watching it 72 times. (Not that it bugs me or anything.)Thankfully, ""The Iron Giant"" is the complete opposite of all this. A quiet, touching film filled with delights both large and small, its heart is as big as its brain. It's got a gentle, thoughtful essence that most movies of any kind simply lack.I am late 20s with no kids, and rather cynical (if the Disney rant didn't clue you in). I watched this film with my wife, and we both melted. If you have kids, this is a must-see. Even if you don't, I still recommend it. It's clever, well-written, thought-provoking, and it will resonate with anyone who has a sense of humor and empathy. Give this film 90 minutes and it will give you reason to believe that there are still people who use animation to make something special, not just make a profit.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
OOPS!!!  Nearly Forgot,"** I don't know that this is allowed; if it is, it's a P.S. that goes with my other comment made just a few minutes previously.  I forgot to mention two of my favourite scenes in the movie.  One is when Paranoia-stricken and completely insufferable Government entity  Kent Mansley appears on the scene of a chomped-up transformer substation. After a few infuriatingly condescending remarks to the locals and jotting a few scathing remarks into a tiny notebook, he gets into his car to drive off, presumably to find the ""Big Stuff"" he was only just so helpfully (?) explaining to the locals. ** It's at this point that he discovers exactly half the passenger side of his vehicle has been bitten off and he jumps 10 feet or so out the driver's door, producing a noise that sounded a lot like ""ohmyGOD!!!!""Before he can make a coherent further statement the rest of the car disappears, apparently meeting an identical fate (the Giant must have been a bit peckish at the time). ** The other was when the Giant imitates Hogarth's rather unimpressive ""Banzai!"" leap into the lake and, of course, causes a fair-sized tidal wave. ** I happened to notice Dean McCoppin, sitting on a bench behind the inevitable newspaper, was still sitting in, and holding onto, his bench while being tumbled round by the water and watching an intersting display of fish swim by. ** He finally lands in the middle of he road, looking rather like a drowned cat.  A truck pulls up just then and a brief exchange ensues:""Hey!""  Without turning his head Dean looks askance at the truck driver and says carefully: ""Yeah?"" The driver then says, somewhat unnecessarily, ""You're sitting in the middle of the road!"" Without moving even slightly Dean again answers identically, except with considerably more force: ""YEAH??""  At which point the driver mutters ""Allright..."" and drives off. ** The second time I saw this scene I cracked up laughing.  You really just simply MUST see this movie -- period.  You'll have no idea what you're missing otherwise.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
delightful,"A young boy befriends a metal-eating giant from outer space. With the help of a beatnik scrapyard owner, he takes on a government agent filled with Cold War paranoia in order to save their iron friend. The Iron Giant is funny, thoughtful and has heart. The script respects the intelligence of young and old, and the under-90 minutes running time attests to the brisk pace and judicious lack of exposition. Our hero Hogarth has a child-like curiosity about his new friend, and a fierce loyalty, all the while keeping sentimentality in check. A quasi-religious theme is lightly threaded through, and an anti-war message is more more strongly foregrounded. But none of these elements detract from an engaging tale of a young boy who is bullied at school looking out for his new-found friend. A good example of what animation can achieve when the screenplay is considerate of its audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It's not your typical cartoon, but it's not Heavy Metal either...","I thought it was great.  There was actually a lot of adult humor mixed into the story, which was a nice touch.  I liked it a lot, actually.  The animation was great, and the Giant himself was incredible to watch.  The animators did a great job of making him appear absolutely enormous, but not threatening.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A classic,"I thoroughly enjoyed this animated film.While there are a few things I did not think were perfect they are too nit-picky to even mention.The moral messages were a bit heavy handed but over all what was being said was valid.I do wonder if a children's movie can be made any more without some kind of moral hitting you over the head.The characters were quite appealing and the story line is extremely well done.It does have you on the edge of your seat wondering just how it will all end.Some of the messages it imparted were a bit heavy handed for adult audiences -- and I do not think that kids would understand the whole ""Duck and Cover"" routine.  In some ways I think it tries a bit to hard to appeal on a cross-generational level.But all being said I did enjoy this movie and what it was saying to anyone that saw and understood it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
If it weren't for the animation I would give it a 10!!,"Which is basically it. When you compare this type of animation with (dare I even mention it) Disney you feel quite let down. The people are unrealistic but this can be tolerated because they are stylised, which is fine if you like that sort of thing. Some of the backgrounds ARE beautiful especially the sea and snow, it is also nice to see how the weather and seasons slowly change throughout the film.The main problem (as I see it) is that some objects, especially the cars and quite noticeably the tractor looks 2 dimensional. This is the first time I have ever noticed this on ANY movie. I suppose it is because the quality of animation does not match the background.The actual robot is computer animated but because he is put into a movie with low quality animation you simply don't notice it, instead the robot looks like he was drawn with great care by a skilled animator (with normal animation) and then placed in TV quality animation.But I am afraid I am just being picky the quality of animation is unlike don Bluth or Disney but it is effective. After 10 or 20 minutes you forget about the animation and fall in love with the story.This is one movie where the STORYLINE TOOK PLACE OVER THE EFFECTS AND ANIMATION. Which is a nice change especially since the horrible trash Disney produced last year with Tazan. This is what made it such a pleasure to watch.It is a touching film in which I dare anyone to view and not feel compassion for the giant robot with a big heart. The animators did a noticeably good job at making a ridged iron face show warmth and love .(WARNING THE NEXT FEW LINE MAY CONTIAN MINOR SPIOLERS DEPENDING ON YOUR OWN POINT OF VIEW)The part when he prodded the dead dear and when he thought the boy was dead was quite frankly a masterpiece of effort. It is this sort of atmosphere that so many modern animated films lack. The LAND BEFORE TIME showed this depth of sadness and it can be seen with this film as well. To really enjoy a happy ending you must first feel sadness and pain. This is how I feel anyway a sad part in a film is essential for getting it's audience to care about it's characters.I gave this movie 9 out of 10, because I really do think the quality of animation (not the style the quality) could have been improved.But the best comment I can make on this movie is this- I asked my little 7 year old brother whether he liked the movie or not and he said `I WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN' . He had never said that about any movie he has seen. So I can think of no higher praise for such a brilliant movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
An underrated classic from W.B. Animation and Brad Bird,"W.B. Animation is one of the less-successful animated companies because most of their films were box-office bombs. But they did make three classics, the first one was, ""Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm"", the second one was, ""Cat's Don't Dance"", and the third one was, ""The Iron Giant"".The plot is just like, ""E.T."", except instead of an alien, it's a giant robot from Outer Space voiced by Vin Diesel. What I love about this movie is that it has great animation, some funny moments, the voice acting was good, and the movie also has some nice references to the Cold War.There's nothing else to say about this film. But if you're looking for a good animated film to watch. ""The Iron Giant"", is worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beautifully animated, enjoyable, meaningful movie","Having heard great things about The Iron Giant, I decided to get it myself and watch it.  What I saw was a wonderful event of animation, with plenty of depth and imagination.Animation has come a long way from the days of the old Looney Tunes and Disney cartoons, and now with The Iron Giant we have a seamless merging between traditional 2D animation and 3D animation, with the Giant being fully animated in 3D.  The result was the most visually stunning animation I have seen in a while.The Iron Giant had a great story to it (being based on the book by Ted Hughes), one that was meaningful and one that allowed interaction with the viewer to use their imagination (there are questions which are not answered, you really have to use your imagination).  All the voice performances were exceptional, and really added to the characters in the film, instead of making them one-dimensional.  The Giant in particular had a lot more emotion then you'd expect from a giant robot made from iron.This is the best animated film I have seen since The Lion King, it had everything in it, from laughter to drama, from happiness to sadness (the ending brought tears to my eyes).  This is an animated feature not only for kids, but for anyone of any age.  It's a shame it wasn't given the exposure it deserved, it probably would have done a lot better at the box office.  If you're a fan of animation, or you just want to see a great family film, you have to see this.  I give it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
More than a film...an experience!,"Think about the first time you saw the original Star Wars, or E.T., or whatever movie kept you glued to the seat in awe...your heart in your throat, and your mind totally transported to another place.  This is what ""The Iron Giant"" was like for me.  This movie is made for all of us 20-something animation junkies who have been caving an intelligent, fun, emotional trip to another era.  Parents who take their children to see this masterpiece will get so much more out of it than the tykes will.  I think people who remember the early stages of the cold war (which I don't, I wasn't around yet) will watch this film with a nostalgic eye, while those of us who remember the last stages of the Vietnam War will see analogies to the anti-war sentiment of the time.  Their are many metaphors spread throughout the course of the film, giving everyone something relevant to the era of their upbringing.  Do yourself a favor, and catch this one at a later showing, you'll want to avoid all of the kiddies who's parents are too rude to keep quiet...then take your favorite niece or nephew to a matinee (but be kind enough to make them view the film respectfully and quietly).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
High-water mark for animated films,"Simply put, this is the finest animated film I've seen.  Hell, this is almost a perfect movie.

A Giant Classic!,"I have been dumbstruck by the lack of attention this gem of a movie has been getting.  It is easily the best animated movie I have seen since Beauty and the Beast and the best movie I have seen this year.  It accomplishes this by setting out on a different trek from Disney.  The story is kept moving along without the now obligatory song and dance routines and goofy sidekicks perfected by the Mouse.  Instead the animators rely on a carefully crafted script and characterization.  The main morals of the movie are ""You are what you choose to be"" and an anti-violence message that seem particularly pertinant in this year of classroom horrors.  As the director Brad Bird has said ""what if a gun had a soul and chose not to be a gun.""  Overall, a stirring and timely classic that will stay with viewers long after they have left the theatre.  I dare say, worthy of Oscar recognition for best picture of the year.  Not to be missed!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Glorious,"I love good children's films.  They are one of the few genres left where writers, actors, and directors feel safe to tell a story in ways that honor both an audience's intelligence and desire for entertainment.  I loved *Charlotte's Web,* I loved *Babe,* I loved *Fly Away Home* and now I'm happy to love *The Iron Giant,* which goes on my shelf to have on hand whenever my friends, both children and adult, come for a night at the movies at my home.As we were leaving the theater, my friend said ""I wish it'd been made 20 years ago"" and I agree.  At the suggestion that the family find a fallout shelter once the nuclear missile is aimed at the Giant, Dean sadly replies that ""It doesn't matter...no shelter can protect us.""  And Hogarth tells his friend ""We're all going to die.""  Using the old ""duck and cover"" cartoon is brilliant: what a contrast between that moment of boundless optimism, and the end, when reality hits!  For that reason, and for the love that so evident here between all the major characters, I wish I'd grown up with this movie.  In an ever more violent America, I wish there was just one other release this year with a line like ""You choose who you are.  You can choose *not to be a gun.*""  One of my favorite films this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A True Classic,"I dismissed this movie altogether when it was first released in theaters. Basically it looked another pointless adventure film aimed for kids about a boy who encounters a robot and have to run from a bad guy.

Kill a few hours, enjoy the evening.I was quite surprised at what I discovered.I never expected to encounter such a rich story with beautiful animation, three dimensional characters -- even the antagonist wasn't your run of the mill cliché. I especially loved the intelligent dialogue that provided sharp insight into Cold War and even modern day paranoia. And the climax...just not something no one but Brad Bird and his team would have the cajones to put into a kids film.Many have harped on the marketing and I am piling on, Warner Bros. screwed up royally.

This Iron Giant Will Touch Your Heart And Move Your Soul,"What a wonderful story this cartoon tells. The Iron Giant tells the tale of a young boy who comes in contact with a Giant Robot from outer space. As the robot is trying to feed himself with powerline girders, he's tangled up in the live wired and unable to escape. The frightened boy (Huglow Hughes) rescues him. What follows from that point is true friendship, lessons of war, anger, parenthood, and the bound between a boy a Giant Robot with incredible capabilities. This movie is great family entertainment and should be seen with your kids or parents. Basing this story in the 1950's was a great idea, since war was just itching to happen and people didn't really have a whole lot back then. A little boy and his Mother just getting by in a small town of Roswell, ME really shows that adventure and the love of life can be found anywhere you go. The seen with the deer dying and the explanation of guns killing people were right on target. Yes, guns don't kill people. People kill people, but with GUNS. The NRA may not like this movie, but the fact that it shows parents and kids alike that guns can cause violence and bad things to happen is perfect in this day in age.

Fantastic Film!,"The Iron Giant is an underrated animation film and is just plain excellent, more so than it ever has a right to be. On paper, it's practically an animated version of E.T, but the film works despite the non-original story. It is full of substance and style with an underlying political commentary that will appeal to the adults. The kids will love the gorgeous animation (very good for a 1999 film) and the story about an unlikely friendship. I haven't seen this in many, many years until recently, but it was always one of my childhood standouts.Brad Bird's earliest theatrical film is about a kid named Hogarth befriends a giant robot from another world, during the height of the Cold War and the launch of Sputnik. Hogarth tries to protect the giant-sized robot not only from his mother, but also from a bunch of bureaucrats believing the giant is actually a spy for the Soviet Union.The voice acting is not that bad. The robot does not speak English at first, but when he does, it was voiced by Vin Diesel who made the robot seem even more lifelike. We also have some solid voice acting from the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., and Eli Marienthal.Overall, The Iron Giant is one of those rare gems that appeal to both adults and children. The story is executed well enough against the backdrop of political and historical issues and the film is also a visual spectacle with the animation way beyond its time. Who cannot resist a film among the veins of ET, especially one that is good as this. It's a beautiful, must-see film. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really impressive and vastly superior to a lot of other animated films.,"I liked The Iron Giant, I liked it a lot. The film, surely, has to be recognised as one of the last, great two dimensional animated films that the Americans made at the back end of an era. If we formally acknowledge that the new 'era' of animation is, or was, from 1999 onwards predominantly three dimensional from an American perspective, then this is the last great film of that time. Here is an animated film that does not rely on purely the visual, even if they are as impressive as they need to be and opts for story telling and emotional involvement more than anything else. Sprinkle on a little bit of Cold War paranoia and you have The Iron Giant, a period set character study of a human being and a creature not of this world.The film is one of which it is difficult to not just sit there, and stare in both wonder but more importantly appreciation at what's being presented to you. While both colourful and atmospheric, I was most impressed with director Brad Bird's attention to character detail when it came to the animation. It's the little things; the way in which the Iron Giant himself moves around in the manner in which he does. The Iron Giant is big and hulking but its presence is juxtaposed with the very fragile and delicate relationship he has with a young boy, who is established to be pretty desperate for a friend or companion early on. The Giant's presence and traits are comparable to the only villainous character of the piece, an F.B.I. agent who's grossly smaller than The Giant but seems more threatening despite the height difference and jolts about in an urgent and jittery manner giving off an entirely different feeling to that of the large, lumbering but friendly robot.Bird's work here reminded me of Nick Park's Wallace and Gromit series, a series which I feel has since partly been inspired by The Iron Giant. There is that knowing feeling behind the production; that setting in the past and that referencing to what the filmmaker enjoys or grew up enjoying, indeed The Iron Giant's tag-line is 'It came from outer space!', maybe a nod to Hollywood science fiction films of the 1950s and 60s that dealt with the fear of impending Communist-related invasions. The link is uncanny  a giant robot the most antagonistic character of the film, believed to be Russian, sent to 'the good ol' U.S.A.' in order to destroy the nation from within.The hero of the title is a nine year old boy named Hogarth Hughes (Marienthal) and lives with his mother Annie (Aniston) and in a desperate attempt to prolong some sort of relationship with another being other than his mother, he brings home little animals not exactly fit for household domestication. The establishment introduces this fact and acts as a good introduction to post-modern artist, working in a time not ready for the post-modern, Dean McCoppin (Connick Jr.) who's a friend and ally for them later on. After some other initial events, a large robot voiced by Vin Diesel, who merely has to supply some grunts and other such noises that eventually turn into synthesised words, comes into contact with Hogarth and they strike up a friendship following a train-wreck.Enter F.B.I. agent Kent Mansley, played by Christopher McDonald in the sort of slimy role you'd associate with him, in all his paranoid glory. I think initially, we don't really mind if Mansley gets his prize. He makes some enquiries and asks about but he's just doing his job. We know about as much about it as he does and it hasn't really earned its place in our hearts but it's not until Bird brilliantly brings together both the Giant's friendship with the boy and Kent's gradual obsession with the capturing of the robot until we veer more into a thought process that demands we don't want to see him get his man.Echoing what Bird sets up at the beginning, The Giant acts as a fatherly figure for Hogarth; wearing a constant smile on his face and vastly becoming one of the friendliest non-human components to a relationship involving children we've seen on screen. From the Cold War era sci-fi films of the 1950s onwards to Spielberg's E.T. and Cameron's second Terminator film, the referencing and inspirations flow and flow. Additionally, the other feelings I got amidst all this harked way back to comedy of the silent era and the use of heartfelt music and shots of character's reactions while humorous exchanges were played out  it seems Bird's knowledge and love of cinema-past knows no end.Despite this phenomenon of a giant robot landing on Earth and a child taking a likening to it, the film looks at the identity of the robot more than it does anyone else. As a grey and hulking thing, is possesses neither the colour to place it into any particular category nor the necessary intelligence to place it within another. What reminded me of the second Terminator film apart from the obvious fatherly connotations was the scene in which the boy teaches it the difference between good and evil, and the poor kid uses all the facilities available to him, which peak at mere comic books, to give this creature some sort of identity and how he can be 'good' like Superman instead of 'bad' like the typical 'destroy the world' aliens  perhaps a reference to more recent blockbusters like Independence Day which rely on flashy visuals, hostile aliens and zero logic. The Iron Giant is the opposite of this and is vastly superior. Towards the end, there is one lump in the throat moment and I don't think the immediate ending does the film a disservice. The Iron Giant is truly a special animation for children and adults alike.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The One That Matters,"More of a retrospective commentary than a review; what follows is completely spoiler-free in terms of plot points, but is intended as an admiring post-script annotation to the film's thematic legacy and resonance.The Iron's Giant is simply the best animated feature ever made and one of the most subtly sophisticated conscience driven ""films"" in all of Cinema. In addition to the elegant old-school cell animation, wonderful adventure, and truthful humor -- auteur Brad Bird's tour-de-force quietly and magnificently emerges as much more than just another innocuous warm-hearted family friendly diversion.Set in cold-war paranoia & post nuclear Rockwellian/Capra-esque New England/Americana nostalgia, this all-time classic gem -- with sublime eloquence and earnest maturity -- beautifully dignifies powerfully principled pronouncements on prejudice, xenophobia, alienation, anti-authoritarianism, nonviolence, and moral identity; Of lonely boyhood reverie and single-working-mother/son repport; surrogate family in father figures, secret bonds & empathetic brotherhoods; tolerance, compassion, free will, devotion, sacrificial love, and the nature of consciousness and the concept of a spiritual soul. But far from heavy-handed frothy proselytizations, it wisely finesses those virtues subtextually into the nuances while rendering a completely involving fantasy story of a boy coming of age through a symbiotic relationship with an otherworldly friend that rivals Spielberg's ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial"" in pure exhilarating enchantment! This movie is all lunch-boxes, no soap-boxes.Perhaps The Iron Giant's most profound platform however is the bitterest pill: running against the modern hedonistic zeitgeist of coddled indulgence and fickle fluidity to shrug, ""The Iron Giant"" gracefully drives its primary message that each sentient individual of seminal volition is autonomously responsible for the decisions that ultimately define their position as a cognizant being. Regardless of birth or influence, every conscious entity with the capability to express love or hate beyond self preservation, has the self-agented obligation in full context of their ethical effect upon the existing morale they help mold to mindfully choose what and who they are -- even at the rejection of core inclination. It's the total opposite to excusing one's self because of proclivity. In this life each Soul is sole, but the lone quest to find purpose through harmonization, because all are connected beyond the dirt we return to, and everything counts, every attitude ripples, and every action reveberates. No one who is able, can dismiss that ability by citing implement or impediment as the deciding factor to their path. It doesn't espouse the total embrace of what one wants most, but rather the total thoughtfulness to what wants most from one -- what is right and worthy of one's ""oneness"", and where one fits into carrying that through for the sake of togetherness.Disney will glorify the vapid virtue of ""being yourself"", while The Iron Giant will implore the existential ethic to find yourself by being beyond just yourself. The high-road will always be up-hill, but ""you are who you choose to be"".In empathetic powers, anyone can resolve to become ""Super"" by submitting to a supreme ethos/pathos/logos which reciprocates the sacrifice of superficial selfishness with the significance of synthesis in shared sacredness.Who you choose to be is dependent on what you will choose to service.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great film,"I'll tell you, no film this year will tug your heartstrings like this one. It's animation, but not directed at kids so much as both kids and adults. My family and friends couldn't understand why I wanted to see this.  I cried my eyes out at the ending, the same way I do every year when I see It's A Wonderful Life.  It's a shame a pedestrian film like Blair Witch is getting so much attention, when you have a FILM like this being overlooked.  See it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I Should've Listened To My Nephew...,"Back in 1999, when ""The Iron Giant"" was first released, several friends of mine, aware of my love for 1950s sci-fi films, urged me to go see this movie. For some reason, I passed. A few years later, another friend's 4-year-old son told me what a great video this was, but I still declined to watch it. And even later, when my own nephew (then 6) told me what a hilarious scene he'd just witnessed in ""The Iron Giant"" (the one in which young Hogarth drinks espresso and starts talking a mile a minute)...well, even then, I still ignored the advice. Anyway, all the above folk will be happy to hear that I finally DID watch this animated sci-fi film last night, and found it absolutely charming. Featuring wonderful animation, nice touches of warmth and humor, and wry commentary on '50s paranoia and A-bomb lunacy, the film really does have appeal to young and old. Lovers of sci-fi and/or action films should especially enjoy the film's latter scenes, in which the lovable Giant gets ticked off and morphs into an unstoppable killing machine. My hat is certainly off to everyone involved in the making of this most entertaining film. And this ""special edition"" DVD, filled with more extras than you can imagine, certainly does live up to the advertising. Hmmm...maybe I SHOULD take my nephew's advice and finally rent out his favorite movie, ""Toy Story 2""...",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great movie whose only fault was the distribution,WB distribution fell big time with this movie;  This movie could have sold two or three times more tickets with good publicity.  It is a movie you would be glad to take to see with your children and recommend to your friends.  I saw it twice at the theatre and the last movie I saw twice was Matrix because my wife did not have a chance to see it.  Definitely a buy recommendation and not one where I will wait for the video store to sell the used ones.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best animated films ever.,"Critics have raved about this movie, but audiences have been missing it. Too bad.  On the whole, the quality of Hollywood films have been on a huge downturn.  Huge, loud blockbuster films that are empty and boring.  But here's a Warner Bros. animated film that has heart, style, and all the right ingredients to become a classic.  It's already been compared to E.T. (lonely boy finds and takes care of alien), but this is no melodramatic sentimental Spielberg film.  This is fun!  Sure the kids will like it, but I bet I enjoyed it more than any of the kids in the theater.  One of the best animated films ever, and yes, more fun than Star Wars:  Episode 1.  Don't miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A magnificent movie.,"This is a wonderfully satisfying movie.  Everything is on spot.  The humor, the personalities of the characters, and the surprisingly sophisticated moral message. I have never felt so satisfied and so eager to see a movie again, since I saw the original Star Wars.I only hope that others notice this movie and pass the word along. It is apparently doing very badly in the box office, and I fear that if it bombs, animation companies might steer clear of this level of movie-making If you've not already seen this movie, then I urge you to watch it. If you have seen the movie, then you're already telling everybody about how great it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Hero With A Thousand Pieces,"Like all great stories The Iron Giant works on a number of different levels. In the simplest sense, it's a first-rate adventure story for kids with a nice balance of action and humor. There's a ""moral"" to the story but very little actual moralizing and none of the groan-inducing variety. The artwork and the music use familiar elements without falling into cliché.But there's more. The Iron Giant also works as a re-telling of myth, combining elements as old as storytelling itself. In Joseph Campbell's landmark book, The Hero With A Thousand Faces, he shows how certain themes are constantly recurring in mythology, religion, psychology and literature. Campbell's work leans heavily on the writings of Carl Jung, who believed that these ideas are part of our human heritage and understood on a deeper level (often without our awareness). While this may seem like a lot of baggage to be strapping onto 90 minutes of family entertainment, it works. Furthermore, poet Ted Hughes, the writer of the story on which the film is (loosely) based, knew his mythology as well.While a small book could be written on the themes running through The Iron Giant it's important to avoid the ""this = that"" sort of allegory found in Cliff Notes and high school English courses. The giant does not ""stand for"" this or that figure in religion or myth. There are elements of Osiris, the Egyptian figure whose body is scattered and re-assembled and Iron John, from the European folk tale collected by the Brothers Grimm and the subject of Robert Bly's generally misunderstood book. There are lots of interesting twists on the classic themes. The character of ""Dean"" functions partly in the Iron John role and partly as the Old Wise Man. This figure is often a wizard in folklore (think of Merlin or Gandalf) but the writers turned him into a twenty-something Beatnik sculptor. The list goes on and we haven't even mentioned Hogarth.If this all seems a bit too much like a Required Reading list or a homework assignment ignore this and see the movie. If, however, this all sounds interesting, read Joseph Campbell and see the movie. Ten or twelve times.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Iron Giant feels more human, the animation really doesn't matter when you realise how awesome this movie's story is. It's really doing great here in Mexico and I'm kinda glad, because it's the kind of movie everyone should see. The final sequence is so sad you won't help the tears falling from your eyes.

"""What if a gun had a soul and chose not to be a weapon?""","""What if a gun had a soul and chose not to be a weapon?""That is the one sentence summery of ""The Iron Giant"" that director Brad Bird uses to capsule the concept of his new film. I saw it last night and my head has been so busy with thinking about it that I just had to sit down and send a quick note to my friends to let you know how wonderful a movie it is. It has so much love and care put into every frame and it shows. The characters are nicely fleshed out, the voice performances are wonderful, the themes of the film are so seamlessly sewn into story that it never feels preachy and most importantly, it is 100% entertaining. I went into the movie with extremely high expectations having heard others rave about it. I felt sure that I would be let down some because of the hype. Not for a moment. I was pulled in from frame one and was taken into this little boy's world until the very end. It does not pander to kids and it does not try to be cleaver with a wink-of-the-eye towards adults. The message that this story, set in Maine in 1957, brings to America in 1999 cannot be ignored.You do not need a child to accompany you to see this film but when I walked out of the theatre I was trying to think of nieces, nephews, neighbor kids, or anyone who could provide me an excuse to see it again. If you were already going to see ""The Iron Giant"" (or have already seen it) that is great. However, if reading this has put you one step closer to seeing a film that you were going to pass on then I am glad.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Genuine sentiment without corn,"Like all high quality animations, this is a movie for kids and adults.  The vividly drawn relationship between the giant and the boy is the most...human...and touching (without being maudlin) that I can remember in recent years, and that includes both children's films and so-called adult drama.  For that reason, maybe, it drew genuine emotion out of me, something that hasn't happened since I first saw Barry Lyndon (of all things) years ago.It's sad that Disney has such a stranglehold on the genre. I was so grateful that there was not a single syrupy pop song in this movie that on the strength of that alone I might award it a ""10"" on IMDb.  But fortunately, Iron Giant succeeds more for what it is than what it isn't.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The characters were realistic, the animation was beautiful, and the plot was good enough to hold my three year-old's attention as well as my own.  And I figure that, eventually, I will be able to watch the ending without bawling.  Also, I liked the anti-gun message behind the film, and how simply it was rendered.Do yourself a favor.

"take your kids, your parents, your friends.... take everybody.","Wow, I don't know where to start.  The Iron Giant is a fantastic film that transcends animation.  That is, it could've been done live action, but it wouldn't have worked as well as it does as a cartoon.  This movie is absolutely amazing.  I urge everybody who hasn't seen it to go see it immediately.  Probably the most moving film I've ever seen.  The ending ranks right up there with the endings of ""Sling Blade"" and ""One False Move"" for pure emotional power.  When the movie ended, I looked around and saw people everywhere in the audience dabbing their eyes.  On the way out of the theater, a father and his six year old son walked hand in hand.  The father was using his other hand to wipe tears from his cheeks.  That in itself speaks volumes for this movie.  Despite this being animation, it's a film for everybody.  And I don't mean that in a ""this is a film for the whole family"" kinda way.  You don't even have to HAVE a family to enjoy this one. I'm shocked by The Iron Giant.

"The ""E.T."" of Animated Robot Films.","I don't know what was wrong with me.  Why did it take me so long to see this wonderful film?  ""Iron Giant"" is one of the the most intelligent, touching, feel-good animated films to come out in a LONG time.  For that matter, why didn't anyone see this film last Summer?  A wonderful story with a great voice cast and entertaining story.  The Giant is simply an amazing character.  Not for his technical gadgets, but for his range of expressions and the ability to become thoroughly engrossed with his adventure.The messages in this film, from the ""Red Scare"" sentiments, to discussing death, freedom to be who you are, and the a little boy's perspective of what a soul is make this deeper than any recent Disney film that comes to mind. The robot's desire to be a hero like Superman really tugged at the old emotions on my part.  The robot, even in his darker moment, was truly an innocent.I hope the low box office sales don't scare Warner Brothers off from trying something like this again.

Best animated movie ever,"I recently saw The Iron Giant: Signature Edition at my local cinema. As a young kid, I cried when watching this film. As a 31 year old, I still cried when watching the re-release. This is the only animated film that has made me react emotionally. Not even my favorite Disney film Beauty and the Beast made me cry. So for people who dismiss animated films as ""kids stuff"", you are wrong. In my opinion, this is the greatest animated film ever made, and I'm glad that as time has gone on, it status has grown. It under performed back in 1999, due to bad marketing and competing films of the time, but it's now regarded as one of the all-time greatsSimpsons veteran Brad Bird has been one of my favorite directors for a long time, and this, along with Ratatouille is one of my favorites of his films. The film's score is fantastic too. The animation is amazing, the voice acting is brilliant. And I'm a sucker for a film set in the 50s.If I have to pick one thing I didn't like, it was the reinstated dream sequence for the signature edition, where we scenes of his home world. I felt it demystified the origin of the giant, whereas the original kept it ambiguous. But that's a minor quibble. If you can make a cartoon film that makes me laugh, cry and get emotionally invested, you've done a fine job.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
LEGEND,"Probably my top 5 or 3 favorite movies. Its such an emotional, touching and superb movie. Iron Giant Does not get the acknowledgement that it deserves.The story is about some Alien Robot Landing on Earth where it is discovered by a boy then the typical evil yet good guys called the government most step in and ruin lives.TIG was one of the most underrated movies of all time. I know I may say it often, Nevertheless The Iron Giant is probably the most underrated, ignored and forgotten about movies.The animation, story, characters, soundtrack was so great. I almost cried. Jokes, but I surely did this movie did have an emotional vibrational effect on me.Besides its tiny appearance in Ready Player 1 I'm not sure if it's a good thing a sequel/remake/tv show has not been made. I say this because current movies/tv shows in the last 15 years have been mostly hash. Take away the MCU and there is nothing putting people in the seats.The Iron Giant was a beautiful movie.What can be learned?

This is definitely one of my favorite movies.,"I really liked this movie. I would have to call it one of the best animated films ever. Yes, I'm including those made by Disney too. Now, I love Disney movies, don't get me wrong, but this movie has a different quality to it. Instead of having song-and-dance numbers, or slap-stick animal characters, it's just a movie. It's like a normal live-action type movie, but everything is drawn instead. I love the medium of animation, because you can do so much with it. The special effects blended much better with the hand-drawn animation in this movie, then I've seen anywhere else. In many recent animated movies, it seems like the characters are drawn into a background where they don't belong, or even fit in. This movie has restored my faith in Warner Brothers Animation. The story was wonderful, the voice artistry wasn't over-done, and the animation was nearly flawless.

This is the best of children animated films,"My nephews live in a town that has one of those 2nd-run movie theaters. This week it was Iron Giant and I really didn't think I'd want to sit through this movie.  My nephews, ages 9 & 7 insisted they wanted to see it, not because it was the rage of all the kids (no one heard of it), but because it was just playing at the theater and was a cartoon.Boy was I surprised.  I went into this movie thinking I'd catch a quick nap and instead I was captivated by this incredible movie.  Not only did my nephews love it, but so did I.  It was a great plot with an excellent storyline/moral.  Great animation too! It's not a fluke that this move has an 8.7 rating at IMDB, it should probably go higher.  Compared to some of the latest offerings from Disney, this movie outshines most of them (It was head and shoulders above Disney's Tarzan and Dreamwork's Prince of Egypt).

Terrific Animated Take on 1950's Sci Fi,"Unlike most folks I know I really like Pete Townsend's ""Iron Giant"" album. It inspired me to get the Ted Hughes' book and read it to my kids, who really liked it.The animation in the movie is terrific (except for the faces, which are distractingly bland, especially the kid).There was clearly a dig at Disney by opening with an ocean storm as most Disney animation starts with that (i.e. ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Tarzan,"" etc.) or maybe animators just like doing storms.This is done very much like ""Day the Earth Stood Still,"" a throw-back to old '50's sci fi films with a dash of ""The X Files,"" including a satire of Fox Mulder's character. There's references kids won't get, like the ""Duck and Cover"" cartoons, Sputnik and general Cold War paranoia, which I remember quite well.Nice that there's actually some sympathetic adults in this, especially the sculptor/junk yard dealer where the Giant hangs out.But I did miss Townsend's music, even if they bought him off with a producer credit.(originally written 8/22/1999)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Film Gem,"Once in a great while a movie is released that reminds filmgoers just how powerful the medium can be.  ""The Iron Giant"" is one such film.  The fact that it is animated only adds to its magic.  The animation is absolutely superb, strongly rivaling Disney's best.  The screenplay is wonderful, all of the characters are incredibly three-dimensional (something which, alas, I have a difficult time saying about the most recent Disney films), and the voice-over acting is simply the best ever.  The young boy who voiced the character of Hogarth Hughes is a true talent - his voice coupled with Hogarth's animator's drawing prowess gives the audience the best depiction of a young person ever.  Hogarth is very honest and real-to-life, from his innocent romping and make-believe sessions to his deepest and most heartfelt emotions; at no point in the film does director Brad Bird patronize youth. Hogarth is unabashedly human and not a ""boy as he should be"" caricature. Not since Elliot in ""E.T."" has a young character been so real.The character of the Iron Giant is so well drawn - both visually and emotionally - that I often had to remind myself that he was not a living, breathing human being.  In fact, the magic and mystery of this film is the fact that it took a character of cold metal and made it more human than the average person one sees walking down the street.  The Giant is a wonderful symbol of modern man and the beautiful heart that is still within him, albeit buried deeply beneath layers of materialism and aggression.  This movie is a great reminder of man's true nature - ""souls don't die"" - and the possibility that, with the help of the Hogarth Hughes within him, he will discover the Superman he truly is.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Somewhat Flawed Gem,"I recently saw this movie again on TV and my opinion hasn't changed on it one bit. A small masterpiece in every way...except for the politically-correct (read: heavy-handed) way that guns are portrayed. It somewhat bothered me in the theatre, and seeing it on TV only reinforced the feeling. The only instances of gun use in the movie, including the toy one that Hogarth uses, were correct and not objectionable in the least. But the writers just had to hammer their point home.Oh, well. I found the movie a rare gem and still cannot understand why it wasn't a smash. Maybe it was over a lot of heads. I even bought a copy, despite the not-so-subtle messages. Buy it when you find it. It's definitely worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Brilliant, Touching Tale","Can it be that the best film of 1999 is....a CARTOON?  I would have to say yes.  This is perhaps the best animated feature in the past 10 years (or maybe even further back than that.)  What makes it so great?  First of all, it is a visual marvel.  The film contained some of the smoothest animation ever, with CG elements flawlessly incorporated into the traditional elements.  Vibrant colors and wonderfully expressive characters make the movie much more than a cartoon - it is merely animated life. 	The story is a gem.  The hypothetical question ""what if a gun had a soul?"" lies at the heart of the plot, and issues, of spirituality, redemption, and sacrifice make the plot much more substantive than anything Disney churns out to make a quick buck.  There are parts where I actually teared up.  Yes, I admit it, a strapping young man such as myself actually cries at films if they deserve it, and this one does.  The fact that very few people actually saw this film is very upsetting to me.  It is the perfect movie for parents to take their children to, because not only will their children be wildly entertained by the endearing, larger-than-life title character, but they as parents will also enjoy a rich movie experience - thanks to a script which pokes fun at Cold War hysteria and propaganda, among other things. 	This review might ramble, but let's wrap it up like this:  This is a fabulous movie for the young and old.  If you are a parent, PLEASE show this movie to your children.  And if you don't have kids, watch it for yourself. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

There are pop culture references, and jokes strewn about movies that fly over the kids heads, but keep the adults entertained while struggling through the movie.  But as of late I've found that all the kids get out of the movie is funny looking characters doing funny looking things, and all of the dialogue is centered on the adults.  The reason for this is the idea that kids don't get it. Some movie makers think that movies with adult themes will be too much for the child, and in turn stupify the movie.  Once this is done they have to fill it up with silly references and jokes that the parents will like.  The end result is a less than entertaining film.  Then there are the movies that say ""screw it all"" and actually focus on making a good animated feature. The Secret of Nimb and The Black Cauldron, and now The Iron Giant are each excellent examples of this.  The makers of these movies give the kids a chance to get what the movie is trying to say, and the kids do.  The political undertones of the Iron Giant may not be something that the kids will relate to and say ""oh look, a cold war metaphore"" but they understand the story and plot, possibly better than those who see what this is all based on. Too add to everything, the animation in this film is fantastic.  Great film all around.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent.,"Totally a joy to watch, The Iron Giant follows the story of young Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marenthal) - a little boy who has nothing to do. Then he hears about a huge metal machine falling from the sky. He goes and searches. And of course, trouble finds him. But love, friendship and redemption also find him and he befriends an Iron Giant.This film has excellent animation, great voices and cool direction. Don't miss it!The Iron Giant would definitely be on my top 30.My rating : 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's a shame this enchanting animated film never found a bigger audience,"While the story is familiar (kid meets alien/ monster/ outsider, and befriends them, understanding they're not the threat the grown up world thinks), Brad Bird brings humor, freshness and heart to the sub-genre that lets this transcend into a terrific movie.Set in a cold-war paranoid America of 1957, the titular creature cash lands from outer- space, with a knock on his giant metal head leaving him with amnesia about his purpose or history. After being saved by a 9 year old boy, a series of at first comic, then later more serious adventures begin.There's some very funny jabs at the cold war mentality, and some terrific, unusual supporting characters, including a mom more interesting and complex than you find in most cartoons, and a local wanna-be beatnik artist who joins in to take the giant iron man's cause.I love the look they designed for the Iron Giant himself, there's something wonderfully retro and almost art deco about him, and they do a great job of bringing heart and emotion to this gigantic metal creature.By the end I was shocked at how moved I found myself. A lovely, well told, fun fairy tale that is as much for adults as for kids.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best movie of the year!,"""The Iron Giant"" is easily the best movie of 1999 -- or at least it should be.  Heartwarming without being sappy, funny without being gross, insightful without being preachy, this is a movie that pushes the boundaries of American animated film which everyone MUST see.  The only flaw on this masterpiece film is Warner Bros. inept marketing of it...",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Well-crafted, funny, and touching, with great visual appeal","The Iron Giant presents a well-written and visually appealing story that works better than most Disney movies.  Set in 1957, it explores half-seriously, half tongue-in-cheek the stereotypes and the reality of ""G-men"" and the US military mindset, the cold war, and life at the start of the space age.The story is told from the point of view of the boy, Hogarth, who is a believable and sympathetic character.  A couple of anthropomorphic elements can be seen in the robot, but it's not hard to suspend disbelief since these elements are subtle and not the primary driver of character development. The robot character is somewhat enigmatic/alien, which only serves to make the story more intriguing rather than confusing.The other characters are enjoyable, even though they are somewhat flat (to varying degrees).  The humor is not as sophisticated as, say, The Simpsons, but it's never annoying, overly juvenile, nor over-the-top as it can be in most Disney movies.By the conclusion, I found myself unexpectedly moved, thanks to the well-crafted sympathy-inviting character development.  Despite the use of some standard plot devices, The Iron Giant is certainly a movie I plan to share with my future children, and one that I will enjoy right along with them.  Highly recommended.  Overall score: 9.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the Best Animated Films Ever,"""The Iron Giant"" is a film about a boy, his beatnik friend, his mother, an insane G-Man and an Iron Giant from outer space in a small town in the 1950s.  The film is beautifully directed and the voicing seems to have a depth and character that I can never remember seeing in any Disney film.  It is in many ways a re-telling of one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and is just as powerful, intelligent and moving.  It is with out a doubt one of the best animated and sci-fi films ever made. Klatu Viratu Niktu (I hope I spelled that right).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
About a Machine Man,"Without doubt one of the best films of the past ten years, animated or not, IRON GIANT is a fabulous love letter to 1950s science fiction b-movies and b-fiction. The central figure, the alien robot construct, is as grand and cool a physical design for a robot as ever put on film; but then this is perfectly balanced with the character of the robot, a being who is sentient and loyal, as he understands it.The robot, befriended by a young boy who is himself a SF b-movie junkie during the reactionary '50s time period, engages the boy and the boy's beatnik confidant with his trust, allowing the film to briskly detail the Giant's advances, as he comes to understand his own nature, the possibility of becoming a deadly weapon and a ""monster"" from the boy's comic books, and his understanding of heroism and love for his friends. In a world which is dangerous for the robot, and he in turn a danger to it because he is built to destroy, rather than love, the Giant's story of coming to the realization of what and who he truly is has a poignancy that is simply amazing. It is a story of redemption as great as the classic monster icons that have inspired this movie, such as the deformed Quasimodo of Notre Dame's saving of the beautiful, wrongly-accused Esmeralda who will be executed unless he protects her, even if he must die for her, loving the unattainable beauty he loves but can never have, or Frankenstein's Monster destroying himself and his newly-created Bride of Frankenstein because they are, in the Monster's opinion, a vile affront to nature.The Giant too realizes he must do what he has to, in order not to be a monster. It is one of the grand moments in cinema when the robot faces his fate, and becomes more than human in the process. An amazing film worth seeing many, many times.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply a masterpiece.,"The Iron Giant is an animated film directed by Brad Bird. It is about a giant alien robot who landed on earth from outer space in the year 1957 and seems to have gotten amnesia. He meets and befriends a young boy named Hogarth, who shows the robot how to be a good person. While doing so, he must keep the robot safe from the public and especially from the U.S. government who is trying to track down what crashed on the planet.I watched this movie at my local theater this week because it was only two dollars a seat and because I was very curious about this one and I left the theater very satisfied with my experience. I couldn't have liked this movie more if I tried. The critics don't lie with this one, it's a well-written, well-polished animated family masterpiece. It is something that both kids and adults can watch and enjoy wholeheartedly.Staring with the animation, it uses a combination of both traditional animation and computer animation. Almost everything in the movie is traditionally animated and then we have the robot who is, at all times, computer animated. Surprisingly, the animators manage to blend in the robot with its surroundings perfectly. The animation doesn't feel out of place with either the 3D or traditional animation, which is a pretty amazing sight to see.The overall feel to it felt out of the ordinary from what you would find in most modern animated movies outside of Disney and Pixar. I feel like a lot of other companies try too hard to make their animated movies part comedy nowadays. With this movie, there were some funny moments, but they didn't parade the movie entirely. Instead, they're replaced with emotionally swinging, powerful moments that give it a very mature feel. For a family movie, it is quite mature, it's one of those movies that's rated PG for a reason. It delves into some very sensitive topics that were and still are relevant to the movie's time period such as fear and prejudice as well as what could lie beyond our world. To further that it's a more mature film, it does have some adult humor and language.I liked all the characters in the movie. I liked the simple, quirky and lonely boy that was Hogarth. Kent was a menacing, unsettling villain who always kept his watchful eye on the main character as two examples. My favorite character of them all has to be the titular character. He's a simple, yet deep and complex character. I won't go too in-dept on him since it would go into spoiler territory, but we do find out about his complexity much later which changes the mood of the movie.Going blindly into this movie was a decision that I do not regret. The Iron Giant is a must watch for anyone who loves animated, movies or just wants a good movie experience. I don't think I found a single flaw or con with this movie when I watched it, it was an experience that I won't forget.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
How did I miss this one!! Awesome,"I never leave out animated movies that comes out from the Hollywood, well this one was out and I didn't even hear anything about it, nor could I see any DVD on the local stores. When I saw the name in the top list of animated movies on IMDb I just wanted too see it. Not only IMDb I checked for it on many other movie database websites it was almost at the top of almost all of it name it be Metacritics, Rotten Tomatoes, Movie Web and only after seeing it I can understand why!! Really good one the story was simple and awesome the characters were remarkably fits the story and pretty much I was with movie flow shouting 'Kent Mansley' sometimes hehehehe. The movie is worth a watch if you haven't seen it, well just only I feel the movie label is too limited I had to get it from eBay from US but it was really worth it!! The movie is well better for kids as it is having good moral, the script was good with the direction of the movie sequence as Ted Hughes authored ""Iron Giant"".

Perfection?,"As close to perfect as any animated film has ever come in my experience. I'd especially agree with the comment that this movie thankfully lacks the 'preachiness'(and musical routines!) found in EVERY Disney animated film I have ever seen.Fans, old AND young, have gotten used to, or expect to be talked down to when they go see animated films. It's insulting, tiresome, and downplays the effectiveness of art come to life. Here you simply never feel that way; the story and characters are put first, not some self-righteous posturing done 1,000 times before. Thanks to all involved for reinforcing my belief that this medium still retains awe-inspiring story-telling power for those brave enough to create OUTside the lines! The Iron Giant is very possibly the best film I've seen this year - video or big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderful film!,"What a treat this film is! For those baby boomers who grew up on B&W 1950s Sci-Fi flicks and who spent their days with comic books folded up and stuck in their back jeans pockets, this is a must-see film.  Long-time comic book fans, especially, will be thrilled by some of the images and story points. And oh yeah -- kids will love it too!It's a good-hearted, honest, witty, well-written, well-directed, beautifully drawn film that works for all ages.  What more could you want?I understand it is NOT doing great box office business, and that is a crying shame -- as it is clearly one of the best films of the year, and those who ARE seeing it are loving it.

The best animated film for all ages,"as a twenty-something year old man my favourite films include the likes of Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, Seven and I hope soon to see the Wolf of Wall Street. However, I have fond memories of my childhood, the days of Toy Story and Disney Classics. I say this to give context behind me stumbling upon The Iron Giant today on television. I partly remember really liking it as a child so I put it on in the background while I did some work, but within 5 minutes I was completely engrossed as this film is fantastic.This film is about a giant metal robot that arrives on Earth in the 1950s for unknown reasons and a boy who finds him and befriends him. The two form a heart-warming bond as the child tries to protect his new friend from a paranoid government official. This is set against the backdrop of the cold war and the suspicion and fear that came with it. I wont spoil any more but this film is so emotional I'm not ashamed to admit I felt a few tears once or twice. The story is very simplistic yet it touches on a number of ongoing political issues, most importantly that just because we don't understand something, doesn't mean it's a threat.Despite gong into these themes, the film never feel like it's preaching or talking down to the audience, and fortunately it came before the era when everything had to be very PC so don't expect anything like this film to be showing any time soon.To sum up my short review, this film is a must-see even for those who don't like animated films, I don't usually watch them but this is definitely an exception. This is a film to watch with your family on a wet weekend day when you're in the mood for being cosy. I think children will enjoy the aforementioned giant metal robot but the film goes so much deeper than that, making it possibly the best animated family film I've ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

a brilliant alternative to Disney,"In many respects, ""The Iron Giant"" has a lot in common with another excellent film that came out earlier this year, ""October Sky."" Both films are set in the same year and feature the beginnings of the space race and the dawn of the atomic age as their respective backdrops to the main action. Each movie features young protagonists who are dreamers and outsiders of their societies and present refreshingly peaceful resolutions to their respective conflicts.""The Iron Giant"" has a wonderful nostalgic, small-town atmosphere that is brought to life by the stunning animation that is on par with anything that Disney has produced recently. The attention to period detail, from the cheesy educational videos that Hogarth's class is forced to watch, to the way townspeople talk, is faithfully recreated and really goes a long way to drawing you into this engaging world. In some respects, the animation style of this film recalls the early, groundbreaking Fleischer brothers Superman cartoons of the 1940s with its depth of field, but without the German Expressionist influence.The real strength of this film is the relationships between the characters -- something that is often overlooked in animated films for flashy visuals and epic musical numbers. ""The Iron Giant"" has the feel of a very intimate, character-driven film with the relationship between Hogarth and his robot friend as the emotional centre but with several other relationships (like the ones between Hogarth and his mother and between him and Dean) also featured prominently as well. This is no simple Saturday morning cartoon but a strong feature film that actually has something to say.""The Iron Giant"" is one of those rare animated films that appeals to both children and adults, that doesn't contain one annoying musical number a la Disney, and that isn't one long advertisement for a toy. In fact, this film is an entertaining, even touching, story about tolerance and compassion. ""The Iron Giant"" refuses to talk down to its audience (the usual tactic of most animated films) or spoonfeed them any answers. It also deals with real issues like death and bigotry -- pretty heavy topics for a children's animated film.easily one of THE best animated films i've ever seen...",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hungry Man of Iron,"One of the many struggles that filmmakers run into when making a children's film is creating something that appeals to both the children and their parents, who will most likely be watching it with them. ""The Iron Giant"" is an example of one that completely succeeds in that area. The opening where Hogarth goes on the roof to check the antenna and then into the woods with the flashlight has much more suspense, as it appears to be night in the Signature Edition. The glowing power station and the Iron Giant getting shocked by the wires has much more pop in the Signature Edition. Hogarth coming up the stairs with the TV lighting the stairwell when he goes to check on the noise upstairs while watching TV is another good example.This is a really exciting and touching movie which highlights the intolerance and prejudice of people. Humans are out to destroy what they don't understand, rather than reaching out. The animation is superb, especially, the showdown at the end of the movie. The film leaves us guessing what the robot actually is- is he an alien from outer space, or a military experiment? This is an intelligent kids movie which will have you thinking about it after it has finished. Children will identify with the appealing lead character, as he struggles to help his friend. there are some really funny sequences in the film too, like when Hogarth gives Kent chocolate laxatives when he starts asking too many questions, and when the robot hand comes detached and starts wondering around the place.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

How can MAN be so cruel. It makes you cry. 10 out of 10!,"A fantastic feeling. How can MAN be so cruel. This movie touched me very deeply, and I can't remember any other movie that made me so angry and sad about the way humans (can) think.24 years old, it's a cartoon, and it's ""only"" a machine, but at the end when the worst of all things happened I cried like I have never cried during a movie. It has been years since the tears ran like that. I don't think I ever will forget that moment.I almost missed this movie, because I regarded it as a children's movie, and even though I always go to Disney's cartoon to see the fantastic pictures, this cartoon does not have that kind of drawings. So I was lucky, that so many other liked it, because when I saw that it was in top 100 on IMDb's Top 250 I said to my self: ""Well maybe this is worth watching"", and now you know that I think it was.Before the terrible moment, there are laughs, excitement and all the other stuff that makes a good movie. I loved the scene with the hunters that shoots a poor deer, and then looks up, sees the Giant, and cries out: ""Oh no, it's the monster"". That's so ironic as can be. I think the movie does a good job; it can be enjoyed both by kids and adults. I have already mentioned why adults would like it, but when I just saw it, the rest of the audience consisted of children with there parent(s). I could here that the children liked it. I don't think they really understood what happened in the worst part, they didn't sound scared.

A Wonderful Movie that doesn't deserve to fail,"Unlike the animated bombs that Warner Brothers has released over the last two years, the Iron Giant does not deserve to fail. Unfortunately, it seems that Warner Brothers thought that it would, and therefore didn't put any effort into promotion. I saw the film the day that it came out, and I was so taken with it that I had to have a memento of some kind. But there was nothing. No books, no toys, no posters. Except for an advertising campaign that seems to have peaked two weeks ago, publicity has been almost zilch.All of this is a shame, because this is the best animated film I have seen in years. Brad Bird has crafted a fully realized world from the fifties, and set it in the animation style familiar to those times. There are shades of Lady and the Tramp in the large lines and fluid movement that the human characters exhibit. More telling than any technical aspect, though(including the amazing computer-generated giant), is the script. This is a beautiful one. Simple enough for children, but aimed at adults, the movie had everyone in the sparsely populated movie theatre laughing and cheering.This movie should be seen by everyone it can.

But what shines is the writing.  Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies have produced what may possibly be the best screenplay ever written for an animated feature film.  As good as a few of the Disney features have been, and as good as Fox's recent ANASTASIA was, this is better.  Add a solid, effortlessly smooth ensemble of voice performances, and you have a story that viewers will remember and return to with pleasure.Look for THE IRON GIANT on awards ballots -- and not just for animated films or SF movies.

The BEST film of 1999,"I've just watched the DVD version of ""Iron Giant.""   I found the story line to be one of the most cliche' plots in all of animation.   There is an obvious anti-gun message that is rather silly and ineffective.   Then there's the all too familiar ""kid without a father"" theme that Hollywood beats like a dead horse.    Hardly the sort of stuff that makes for a great film.   But, worst of all, it is filled with logical and factual errors that stretch the already thin credibility of animated flicks.Despite all that, I just loved this movie!Of all the films I've seen in 1999, this is definitely the best of the lot-- animated or live action.   And I say this just having seen ""Toy Story 2"" a few weeks back, which is now my second favorite film of '99.  ""Iron Giant"" kicked it out of first place.   (You know it's a bad year for movies when your top two favorites are animations...)   Flaws and all, this film has more heart and emotion than any other 10 Hollywood films of 1999 combined.The film takes place during 1957.  We have a story about a boy named Hogarth (without a father, of course...) who finds a giant iron robot from outer space while searching the woods for invaders from Mars.   After being initially scared to death of the creature, he quickly realizes the robot is not out to harm him- and so, in short order, the boy befriends him.   The rest of the movie deals with the boy's efforts to hide a 100ft. tall robot from the local townspeople of Rockwell, Maine and the United States government.While there's nothing cliche' about a boy taking a walk in the woods and discovering a huge metallic robot suffering from amnesia munching on the local electric power plant, the ""...boy meets awesomely powerful yet benign creature and quickly befriends him while everyone else wants to kill him..."" plot has been done too many times to count.    Yet the film's writers, directors and animators take us down this well-traveled path in such a way that new life is breathed into this most ancient of fairy tales.   For that feat alone, the movie is deserves every drop of praise it gets.The film is a parable of the atomic age.   The fears and paranoias of the time are summed up in the government agent sent out to find the giant robot, ""Kent Mansly.""   He's a walking, talking tribute to the ""red under every bed"" mindset.    The innocent and fun loving target of his paranoia, the boy Hogarth, contrasts Mansly.   Hogarth is about the best portrayal of a red blooded 50's era American boy that's ever been put to screen, despite the fact that he's a simple drawing.""Iron Giant"" should not be mistaken for a mere kid's flick.    Parents will like it as much if not more than their children.   The message of the film is one of love and self-sacrifice, the kind of thing most of us want to instill in our kids.  In it's own way, ""Iron Giant' is a kind of ""Saving Private Ryan"" for children.Ultimately, this is a love story between a boy and his robot.   Yes, it sounds silly, but you'll have to see it yourself to understand how the writers & directors pull it off.  There is a moral to this film, or I should say, ""morals.""  The morals are not heavy handed or preached, but they are expounded upon by the actions of the characters themselves.   My favorite lesson had to do with  ""peace through superior fire power!""But don't take my word for how good it is. My four-year-old son watched the DVD three times in a 24-hour period, and watched it every day we had it for the seven-day rental period.  I believe it's now his new favorite film.  We judge how much he likes a film by the amount of times he asks to see it again.    The last movie he wanted to watch as much as this one is ""A Bug's Life.""Interesting note: ""Iron Giant,"" along with ""Toy Story 2,"" both pay homage to good old ""Sputnik"" -the first ever satellite launched into earth's orbit. It's neat how these two rather unrelated stories both deal with the significance of that event.Don't bother renting this film.   Just buy it the next time you see it on sale.   We've already decided to make the ""Iron Giant"" DVD a permanent part of our collection.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great picture,"Lovely animation and a simple but involving story. I enjoyed the voice overs and the feeling of purity and innocence that the woodland scenes invoked in me. And best of all, no sex to pollute young minds. Well done to all concerned!",,Anonymous,Animation
"Small animation, Big inspiration.","Firstly, I want to say this is a beautiful story, a interesting animation, a deep thinking with its lovely dubbing. The outline of this story is clear and ordinary, but it will not let you down at any moment. Due to its almost perfect continuity and obvious but not boring plot, it is easy for children to follow and to wet their eyes, especially when our iron giant said ""Superman"" and then took care the bomb; just like the plot in ""How to Train Your Dragon"" (2010), it is a sacrifice in the end, however, everything will be fine at the final end.Furthermore, with this simple story which is logical but not novel, ""The Iron Giant"" really teaches us something. The unknown things are always considered dangerous and scared, it is absurd and what the author wants to throw down by this film. When Hogarth helped the iron giant to get rid of the electric cable, the next day our giant show him the friendly. ""Him, not it"", said by a little boy shows us a warm world although it is frozen winter in the film. ""He is like a baby"", when he is hungry, he has only iron in his mind, when he find it is interesting to jump into the water, he plays like a children; ""You are not him (the machine killer), you are like superman"", just like teaching a child, good teaching grows up a reasonable boy.Finally, the most worth thinking about is ""guns kill"", is this a enlightenment telling giant you are a gun of killing, wake up, or a word to tell him do not be the gun killing innocence, even though you possess the power. Actually, clues for both of them can be found, but of course, the later one is what the film wants to say.Just an cute animation, too much thinking for it...... LoL!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Perfect Anti-War Film; And A Sci-Fi Gem!,"The Iron Giant came out in 1999 in the midst of a troubling promotional campaign that made the film suffer at the theatrical box office, only for critics to immediately fall in love with the film resulting in audiences discovering it once it came out on home video; and it quickly became a success story for the ages.Nearly two decades on and this film has aged wonderfully well. It's a heartwarming and tear-jerking adventure that still holds a special place in my heart as being an animated film that has the potency of a live-action film and showing that animation doesn't need to adhere to the Disney formula of songs, animals and princesses. Brad Bird gives an experience akin to that of a Hayao Miyazaki film. The Iron Giant is a golden piece of Warner Brothers Animation goodness that has all the care and attention to detail comparable to the works of Chuck Jones and Bob Clampett.Putting it shortly, The Iron Giant is an all-time favorite of mine as it is for many animation aficionados the world over; and it's as necessary as movies like Back to the Future and The Star Wars Trilogy. 5/5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Touching story of a boy and his giant outer-space robot,"Yes, the boy-and-giant-robot theme has been done before (Gigantor, aka Tetsujin 28), but here the plot is new and well-constructed.

Good characters, especially the robot; a very good mix of laughs, pathos, and explosions.  The animation is Disney-like, blending in computerized effects seamlessly.  The mix of art styles is interesting:  the giant robot is art deco; one character (Dean the beatnik scrap dealer) looks like he came from Eightball; the rest look like they came from The Little Mermaid.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Simply put, one of the most beautiful stories ever told on film","Because it didn't raise a huge ruckus in it's theatrical release, I'm betting that almost everyone forgets ""The Iron Giant"" come Oscar time...but they shouldn't.  Oh I'm sure that it will get nominated in the Animated Feature category, but I doubt we're going to see this film's name in either of the categories where it belongs - Best Screenplay and Best Picture.  The sad thing is that this is probably more likely going to be due to a lack of an attempt on the part of Warner Brothers to push the film as a Best Picture/Screenplay nominee than on the unwillingness of the Academy to nominate it in those categories.  Warner Brothers will I'm sure make at least a token effort to outperform Disney's ""Tarzan"" marketing juggernaut, but I won't be suprised if it doesn't even occur to the powers that be to float this as a Best Picture/Screenplay contender.That said, the Iron Giant is, without a doubt, the best film of 1999, and probably one of the 10 best stories ever told on film.  The animation is typical Disney-esque fare, and if there are technical categories for animated features there's no reason to think that IG should win an award in one.  What carries this film is the writing, both story and screenplay, and wonderfully performed voice acting.  Take special note of Vin Diesel (yeah...Vin Diesel) as the Iron Giant.  I don't know how much easier voice acting might be than regular acting, but in this case, Diesel nails it.There's the usual spate of grown-up jokes thrown in to keep adults entertained, and the robot's Cool Quotient is right up there with iMacs.But when you get down to it it's the simple yet perfectly told story that make this film great to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Origin Of The Iron Giant (spoilers),"The review says how the origin of the Iron Giant is unknown (even to him).But it's not true.A deleted scene from the movie (included on the DVD) shows what the Iron Giant was intended for, if not the specifics of his creation.The Iron Giant is dreaming and his dreams are broadcast to a nearby TV. It shows an army of Iron Giants (in weapons mode) marching on a planet. They start destroying everything in sight. Then we see the Iron Giant (the one who comes here) look at his shadow, a precursor which hints at his destructive potential. Then the Iron Giants use their chest weapons and the planet blows up.At this point, the Iron Giant wakes up and the dream stops. The only thing that is not specified is how he came here (or why).",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Brad Bird's Directional Debut Is A Timeless Classic,"Affectionately crafted, mesmerisingly told & gorgeously animated, The Iron Giant is a wonderful marriage of traditional & computer animation from Warner Bros. Animation that not only triumphs as a technical marvel of its genre but is also the most heartwarming, emotionally resonant & thoroughly intimate narrative to surface on the silver screen since Pixar's very own Toy Story.Set in the late 1950s during the Cold War, The Iron Giant tells the story of Hogarth Hughes; a lonely but smart kid raised by his mother who one day comes across a giant metal robot that fell from space & soon befriends the innocent alien. And with the help of a junkyard owner, he tries to save the fifty-foot, metal-eating robot from the paranoid government that intends to find & destroy the Giant.Directed by Brad Bird, The Iron Giant marks his feature film debut & is a work of impeccable craftsmanship from start to finish. There is no irrelevant moment in its story, every sequence has a role to play, the various themes it deals with brilliantly captures the fear & paranoia present in the society in those times, and the way it all adds up into an engaging & thought- provoking cinema speaks volumes about Bird's talents as a filmmaker.The whole plot maintains a playful tone despite dealing with some serious issues, has a very fluid feel to it coz of which the events unfold in a smooth manner, the 2D animation is exquisitely handled & meticulously detailed plus the CGI element is seamlessly integrated into it, voice cast is wisely chosen, use of colours isn't extensive but it works in its favour, pacing is steady and the background score provides a very personal feel to the story.On an overall scale, The Iron Giant is one of the greatest animation features of last century that deserves to be seen by every cinema lover out there. Presenting a firm control over all aspects of filmmaking, cleverly balancing its refined drama with clever wit & riding on the strength of its highly gripping story, crisply defined characters & terrific animation, The Iron Giant is endearing, entertaining & enlightening in equal doses and is a timeless treasure in every sense of the word.A roller-coaster ride of emotions that's sure to leave its audience both smiling & teary-eyed by the time it ends, The Iron Giant is absolutely worth your time & money and comes one hundred percent recommended.",,Anonymous,Animation
Fine Animation,"The Iron Giant is the best surprise film of the summer.  Intelligent writing, comedy that is actually funny, and a strong message all come together to create a good film experience.  The film loses its way a bit at the end by going a little too over the top with the boy's relationship with the giant, but otherwise it is even-handed and emotionally restrained.The best part of the film is that it is not afraid to state its political beliefs.  The Cold War was a waste of people's lives and times.  The boy is fatherless, in fact, because he was a pilot who died in Korea (we can assume).  The methods that our government provided us for protection were all lies, such as the Duck and Cover film that must be seen to be believed. Best of all, the film is strongly anti-gun.  The giant, like all of us in our insane country, can be a gun.  He chooses not to be and chooses not to hurt others.  It is a choice we can all make by saying no to guns and gun violence.  The military and government officals suffer some well-deserved put-downs, and the hero's friend is a subversive beatnik artist.  What could be better than that?  The real reason that Warner is not promoting this film is that it fears that its strong political message could create a backlash against the company.  Instead, they put their money into Wild Wild West and its humor based on race and disability. Better to reaffirm those who hate than encourage us to love.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"This is not just an animated movie, this is a great film","Just because it is an animated movie, a lot of people are going to think that it is just for kids, but that couldn't be further from the truth.

The closest movies that I think could be used to described The Iron Giant would have to be Miyazaki's since they all take place in a reality which is not quite our own but is close enough for us to identify with it and its characters.

A startlingly good animated film that seemed to come out of nowhere. Amazingly well done.,"The Iron Giant is an animated film that probably did not get the attention that it deserves because it was not made by Disney. When I saw this movie, I did not know anything about it and I didn't expect much from it, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The story involves a young boy who discovers a crash landed (?) robotic giant in the woods near his home, where he lives with his single mother.Despite the predictable ending and the rather unoriginal story (""Cool, my own Terminator!""), The Iron Giant is a heartwarming tale of friendship and family that provides excellent entertainment for all ages. It is unlikely that the giant is able to learn so much about humans (emotions, soul, acceptance, life, etc), but that's beside the point. I mean, they never even hinted as to where the giant came from, who made him, or why he was endowed with such jaw-dropping artillery. Is he some sort of alien Bicentennial Man? Even though the giant's entire background is left a mystery, the film is still able to tell a wonderful story. Let's just hope they make a sequel in which the giant's home is portrayed more.The cast was also excellent. In particular I enjoyed Harry Connick Jr.'s performance as the endlessly tolerant Dean McCoppin, and most of all, ironically enough, Christopher McDonald as the government agent Kent Mansley. Christopher McDonald almost always plays a jerk of some sort in all of his movies (Happy Gilmore, Dirty Work, and SLC Punk, to name a few), and he was endlessly amusing in The Iron Giant (""...no, Bob, big things happen in big places. And the sooner I fill out my report, the sooner I can get back to them.""). Great stuff.The Iron Giant is a movie for all tastes. I strongly believe that anyone who didn't like this movie did not give it a fair enough chance, because it was just so well done. It is one of those rare films (especially animated) that has an ending that virtually forces you to smile. You can't walk away from this movie unhappy, it is touching, it's fascinating, it's entertaining, and it should not be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
10/10!,"Once in a lifetime you'll come across a film that truly captures the history and cultural distinctions of the modern world the way a person can subjectively perceive it through our guided field of perspective. I have to admit, I had my doubts when I first learned of the movie. After all, The Iron Giant? Will this movie even be good? How ignorant was I to even have these thoughts. Little did I know I was about to indulge in what may have been the best 2 hours and 21 minutes of my life. The movie started out strong. The opening scenes enticed the audience with a captivating enigma. I was so taken aback from the next-generation animation that I almost didn't even realize the underlying symbolism in the ongoing scenes. It wasn't until my twenty sixth viewing of the movie where I finally got my bearings together and was able to focus on the gripping and labyrinthine stratagem. The underlying analogy for 19th century distopianism and the evangelical deviation of typical orthodoxy was enlightening to say the least. Just when I thought the movie could not get any better, the increasing conflict before the climax began. I could not believe the complexity of the story as the main bee protagonist, Bellza, struggled with the everyday endeavors for a quintessential bee such as the consistent up- hill altercation of the fight against misogyny and the fiscal synergy of opposing interplanetary dynamisms. There I was, gripping to my chair as the conflict of the movie began. I was so enticed by the movie that I felt as if I was both practically and relatively apart of the movie. This is a special kind of high that not even the strongest of drugs can give you. Was I part of the movie? Am I inside the movie right now? This movie will leave you questioning existential nihilism and the objective skepticism of our perceived valuation of anthropological existence. At this point in the film, I was fully intoxicated by the avant-garde animated art style. That's when the plot finally aggrandized and I was completely stupefied. You could have lived a thousand years of isolation trying to predict the plot twist and you would never even scratch the surface of what actually transpires in the movie. I was so bewildered that I actually had to pause the movie so that my existential crisis didn't dive too deep inside of myself. Even pausing the movie was surreal. It's almost as if life paused with the movie. I felt as though I had actually become a cinematic tangent quantum. The effects are still wearing off and I haven't been able to watch the movie in several years. I spent the following seven years afraid of what outside of my house actually looks like. Every single day and night I live in misery because I became fully aware that happiness is never achievable. I realized that human life has absolutely no meaning and that no matter what I ever do, it is of complete unimportance and in years from now, no recollection of my existence will prevail, meaning that if I died years ago, died now, or die sometime in the future it will not matter whatsoever to anyone. But, then again, the fact that I'm living doesn't matter either so I might as well stick around for awhile, living in complete isolation, condemned to a life of traumatic memories and a completely corrupted sub-conscience. The Iron Giant literally ruined my life. 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Just a great family film,"I have truly enjoyed this film since I first saw it many years ago. It manages to entertain to the fullest, and not a single scene is too stupid or annoying for the average audience to watch. Adults, especially those growing up in the 50s or 60s, will relate well to this film, knowing what it was like to grow up during the trials and uncertainties of the Cold War. ""The Iron Giant"" tells the story of young boy Hogarth Hughes befriending a gigantic metal robot who has crash-landed on the earth from space. The government is suspicious, as usual, and wants to destroy the robot. Hogarth teaches the robot the truths and choices of using his powers for good rather than evil. What makes up this film is a very fun collection of humor and suspense. The humor is top-notch, from Hogarth saying grace and trying to hide the robot's missing hand at the same time to Hogarth's hyped-out experience after drinking espresso. It is also compelling and touching, as Hogarth and the giant must make choices and learn lessons throughout the film. What an enjoyable film.

An American Classic.,"This is truly one of the greatest animated films ever made. It's the story of Hogarth; an imaginative, young boy, growing up with out a father, at the height of the 'red scare.'  When he crosses paths with a alien robot fallen to Earth an amazing friendship, adventure and education begins.This is a heartfelt, E.T.-like tale which should be a classic in every child's video collection.  It teaches of acceptance, non-violence and true friendship while never hitting you over the head with morality or gitty music numbers.  But what makes this film even more amazing is that it is just as entertaining for adults, as it is for kids.In 1999, two classic animated films were released; one by the goliath of animation, Disney, and the other by Warner Brothers.  Toy Story 2 went on to gross over $200 million, while The Iron Giant grossed only $23 million. America missed this film while it was in theaters, but we have a second chance on video.

Here we have an intelligent, and entertaining film about a boy who befriends a giant robot from origins unknown.   The characters are not dumbed down in anyway, and there is no need to break out into song as many recent animated films have done.  We are carried along by the story and the curiosity about what will happen next to Hogarth and his giant friend.   One of the best sequences in the film is toward the end when the Giant and Hogarth are knocked out of the sky. Once they land, the Giant shows more emotion and range than many living actors can muster. The result is a scene that's full of power and emotion.  The climax of the film is fitting, but I can't say what it is, you have to see it for yourself.  A great film to show to the entire family.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

You Are Who You Choose to Be,"You are who you choose to be. Some sort of rocket falls from space along the Maine coast in 1957. A gigantic robot emerges and cuts a swath through the boreal forest on the way to a small town. It could be a weapon of the Soviets, a monster, an alien invader bent on destroying the earth, and more. When the iron giant encounters in its path a nine-year-old boy, Hogarth, it displays gentleness, keen intelligence and the innocence of a child. Hogarth is not the only one, of course, who knows about the robot. A fearful, negative and self-centered government agent attempts to corner the iron giant and triggers some adverse and alarming reactions. As the US Army responds, the robot and boy have only each other to turn to.While this animated feature is simple and straightforward in appearance, it carries a profound and touching message. There are many people who want you to live in a box they built for themselves, full of fear and negativity, yet we should decide for ourselves who we want to be. Even Superman or Superwoman are not out of reach, as the Iron Giant reveals. Brad Bird, one of the inspirations behind the rising Pixar Studio, reveals in this film why he is worth a damn.

The animation is very nice, the characters are interesting, the story is well played out but I believe the one character that steals the show is the giant himself.He is very innocent yet he has no memory where he came from or who created him, but the friendship between the kid and the robot is very satisfying to look at. He learns so many thing from the kid himself but the one lesson he taught the giant is ""You are who you chose to be"".I won't give away the ending but I will say it is beautifully emotional it will leave anyone in tears.

""Iron Giant"" had wonderful characters that lended humor when called for without idoitic gags, tears (Yes, I was nearly crying at the end), and boundless joy that made the audience feel uplifted and like they were a kid again. And it was rated ""PG"".A side note to parents, at the screening my husband & I went to, there were a lot of kids (we do not have children at this time). The parent who sat beside us had a boy about 7 or 8. the child was asking a lot of deep, good questions that the parent did not have time to really answer and discuss with the child. So, a word of warning... if you have young children you may want to screen this movie by yourself and then take your child. This does not mean that this is NOT a good movie for kids, I just think you need to enjoy it too and give yourself time before or after the movie to discuss issues with your child.The animation was super and way beyond Warner's last attempt with ""Quest for Camelot"". I look forward to their next movie and hope it will be as entertaining as this. I give this movie four thumbs up (my husband's two and my two!). I really hope it does well in the box office.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

An empathetic tale of an unusual friendship,"Although initially not performing remarkably well at the box office, the film later gained cult status through positive reviews and word of mouth. Personally, I didn't see it until over 20 years after its release, and it completely passed me by. Yet, it truly is a small masterpiece and a milestone in the world of animation.Director Brad Bird demonstrates in his debut exactly the qualities that were responsible for making ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"" a global successes.An empathetic tale of an unusual friendship that transcends all external adversities. An adventure film that you should see, not just for children.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly incredible,"Before director Brad Bird hit the big time directing acclaimed Pixar films The Incredibles and Ratatouille, he directed a little animated film for Warner Brothers called The Iron Giant. It's a story set in the Red Scare era about a giant robot that crash lands on Earth. A young kid named Hogarth happens to find this robot and the two quickly develop a strong and powerful friendship. However, Hogarth must keep his giant friend safe as a snooping government worker named Kent tries to find out what Hogarth is hiding and whether or not it's dangerous (ie. built by the Russians). This is an incredibly moving, incredibly powerful film with a lot more to it than meets the eye.The Iron Giant starts out simple enough. It's a story we've seen before. A young boy befriends a larger than life person or thing, highlighting the innocent and non judgemental eye of a child. But this film makes this recognizable motif so powerful and so emotionally enthralling. It hits emotional chords that send chills up and down your body as the film roots itself into your heart. This is a shockingly poignant film with so much heart and a constant thread of sincerity running through it, despite it being a cartoon.This leads me to the other impressive thing about the film is the fact that it's a cartoon. You would expect it to be more in the league of some of the sillier and more light hearted Disney films like The Hunchback of Notre Dame or 101 Dalmations. Instead, The Iron Giant is much more complex and is more mature and intelligent than these films. And the cartoon element also makes it a visual spectacle that is simultaneously larger than life and down to Earth. This sincere parallelism makes the film entertaining and exciting as well as real as the story and characters connect on a very human level, even including and especially the Iron Giant himself, who proves to be more loving and more compassionate than most of the humans in this film. The emphatic realism of this film is enough to bring a tear to one's eye, and indeed it does.Don't underestimate The Iron Giant because of its simple cartoon exterior. It has a heart and a brain, and it has a surprising level of poignancy to it. This is a truly fantastic film that breaks new ground and proves just how human and just how emotionally superb a cartoon can be. This is a film that can't be missed, and must be experienced by anyone with a soul.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really good retro-style animated film.,"The reviewer from my college paper (whose favorite movie is supposedly Natural Born Killers) considers this the best animated movie ever, over anything by Disney or Hayao Miyazaki and apparently over anything by Ralph Bakshi--the same sort of superlatives that have been lavished on Shrek by young and false animation buffs simply because the movie is ""hip"" and irreverent.  The heart of animation is not cheekiness--it is a stylized reality, something we are in danger of losing with the current trend of photo-realistic computer animation and digital ""film"" (though the Final Fantasy trailers show that there are some in the CGI field that still believe in creating fantastic shots, even if the early dialogue screams Titan A.E.).This is not a problem in The Iron Giant, because the filmmakers only draw the giant (and other rotoscoped objects) on computers, then literally paint them (a la ""The Great Mouse Detective""'s Big Ben scene). The effect is that the computer animation blends well with the traditional cel animation, leaving us in peace to enjoy the beautiful retro-style animation.  Even more important, the story (even with its obvious reference to the X-Files in the form of Kent) stays true to the time they are in, unlike most Disney pictures these days.  This does seemingly make the movie drag, but we are compensated with an atmosphere almost completely devoid of cynicism and mean-spirited irony. This is as close to the feelings of wonder and innocence evoked in E.T. that we are likely to get in animation--save for My Neighbor Totoro, which might be a little too innocent.The only real problems I have with this movie are some glaring and unforgivable continuity errors, exemplified by the filmmakers indecision as to what season the movie should take place in (the movie takes place in less than a week, but we see Hogarth diving into a(n admittedly cold) pond in one scene, then later there is a snowstorm).",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't miss this movie...,"Warner Bros have done a great job at not promoting this movie.However as all the other comments testify it is a ""must see"".

It is suitable for just about all ages.The animation is not quite up to recent Disney/DreamWorks efforts - but this is a minor point given that overall the movie works so well.This movie gives me faith that Hollywood can still make films worth seeing. 9 1/2 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The animation isn't the greatest little thing known to man, but still looks brilliant. The voice talent is pretty good. Some real gruff and grit in the characters.In conclusion, buy it.

This movie is a must see not only for children who it is intended for but for adults who have lost the imagination of children, this movie will take you back.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Iron Giant is not as cold as the title would lead you to believe.,"I remember watching this when it first came out on DVD, I was about 6 years old. To a child, this is a story about a colossal robot wanting to use his powers for good. Nearly twenty years later as I enter adulthood, I view this film completely differently. A story about loneliness, a young boy confiding in the titular character in a bid to teach him his ideologies of anti-warfare. A governmental agency concerned for the welfare and security of their own country, viewing the giant as a weapon from another nation. I cannot emphasise enough how rare it is to find such a multi-dimensional family animation that tells a different story dependent on your own perspective. Bird's directorial debut is a statement and certainly a landmark in the animation genre, garnering a cult status where the giant is often the centre of several pop cultural references ('Ready Player One' anyone?). The steampunk aesthetic appeal, CGI on top of hand-drawn animation and surprisingly dark themes has resulted in a flick that has aged impeccably well. Incredibly minimalistic in its storytelling, particularly the deer death scene, yet utterly powerful. The characters themselves were brimming with personality, from the mischievous boy to his worrying mother, they all brought the pictures to life accompanied by an intelligent screenplay. Voice acting was pretty special also, boasting an A-List cast including Aniston and the deep sounds of Diesel. The pacing was pretty much perfect, quickest hour and a half you'll experience. Let's talk about that heartbreaking ending...perfection. It took everything that the film symbolised and placed them all into one powerful scene. Everything from the themes, metaphors and ideologies. Boom. That scene. It defines the film. Whilst I would've preferred they removed the final minute, it is a family film so I'll let it slide. What I can confidently say is that The Iron Giant is a timeless thematic classic that hasn't shown any signs of rust just yet. One of the most impressive directorial debuts.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Iron Giant was so much better than Tarzan, and worlds above Wild Wild West, and yet it has made less than five million for it's first three days.  This is horrible.

It has its moments...,"I was rather disappointed by how a lot of the movie was boring. The first 20 minutes were decent, the middle part was boring.

The superstition, the naiveness, and the style.The story is heart warming and heart breaking at the same time. It is a story that every writer wishes to tell, but at a simple form so that it can be told to children as well. It is a story on how a child can get past every difference in another person/object, where adults cannot.I will watch this movie for years, and will pass it onto my children when the time comes.

A Delightful Surprise,"A box office bomb upon release (Due to dire marketing for Warner Bros who simply didn't know what they had) ""The Iron Giant"" is a great animated story, at 36 years old I sat and watched it on my own, when it was on TV and I was very entertained.Plot In A Paragraph: A Robot from another planet is stranded on Earth somewhere in America, he befriends a nine year old boy, who helps keep him from the US government who are searching for him.Straight off, I need to note the similarities with this and Steven Spielbergs ""E.T"" re read my 'Plot In A Paragraph' replace the word robot with Extra Terrestrial and you have the 'Plot In A Paragraph' for ""E.T"". It's not a bad thing, ""E.T"" is a classic and I love it, and is not exactly the same, but the ending did reduce me to tears like ""E.T"".All the voice actors are good, stand outs are Eli Marienthal as Hogarth Hughes, Jennifer Aniston as Hogarths mother, Christopher McDonald is superb as U.S. Government agent Kent Mansley Harry Connick, Jr. as Dean McCoppin and Vin Diesel as the title character.

Another ignored classic,"One of the most frustrating things about Disney's stranglehold on the animation industry is that when a truly great animated film does come along, fans ignore it in droves.  Such a case is The Iron Giant. Many people are blaming its poor showing on Warner Bros lack of advertising, which is ridiculous. I dislike the idea that unless we're inundated with Happy Meal tie-ins and action figures, the film is under-advertised. There certainly was adequate advertising for this film; it simply wasn't in titanic Disney proportions.The Iron Giant is, no exaggeration, one of the best animated films of the last ten years. As a childhood fable, as a view of fifties foreign paranoia, as a statement on violence, it works perfectly.  There isn't a single flawed scene from beginning to end. And it proves conclusively that animation can work without cute animal sidekicks or overwrought musical numbers; just a great story, brilliantly timed comedy, and some truly touching moments.The combination of cel animation and computer imagery is seamless, with each technique used to its best effect. The voice-acting is top-notch, with Christopher MacDonald particularly good as the paranoid government agent. Having not read the book myself, I can't vouch for the film's adherence to the original story, but I highly recommend it to any lover of animation.Incidentally, lest you think it's purely for children, I watched it with a group of men over thirty, and we all loved it. Let's hope this film gets the discovery on video it was denied in the theater. A solid 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Take the kids or go alone!!!,"This was an awesome movie!  I don't think I can say that enough.    From the trailer (which doesn't do justice to the movie) I had already decided that I'd have to endure it for an hour and a half simply because the kids wanted to see it.  Thank God for my kids, because without their insisting I would have missed the best animated movie I've seen since Toy Story.  A quarter into the movie I'd already decided to buy the movie the minute it's released on DVD. There's a lot of humor that might be lost on kids, most of it related to period satire.  However, my 4 year old son laughed throughout the movie, and afterward told me ""I'm the good giant robot, Momma"" (Do I see us buying Iron Giant Merchandise? You betcha!)  I felt that the movie was like a nostalgic trip to my own childhood.  I remember when Superman was THE hero to be, and the difference between right and wrong was clearly defined.

A warm tale of friendship,"In the 1990's, it was rare for a studio besides Disney to release an animated film. So when Warner Brothers (home of Bugs Bunny) decided to release an animated film, everyone expected it to be some sort of ""Looney Tunes"" and were sorely disappointed when it was not.And that is too bad...for the film that was released - THE IRON GIANT - is a wonderfully warm and heartwarming tale of friendship, acceptance and, yes, intolerance of those different from you, set against the backdrop of the Cold War of the 1950's.Marking the full length feature animation Directing debut by Brad Bird (THE INCREDIBLES), THE IRON GIANT tells the tale of young Hogarth, who finds a...well...Iron Giant... who has fallen to Earth from Outer Space. Hogarth befriends The Iron Giant and helps to hide him from Military-types who see this as a threat to the safety, security and superiority of the United States.Featuring the vocal talents of Jennifer Aniston, John Mahoney, Harry Connick, Jr., Christopher McDonald and Eli Marienthal (as Hogarth), this film is warm and inviting, showing ""good characters"" that you want to root for and spend time with spar with ""bad guys"" that you want to see defeated. All of this over a character that is naive to what is going on around him. Special notice should be made of Vin Diesel's vocal work as The Iron Giant. He says very few things, but the words that he does say, convey strong emotions.You can see the seeds of THE INCREDIBLES in this work of Director Bird. The action sequences are fun and effective and are off-set by slower, more personal, scenes of the characters getting to know - and interact with - each other. He shows a deft touch in balancing these items, finding the right amount of pathos and pace throughout.The main themes in this film - fearing that which you do not know/do not care to understand resonates to this day and is a reminder that kindness can go much further than fear/ignorance/intolerance.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Great for the Whole Family!,"I loved this movie when I was younger. Though I was too young to be hearing the mild swearing in this film, it still cracked me up.THE IRON GIANT is set in the late 1950's in Maine and focuses on a 9-year-old boy named Hogarth, whose mother is a waitress at a diner. Hogarth is just at home while Mom is working the late shift when he uncovers something in the woods: a giant robot-like figure with its food source being metal. Hogarth meets the giant again and the two become friends. But everything out of the ordinary (and outta this world) always attracts the U.S. Government.

Jennifer Aniston as Annie, Harry Connick, Jr., and Eli Marienthal all portray their parts as people as opposed to just actors reading lines.The animation is fine, although I've seen better, but it captures the period well enough.

A Lesson that Ought to be Learned by American Animators,"Don't get me wrong, I did really enjoy this film, but it is also a good example of why I think American animation is far inferior to Japanese animation. And I am talking solely about the animation (i.e., character design, movement, and scenery), not the story complexity. There is no doubt that the stories of Japanese animated films are more complex than those of American animated films. The Iron Giant's story is basically taken straight from E.T.Anyhow, watch how mannered the designs of the characters' faces are in this film. Check out how large Hogarth's ears are. And check out how exaggerated the characters' movements are. This becomes staggeringly unrealistic very quickly. It begins to look, well, just plain goofy. People don't really look like this. They don't make these sorts of expressions.People always complain about the eye size of Japanese anime characters. Their eyes are big for a simple reason which was stated in ancient Rome by the neo-Platonist philosopher Plotinus: the eyes are the windows of the soul. The sculptors of the later Roman Empire always made the eyes on statues enormous, just like the Japanese animators do. Most human expression comes from the eyes, so Japanese animators made the eyes on their characters bigger.What most critics of the Japanese anime eye-size have failed to notice is how large the American animators have made the eyes on their characters. The Americans are obviously learning something from the Japanese. Disney animators have said that there is not a work day that goes by where they do not watch parts of films by Hayao Miyazaki. These films have influenced them greatly. But what American animators have missed in the Japanese animation is that the other pieces of their characters' faces are extremely downplayed. Their mouths, ears, and nose are all very small. Humans express much less in these areas of their faces than the characters of American animated films. This over-exaggeration has occurred in all Disney movies after The Little Mermaid, The Iron Giant, The Road to El Dorado, and I can even see that this is a problem in the upcoming animated flick Titan A.E. It is a big problem, and it must be solved.As for the film itself, after I got around those technicalities, I was quite touched. I liked the anti-violence theme a lot. I think it is a very good film for children. I give it an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""It came from outer space!""","A boy makes friends with an innocent alien giant robot that a paranoid government agent wants to destroy.This film is really good. It's almost like a childhood memory that every time you watch it, it's a different experience. This may be one of my favorite animated movies of all time. The Iron Giant illustrates friendship in a somewhat odd way, with a robot from outer space. The writing and the voicing is almost perfect and the whole animation thing wears away a little after you keep watching. It feels like a real movie with real emotions and that's what it is. I swear the ending is chilling and emotional to see. But the film bonds together the two in the most unique way and the kid shows the Iron Giant rules and lessons about the world they live in. So that pretty much sums it up, this film is a beautiful experience with a heartwarming friendship that is so interesting to see unfold. Aside from being animated (not really that big of a problem, especially how you just forget about it) this film is a must-see. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Probably the best animated film ever made,"I can't really think of the adequate words to describe how amazing this film is,I am truly left in awe after watching it,something I never expected from an animated movie.""The Iron Giant"" is...flawless.The story is very compelling.The characters - very well developed and the animation is very good too.When there is humor,it's actually very funny, even for older viewers. This is one of the few animated films that will be as interesting to kids ,as it would be to adults.You will find that the story sucks you in very quickly.I will admit,I nearly cried in the end. This is,in my opinion, one of the best animated movies ever made,sadly it never was a big hit when it was released.""The Iron Giant"" is a must- see,regardless of what age you are.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An amazing film,"I didn't really notice the similarities to E.T. while watching it, but now I can see them.  Still, I found this to be a much more entertaining movie. The animation was superb, the story was sharp and the giant's technology was awesome.  It's really a shame this film didn't do very well in the box office.  Hopefully it will make it up in video and DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Catch it before it leaves the theater!,"The Iron Giant has some of the best animation and one of the most adult stories I've seen from a U.S. firm in some time. Much of the animation was so smooth it must have been done on a computer - but it wasn't intrusive; it just made the story flow better visually.The sole complaint I had was that there were kids in the theater whose parents had never taught how to behave in public. It was bad enough that the kids talked but even more inconsiderate that their parents were holding conversations with them!So, aside from the danger of young kids in the audience, the Iron Giant is about as good a show as you're likely to see this year. And please see it in a theather - you'll lose a lot of the visual scope of the film if you wait for it on video.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wonderful! An animated classic.,"A truly enchanting film that has so much to offer. From it's witty but gentle lampooning of 1950's cold war hysteria. To it's classic looking animation style, which brings to mind story books and Disney films of years past. It's snappy pace and careful script mean that it's likely to hold the attention of it's younger viewers.Most importantly it's story is a heartfelt retelling of a very old one, the misunderstood monster. But it's warm and uplifting take on this makes it all the more a thing of wonder, it's obvious that the making of this movie was a real labour of love. A must see for animation lovers of all ages, sure to stand the test of time as a true classic family movie.For those of you who might be put off by the Vin Diesel credit, don't worry it could have easily been anyone, the robot thankfully isn't much of talker!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
There are too many similar works,"Replaced the basic Steven Spielberg ET with a robot. The movie fans of the past may not have felt so good looking at this movie just like me. Or you may have been impressed to think that ET was remodeled like this. Or maybe you didn't notice anything. Also, when I was a child, I watched a special-effects robot hero called ""Majin Bander"". Last was the same. The part that the child works on the bed feels like I have watched about 100 times in a movie. I would like the writers to think a little about these places themself and try to devise rare ideas. It was like a movie made up of episodes of past movies.
The story composition was good. The sequence that robot and the boy talked was pulled as much as possible and the action came at the end. I have to praise that place. When I thought about it, I found out that this writer has written the 'incredible family' and is currently very successful in Hollywood. It is said that his annual income is over $ 6 million. That's fine. I wrote something a bit tough, but in modern times it is inevitable to resemble other works. This is a good film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Warner Bros'. masterpiece.,"Only one and a half year prior to this heartfelt and passionate movie, WB released the bland and nonsensical Quest for camelot. That's a major improvement, because The Iron Giant delivers on every level!First of all, the setting of a Cold War America creates a wide range of possibilities of making conflict and is used to the fullest with a government agent being on the search for an unidentified fallen object. The tense atmosphere increases every time he acts, because of the relatability created by the setting.Speaking of the government agent, he is not the only character to add depth and dynamic to the movie, every character plays off of each other perfectly to add heart and soul to the movie's atmosphere. The relationship between the giant and the boy Hogarth is really heartfelt and well developed, what else could you desire but great main characters?The story about paranoia and how we perceive the unknown makes you think it's a dark and serious movie all throughout, but it manages to give some hillarious comedy as well without damaging the overall tone. Hogarth and the giant are lovely to watch and the junkyard owner share some hilarious moments with them when he discovers the giant.The animation has also taken a giant step upwards (no pun intended) since the underwhelming expirience in Quest for Camelot. The backgrounds are gorgeously detailed and mange to show the size of the giant's appearance in general and capture the even grander feel when he flies and especially in the epic climax. The design of the giant himself is also brilliantly done and how much emotion he is able to show despite the restraints of it.The initial release was not kind towards this animated gem due to bad marketing and lack of confidence in the movie from WB thanks to the failure of Quest for Camelot. I'm glad to see that The Iron Giant has gained praise over time and today is considered a modern classic. One of the best animated movies ever made if you ask me.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Caught me totally by surprise and was great!,"I bought the DVD without any knowledge about the plot other than it had a giant robot and a boy in it. ""duh"". The film just completely caught me off-guard and it was absolutely great. There were no disney-like ""let's all sing and praise"" moments and it was completely believable + the voice actors did a great job. Although the film is a bit short it still packs in everything it needs and the end is very touching.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"You won't believe your eyes, but you'll believe your heart","This movie was visually beautiful and at some points, astounding but what I absolutely loved about it was how moved I was after watching it.  The characters were very real, despite them being animated (and who says animation isn't as valid as live-action...I argue that it can surpass live-action) and all, including the Giant, were lovable.  It doesn't preach anything to the viewer, either.  I also like how the movie combined classic design/animation with high-tech visual effects of the movie.  Superb.  Oh, yeah, and the kids will enjoy it, too.Miss Tran",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great animation for children of all ages,"I fondly remember the short book this movie was based on - ""Iron Man"", which I got from the school book club when I was about 10.  Even coming back to it as an adult it is a great book that engages you emotionally and spiritually. The movie starts the same but becomes completely different about half-way through, which is usually a recipe for disaster.  However, in this case they have updated the story for our times and, if possible, maybe even made it better.  Get this out for your children and watch it with them.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Vin Diesel Effect IS HERE!!,"Vin was totally right for the voice  here.  The movie is animated and very emotional.  There were times when I was reminded of the way I felt when watched ET for the first time.  There are many similarities between this movie and many other NON ANIMATED movies that portray racism and isolation. The poor robot was so likable.  I mean, this is the first time I have ever been so touched by a cartoon and I am 31 years old!  Rent this, or better yet BUY it.  It is a huge success in my book.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Now one of my favourites.,"I rent movies, i rent A LOT OF MOVIES, i rent them within a week of coming out, but sometimes due to various reasons, the odd movie gets missed - but i will eventually rent it some time later.The Iron Giant was one. On DVD Animation looks great, i love the style of animation in The Iron Giant, but with any film after an hour no matter how visually stunning, or how good the sound is - you'll have got used to it, now the story has to be good enough to keep your interest.I'll keep this short, and say The Iron Giant is in my Top 10 films of all time, and that's saying something.WARNING: Do not avoid this film....",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
a great movie!,"this is one of those movies that comes along every 3 years.  a great adventure for the whole family.  it follows hogarth, a lonely boy in the 50s, who is fatherless and lives with his mom.  he discovers a huge iron robot thing (or an iron giant!) and befriends him.  really sad in the end, always makes me cry.  animated movies always make me cry, like the lion king, the prince of egypt (when the spirits kill all the innocent children for not having blood on their doors) and this movie.  i really recommend it. it's really well done and very touching.  it also has a good lesson.  guns kill.9 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantasized Realism & Heartfelt Charm Elevate 1950's Homage,"It's an Odd Animated Film that Failed to Capture Box-Office Gold in 1999, but has since Gained a Huge Following.Charming in its Simplistic Storyline and for that matter it's Animation, the Movie is Familiar with its Boy and His Pet Adventure and its 1950's Sci-Fi, Real-World, Cold-War Paranoia.Newspaper Headlines, Television, Comic-Books, and a Fatherless Child (Dad died in the War), all lend a Sense of Giddy Verisimilitude to the Proceedings.By Today's Standards the Animation can Look a Bit Sketchy at times but it never Loses its Appeal and Cranks Up when it Needs in the Action Sequences. The Script is not Dumbed Down and Respects the Kids Ability to Understand what's Going On, and the Humor is Sharp without being Gross or Slapstick.As a Bonus there isn't one Sappy Song to Distract. Overall, it's Not a Great Animated Movie but it sure has a Classic Feel and Holds Up just Fine.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Masterpiece...,"There's a moment in the Iron Giant where young Hogarth Hughes finally meets the ""metal monster"" his town has been talking about. He is terrified as we all would be by this unknown being, but then it stops in its tracks. It sits down, begins to mimic Hogarth, he teaches it words and they form a bond of trust. Its probably about 45 seconds of screen time, but it transforms the story from one of fear to one of the complex beauty of the human imagination and human connection.The Iron Giant a precursor to Brad Bird's Pixar success with Ratatouille and The Incredibles is a haunting piece that captures history and emotion all in one. It's 1957 with Sputnik orbiting the Earth, everyone is terrified by the Red Scare, the unknown and that beings from other worlds are trying to destroy us. The Giant comes from this unknown world above us and is whispered about with concern, fear and suspicion.But young Hogarth Hughes sees the monster before anyone else does. It's like a child that is lost, he teaches it lessons, nurtures it and gives it a sense of purpose. Both are loners to an extent, and their bond of friendship along with the Giant's transformation is one of the more beautiful bonds you'll see in any film. There is another moment whereThis is not a Disney film with songs or dances. Bird is above that, and instead creates a setting in small-town America that mirrors the feelings of the world in that historical era. Hogarth himself fears how people will see his ""friend"", and the fearsome government agent Mansley captures this attitude of 1950's America in that the unknown is a threat to public safety and that it must be stopped, isolated and removed at all costs.I will try not give away the ending, but all I will say is be prepared to have your heartstrings pulled at. The Giant is remarkable symbol of not judging something before you know it, it has a personality and emotion that experiences pain, joy and sadness and a willingness to do the right thing at any cost. Much like ET, King Kong and even Inside Out there is a moment where something must be given up, in order for the greater good to occur and that we choose our paths no matter what others try to shape us as or determine for us.While the Disney Renaissance broke the mold for modern animation, the Iron Giant does something all of those films(many of which I do love could not.) It teaches us something about the unknown, and that what we fear can actually turn out to be something that isn't trying to kill us or hurt us. Instead, what we fear can be something that transforms our way of thought, and gives people a new sense of hope and resilience in the face of destruction and war.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
