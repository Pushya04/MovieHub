"""Minions"" is a lot of fun and a great family movie, but may be too much of a good thing.","In 2010, Illumination Entertainment released its first animated feature film, ""Despicable Me"", about an evil genius named Gru who was struggling to stay on top of the evil genius business, with the help of his pint-sized henchmen known as minions. That film made over $250 million in the U.S. alone (almost quadruple what it cost), so, naturally, there was a sequel. In 2013, ""Despicable Me 2"" made over $368 million domestically and was rated by audiences as even better than the original. The minions were a small big reason for all that. They were a hit in the first film and they played a larger role in the second film, which performed even better than the first, so, naturally, they got a movie of their own.The minions are child-sized, yellow, pill-shaped creatures whose sole purpose in life is to serve an evil master. Some are a little taller than the others, they have slightly different styles of (sparse) hair, some have two eyes and some have one, but all wear goggles and they speak in a kind of child-like babble which combines English, Spanish, French and possibly bits of a few other languages too (it's kind of hard to tell). Oh, and one more thing – they're simply and completely ADORABLE! In spite of their evil inclinations, these are simple-minded, child-like innocents who mainly want to have fun and fulfill their potential as minions. And they are front and center in ""Minions"" (PG, 1:31).This sequel to the ""Despicable Me"" movies is really a spin-off and also a prequel, which takes us back to the beginning of the minions' story – ALL the way back. We see how the minions originated and, through a short series of vignettes, we observe their well-meaning, but hilariously botched attempts to serve a wide variety of ill-tempered masters throughout history. Finally, they are driven into exile in an ice cave in Antarctica. They build a civilization and do their best to entertain themselves, but without a master to serve, they're unbearably bored. So, in 1968, Kevin (voiced by co-director Pierre Coffin, who does all minion voices), a tall(ish) minion, tells his tribe he's going on a quest to find them a new master. With only the extremely child-like minion (even by minion standards) named Bob, and a ""volunteer"" named Stuart to help, Kevin begins his journey.The three minions end up at Villain Con, a secret convention of super villains and their fans, where the minions meet and get hired by Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), the first female supervillain. Scarlet is taking her typical girlish fantasy of being a princess a little too seriously. She wants her newly-hired helpers to steal the British crown jewels so she can be Queen of England. Scarlet's husband, Herb (John Hamm) sets up Kevin, Stuart and Bob with a variety of his evil inventions and they embark on their mission. Of course, this being the minions, nothing goes according to plan, one thing leads to another, Scarlet feels as if the minions have betrayed her, and she sets out to get revenge on Kevin, Stuart and Bob, while still trying to accomplishing her goal. Meanwhile, the rest of the minions have received word that Kevin has found them a new master in the U.K. and the entire tribe is working to get there ASAP.""Minions"" has a slightly different target audience than the ""Despicable Me"" films and feels like a little too much of a good thing. Don't get me wrong – I LOVE me some minions, but they're schtick can wear thin. Even their powerful minion cuteness can't sustain an entire film. Plus, while the ""Despicable Me"" movies seemed to appeal nearly equally to kids, teens and adults, the minions' spin-off is more squarely aimed at kids. The animation, voice work and story are all as strong as the previous films in which the minions appeared, but the humor in this one aims a little lower. The adults will enjoy the soundtrack and there are plenty of cute, clever, and funny moments. ""Minions"" works well as a family movie, but I think the little yellow guys should stick to being fun, naughty side-kicks. It's what they do best. ""B+""",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A pretty decent film!,"Minions was a pretty good film, I mean the animation was top notch, and the jokes were very good (at some points). The main minions in the film Kevin, Bob and Stuart were fairly funny at times, and the fact that they couldn't speak English added another funny mark to it. If you have seen the Despicable Me franchise, then you probably know who the minions are, but if you haven't seen the Despicable Me franchise, then before you watch Minions, I recommend you see Despicable Me 1 and 2, As that is where they were first introduced to the world. Moving on, some villains in the film, seemed a bit rushed just to get on with the movie, and some of them were unnecessary, but overall they each had their own funny scenes. The main villain Scarlett Overkill, had a crazy personality, and had some good humor which added a nice ring to the film, as well as that the Minions were always there to mess with her, So it was an action packed- family fun film :)Overall: I recommend you watch this, it has some funny moments and is a perfect spin-off to the Despicable Me franchise. I hope you enjoy the film :)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Banana!!!,"Quickie Review:Minions from the dawn of time have always searched to serve the most despicable masters in the world. After failing to keep their masters numerous times, the minions feel without purpose. That's when three brave minions, Kevin, Bob, and Stuart set out on a journey to find their new master. Despicable Me franchise has done a lot of things right, one of which that clicked with all ages were the adorable little minions. This film could've been very basic, continuously rehashing a collection slapstick comedy, and just simply depend on the popularity of the minions. Instead, the creators of this film added heart to the characters, delivering a movie that kids will love and adults will have fun with.Full Review:As much as I love the minions in the Despicable Me movies, I was quite pessimistic on how good Minions was going to be. It just felt like a cash grab. Of course, all movies aim to grab some cash but this movie in particular felt like the studio was just capitalising on the popularity of the characters. Gratefully, the movie got me to set aside my pessimism.One of my biggest concerns was whether a collection of side characters can really carry an entire movie. Short answer as it turns out: yes they can. It works because we are focusing on just three minions for the majority of the movie. Each of them have their unique personality that shines through without a single word of comprehensible dialogue. That in itself is an amazing feat, the minion-gibberish is all non-sense and yet I am able to empathise with them. I can't even say the same for actual human actors in other movies sometimes! So in that sense, job well done animators. I also liked the small story arc that was given to the villain of the movie, Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock). She wasn't a villain just for the sake of it, which added another dimension to what could have been a generic character. There is relatable back story to her that made us understand where she was coming from, while still retaining the unpredictable evil-ness.The movie is not without flaws. There are times where the jokes might be too slapstick for adults to enjoy. These scenes are obviously aimed for the kids. They don't completely alienate us grown-ups but it is still noticeable. On top of that, I have to say I felt the absence of Gru and the kids from the Despicable Me movies. What I love about the minions is their relationship with Gru's family, the pranks, the shenanigans, the care they have for each other, is all so delightful to watch. This absence was bound to happen since we are concentrating on the minions. At the same time, aside from Scarlett Overkill there are no other memorable supporting characters.Even with the problems, I really did enjoy my time watching Minions. It was a great light hearted, charming, fun movie. If you have little kids, nephews or nieces, don't hesitate to take them to the cinema. They will have an awesome time. Together you too will find some amusing entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Delivers on its promise,"""Minions"" doesn't really have anything new to offer, aside from crassly commercializing the yellow side players in the ""Despicable Me"" movies. You sort of accept that going in. Personally, I've always been fond of the little pill-shaped bastards, which is why I enjoyed this movie. It's 90 minutes of exactly what you'd expect from them and it turns out that's enough to sustain a whole movie. The cast is great, despite the miscast Sandra Bullock (not a slight, I like her) and the humor is just right for a light-as-it-gets Summer movie. The '60s setting also worked surprisingly well.Honestly, as toy commercials go, you could do a whole lot worse.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
So fun and cute!,"This animation tells the story of the minions trying to look for an evil master in order to keep up their morale. They find a villain called Scarlet Overkill, and the minions are tasked with stealing the crown from the Queen.I saw the trailer and I thought the ""Minions"" was so cute. After watching the film, I thought it was even cuter than I expected! The plot is silly but fun. The minions are simple in design, and simple in their thoughts, but they manage to create the funniest situations. There are some jokes that made me laugh out loud, such as the usage of a teapot inside a police car. I also just realised that the minions are not talking unintelligible gibberish - it is actually a mix of languages, which I spotted Spanish, German, Mandarin and Bahasa. I enjoyed watching this animation, it is 90 minutes of brain-off entertainment.",,Anonymous,Animation
Below par money spinner,"I don't usually write reviews but this was such a disappointment that I felt I had to put something. Most of the good jokes were shown in the trailers, so if you've seen the trailer then it's probably not worth the money. There were 3 of us watched this and although we all loved the despicable movies none of us enjoyed this. My son (11) said it felt like it was 2 hours long it was so boring. I can't really explain why it came across as so poor - but it just seemed really lazy and without Gru to play against the Minnions were just to simple. It was slapstick with no soul. The music although quite good didn't really seem to fit the film - just seemed to be tacked on at bit were they felt they should have a soundtrack and a famous song. Buy yourself a copy of despicable me and watch it again and again. Much better value for money! This just felt rushed, with loads of stock jokes, maybe hoping enough of them would hit the mark - they didn't.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
The love of my life,"Like the title of my review states, this movie is the love of my life. The limitless amount of perfection in this movie blows my mind till this day.I watched this movie on the day it came out, I had my doubts because the first despicable me movies were decent, but as the story progressed i was driven to the edgy of my seat, waiting on the funky little yellow men their next moves. Stuart Kevin and Bob have kept making my day everytime I rewatch this movie, which has been a total of 13 times so far.I love how the movie starts of with showing how the minions came to be, and. It gave me alot more insight into the minion lore, the way these tiny little yellow men cannot properly survive without the most evil and despicable leader to follow to the point they were driven to depression, was something truly remarkable to see. Kevin's braveness to go into to the world and help his fellow minions to find a boss, gives me hope and motivation to this day. I love how Bob and Stuart join him because it truly makes for a quite hilarious trio.I love how we were able to see where they got their adorable little outfits from after they landed in New York. The introduction of the Nelson family was also amusing to watch! But if we're talking about good introductions I think Gru at the end of the movie takes the spotlight.And how can I not talk about Scarlet Overkill, she took the place of Vector as my favourite Despicable Me franchise villain. Her introduction!! Amazing!! Choosing Sandra Bullock as her voice actress was a fine choice too, she truly brought the character to life.I will continue to recommend this movie to people around me, as will I continue to enjoy this masterpiece. I cannot wait for the second movie, my calender is already marked!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"With visual slapstick and retro quirk, Minions is a light fun comedy","Having mostly gibberish for script, this movie is a prove that visual antics and a few timely noises go a long way to induce laughter. In a throwback to classic setting and comedy, this spin-off might not be bigger than most animations in recent time, but it's still an enjoyable foray. The style of 60s world and era appropriate soundtracks enhance the atmosphere as these peculiar creatures dabble in feeble mischief.Story follows three particular minions on their way to find the most dreadful villain there is. The journey takes them across the globe until they meet Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock). Graphic-wise Minions is presentable. Though not all of the set pieces are magic, some of the displays, such as the rainy night or monarch architecture are still engaging and presented with nifty details.The mostly simplistic nature works well, bringing visual cues and lots of squeaking mumbles. It doesn't use elaborate word plays, but this is actually an advantage as the humor is readily accessible for any casual viewer. Several of the jokes are distinctly amusing, though it doesn't fall flat even when a couple of them don't hit the high note.It also boasts notable pop references of the time, from the ironic quips and its zippy tunes. The human characters can be a bit stereotypical or over-the-top, since these are mostly spoof version of action flick baddies. Its actual villain portrayal might take the name Overkill way too seriously for comical purpose.The presentation for visual humor is fine and the references are easily relatable. Minions is not a cerebral endeavor or emotional adventure, though these awkward yellow simpletons are notoriously delightful.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as Funny as Despicable Me,"The popularity and the huge profits of Despicable Me franchise has driven the eagerness of Illumination Entertainment to produce a minions spin-off solely to entertain the fans. Caught in variations of the same scenarios, the decision to put more focus on the three minions - Kevin, Stuart and Bob might remind audiences about Alvin and the Chipmunks or the three daughters of Gru. While the animation does remain the fun, hilarious and ridiculous behaviors of the characters, the theme of the scores and the nonsensical language of the minions, it does not have a strong villain to support the three, also it lacks of character development, warm emotional engagement and moral values. The cuteness of the minions is the main element for entertainment rather than the dialogue itself in which the jokes aren't as funny as Despicable Me's series. Nonetheless, it is still energetic, actions packed, visually stunning and colorful for family audiences even its creative mistake drags its overall quality, proving that these banana lovers are far more effective and surprising to be supporting characters just as in the main franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious!,"Having read bad reviews I went with low expectations. But as the movie started my laughter overshadowed my expectations.Kevin, Stuart and Bob go on a journey to find a super villain to be their tribe's boss.Yes, the story was predictable and it may not have been as good as Despicable me 1 and 2 but to be honest it really didn't matter. It was amazingly funny and there was not a single moment in which I got bored. Also the jokes were not at all kiddish and would make a person of any age laugh. 3D was also pretty good.So i would recommend you to leave the serious part of your brain at your house and watch this hilarious and light hearted movie of the adorable minions.P.S If you haven't watched the trailer, don't.You will enjoy the movie much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Funny, but that's not it!","So, this movie disappointed me a bit, but not that much.Minions Stuart, Kevin and Bob went on a journey to find a super-villain, which will they serve. On their journey, they went to VillainCon (I think it was called like that) and they started to serve one of the best villains in the world (America), Scarlet Overkill. They helped her to steal a crown.This movie is not that good as Despicable Me, but it's better than Despicable Me 2. In the first one, minions are funnier than in this one called Minions, which is a shame. Of course, this movie is funny, but there are some jokes that are here for the kids. The movie's ending is great. After I saw young Gru and when his theme song started playing, I was being like:""OK, I think this is one of the most awesome movie (animated) I ever saw."" The funniest joke in this movie is when minions came to the VillainCon (again, don't know if it's called like that), and Scarlet came at a stage with her awesome dress, dude dressed like her screamed:""I love you, Scarlet!"" I mean, that was hilarious. Also, I really liked that moment when Scarlet told minions a ""bed-time story"" (which was cruel), Bob fell asleep. Characters (Bob, Stuart and Kevin) are done well in this movie. They have a lot of chemistry together. They are always all together and they are different. Kevin is brave and he is a chief. Bob is like a child. He is playful and scared. And Stuart, nahh... He is just hungry.At the end, this was a really short review, but I have nothing else to say. I mean, jokes were mostly funny, characters have a good chemistry, ending is badass and... That's it. This movie is not that good as I was thinking it'll be, but it was good.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Minions Review,"Alive since the beginning of time, Minions live to serve the biggest, baddest, and most evil. After a series of unsuccessful masters find a way to perish, the Minions no longer have someone to work for, a purpose to live and they all being to grow depressed. But one minion finally decided to do something, Kevin, along with Bob and Stuart venture into the world to find their people a new evil boss to work for. Their search culminates in them meeting Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), the world's first ever evil super villainess.Let's be honest, there wasn't really a need for this movie other than an excuse to put Minions in a movie. This movie will inevitably make lots and lots of money. They're cute, they talk funny, and they act funny. Kids (myself included) loved them from the 2 Despicable Me films and they (and I eventually will) probably have all of the related merchandise. Kids will want to see this one too and get all the eventual merchandise that will come from it.Now to the film! Even though I am an adult, I liked it. I mentioned that I liked the 2 Despicable Me films and the thing I liked the most from them was the Minions. Despite all of these years, they still haven't gotten old for me. But the question is could they carry a movie? The answer is no. Don't get me wrong, I like the Minions and the movie is called Minions but it did not have to focus on them as much as it did. There are other human characters in the film like Scarlet Overkill and her husband Herb (Jon Hamm) and also this family of bank robbers. I felt that they were a little underused and a little more of them would have provided some balance. Another thing that was underused was the narrator. He was used in the beginning of the film just so the viewers can understand what was going on. It could sometimes be difficult to understand what is going on when all you see is a bunch of Minions speaking gibberish. There were moments later on where more explanation would have helped. The story is simple enough. The film is a prequel to the 2 Despicable Me films so it takes place in the 60s so you'll get all the time-appropriate references and a soundtrack with 60s music so you'll get your Beatles, your Who, etc. The slapstick humor will keep the kids entertained and the 60s references will entertain the adults. Some of the reviews have mentioned that the plot is not compelling but I was fine with it. I would have liked it if some of the writing for some of the human characters was a little better. It wasn't terrible but I what I liked about the Despicable Me films was how the human characters interacted with the Minions. If I had to compare this film to the Despicable Me films, this one would place third behind 1 and then 2. I personally can't wait until their next film which will be Despicable Me 3 which comes out in 2017.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Minion$: The Prequel/Spin off Proves that Minions are Great as Supporting Characters Only,"Money over art --this is the undisputed law that Hollywood has churned up, and you can't blame them: who doesn't like money? Unfortunately the audience takes the toll when they are delivered disappointments. Something else that one sees throughout all of Hollywood is the inability to know when to stop. Minions proved to be the perfect showcase for these two ubiquitous aspects of Hollywood.Minions is a prequel/spin off of the loved and critically acclaimed Despicable Me movies. In Minions we are told about the origin of Gru's (Steve Carrell) yellow, banana-loving helpers. The minions' objective in life is to serve the biggest and most evil villain of them all, so throughout history we see them serving (unsuccessfully) such figures like a T-Rex, a caveman, Count Dracula, and even Napoleon (I'm glad they didn't show the minions in the 40s). After decades of inactivity in the North Pole, three brave minions decide to set out and find a new master. These minions are Kevin, Bob, and Stuart, and they trek through all sorts of environments and finally reach 60s New York City, where they find out about Villain-Con where all of the world's villains will gather for an annual convention including the infamous Scalett Overkill (Sandra Bullock).I have to say that the first half of the film had me mesmerized and laughing at the minions and their arguments in gibberish. I can't blame the studios for doing a minion spin-off, since the yellow characters completely stole the show in both Despicable Me films and they were a commercial hit. However, carrying a film out entirely on their own is much more of a challenge than brief sparks as supporting characters. And unfortunately the minions' humor burned out at the halfway point of the film. The story itself, which had been so sophisticated and surprisingly intricate up to that point suddenly took a turn and became a predictable childish lump. The humor started to go on a loop so that every joke was used at least four times by the time the film ended. And I think that this was such a problem because the filmmakers were trying to extend the runtime in order for this to be qualified a film and not a short.However, I don't want to shame the filmmakers at all; it's hard to make a film where the main characters speak a mixture of gibberish, Spanish, Italian, French, and English. I actually admire the bold move of taking basically ""mute"" characters (in the sense that all their dialogue doesn't mean anything) and telling a story in a simple enough way that children can understand it.But even so you cant help but feel that the second half of the film is extremely forced, so much that it takes down the entire film with it. And the ending is too fairytale-ish and ties all the loose ends a bit too conveniently. So overall the film is a bit of a let down, with a strong first half and weak second, but even so it's worth seeing the admirable work of the directors and writers by placing ""mute"" characters in their lead roles.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Banana.. that is all.,"I, like everyone else, love the minions. Since Despicable Me was released they have become a global phenomenon, but what is it about them that is so appealing? After seeing this film i still can't quite put my finger on it, yet I want to see a lot more of these little yellow, pill shaped lunatics who love to punch each other. The appeal is mostly their humour, yet it is something we have seen before. Minions (sort of) explains their origins and where they originated from and makes a solid entry into the franchise that people just can't get enough of.The story follows the Minions from the dawn of time. They were born to serve the biggest, baddest boss. But each boss they serve they end up killing somehow. Eventually the minions get depresses that there is nobody to serve. Kevin, Stuart and Bob take it upon themselves to go out and find their tribe a leader. After an encounter at Villain-Con they meet Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and go on an adventure around London to steal the Queen's crown. Pretty simple, yet this movie ultimately felt bigger than the previous entries. Having no Gru in the film leaves mostly gibberish as the dialogue. Sandra Bullock does a fantastic job as the villainous Scarlet Overkill and i really enjoyed her stop-motion three little pigs story.Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton and Steve Coogan also show up in roles that aren't really integral, but you can tell that each one of them has a lot of fun. At the end of it all though the Minions still keep this as their own movie and give us so many laughs. Some scenes in particular had me laughing a lot and with the humour being mostly visual this can be hard to do but is pulled off well here. One scene involving Stuart's hypno hat and some dancing tower guards had me in stitches and was easily the best part for me. Although one of the flaws i found was that whilst the film certainly feels bigger, some of it just feels unneeded and as if it were filler to make the film longer. With that being said, the film was a perfect length and i found that with Despicable Me 2 as well. It felt like the film was over within an hour, yet was still the longest in the franchise.At the end of the day, this is the minions at their best and if you're one of the very few who doesn't like them then this will not convert you. If you are anybody else i guarantee you some fun with this film. Plus the soundtrack was surprisingly awesome. I give Minions a solid 7.5 out of 10 bananas.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good story line, age to most enjoy film:10 and under","I chose to go see Minions this because I enjoy comedies and also enjoyed Despicable Me before hand. My favorite part of the film would have to be the ending, this is because it was the most dramatic and action packed part of the film! Showing a scene of loyalty, definitely a great finale.I also liked the fact that it linked with the film Despicable Me, creating a twist. I found the characters e.g. Bob, Stuart and Kevin (The main 3 Minions) very hilarious, I also found the main villain Scarlet misleading and cunning. These two types of characters, add an extra element of comedy to the film.I would have enjoyed it if I where younger and around the age 9 or 10 and I recommend it to a younger audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great characters with amazing animation and a hilarious script.,"Perhaps I am a little biased in my opinion of this film, as I loved the two Despicable Me movies, plus the minions was a theme for my residence floor last year. So as you see, I have a personal affiliation with the minions. I really enjoyed this.The story is simple but not boring or over-exaggerated. There are many little happenings throughout the film that add to the atmosphere and overall mood of the film. Choosing to focus on three minions (though I miss Dave) was a good call. The three different personalities – not to mention shape size – of these minions were so prominent and well established that instead of being 'minions' they were Kevin, Stuart and Bob. Kevin being the older brother, Stuart the rock star and Bob the most lovable.The animation was great with good effects and colours that matched the theme of the film. However, I do have to disagree with the extreme body sizes of some characters. Most have too tall and skinny bodies; Walter Nelson (Michael Keaton) and Herb Overkill (Jon Hamm) both look like a human version of 'Daddy long legs'. I guess however, that this adds to the impossibility element of the film.The voice acting was pretty awesome. I love Sandra Bullock, and she did great here, I almost couldn't recognize her voice in some places. She gave great energy to her character, as did Jon Hamm and Michael Keaton. I did not recognize Jennifer Saunders as The Queen, but it did sound familiar, and she was funny. But obviously the spotlight goes to Pierre Coffin and his marvellous gibberish minions talk. There is notably a lot of Spanish words and phrases in the minions speech in addition to many other languages that seem to just fit in randomly here and there. I was pleasantly shocked to hear Bob say 'Terima Kasih' which means thank you in Malay. Mad props to Coffin, to be able to voice the minions in a way that can be distinguishable between the three main characters.Maybe the reason I like this so much is because there is less obvious talking and more inferencing of what the minions are talking about. Because even though we do not understand them in the literal sense, we can still infer as to what they are referring to.This movie is more about having fun than anything else and I enjoyed it thoroughly.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A bundle of silly fun.,"By the time the end credits rolled on the first Despicable Me, the gibbering, yellow henchmen had already outgrown their malevolent master. Finally (and unsurprisingly) getting their own movie, this prequel begins with a clever montage charting the evolution of the eponymous critters as they follow one doomed boss after the other. Settling in to the 1960's for the bulk of the adventure, this whimsical comedy focuses on three brave minions who journey to Orlando – for a villains-convention of course – then London, in search of another boss. Not all the jokes work and chief new addition Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock) lives up to her name in the worst possible sense, but the gag rate is so high there is still a healthy dose of laughs. The trademark minion chatter has evolved with an increase in recognisable words but remains just as amusing, whilst the cheeky visual gags and hidden references ensure there's humour for all ages. Where this film differentiates itself from the Despicable flicks though, is by homing in on, and adding depth to, a specific trio of minions: optimistic leader Kevin, laidback crooner Stuart and the indefatigable ball of joy Bob. Another bonus for the parents in the crowd is the ridiculously good soundtrack featuring classics from The Beatles, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, The Turtles, The Kinks, Aerosmith and The Who, to list but a few. More of a carefree, in-the-moment joyride rather than an animated heavyweight with lasting power, Minions is a bundle of silly fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Playfully Aimless,"2013's Despicable Me 2 has proved that people came back to this franchise for the striking popularity of the film's comic relief characters, the Minions. So the studio basically made a spin-off mainly for them, which makes more sense than having these characters stealing the predecessor's spotlight, thus leads to a result that can be good and mostly bad. It seems that the filmmakers don't have much of a decent idea for the original character for a while, so it's quite appropriate for them to stumble into these Minions while it lasts. Unfortunately, the film doesn't find a compelling storyline for these antics to fit right through. While the gags are funny enough, it suddenly gets exhausting after a while. In the end, there is just nothing remarkable about it.The Minions happen to be long-living prehistoric creatures that exist to serve any formidable master, in spite of their often incompetence. It's a decent little origin story, even though we would rather assume them as an accidental science experiment. But this makes for a setup of putting them in desperation for having a boss after a number of failures of keeping them alive. Now that the actual plot enters the picture, the movie now takes place where supervillains are the ones who deserve them, with three of the Minions stumbling from one misadventure to another. The laughs are solid, though some can feel a little forced while some can be unexpectedly tasteless, but a joke works if the film actually finds an inspired humor within itself. But the main story itself doesn't find any remarkable substance or any cleverness, at all. It's just randomness after randomness, and it's sometimes losing its steam until the film finally finds another occasional great joke again after ten minutes or so.The comedic action on screen is undeniably enjoyable. The bright, playful visuals have always been helpful in these Despicable Me movies. The movie centrally takes place in a new environment and time, while adequately captures the era and location, though also making unimaginative stereotyping to the British culture, but anyway. Some dark humor sneaks in, as well, it gets a little too outrageous, but I believe it's for the sake of establishing its world of villainy. The story eventually not gaining much of a center at all. These series of silly situations lead to the fate that we would all expect. Nothing more and nothing less. The voice acting is only impressive when it comes to the Minions, we all knew that already from the past installments. The rest of the cast are committed to go over-the-top as their characters are actually written.In spite of extending the focus of these characters who are more popular than Gru, it's still not quite a satisfying experience. Maybe the Minions aren't meant to have a movie at all. It would have been a kid's TV show being played in the morning or something. Or the story would have given itself more effort in sticking these comedic moments with coherency. It's possible. Earlier this year, Aardman proved that physical comedy still works in this era of more verbal animated films and can be consistent in narrative. But the film seems too aimless to realize that. It's only pandering the audience until they are interested with Gru again for the third Despicable Me, only if that sequel could offer more than this.",,Anonymous,Animation
Definitely NOT funny and a little inappropriate,"I watched this with my 5 year old and must say: so disappointed.It's a little violent at some places and weird. In one scene there were three guards dancing, throwing their clothes in the air and then spanking each other.Yeah, so i wish I could rate this movie less than one star.I might be over-reacting but this is completely INAPPROPRIATE for kids younger than at least 6.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really Fun,"I'll like to start this off by saying that Minions was much more than what i expected. At first i thought this movie wasn't gonna make sense at all , it thought it was just gonna be these little devils going around without a care in the world but thank God I was wrong.The Minions had a purpose for every action they did and that's something i really like. They movie was really entertaining and it had me laughing all the way.It doesn't matter your age guys, these movie is for everyone who wants to have some fun and for parents this could be a great change to connect and share happy moments with their children. Go paint yourself yellow wear some blue overalls get some goggles and watch the minions you wont regret it.tip: the movie has already made over 400 million dollars worldwide",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not as heartwarming as the Despicable Me films but, it's hilarious!","Minions is a movie that tells the origin story of the cute, yellow, goggle wearing creatures that gained massive popularity in Despicable Me(2010) & Despicable Me 2(2013). The Minions(Pierre Coffin) have been on Earth, far longer than humans have. They have only one purpose. Find the baddest & most despicable super-villain of all time. Their journey to find the baddest boss takes them on a long & tumultuous adventure. Finding a boss wasn't difficult. However, keeping a boss turned out to be particularly hard due to one hilarious mishap after another. Finally, three Minions namely, Kevin, Stuart & Bob take the initiative to make sure all the Minions have the most evil & despicable boss to work for. This leads the trio to, Scarlett Overkill(Sandra Bullock). Scarlett has nefarious plans to take over the world, with the help of Kevin, Stuart & Bob.Minions is an extremely funny movie. This is thanks to the goofy antics of the adorable titular characters. I loved the idea of a Villain Con. This film had me guffawing throughout its run-time. However, it lacks the heart & emotional depth of the Despicable Me movies. Characters like, Gru, Margo, Edith & Agnes are missed. Don't worry though. The Minions, with their mildly understandable gibberish & various idiosyncrasies will make this film thoroughly enjoyable for the whole family. Though most of the gags involving the Minions get repetitive, it still manages to crack you up, every single time. The animation & 3D are fantastic. Sandra Bullock is brilliant as Scarlett Overkill. Jon Hamm is amazing as Herb Overkill. Michael Keaton is spectacular as Walter Nelson. Allison Janney is awesome as Madge Nelson. Steve Coogan is good as Professor Flux/Tower Guard. Jennifer Saunders is outstanding as The Queen. Geoffrey Rush is great as the Narrator. I loved Steve Carell's cameo as Young Gru. Last but not the least, Pierre Coffin steals the show as The Minions. A must watch for all fans of the Despicable Me franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
What a garbage movie,"I just saw this movie with my 5 year old, even he was unimpressed. Despicable me 2 had him do the bee do thing for days. He's already forgotten about this one and we're watching cartoons now. Such a large marketing campaign, such fan fare, such boat loads of horse, over this BS. Nothing but silly noises and stupid story line. Even the older kids in the theater were like what. Movie got repetitive and boring very quickly. You have such an excellent idea and product here, why waste it like this. The minions are everywhere, ice cream, cereal box, underpants, happy meal, not a thing without them, and they are lovely and adorable characters. The kids will love them if you can please have a story line instead of them running around making noises. Please do a better job with Despicable 3.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Boring at first but gets so much better.,"I saw Minions the day it came out and there are some things I I love about this film but at the same time I do have some issues with it.Good points:1. It was really good to see something focusing on the Minions. Audiences for a long time have wanted to see something revolving around them and when we got it, there was no disappointment.2. Scarlet Overkill acts and sounds like a Bond movie villain but for a kids movie. Which as a fan of James Bond films, I loved very much.3.The British stereotypes in this film are brilliant and just downright hilarious, and mind you this is coming from a British guy himself. It also felt like they were poking fun at the stereotypes as well.Bad points:1. The film takes about 20 minutes to get underway. I honestly thought I was going to hate this film at first but the moment the Minions get to Villain Con then things improve drastically.2. It's obvious that quite a lot of the jokes in the movie are aimed at children. This annoyed me at some points but there were also jokes and not just funny but hilarious scenes in there for everyone to enjoy as well.Final rating: 8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Less despicable, more adorable and very delightful","A spin off of Despicable Me tells the origin of Gru's minions (who I always assumed he created in his lab) as they attempt to find a suitable evil master. A few years before Gru, the minions find Scarlet overkill voiced by Sandra Bullock.At first I was not sure about Scarlet, but she turned out to be pretty evil overall.It was a fun little movie that lives up to the popularity of the Despicable Me franchise and a cool extension of it, but not as charming without Gru leading the minions, it kinda misses it's point.There suppose to be evil minions yet there so cute and cartoony you can't help but to smile through out the film.One really cool thing about the minions is that they always do some really cool stuff in 3D, so it's worth seeing in 3D.Cheers to Universal for milking the success of their animated blockbuster, with a spin-off movie with a good story line a great villain, and some great animation.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
It can be a great movie or a horrible movie depending on what your expectations are,"To start off, I came into this movie expecting it to be bad from the previous reviews. I went with my little brothers to see this movie, and I was actually satisfied with the movie. My 5 year old brothers are minion super fans, and they laughed a lot in this movie. All of the jokes are more slapstick and mainly for kids. I would definitely say that the two ""Despicable Me"" movies are better, however, this movie is about cute yellow characters who speak a bit of English, a bit of Spanish, and a bit of gibberish. The ""Minions"" movie is made for kids, so remember that. If you go into the theater expecting a good movie with a rich plot, boy, will you Be disappointed! However, if you are going in with your kids or siblings just so they would be entertained, you will be very happy. It deserves a 7.5 out of 10, but if I had to choose, it would round down to 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Super Cute.,"Minions isn't as great a story as Despicable Me, but it's definitely a lot of fun. It's just a silly little story, giving some background to the little corn pops.I really had a good time watching it. There's lots of goofy action, and thank god, it wasn't full of stupid bathroom humour. It was actually pretty funny. The kids will like it.My favourite part of the movie was the soundtrack. The movie takes place in the 60s, so the songs comes from that era. It's going to introduce so many kids to a lot of good music, and you can never go wrong with that, especially nowadays.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Relive the minion idiocy,"Those lil' yellow awesome dumb creatures are back. This time with their cuteness, (Bob), their intelligence (Kevin) and their guitar (Stuart). Their mission – to find the greatest villains of all times. So primarily to seek their purpose in life. Isn't that something we endeavor to do? Minions goes back to its origin and tries to portray 'the how' in the backdrop of the credits. Some of the beginning parts were pretty much included in the trailer itself. There is a narration that helps you understand the whole point like a diegesis (since you can't make out what any of the minion is saying) which dies out pretty soon.The story is pretty vacuous, if you closely look at it. Nothing much that it has. Seems like a child giving wings to his imagination. You know that it's stupid but you still watch to see what's next. It concludes at an interesting juncture, which as a matter of fact, everybody saw coming.Humour is mostly slapstick. Weird things keep happening, and you can't really ask why. It beats logic. You just have to accept it and gulp everything that goes beyond the point of explanation.The movie is a bland spin-off solely intended to rake in moolahs, which I am pretty sure everybody is aware of. It's just that these lil creatures are so cute and adorable that we want to see more of them. Even if there is nothing much for them to do, watching them talk, fall, be themselves, simply makes our day.So if you don't feel intelligent lately, you have got yourself a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cute but not Despicable.,"""Doesn't it feel so good to be bad?"" Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock voice)Well, I'm feeling ""bad"" because I just saw Inside Out, and Minions is no Inside Out. Inside Out is insightful about the emotions of a pre-adolescent girl, and all of us by extension, yet Minions is a sometimes cute, lightweight animation about goggled, puny pills who speak child-like gibberish that now and then throws in a discernible word like ""boss."" As for insight, there is little, like the little people themselves.A ""boss"" is what the little travelers are searching for through history until they find permanence with the meanie of the Despicable franchise. The Minions want to serve the worst person in the world, a little like Republicans looking for a leading candidate in a crowded field. Although Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock voice) is a worthy candidate, no one can compete with Gru (Steve Carell).Along the way of history, the best part of the film for me, they encounter notables like T-Rex and Napoleon, who suffer the danger of the little ones' benign benevolence, always tempered by their colossal ignorance. The funniest for me is their exposing Dracula to direct sunlight.The most likable historical figure for me is the current Queen Elizabeth (Jennifer Saunders), whose toothy joie de vivre best exemplifies the light-hearted view of history fostered by directors Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin. The tour of London stereotypes, structures and people, is basic but welcome to this Anglophile.The best insight into humanity is the child-like character of the minions themselves, whose anarchic behavior is not unlike that of most terrible two's.My disappointment with Minions may stem from my being a language person frustrated by the animators' attempt to relay emotion and meaning, a la Chaplain and Wall-E, without words. These pill-shaped heroes don't do it for me except to say, ""Well, at least I'm cute.""",,Anonymous,Animation
That is sad.,"What fun characters mouthing multi-language pseudo-meaninged gibberish (as opposed to just gibberish).What a great start with a series of interesting minion history snippets (all of them already in the trailer - yes, those are the best bits and nothing else in the rest of the movie comes close).What frustration when the gear just gets stuck - and the whole thing numbingly grinds into predictable land with uninteresting plot, an array of boring characters  blah blah  and ends up just another multimillion gibberish animation.After the first 10 mins, Minions is plagued by too many unnecessary pointless characters, plain villains, inconsequential dialogue and actions  and the boredom (and depression) that the Minions experience on screen is unfortunately also paralleled at the same time by the audience and never really lifted up after that.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A different perspective for you folk,"I live under a rather large rock. I don't have TV reception and I am horrible with pop culture. I just follow movies, obsessively, and that has only been for the last two years. So in my world, until not long ago I had no idea what the Minions were. I now feel a little foolish, as for once my friends answer 'yes' when I mention the last film I saw. This is not the normal reaction I get. Apparently this movie is a massive deal. But none of this bothers me. Is this a good film to become a child again for 90 minutes while giggling yourself stupid? Well... A thousand times yes!! I even find the very purpose of their existence to be a funny, somewhat dark joke. They live to serve tyrants. If these guys were people, they'd have served in the S-freakin-S. Which the movie conveniently ignores when going through the Minions' history, good decision. But hey, they are little, adorable yellow things so its hard to ever picture them in a bad way. They just want to help! Even if it is the SS! This film is filled with slapstick comedy, which is great for all ages, while there are some great jokes early on for older viewers: my favourite, a giant poster saying ""A MAN YOU CAN TRUST"", and under those letters is a giant face of Nixon. Ha!! There is a lot packed in here, but if it has a flaw, and it does, it is the second half. Sandra Bullock sounds like she phoned in her effort - literally - and the humour simply wasn't as rife as it was during the first half.The best thing about Minions is it is achingly funny, the second half still great, but not compared to the first, which is simply a riot. I love the fact that their language can be gibberish, but we can follow what they are saying most of the time. I find it to be an amazing achievement honestly, especially given it is animated. But the truly great thing about this movie is it is 90 minutes of being a child again. Personally this is kind of great for me, as I have zero memories from before I was thirteen. So to watch a movie that truly makes me feel like a child, in the best possible sense, is a damn good experience.jordy www.epilepticmoondancer.net",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Pretty Funny Movie, Not Amazing","This minions is great as usual for its jokes and slapstick comedy with the world's funniest tube-like creatures since the Weebles. It's visually amazing, which one would expect from Illumination pictures but lacks a good story akin to the first Despicable Me film in the series. Many will argue that a good story doesn't matter for the Minions to be entertaining. This is mostly true. Perhaps it's because the film came out running neck and neck with amazing storied films like Inside Out and Home. I wanted to get into the story at least a little bit. I really had no interest in the story of the Minions. It has many holes in it and so much is left unexplained. For example, how long do they live and are these the same ones we see with Gru that are with the T- Rex?The film works as a set of short films, if taken that way. I think it would have been better to leave out the history and the evil villain played by Sandra Bullock. Watching the little guys hit and slap each other is fun without any need for an underlying story. The one provided is so fragmented and under-developed, it's hard to stay focused on the proved comedy of the Minions.I wanted to say I liked this film more than all the reviewers saying it's awful. I can't really recommend it as amazing. This, the slapstick stuff everyone loved is there even in the absence of a decent story. Hopefully animation movie makers will try and get a powerful story along with stunning visuals. They go hand in hand for truly great films.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"7--Good for the Kids, Not so Much for the Adults","It's an animated spin-off film starring creatures that talk gibberish. Obviously you shouldn't be asking for much with a movie like that. But that shouldn't be an excuse for this film to be average. I really liked the first Despicable Me movie, and the second one was OK to me. (In my opinion, it didn't live up to it's predecessor). With ""Minions"", I was cautiously optimistic.This movie made me think of another animated spin-off that came out a while ago, ""Penguins of Madagascar"". They both suffer from similar issues. Both films feature the antics of (previously-supporting) cast members who mostly provided comic relief. While the minions just mess around and spout nonsense, there still was opportunity to maybe tell a story with them. Unfortunately, the filmmakers failed to do this as best as they could have.The Nelson family were an amusing bunch of characters, but I think their roles should've been expanded. As they're the first humans Kevin, Stuart, and Bob meet, they should've had more importance and influence on them. The minions are so impressionable, yet the Nelson's don't leave any lasting influence or mark? Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Herb are both fun characters, but neither of them are ever fully developed or made unique in any way. The minions themselves are what you'd expect.The plot of the movie revolves around villains attempting to steal the Queen's crown. Herb's gadgets make this relatively easy, but if he had them all along, why didn't Scarlet use them to steal the crown earlier? She's very capable, but for some reason lets the minions do the work for her. Why?I think one of the main reasons this movie exists is to sell merchandise--particularly toys. ""Minions"" is ultimately a dumb, but harmless kid film. It doesn't live up to the first two Despicable Me movies. It's definitely not as good as Inside Out, which came out a few weeks ago. But if you want to watch it, I recommend renting it or seeing it on Netflix.I have reviewed 40 movies (on Metacritic and IMDb), some recent ones, including: Inside Out, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Fast and Furious 7, The Divergent Series: Insurgent, Taken 3, and more. I also review TV shows.Notes: The minions' submissive nature and tendency to have a villainous master was actually a pretty interesting concept IMO. It had never occurred to me that the minions had actively sought out masters; in 'Despicable Me' they are all just shown to be employed by Gru and their origins are never really explained.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Cute, Minion Fun, Lacking A Lot Of Other Elements","We've all had moments where we speak gibberish, but none of us match the skill level of babbling utter nonsense like the Minions of Despicable Me. The cute, cuddly, yellow bodied blobs have entertained for the past few years with their antics, communicating in their special language that remains undecipherable to me this day. Turns out they are so popular Hollywood has decided to give them their own movie, one that is sure to provide hours of fun for all ages alike. So with all the advertisement and hype, you may be wondering what this movie has in store. Fortunately I am here to help, so sit back and read the latest review.If I were to summarize this movie in one word it would be CUTE. The animation studio has managed to bring all the cuddliness of Gru's henchmen and unleash it tenfold on the screen. Sure there were some adorable moments in Despicable Me movies, but Minions takes it to the next level with squeaky voices, petite faces and huggable goodness. Boys and girls, men and women of all ages will be awing as our three heroes traverse the elements to find their new boss. Bob in particular was the cutest as he jumps into the adventure with eager eyes, and a beat up teddy bear. In truth it is like watching three small children go on an impossible voyage, constantly failing, but doing so in a manner that pulls at your heart strings.Minions is also a very happy and energetic movie, the youthful antics of the minions bringing a positive vibe to the theater that you feed on. The movie is simply fun, the pint sized aspiring villains living life to the fullest as they explore the city. Because of their enhanced biology, or whatever force makes them nearly invincible, the sky is the limit for what troubles they can get into. Normal devices that are meant to be horrifying, or extremely violent have now been diluted to playground level fun, sugar coated with the Minion cuteness to distract from their true meaning. Bombs, guns, bank robbing, etc, it's all just a big game run by naïve munchkins and a world full of extreme personalities that make for very one dimensional characters.Surely you are asking one thing in your mind though, is it funny? The answer is yes, Minions is definitely a humor filled movie targeted for the young and young at heart. Slapstick comedy unfolds as the Minions pull off three stooges ploys as they slap, crush, and blow up everything around them. Their klutziness, and again their versatile bodies, allows reality to be shattered and for them to survive anything. As you can guess the Minions gibberish is also very entertaining, the random babbling made funny in the delivery as they add their voice modifications to the mix. Again Bob has the funniest sounds, as his high pitched squabble makes him my favorite. Voices and slapstick aside, the funniest aspect for me are the built in references to the movie in terms of song and movie numbers. I spent my time trying to figure out what movies the scenes were from, having to rely on my mentor to help fill in some of the details, especially those that were about classic bands or plays. Whatever source you find funny, let it be known that Minions is going to get you chuckling at some point in the film. HoweverLike everything there is a balance that is greatly needed in its film and the major downfall of this movie is doing too much of one thing. First the gibberish thing, it's nice to get that ridiculous language in spurts like in Despicable Me, but in this movie it took too much focus. A lack of dialog was annoying, the mindless gibberish losing its appeal to me, especially when there was a lack of supporting dialog to relieve us from the antics. The slapstick saved it somewhat, the variety in the comedic situations assisting with keeping things fresh. My friend pointed out that Minion antics are fun in small doses, which this movie abuses. The young and obsessed won't care, but I could have used a better story to ground the adventure a bit. The simplistic tale was also not the most thrilling, the tale very formulaic and lacking in character development. Even the villain Scarlet Overkill didn't hold much strength, and was thrown to the back behind the minions. In addition, about half the movie had been revealed in the six trailers they have shown, especially the fun opening, but the parts that weren't ruined are still entertaining. The limited voice acting is decent, but when all you are doing is babbling like an idiot, there isn't much to really be impressed with, even with the great Sandra Bullock leading the group.Minions is the adventure you are all expecting it to be, a mashup of cute, positive, fun that will have you chuckling most of the way. Chances are if you are obsessed with the little guys in Despicable Me, you are going to find no fault in this movie. However, Minions leaves a lot to be wanted, including story, character development, and some more clever humor that could work with the language. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed myself with a lot of the humor here, but my scores have to entail everything. I recommend a trip to the theater with a group, or taking your young ones, but please don't be persuaded to see the 3-D version.My scores are: Animation, Comedy, Family: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Three Stooges meet 60's Music,"Minions!!!Three Stooges meet 60's music. Really simplistic plot (if any) that likely will put off adults. This is not Despicable Me, Wall-E or Incredibles, it is more of a classic cartoon - fun but pointless. Frenetic enough comic action for little ones. Enough rude & crude stuff for older kids. Great soundtrack of 60's music for grandparents (with a really disturbing but funny performance of ""Hair"".). There are many slow parts that I guess are directed at adults, and I was surprised my theater full of toddlers didn't get bored during those.None of the families with kids stayed through the credits, missing out on the ""cast"" party set to The Beatles ""Revolution"" - loaded with (as the Muppets put it) cheap 3D gimmicks. Unlike Wall-E there was no visual action through the credits roll to keep anyone's attention, which is a shame because the post credit madness was well done fun.I give it a B-.

'Minions' Lets Its Lovable Heroes Loose,"Let's get this out of the way first: Minions is silly, nonsensical and completely designed as a marketing device to sell toys or other assorted merchandise bearing the goggled eyes of its childish leads. The story is mostly just an excuse to let the franchise's most popular asset run amok, and those searching for greater meaning are already on a fool's errand. Of course, there's still undeniable fun to be had by joining these little guys on a whirlwind adventure that spans the globe, and despite the fact that many of the plot developments are slapdash in their execution, the Minions encounter a number of laugh-out-loud moments that will have kids giggling uncontrollably even when their parents elicit only a chuckle or two.For the full review, visit my site.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really quite disappointing,I was really looking forward to this after really enjoying Despicable Me and Despicable Me II.If this had been a standalone film rather than a spin off i'd say it would warrant 7 out of 10 but following on from the minions being major highlights in both Despicable me movies this was really disappointing.Just not enough of the silly shenanigans from the minions that you'd expect and a lot of quite pointless and quite frankly boring dialogue in parts.I'm taking my nephews to go see this soon and I really doubt it'll hold there attention - that's how boring it is.....Disappointed.,5.0,Anonymous,Animation
So much fun it's a crime.,"Does Minions have a solid story? NO. Well rounded characters? NO. A touching message? NO. OH WHO CARES! Minions did have one thing in spades, FUN! Those little guys who stole the background of Despicable Me have their own spin off/prequel, and it is everything I expected. Jokes jokes jokes and more jokes surrounding those wacky Minions. I got a lot of enjoyment from Kevin Bob and Stuart, and the zany world they inhabit. The 3D was well used, and you can tell Illumination sunk more money into the animation on this one. Thankfully the wonderfully quirky character designs that made the first two so memorable are here as well(although I would have preferred the backgrounds to have received the quirky styles of the first two as well, but we can't have everything.)Minions opens with an explanation of the Minions origin, perhaps the highlight of the film is this period of about ten minutes which is a total gem. Flash forward to 1968(the film is brimming with references to the year which may, or may not, add to your enjoyment if you get them) and the Minions need a new evil master. So Kevin, the most intelligent and intrepid of the Minions, decides to venture forth in search of one, aided by the innocent Bob and inept Stuart. The trio meets up with Scarlet Overkill, the baddest villain of them all who takes them into her service.It loses energy about three fourths of the way through the picture, and is about fifteen minutes too long, making this the weakest of the Despicable Me films. Having said that, it was still a very amusing film that does absolutely no harm to the Despicable Me franchise. This is exactly what you would expect from a Minions movie, a delightfully warped world where those yellow weirdos entertain with their childish antics to bring a smile to your face.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"don't be so serious, the film's about  bald headed children with jaundice!","Call us crazy, but we love the Minions, so much so that we aren't even a little mad that Gru's sidekicks from Despicable Me got their own film.Since the dawn of time there have been itty-bitty yellow beings known as Minions looking for an evil villain to serve. After various wicked masters fail to liveup to expectations, Bob, Kevin and Stuart venture out into the world in the 1960s to find their most despicable master.The Minions film is exactly what you would expect from these gibberish speaking quirky little fellows. And in that regard, there really isn't much to say. They get into crazy conundrums but their odd antics always end up working in their favor, somehow. There's plenty of silly humor to keep the kiddies giggling, but the jokes aren't completely idiotic so that adults might enjoy themselves as well. The plot does lose a lot of steam once the Minions encounter Scarlett Overkill and pursue villainous adventure in England.I might be biased here because I've been speaking the exact same dialect of Minionese since before I even knew Minions existed, but I can totally get down with these crazy dudes. Not a break out hit like its 2010 predecessor, the third film of the franchise that delves into prequel territory is still surprisingly charming and funny enough to satisfy audiences.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

This movie is bad even by kid standards and, frankly, I don't think they could've managed to ruin the Minions any better.

The ""villainesse"" is boring, overdone and, frankly, unforgettable for how bad she is. Even the Minions are boring (how they accomplished that is beyond me).

"The minions have their spin off movie, and with it, lots of moolah from massive merchandising","It has come to this – we are giggling ourselves silly at some yellow blobs which speak gibberish.If we had to be the ones to jog your memory, here goes. In 2010's Despicable Me and its 2013 sequel, the protagonists were Gru (voiced by the ever reliable Steve Carell) and his three adopted daughters Margo, Edith and Agnes. How many would actually remember the names of these characters? What you probably brought home were memories of the yellow minions, which, to be fair, are adorable in their blabberish ways.Oh, you also brought home lots of merchandise (admit it: you have an irresistible urge to join the long queues to own every one of those plastic yellow fast food toys), and boasted to your friends how much you love the minions. As a lead up to this prequel and spin off to the original movies, have you collected all three limited edition yellow cases containing banana flavoured candy?Ah, the power of marketing, cuteness and gibberish.So what's in store for viewers in terms of, well, story development? It's sort of like Batman Begins, actually (we kid you not!) because it explains the origins of these yellow creatures. History has it that minions have existed since the beginning of time, evolving from one single celled organisms. They only have one purpose in life: to serve the villainous masters. You probably didn't know T Rex, Genghis Khan, Napoleon and Dracula were served by these creatures, and had their lives destroyed by them too.The brief but cheeky introduction is really the best bit of the 91 minute movie. Sad thing is, you probably have watched the scenes in the marketing trailers. Moving forward, the minions fell into depression and over the centuries, they managed to remain cute, but never managed to pick up a proper language. Before long, three of them (you can be sure viewers will remember their names long after the credits roll: Kevin, Stuart and Bob) find themselves in New Yorkto serve the world's first female super villain, Scarlet Overkill. Their adventures begin, crossing paths with Queen Elizabeth II and her crown, as well as the mythical Excalibur from the tale Sword in the Stone.Sounds like a whole lot of fun? For the kids, that's a guaranteed yes. The misadventures of the minions are funnier than the humour from your average weekend morning cartoons. The minions, needless to say, continue to spout nonsensical blabber, and that should have viewers chuckling too.It is evident that this movie is a money milking cash cow when you see stars like Sandra Bullock voicing Scarlet Overkill (nothing particularly spectacular here, by the way), Jon Hamm as her inventor hubby (his character is a little more fun to watch), and Michael Keaton and Allison Janney as a rather underused bank robbing couple. Geoffrey Rush narrates the story of how the minions have travelled through time, while co director Pierre Coffin is the best voice actor of them all, providing the countless gabbling lines (listen out for something close to home towards the end of the movie!) to entertain his viewers. Big Hollywood names and colourful animation should get the adults' attention, if they aren't already going gaga over the cuteness of the minions already.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beginning of the movie is boring get way better later on,"I was really looking forward to this movie. This movie review was really hard to write because it had some really good moments and some really bad moments. That's why it took my since opening day to write about it. The begging was really slow really just in my opinion just random stuff to fill in because they did not have enough story footage. I almost fell asleep during the begging because the first 29-30 minutes were as boring as heck, but I am glad I stayed up because it got a lot more interesting as it went. Some good things about this movie is that it focused mainly on the minions, it's nice that they choose them because they are really in the shadows in the first 2 movies. After the boring first 30 minutes they had a good storyline. Some bad things where that in the begging it had to much time to fill so they choose to peeling the boring mounts with minions. Also it took 30 minutes for me to get interested in the movie. If you take young kids to this they won't even notice the beginning.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Milking/Stretching a Franchise With A Poor Story, Insipid Comedy and Forcefully Injected 'Cuteness'","Long story short, the movie is about how the minions started out and came to work for Gru. For everyone who liked despicable me and were mildly disappointed by Despicable me 2, watch your expectations and emotions associated with the franchise go down the drain in the latest edition designed mainly to get you to buy more minion merchandise for your kids because they won't stop crying in the 'kids' aisle.Remember the gibberish from the minions that you used to find cute in the movies that were mostly in English? Get ready to labor through 90 minutes of it while trying to understand a convoluted plot with the texture of swiss cheese, ignoring obvious plot holes and conveniences and trying to force out an 'awwwww' between gritted teeth as you try hard not to yawn or beat yourself up for wasting your money on this movie. The acting is hard to focus on because of all the other boring and predictable influences in the movie. Enjoy seeing the minions in adorably mortal peril knowing full well that they're going to make it, having seen them in the initial movies.Plot: 1/10 Acting: who cares? Cuteness: 3/10 Comedy: worse than dad jokes Animation: what about it? Overall: 1/10P.S. stay home, buy a minions plushie and burn the $6 you'll spend on the movie instead.

Extravagant and perfect forever.,"Beautiful, amazing, excellent, extraordinary, the best movie of 2015. Every time I saw those brilliant yellow pill men I felt a dopamine rush better than any hard drug could ever provide. The world was happier and more colorful after I watched it. I fear if I continue watching it I'll go blind on color and drunk on joy. I can NOT express how amazing this movie is. It WILL play at my funeral on repeat and I'm 89% sure it would revive me right out of that coffin. If I had a genie I would use all three wishes to experience Minions for the first time again. If this movie is taken off the face of the earth I will search every corner of the galaxy to find even a glimpse of its up most beauty and perfection. This movie takes you on a breathtaking journey with the minions in their quest to find a new villain to fallow. With highs and lows the minions push ever harder to find the most evil villain.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Festival of Pure Silly Joy and Nothing Else,"""Minions"", the spin-off everyone has been waiting for! Over the years, we've grown to be very fond of those yellow pesky yet lovable Minions who speak Gibberish and are very well-known for their carefree and silly antics. This time, they finally get to become the main stars of a 90-minute feature and honestly, they delivered what they were known for, their carefree and silly antics, and nothing else.""Minions"" starts out with an overview of the origin of the Minions (sort of). It explains that they are creatures whose purpose is to serve the baddest villain. But they always have hard time keeping their masters since their efforts to help them always unintentionally leads their masters to a not-so-good fate. The failure to find a master leads them to a depression and one Minion (Kevin?) decides to bring some of his friends along to find a new villain to serve, that is Scarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock).The movie itself is quite fun. It has plenty of laughs, and even if the majority of the laughs are slapstick comedy, the Gibberish spoken by the Minions are always something to giggle on. They do silly stuff. Their interactions with humans are fascinating and funny. They run into ridiculously impossible situations yet somehow manage a way to find solve it. It's hilarious. The gadgets are visually dazzling and cool to look at, but everything else was a bit lacking.This spin-off lacks the incredibly likable human characters its predecessors had. No Gru. No Agnes. It substitutes them with a couple consisting of Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Herb (Jon Hamm). They do not resonate with us as Gru and the three girls did with us in the previous two films. The signature Gru accent is absent. The awkwardness of Gru trying to become a good dad is absent. The vibrant and distinct personalities of the three girls are absent. But rather than replacing them with other rich characters, we just get a female super villain who's really just a control freak or a megalomaniac, with a husband who simply just supports her along the way. I can't help but feel that they are just dull as compared to what we were offered previously. (There's also one random villain family but they're also plain.)Ultimately, the lack of dynamic human characters causes this spin- off to not be able to achieve what I really loved about the first two films besides the Minions, that is the ability to have touching moments. In the first film, there was an arc when Gru started to actually open his heart to the girls, and when he started to gradually become kinder and more giving. The scene in space where he finally shrunk the Moon, but realized that he was on the verge of missing the girls' recital. The bonding between the girls and Gru. In the second film, there was this scene where Gru felt depressed after Lucy was relocated somewhere else, where he just sat outside his home alone in the rain. Agnes comes and the two have a chat.In the end, it's a lighthearted comedy and it's enjoyable. Kids will undoubtedly devour it and will glee at the sight of those yellow Minions. But for those who expect something more than just rampage and silly antics, well this movie doesn't offer to you that much. It reinforces the popularity of the Minions but it's quite a shame that this movie could have been done with more thought and heart, but ultimately chose not to pursue it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very disappointing and unnecessary prequel,"The first two Despicable Me films were fantastic family fun, so while the idea for a prequel starring the minions did strike me as pointless the trailer was promising. However, what promise the trailer had wasn't really there in the film itself.Minions isn't without its good points. Apart from some awkward human character designs, the animation is excellent, with its rich bright colours, meticulously detailed backgrounds and imaginative visuals. The killer classic rock soundtrack is another plus, it is very catchy and upbeat while not being too loud or obtrusive. There is a hilarious opening sequence, which is the funniest Minions ever gets and John Hamm does provide a few amusing(but not much more than that) moments. The voice cast deserved much better and didn't shine as much as they ought to, but Geoffrey Rush is a thoughtful narrator, John Hamm has some fun and Pierre Coffin does well characterising the minions.Regarding the rest of the voice cast though, Sandra Bullock very much underplays her blandly written villain character and the film makes a complete waste of Michael Keaton. Everybody else suffers from not having much to do or being underused, the Nelsons could have brought some heart to the story but weren't used anywhere near enough and were quite bland. The story suffers from being structurally thin, with very little narrative padded out to try and sustain the running time (which it did sometimes struggle to do) and rushed, and had very little of the heart and charm that the first two Despicable Me films did. It is also incredibly predictable and has very little different that sets it apart from other origin stories, and felt like an extended version of the trailer.Generally, the humour isn't smart or sharp enough and there is not enough of it(the very aimless second half is especially lacking in the laughs department), some of it veering on juvenile and with little for adults to enjoy (a mistake seeing as what made the two Despicable Me films so winning was that they had something for everyone). The script is more muddled and over-stuffed (from trying to cram in too many types of humour) than clever, and has some clumsy attempts at acting hip and cool. As said before, there is not much heart or charm here, and the lack of truly memorable characters and lack of identifiable themes is a huge part of the problem. The minions are very funny supporting characters and scene stealers in the Despicable Me films, but they are not utilised enough and they don't seem strong enough to be leading characters carrying the film on their own, so what made them so appealing at first is lost here.In summary, very disappointing and unnecessary prequel. 4/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun ride,"I'm 14. I enjoyed this movie as I was just trying to kill time. This movie was actually pretty funny and kids will enjoy it very much.The minions were hilarious and I found myself giggling at times. Their voices were really funny and the stuff they did was pretty funny. Also the other characters were really funny too.The voice acting was excellent by Bullock, Hamm, and Coffin. They made the movie even more better.Of course the plot was lame and the movie was a little too short. But you can ignore all of this because of the very funny jokes and dialogue that were in this movie.You will enjoy this movie if you like the other ""Despicable Me"" movies because the minions were hilarious and other characters were also hilarious.

There's Something About those Minions .....,"There is something about those minions, that has grasped my own (and almost everyone else's) attention. And this movie (given with it's title) deliverers all that it states..... Minions!. This film brought me a large amount of joy. I will be honest in stating, that before the lights went out and the film started to play. I was jumping in & out of my seat in excitement to see some 'minion-lovin' fun. And as said, this film delivered its justice.... sadly only in some areas. As I said before the film does deliver what it promises in its title... Minions. But there is a good side and bad side to only giving your audience one thing, and one thing only.I honestly had high hopes for this film. As any child, parent, or a '6 year old at heart' twenty year old would. Yet somehow it lost me. Everyone who has contact with the out side world, would know about the Minions from 'Despicable Me'. And as they were so largely loved, they were successful enough to gain their own movie. And that is what this film feels like. The directors have taken in too much of the idea that the Minions are famous, and forgot to put in any real plot or emotion toward it. I'll be honest in saying that ""yes, I did laugh"". However as many times as I did laugh, the times I indeed truly laughed, and it wasn't a force of a laugh. It was always aimed in one general area. That area being, not at our heroes 'Kevin', 'Bob', and 'Stuart', but in fact the minions in between the chaos of those three (the minions that were left back 'home' and weren't our main character's). This being because they were Minion's!. Not force a laugh out of a child to gain an honest buck Minion. But the Minion's we fell in love with from the first two 'Despicable Me' film's. The maker's of this film tried too hard to make a successful children's movie, that they forgot what made their Minions iconic in the first place.Now I know what your thinking ""But wait, how did Sandra Bullock do?"", well I will tell you. Although having a big name like Sandra Bullock may bring in the 'odd older viewer', sadly she didn't save this film. Now don't get me wrong I love Sandra Bullock (honestly some of her movies, give me revisits to when I was a child). Yet the writing of her character (even though a villain) wasn't funny or interesting at all. It just seemed like her character was there to seem like a first pain-of-a-boss to the Minions, and that's all that character did for me.I don't want to say ""don't go and see this film"". Because obviously everyone has their own opinion, and because I do agree it was a laugh. But if you will take my advice do not go into the theater (or DVD store, depends on when your'e reading this) with extremely high hopes, based on your knowledge from the Minions from the 'Despicable Me' franchise. If it is possible don't go in with any hope's at all. Go in knowing you may or may not laugh, practically don't have any expectations. Just enjoy the film and see what it does for you, in your own 'taste' and 'humor'. You never know what having a clear mind can do for your judgement (that is if you wish to judge at all).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Lots of fun but every time the Scarlet Overkill plot kicks in, the film slows to a grinding halt.","In this third installment of the ""Despicable Me"" franchise, the Minions are in search of a master and the first portion of the film is a look back through history of their trying to find one. Then, the movie switches to 1968 and their music-filled quest to become sidekicks for the evil Scarlet Overkill as well as ruling the UK.I enjoyed ""Minions"" and think it's a big step up from the previous installment of ""Despicable Me"". This is because in ""Despicable Me 2"", the film was great whenever the Minions were there but ground to a boring halt whenever the plot reared its ugly head. Here, however, it's mostly Minions and their antics...but once again, the film does bog down when it comes to the plot involving Scarlet Overkill...mostly because it's NOT fun. So, when it's just the Minions being goofy, the film is lovable and fun. And, this is great because mostly the film just involves the characters being funny and cute...especially in the first half hour or so. Is it as wonderful as the first film, ""Despicable Me""? No...but it is fun, very clever and worth seeing in a 'just turn your brain off and enjoy' sort of way.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply perfect,"This is not a complicated film. There is no sophisticated humour. Most of it is toddler level.The plot is summarized on the trailers. The minions are a tribe of yellow round things that want to assist villains in their villainy. They have been doing this since the dawn of time. Historically they have run in to difficulties in their quest to identify the perfect bad guy to serve. After repeated failures they withdrew to the arctic and attempted to entertain themselves, putting the concerns of other life forms to the side.The protagonists, Bob, Stuart and Kevin are three minions that decided to brave the unknown and seek out a new leader. They depart and arrive in New York, in 1968. Essentially, we then follow their adventures throughout the film.Wackiness ensues. The laws of physics are suspended. Gibberish is spoken to wondrous effect.You don't have to be 2 years old to love this film. I personally love it, and I'm an adult without children. I don't even really like children, but if I had a child I imagine they would like this film. The Minions have this magical quality that forces the rational mind to check out, like anything adorable. They're mischievous, clumsy, and sweet - they want to do good, and this makes them endearing.Some have complained that this movie lacks substance. I would respond that you don't need substance with a movie like this. It is gold, yellow gold.But, I am sorry for all the mass marketing.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

In hind site and given the high price of theater tickets, I could have waited to see this one on broadcast or cable.If you do choose to go, DO NOT leave before the credits have finished playing! The animators went to town during the credits. These short bits include in-jokes that fans of the Despicable Me franchise will appreciate.

I can understand why youngsters love the film and why our supermarkets are full of all the Minion bits and pieces.

Minion Overkill,"The first two Despicable Me films were such a surprise in both their humor and their heart. Minions looked to be one of the most entertaining films of the summer as it focused on everyone's favorite characters from the Despicable Me films. Unfortunately we were left with a mildly entertaining but overall forgettable film. But I also understand that as a 21 year old male, I'm not necessarily the target audience and so I can see the appeal that all the young kids and families will have. But I bought into all the trailers and was really excited to see the movie, it just turned out to be a big disappointment from my high expectations.The worst part about giving this film a 6.2 is that the entire movie is pretty much shown in all the trailers. All of the great jokes, some of which I still laughed at in the film, were shown in the various 3 min long trailers we saw. I really do feel like if I would have stayed away from all the trailers I would have enjoyed the film a ton more and laughed hysterically like a lot of people did in my theater. But trailers aren't supposed to do that. It shouldn't be that we are forced to stay away from the teasers and clips so that we aren't spoiled for the film. Trailers are released to sell the movie, not spoil the movie. The various voice talent does a fine job but it was nothing memorable like Steve Carell's Gru. Sandra Bullock plays the main villain, Scarlett Overkill, but she isn't given a whole lot to do and in fact, the film just doesn't have much substance at all. Yes, it is still funny and entertaining to watch the Minions run around in madness, but there was something to be said about the story around the humans in the Despicable Me films. Minions were great in doses, but they were really missing that heart from the family storyline.So with still quite a few laugh out loud moments, but no gut-busters, Minions failed to capture the magic madness that the other films did. But it is a fun time in the theaters with plenty of short funny scenes. It's just that at feature length, the film doesn't hit on all the levels that the trailers promised. It's more of just a shut your brain off kind of kids comedy, and I expected more.+Creative gags+Villain-con+Voice cast does what they can-Trailers give way too much away-Not much substance6.2/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Minions: Mission Accomplished,"""Work for me, and all this will be yours: respect, power, andBanana""Young children will absolutely fall in love with the lovely and insane minions, the humor, and the colorful animation, but unfortunately adults will find their wacky antics to wear off quickly as they become repetitive and tedious. At least that was my experience with this film which I ended up mildly enjoying. It did succeed in keeping the kids completely entertained, unlike with Inside Out where most of the younger kids began to get distracted and run around the movie theater. However it takes animated films like this to really appreciate what Pixar did with the insightful and original Inside Out. Pierre Coffin who co-directed both Despicable Me films with Chris Renaud, now teams up with Kyle Balda (who directed The Lorax with Renaud) for this spin off centering on the colorful characters who were the highlight of the Despicable Me franchise. It's hard to resist their cute antics and for that reason most of the jokes work in this film, but there isn't anything else to the familiar slapstick humor. Coffin is the true hero here as he not only directs, but voices all of the minions and no matter how many times you hear them say ""banana"" it is funny every time. As uneven as the film might be, there are a number of memorable scenes that will stick with you and help you endure the 90 minute runtime. Unfortunately the funniest scenes are all included in the trailers, but it is still a fun ride nonetheless.The plot centers on the origins of the Minions who have evolved through the dawn of time and have always followed the most despicable masters (including the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Dracula, and Napoleon). Ironically they are always the cause for their masters's demise (which can be seen in the trailers). With no master left to follow, the Minions settle in a cave and struggle with depression for decades, until one of them, Kevin, decides to go in search of an evil boss. Along with Bob and Stuart, the trio embark on a journey to America in 1968 where they encounter Scarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock) and her inventor husband Herb (Jon Hamm) who are the world's most despicable villains. Scarlett offers them the opportunity to work for her if they manage to steal the Queen of England's crown. Kevin, Bob, and Stuart accept the mission with the intention of saving the fate of their brothers and finally being able to serve a worthy master.There is no doubt that Minions will be a financial success and it will attract young audiences to the movies. Adults will be glad their children will be distracted for a couple of hours and everyone will return home happy. Other than entertaining your kids for a few hours, Minions doesn't have anything new to offer. There will be plenty of laughs and the characters will sell a lot of toys, but there is nothing else to it. I still had a better time with this film than I did with Home, which surprisingly had done very well in the box office, but neither of these films come close to the emotional appeal of more intelligently crafted animated films such as Inside Out, which continues to prove that the rest of the animation studios are far behind from producing the quality that Pixar brings to their projects.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Forever Minions,"Honestly the real and main reason why the studio (Universal) decided to make this movie at all is because how popular Minions is , they just everywhere know from toys to even some ride in Universal Amusement Park.For me personally i'm okay with that , i mean i'm a big fan of these little yellow guy since the first Despicable Me in 2010 but overall i have to say that Minions is not a bad movie but it's also could be a lot better especially comparison to the first two Despicable Me that a lot better than thisfirst off the script it's horrible super cookie cutter cliché boring script that you pretty much getting tired of it , it's super predictable , lack imagination or any real story driven it's like they just search ""how to write a movie script"" in google and just do it exactly that.Another thing that kind a let me down is the other main character in this movie besides minions and that is Scarlett Overkill voice by Sandra Bullock , she's awful really just another cookie cutter part of this movie , the character itself is boring repetitive predictable and not even likable at all she's just doing her bad stuff without any real background to it even though they try to force her terrible background in to our mouth but it's just terrible storytelling.BUT but even though a lot of part in this movie is a let down , one thing that Minions fans should at least feel safe going into this movie is for sure the minions itself ,they're still cute funny and likable character the same character we know and love from the previous Despicable Me , so if you going to this movie just for this reason and you're a big minions fan there's no reason why you should not see this movie but other than that it's just another cliché mediocre movie that pass the test but never at the top of the class.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
the kids liked it,"The Minions have tried over history to serve the most despicable. They always seem to end up causing their masters harm. After failing Napoleon, they are hounded to an isolated ice cave. They build an impressive settlement but over time, they lose heart without a villain master. Kevin has a plan to find a master with Stuart and little Bob. They arrive in 1968 NYC. They hitchhike to Villain-Con in Orlando, Florida and become followers of supervillain Scarlet Overkill. They travel to London where Scarlet instructs the trio to steal the Crown from Queen Elizabeth. Bob pulls the Sword out of the Stone and becomes the new ruler.The Minions have always been the funniest characters in the Despicable Me franchise. I was confident that they could be hilarious in their own movie. This doesn't measure up to my expectations. I brought my little nephews (7 year olds) to the movie and they had a few big laughs. They liked it but not really loving it. For me, Minions is pretty funny at times but there is a missing element. Scarlet Overkill is evil without the comedy. After a pretty funny first half, the movie struggles for comedy which Scarlet is unwilling to provide. The middle gets kind of boring. It's not a movie for the adults. It is entertaining for the kids and in the end, that's what's important.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why was this movie made?,"I'm sitting in the nearly vacant theater on premiere night and thinking somewhere there must be a struggling movie maker pondering how Hollywood could pump millions into this pedestrian cartoon babble and not into his or her creation? If you feel like you have to see this movie I have four suggestions: 1) pop in any CD of Back to the Barnyard and watch 3 episodes, 2) pop in any Penguins of Madagascar CD or its variants, 3) watch the Croods, but with the sound off, or 4) bang your head against the wall with medium impact for 1 1/2 hours. The best thing about this movie was the short running time, even with the pressure these days to fill and expand movie lengths this was so spare to begin with that they had no place else to go. One other alternative is to watch the trailer 100 times. My son just barely made it through, he gave it a 6 1/2 on the way out.

Thankfully, while it wasn't as good as either Despicable Me's, it was a good movie. It is very kid oriented, duh, so don't go thinking you're going to get an in-depth plot line. The minions are corny and their antics are as slapstick as they are in Despicable Me. While you would think that it would be difficult to relate to, due to them not speaking English, it's not a problem. They did a great job at making everything understandable through context, even for a small child. The biggest issue I had was in the form of Scarlet Overkill. I didn't care for the angle they chose to go with her. I'll leave it at that so I don't include any spoilers. If you have small children, they will love every minute of this movie.

We weren't to happy with the Penguins of Madagascar will this side kick outing be any different?Kid's Korner rating: 2.25 stars Caroline's Rating: 3 starsWhat do sidekicks need? A hero to follow. In the case of the Minions, they need a super-villain to lead this bulbous bunch. In the third film from the makers of Despicable Me, the story goes back to the beginning of time. From the inception of the world, the minions have been searching for a super-villain to serve. The little yellow creatures have been the indentured servants, comic relief and the downfall of villains throughout history from Tyrannosaurus Rex to Napoleon. Their existence is a innocently, parasitic search for the ultimate villain to serve. In a respite between leaders, they find a supposed Minion-topia where they find sanctuary. Yet, become listless and depressed without fulfilling their purpose in villainous service. During this dark time, three minions rise from within their yellow homogeneous existence and decide to go out to find a new leader. Kevin, Stuart and Bob travel to America in 1964 in their search and think they find her in Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), the self-proclaimed female super villain. She takes them on as her new villainous entourage and whisks them away to London to steal the crown and monarchy from Queen Elisabeth where things go bad quickly.Entering the theatre where the median age seems to be five years old, there was a buzz about the new Minions adventure from Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin. The Universal marketing team nailed their pre-school target audience. The Minion fan base was energised by excessive sugar intake and the anticipation of the little yellow men. From the Minion evolution to the indistinguishable dialogue and the pervasive slap stick humour, all parents would have to acknowledge that this will be the DVD on perpetual play in homes of toddlers throughout the world for years to come. It did not take too long to realise that this film was meant to capitalise on the popularity of the this citron gang, but unlike Despicable Me it did not have the same connection with parents. The original film was inventive and strangely endearing, providing as much for the parents as for the children. Minions does not meet the same standard. The storyline barely lifts itself above Saturday afternoon cartoons and the disjointed story only had appeal for the young ones. In Despicable Me, the transition of Gru from evil villain to a loving father of his lovable children provided something for the whole family to enjoy. In the first two films, the minions provided the story filler and comic relief, but in this outing they do not have the depth to carry their own film. Their farcical style quickly diminishes in drawing laughs and becomes tiresome after the initial sequence. There was hope in the inclusion of Sandra Bullock as Scarlet Overkill, but she never proves to be convincing as a super fem-fatale. In the tradition of capitalising on the marketing appeal of the plucky sidekicks Minions meets it's goal, but ultimately this canary-coloured tale is misguided and proves to be a weak outing for Illumination Entertainment.Caroline's review: Dad asked me, 'Did I like the movie?' It was okay. The little boy sitting next to me really liked it and laughed throughout the whole movie, but his Mum kept looking at her mobile. Minions seemed like it was made for little kids.

In 1968, Kevin, Stuart and Bob head to New York and Florida expecting to find a new boss while the rest of his tribe waits for them in Antarctica. They search for the evil Scarlet Overkill that travels to England with them and assigns the trio of minions to steal the Crown of the Queen. However things do not go how planned.""Minions"" is a reasonable entertainment for adults with funny moments. Children will appreciate much more the adventures of the clumsy minions in England. However, the soundtrack with classics from the 60's is a gem and makes this animation worthwhile watching. It begins with The Turtles (""Happy Together"") and includes The Kinks (""You Really Got Me""), The Who (""My Generation""), Donovan (""Mellow Yellow""), The Doors (""Break on through""), Jimi Hendrix (""Foxey Lady"") among many others. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Minions""",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Entertaining But Forgettable Prequel,"You either love or you hate Minions — there's no in-between, at least as of 2015. Back in 2010, they were fun little creations of animated preciousness, sure to make one laugh. But with the constant promotion that has surrounded them, especially in the face of 2013's ""Despicable Me 2"" and this year's ""Minions"", we've come to a point where you still want to purchase a stuffed, voiceless figurine, or you want to throw darts at a picture of their likeness.I've always loved them — not in the same way the kids ten and under do, though — but this second sequel to ""Despicable Me"" (though technically a prequel), while delightful, hardly convinces that these foot-high giggle mavens really need a standalone movie. A backstory for a superhero I can handle; but considering I never found myself curious as to whether these yellow nuggets always worked for Gru, ""Minions"" feels rather needless. Charmingly needless. But needless all the same.Beginning as if it were an Animal Planet special, the story of the Minions is narrated by a voice akin to David Attenborough, all knowing and invested in his subjects. Minions, it seems, are immortal; they began as single-celled organisms and evolved over the years, finding their niche around the Dinosaur era. Nothing has ever changed in their life goals, however — finding and serving an evil master is what they've been brought on this Earth to do. They repeat the same tasks over and over again for centuries, loving every minute of it. But after the Ice Age overtakes the atmosphere, they find themselves without a villain to worship. So they become isolated, lonely. Their easygoing cheer withers away.That all changes come 1968, when they decide it's finally time for a change after years of boring nothingness. Three of the community members, Kevin, Bob, and Stuart (all voiced by director Pierre Coffin) go out on a limb and sail to New York City, where they run into several obstacles and inadvertently hear about Villain Con, a top secret convention in Orlando in which all the world's most devilish foes get together and have some sinister fun. At its head is Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), a legendary baddie looking for a new set of henchmen. You can see where this is going. With three Minions in tow, Scarlet tasks them with the impossible — steal the Queen of England's crown. Then — then — they will become official sidekicks.Whereas ""Despicable Me"" and its sequel were laugh-out-loud funny, ""Minions"" is mostly cutesy, gut-busters few and far-between. This isn't a huge problem — the film is always entertaining — but likability only goes so far before we begin to realize that things aren't as original as they were before. The comic situations are still disaster laden, the animation is still deliciously caricaturish, and the voice-over work is still zany (Bullock is a great addition). Nothing has changed; only the freshness has. It's carefree family entertainment, ready to please the children. Just don't expect to remember it a second after you leave the theater.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
This One's Just For The Kiddos,"Nowadays, when I see an animated movie like this, I pretty much expect it to entertain me as much as the target audience of children. The bar has been set that high. Unfortunately (at least for me), this one is pretty much just for the kiddies.For a basic plot summary, ""Minions"" tells the story of, well, the Minions! While the little mischief- makers were well established in the Despicable 1/2 films, this one explains how they came to meet Gru. For thousands of years, they wandered the earth looking for the meanest bad guy to serve, from cavemen to dinosaurs to Yetis. In more recent times, they fall in with Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), who is intent on stealing the Royal Crown (quite literally) from the Queen of England (Jennifer Saunders). As per usual, the Minions' frantic antics make this an almost impossible task, with one even being crowned King himself (King Bob!).Simply put, ""Minions"" is a fun romp for any audience of children. The gags will elicit laughs, and just the concept of Minions in general is still enough to hold interest. Kevin, Bob, & Stuart (the main three Minions featured) will enthrall kids for the whole 90 minute runtime.Because of how high the animation bar has been set, though, I can't help but rate ""Minions"" a pedestrian 3-stars by my own standards. Maybe that isn't fair to the film, but it is from my own personal perspective. This one doesn't have, say, the wry humor of a ""Toy Story"", and emotional punch of other Pixar efforts, or even the sincere sweetness of its two predecessors. It's just silly, goofy fun.So, if you have kids, put this on and it will be a rollicking hour and a half of laughter. Just don't expect to become invested in the cartoonish fun like you probably have been in the past.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Despicable Me movies were better.......,"First of all, I'd like to start this review off on a positive note, and that note is Sandra Bullock as Scarlet Overkill, she was great as the lead villain! The first part of the film was pretty entertaining, telling the story of how the minions came to be, and how they came to America in 1968. The first about 30/40 minutes was very entertaining, but it seemed to kinda go downhill from there. It wasn't horrible, but it just wasn't nearly as good as the despicable me movies. I was a little disappointed by minions, mainly by comparing it to other movies. I'm not saying minions is bad, it really isn't, it's just definitely not as good as the despicable me movies, keep that in mind if/when u do see it. 6/10. Like I said scarlet overkill was really good, and the main three minions had their funny moments as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Okay but a very poor prequel,"I love both Despicable Me movies, so went to see this with a rather optimistic open mind, unfortunately I was probably expecting too much as felt a bit let down. There were a couple of laugh out loud moments but to be honest I thought it was lacking something from it's superior Daddy!Probably enough in the movie for a child to laugh at (which to be honest is what it's aimed at), but for an adult its a bit of a disappointment, which is shame as I love animated movies.I have to say I think I enjoyed the trailer for the Secret Life Of Pets more, which was shown at the start :-)",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Trailer was as good as it got,"Totally agree with some of the reviews. If you watched the trailer, then you don't need to watch the movie. It was fun but not on par with what my expectation was. WHen they first introduced Scarlet, I was so excited. But she didn't have a very good role in the plot. She was neither clever nor witty. And a movie like this cant have a villain who is not witty. And the funniest part was the beginning 10 min and the credits where they show Gru and minions. Yes, this movie lacks soul and that is because Gru wasn't there. As soon as Gru was on screen, the movie became hilarious because of the chemistry between him and minions. Also because Gru is awesome. And cool. And more cool!",,Anonymous,Animation
Good...Just Doesn't Appeal To All Ages,"I'll start off by saying I'm 14. I went to see it with my sister and family friends. The cinema was packed with very young kids, and i think they loved it a lot more than me.I liked Despicable Me and i loved Despicable Me 2. But Minions fell short without Gru and the comedy was far from original. It was mainly just cheap laughs of a Minion falling over or flying into a pole or pulling funny faces. These pleased the young ones who were screaming in laughter but for the older ones it just felt silly. I gave it a 6 though because there were a few moments that made me laugh in my head and the story wasn't awful. The start was one of the best bits, showing the minions journey through the ages. It went downhill from start to end.If its a rainy day and your 5 year old child is bored then sacrifice two hours and watch this film: its not unbearable. They will love it, its just it doesn't appeal all ages like the best animated films do like Up and Inside Out. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends but i also wouldn't say avoid it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A good film, but also a very lazy one that fails to meet the standards set by its incomparable predecessors.","Despicable me and its sequel, are among my all time favorite films of all time, animated or not, and the minions are the characters that obviously makes you laugh the most and leave the greater impression, because they are so eccentric and infectious. So the idea of a prequel about them was just perfect!But the film unfortunately fails to meet my expectations, by far. It is impossible to compare this film to any of the previous installments. The film has a lot of jokes, but it has tons of time where you only smile, the screenplay is very inconsistent. It begins very strongly, but then it's like a roller-coaster, ending on a lower not however.The film should have a way better story, and it had so much possibilities, but the writers went for a lazy story, that felt they made it as they went along. And it gets stranger as it goes. The way they meet Gru is very unoriginal.It's a lazy film, very inconsistent, and a failed opportunity, its fun, good if you don't expect much, but it to me it was disappointing.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One in a Minion,"This is my review of the lighthearted fun for all the family Minions (spoiler free). This film is set way before the time when the Minions meet Gru (Steve Carrell from Despicable me 1 &2). With a comedic edge the film will probably keep you laughing for ages. There were moments when I was just crying with laughter.The Minions (Piere Coffin, voice) are basically on a quest to find the perfect boss/master the minions in their silly yet hysterical ways try their hardest to keep a master for just longer than a week but it goes horribly wrong for them. The three main Minions (on the poster) are Kevin, Bob and Stuart set off on a journey to find their new master in 1968 (42 years BG, Before Gru) Kevin is the smartest Minion, Stuart is the most ambitious and finally Bob is the cutest and plus the one that is the most clumsy.Minions is a silly yet hilarious prequel to Despicable Me which as you all know is the story of Gru and the Minions. There are three reasons on why I that this film is a must see.1. Original plot and storyline: This film has an original which basically starts off with the Minions evolution and basically explains more about how the Minions came along in their own funny ways as told by narrator Geoffrey Rush.2. Dialogue: The dialogue is hilarious because it starts off with the Minion language but it isn't off putting it's funny and sometimes witty but there is human dialogue as well. Voices by Sandra Bullock, Steve Coogan, Michael Keaton etc.3. The Minion: The Minions are the main part of the story (obviously) but the Minions are witty and well probably the most hilarious characters in any animation.Overall this film was really enjoyable and really put a massive smile on my face and it filled the entire cinema with laughter. This is fun for all the family a must see hilarious animation that will put a smile on your face and will keep you laughing from start to finish. This film was especially good in 3D. 9/10 One in a Minion.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as funny as the trailer let it to be,"The movie is good for a few chuckles and does have some very entertaining moments. What is actually by far the funniest is the ""minion speak""; especially if you understand some french, it does have some layers in it (Papaouté; c'estparlà etc.) and is definitely funny. It also is a very beautiful CG movie. Though it is customary to say that with every new CG movie, this one is absolutely gorgeous, with some great character designs and some cool visuals. But, honestly, didn't laugh all that often. The trailer lets you believe it will be a very very funny movie and was not, it was a cool adventure with some funny characters - left me wanting more. The voice acting was also, with the exception of the minions, nothing incredible.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Terrible,My kids begged me to see the movie. I wish that I had waited until I was able to read more reviews. We don't get to see many movies in the theater (maybe 1 or 2 a year) due to the cost so we try to choose our movies carefully. The Minions movie was a complete waste of money for us. My kids were bored and most of the humor was inappropriate for young kids. It should have been rated PG-13 for such a dark theme. So many kids movies these days seem to have a positive message with opportunities for discussion. This one was not one of those movies. We watched Big hero 6 and McFarland on DVD and both movies were a thousand times better than the Minions.,1.0,Anonymous,Animation
I Want Gru,"""Despicable Me"" and ""Despicable Me 2"" were so good that Illumination Studios had to find out how the Minions would do largely on their own. Usher in ""Minions,"" a movie about how the Minions came to be and their adventurous path to meeting Gru.Without Gru the Minions are just not the same and not as compelling. The Minions movie was an experiment with the sidekicks. It's happened before where a movie was good and the sidekick was such a hit the executives decided to give him his own movie. That usually fails. ""Minions"" wasn't a total fail but I was definitely yearning for Gru.The big villain in this movie was Scarlett Overkill, played by Sandra Bullock. She didn't have the appeal or funniness of Gru. Not only did I find her too verbose, she also didn't seem to fit. She was a supervillain, a villain that all other villains aspired to be like. She was at such a level that she needed no help, yet she employed three wayward minions to steal the Queen of England's crown for her.The movie had its funny moments; most were for kids and some were for an older audience. The Minions themselves were true to form: unintelligible, bumbling and mischievous. I hate to say that the movie was a money grab but by the end that's what it looked like.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Poorly written but brilliantly executed,"""Minions"" has many amusing moments and the animation is simply amazing. The textures of intricately woven curtains, hair/fur and spittle are amazing, as is the elastic quality of skin and other surfaces and the ability to change perspective while maintaining an astounding level of detail. It's fun to watch simply to see how far animation has advanced since ""Steamboat Willie.""However, it is not nearly as much fun to watch as the Despicable Me movies for a number of reasons.The notion that the minions are motivated by a desire to submit themselves to mindless servitude to the most evil villain makes them less sympathetic and seems contrary to some of their actions, particularly when they oppose those villains. It's much better to think of them as innocent, fun-loving, mischievous characters whom Gru is able to manage and motivate through his charisma and by rewarding them with silly things.The idea that the minions are basically immortal and have survived for eons allows the filmmakers to put them into amusing historical situations without addressing the question of how they reproduce. However, it (a) stretches credulity beyond the snapping point; (b) eliminates/undermines the infatuations that were so charming in the DM movies; and (c) lessens dramatic tension, as it's difficult to imagine they can ever be killed after surviving dinosaurs and eons of wars and pestilence.Gru's plot to steal the moon was ridiculous, but within the cosmos of reality established for the film. The audience simply accepts it and moves on, even though the rational mind would reject the idea. The theft of the pyramid was the same sort of thing, the theft of a massive, immovable object. Minions creates new wrinkles and incongruities that haven't been set up and that the audience isn't ready to accept, such as the sword and stone, rules of succession and Kevin's transformation.The movie doesn't have a love interest for the protagonist. Kevin loves his fellow minions, and Scarlet and Herb Overkill love each other, but love isn't nearly as important as in the DM movies, with the orphans, the Gru/Lucy and Antonio/Margo romances and the romantic fantasies of the minions.The music isn't nearly as good. The DM movies have several musical interludes that are fun. ""Minions"" has corpulent palace guards doing a male striptease.The minions don't seem as fun-loving or playful as in DM. The historic disasters with the dinosaur, bear, pyramid, vampire and cannon are all caused by them trying to be helpful, not by losing attention and engaging in some playful prank.The violence isn't always comical. Bob lifting an ice bolder over his head, then being crushed under its weight but surviving unscathed is funny. A dinosaur doing a Wile E. Coyote delayed fall over a precipice is funny to a point. Falling to a horrific death is not funny.The structure is weak. There isn't a strong through line. The stated objective of subjugation of the clan would be considered defeat in any other circumstances. There is no refusal of the call to adventure except by Stuart. Kevin volunteers and Bob eagerly accepts the call. There are several deus ex machina resolutions employing plot devices that weren't foreshadowed. It seems episodic. Some scenes seem self-indulgent, as if included because the filmmakers wanted to show what they could do, not because they advanced the plot or character development.As an antagonist, Scarlet Overkill doesn't seem villainous enough. She wants to steal the queen's crown, which will somehow give her claim to the throne of England. She seemed like a pale shadow of Johnny English's nemesis, Pascal Sauvage, but motivated by insanity, not by villainy.The story doesn't have a good theme or moral. The minions bounce from one objective to another and spend much of the movie fleeing for their lives. What message can we take away for our own lives? If you spend eons trying to subjugate your tribe to the rule of another, you will eventually succeed? If you throw off the shackles of one villainous master, you can find another to serve? What sort of message is that for our children?Despite the many shortcomings relative to the prior DM films, it has many enjoyable moments. The pyramid scene is outrageously funny. It doesn't belong in the film, but it's one of the best scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Minion Madness Has Never Been This Unbearable!,"I had a hunch that I wasn't going to like it but wow, I should not have seen this! This is one of those unforgettable atrocities that absolutely make you despite the very things you once found adorable and although it's quite evident that this stupid vile piece of crap is aimed at kids, does it really have to be this pathetic for the rest of the viewers who were left with no choice but to accompany those little rascals & sit through this unbearable torture?A spin-off to the Despicable Me series that also serves as a prequel, Minions tells the story of its titular characters; the small, yellow henchmen of Gru who have been around since the very beginning and have served the most despicable of masters throughout their existence. The plot follows three of them who, in order to find their group a new master, venture out of their isolation and into Orlando where they meet the world's first female supervillain at the Villain-Con.Written by Brian Lynch and directed by Kyle Balda & Pierre Coffin, Minions neither features a script nor any sort of direction for it is one of the dumbest productions ever green-lighted by any studio. From the very opening scene when these minions accompany the Universal logo, you can feel your intuition telling you to walk out. But the level of annoyance & highly off-putting human characters that inhabit this turd turn it into an experience that many will regret for the rest of their lives.Although minion madness was a surprise delight in Despicable Me, it worked because they were effectively used to support the relevant characters. Despicable Me 2 did upgrade their time on screen & was a laughter riot in a way but it also exhibited inferiority in story quality when compared to its predecessor. But to allocate an entire picture based on these yellow little bastards is a huge mistake for it simply kills the fun by overdoing it and with no story or character development, it's just not worth it.And yet the worst thing about Minions isn't the minions but the extremely forced & childish attempts at humour as well as the few human characters that are penned into the storyline. The gibberish insanity becomes dull sooner than expected, the narration that accompanies the plot was unnecessary, the villain is one of the worst ever imaginable, it feel too long for a 90 minutes movie, animation isn't much of an issue but everything around it is, and from start to finish, it's filled with nothing but one terrible scene after another.On an overall scale, Minions is an uninspiring, unnecessary & mind-numbingly awful movie that not only goes down as one of the worst films of the year but is also amongst the worst films ever made. There are a couple of amusing moments but for the most part, this movie is a ghastly, repulsive & all-out flat experience that's capable of totally destroying your love for the little yellow freaks, if there was any. Too much of a good thing can have devastating consequences and Minions is definitely a strong testament to that. Skip it or suffer.",,Anonymous,Animation
Bloody BRILLIANT!,"Perhaps I am not as jaded as so many reviewers or even just viewers are...not yawning at the fantastic animation in Minions, the brilliant use of allusions and satire side by side with slapstick and so many side bits. I really have to believe that those who didn't like this movie simply didn't have the knowledge or the media/social historical savvy to GET all the stuff crammed into this wonderfully delightful film. It's possible that the 50+ crowd would embrace this film faster and more readily than the 30-40 something crowd who actually have little ones who would just love the basic silliness. I wanted to stop action constantly...hey, wait, did I see Brezhnev AND Nixon in those front rows at the villancon!? I simply will have to get my own copy and enjoy the details at home. Loved that Queenie was having a jolly pub crawl on leave as it were. The Corgy has a short tail by the way chaps, and our English sterling wasn't decimalised until 1970 but why quibble over little things like that? So grandparents? Grab a kid and see this!

Better than most spin offs,"This isn't a story driven movie nor is it a movie that has much depth to it. However it's a family flick where the kids will have a blast with. There is almost no slow parts in this, it's a super fast paced movie that will entertain just about any kid with it's wacky slapstick humor. The whole plot is about the Minions looking for a evil boss who they can work under. Soon Kevin, Bob and Stuart who are Minions volunteer to go on a mission to find a super cool evil boss. And their journey takes them on a wild adventure. The drive of this movie is the interactions between the Minions, their expressions and how they go about it. Which is actually pretty creative for the most part. Overall this is a movie kids will have a blast with it and adults will at least be amused with it.7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"There are cheap-ass Spin-offs, and there is the Minions movie","Ever since watching Despicable Me I'm totally in LOVE with the Minions. Everyone around me knows me for being sorta crazy about these little yellow dudes. Minions are just AWESOME!So, when I learned there would be a Minions movie I was in ecstasy really... But, as time progressed and more information became available about the movie my expectations started to drop.... Part of the magic of Minions was NOT knowing where they came from. But, hey, they are Minions! So, of course I needed to see the movie. And I'm truly sorry I did. Horribly disappointing! No story what so ever (I mean, at least 15 minutes with a voice over needed to explain what the movie is about says it all!). All jokes were already in the previews. Nothing exciting, nothing really funny. Just pure- and utter boredom! I really regret ever seeing this movie. It takes the Despicable Me movies down with it. I can give everyone who hasn't seen this movie only one advise: DON'T even think of watching this movie!! It's nothing more then a cheap spin-off intended to make a lot of money on the success of the Minions in the Despicable Me movies. Even the music was recycled from the previous movies and games. I'll try to forget seeing this movie and will stay away from it as far as I possibly can! Horrible, horrible, horrible!

"Lacks Heart, but All Ages should be Entertained,","Minions is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific voice cast. Despite people's love for these characters, it seemed like a big risk to give the minions their own solo movie, mainly for the fact that they can't speak, but it worked out very well and is probably one of the most impressive spin off movies to date, something Hiollywood have gotten right on very few occasions. The characters are very lovable and we genuinely care for and support them in their journey. It suffers from the same problem a lot of these animated spin offs have (Penguins of Madagascar, Puss in Boots, etc.), it dosen't have as much heart as the movies it is spun off from have, no scenes that warm us and make us feel sympathetic towards the characters to the same degree we do for Gru and his daughters, this is something I think should always be evident in animated films and it is a huge loss when it isn't. The voice cast is outstanding and certainly the highlight of the movie, Peter Coffin is obviously superb as every single minion, and there are also great performances from the likes of Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton, Allison Janney and Geoffrey Rush, who all sounded like they really enjoyed delivering these characters dialogue and wern't just in it for the pay check. It's certainly not perfect, but Minions is definitely a very fun and enjoyable ride that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good family film.After searching for someone to serve, the Minions become recruits for Scarlet Overkill, who hatches a plan to take over England, and eventually the world.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"I LOVE Minions, but was sadly disappointed.","As my title says, I loved the Minions in DM1 and DM2, I cannot tell you how much I looked forward to this film, especially after seeing the trailer which, I suppose as expected, has the best of the one liners.Maybe my expectations were too high but I was left disappointed. The plot is just not very good and just not funny enough. Some laughs, don't get me wrong, but considering the potential with these funny yellow blighters, not nearly enough. DM1 and DM2 had me quoting lines for days after and chuckling to myself (It's so fluffy!!!). Minions has one line (or word, you all know it!) and that is about it.The first few minutes of this film had far more potential (those that have watched it will probably understand what I mean) and I wished the had spent the first film charting their progress through history. Maybe the will be left for the inevitable Prequel!!I am sure plenty of kids and families will love it. I saw it with several 7 year olds who said it was good, but I guess that was post cinema excitement. All parents agreeing it wasn't DM.On the cast note, I like Sandra Bullock, but her voice adds nothing to the character. Poor casting I'm afraid. Whoever cast Gru got it spot on for an animated film.The franchise will make a killing out of the merchandise which is everywhere. They've done THAT job very well.

"A little too much Minion, but still entertaining","26 June 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Minions. I'm a big fan of Despicable Me and who cannot fail to love the hapless yellow Minions who only live to serve their evil master. This film was much anticipated and although I enjoyed it, my fear of Minion overkill did come true.....just a little bit. With their made up language, these endearing little chaps are entertaining in small doses but just a little too much in their own film. The story was solid......after serving many evil characters through history and unwittingly helping to hasten their demise, the Minions had established a colony but were losing their zest for life, so with the help Stuart and Bob, Kevin sets off to find a new master to unite the Minions once more. Their adventures lead them to Scarlett Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock) and ultimately to England where things go so wrong they end up right.

The gibberish they speak never left you wondering what was said. You got the idea and many of the words come through anyway. This is a movie I would recommend to any family.

I couldn't stop thinking ""WTF were there writers thinking when they wrote this"" while watching this in the theater. I'm generally very liberal in my movie going experience and in general, but because of this movie I will never let my child watch a movie until one of the parents have screened it first.

I think that along with the Penguins from Madagascar and Scrat from the Ice Age they are the best ""supporting"" figures in such movies.When the movie was out, I rushed to the cinemas to watch it, along with some other 30 something geeks and of course lots of parents with their children, with the same immaturity I guess but with an excuse at least...The movie was disappointing. Apart from a few laughs at the beginning, at some point all this made-up language of the minions was too much and it began to tire me. The story was nothing too elaborate or crafted. It seemed like the simplest scenario they could get to get the movie out. I cannot pin point exactly what it was that did not cut it for me, but I think that the language part was quite significant.I would expect something more adult-appropriate, as let's face it, these movies are not just for kids anymore. It's a really really generous 6/10 from me for this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Should have been better,"Expectations were high but movies was not.Upon seeing the trailer I was very eager to experience the movie but it was a disappointment. These yellow creatures were expected to create hell lot of comedy and stomach aching laughter which seemed to be missing, except a single scene. Most of the comic scenes to be laughed upon were already showed in the trailer so if you have watched all the trailer you must not waste money for buying the ticket.The basic story-line was told in the trailer only and the adorable gibberish of minions became a reason of irritation in some scenes. As far as narration is considered it is what they have shown in the movie, so no narration in the whole movie which makes some scenes confusing.Though the movie had several witty comic scenes but none were that appalling to have made the viewer ROFL, even children didn't displayed much excited response.As I said earlier the story-line was a disappointment though the movie started off very well and it was expected to be something different but all our hopes were shattered when the movie became a tail of bedtime story which has a villain that manipulate the heroes to get their work done and then betrays them.The animation was way too awesome and was one of the best things about the movie. Also the 3-D was really appreciable. On comparing with Despicable Me series Minion has no stand. In this movie there was a lack of Gru who would complement the minions or it could be other way around.So basically if you are a minion fan than you may find the movie awesome but if you are a Despicable Me fan than you won't have that big smile on your face when you'll be retreating the theaters.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

One to only watch with kids,"Honestly, having seen the despicable me series of films I was expecting better. The funniest parts were within the first 5 minutes really, with very few laughs through the film. It is only one you would want to watch with your kids on a very dull day. OK the plot doesn't have to be sparkling for a kids film, but at least make it entertaining. Unfortunately this was an utterly predictable and dull plot with very little entertainment. Yes the characters are minions so really what are we expecting of them? But the whole point of minions is that there are a lot of them, this film only focuses on 3, which kind of limits the film.Would I see it again....not in a million years, the minions are far more entertaining in despicable me, 90 minutes of them is torture.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not Sandra Bullock's best,"Really funny movie. Lots of little quirky links to other movies, well-known music, famous people. You'd have to see it a few times to catch them all. I was somewhat disappointed at how the director chose to use Sandra Bullock's voice. I didn't find the character of Scarlett Overkill frightening enough, and as a result Sandra Bullock's voice was somewhat plain, there wasn't much sweetness versus angryness/threat in the voice, like you find with other movie villains. Scarlet Overkill's plans for the crown were crazy, but that didn't really come out. Nevertheless, I think I'll need to go again sometime. There is so much funniness in this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mellow Yellow,"(Rating: ☆☆ ½ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended.In brief: Minions has its shortcomings, but it's the other characters that never rise to their level of fun.GRADE: B-Those zany gibberish-speaking yellow creatures are back, this time starring in their own feature length movie. With their limitations fully acknowledged and their inability to speak the King's English as a handicap, could they have enough clout to carry their own film to stardom? The answer to that is still questionable, but Minions is lots of fun as you sit there and ponder the outcome.Their slapstick antics are still pleasant and silly enough to make any moviegoer grin non- stop, even if the screenplay does quite value their worth. The film starts off very well with a short and clever history of their evolution. Narrated by Geoffrey Rush with a crisp British ironic delivery, these henchman search for a master villain to support, from dinosaurs to caveman to the Napoleonic Wars before the film settles in 1968. It is then we meet Kevin, Stuart, and Bob who are sent on a mission to find a diabolical master mind for the tribes' adulation. The trio bungle their way to a Villain-Con convention and into the clutches of the evil Scarlet Overkill and her doltish husband, Herb, whose sole goal is to get the Crown Jewels. (The story predates their loving master, Gru.)Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin direct the animated film and the latter voices the Minions to perfection. The film has a nice visual look throughout. The Minions themselves have individual traits and a variety of expressions that make these lovable characters work extremely well. As long as the film deals with the adorable threesome, their mob mentality and their relationships, the film succeeds. It's the story's slender plot that fails them and the audience.As with most animated films nowadays, the CGI trumps an underdeveloped script. Minions suffers from that malady. Too often the film relies on dumb chases and an annoying soundtrack of 60's pop tunes to add to the supposed merriment. The plot meanders from one situation to the next with no real purpose, adding minor characters that do little to advance the action. The villain isn't the least bit interesting, nor is her mission. The script by Brian Lynch becomes more illogical (even for a cartoon) and less satirical and witty as it finally reaches its clumsy ending. (You actually have seen the funniest parts of this film in its trailer.)Still, Minions is diverting and amusing, even if it never achieves its true potential. Like its overdone 60's score, the film is just too Mellow Yellow.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awfully Disappointing,"Minions Stuart, Kevin and Bob are recruited by Scarlet Overkill, a super-villain who, alongside her inventor husband Herb, hatches a plot to take over the world.I don't want to be the bad guy, but I thought this was an awfully dull movie. I like both ""Despicable Me"" movies and I generally like the minions, but something was off here. Really the only character I found humorous was Herb Overkill. The Nelsons were also okay, and I wouldn't have minded more with them.Scarlet Overkill was a drag. She was too over-the-top, her dresses just too much and she was too much... too much. I guess that's the irony of naming a character ""overkill"", but she just didn't have the right mix of humor and evil.On a positive note, the soundtrack is very, very good.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Minions proves these characters can carry a movie, but they need a more goofy surreal setup then the too safe British Caper here","In the current age of computer animations, the mainstream audience has never been more accepting. I'm serious when I say that people love animated movies more then anything. It's not's just with Frozen becoming the highest grossing animated movie of all time and becoming a global phenomenon, but it's also with Warner Brothers, Fox, Sony, and Universal setting out their own content that's opened up the hearts of many to the art form that many adults have seen before as just kids stuff. We had a similar revolution in the late eighties when The Little Mermaid, The Land Before Time, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit all came out show showed what kind of storytelling animation was capable of.Speaking of Universal Studios, no one ever expected a project like Despicable Me to have been as much of a success as it was. Those that went opening night would discover that unlike the works of something like DreamWorks's satire tone or Pixar's masterful storytelling found a new kind computer animation that we haven't seen a lot of; good old fashioned physical humor, Both of the Despicable Me movies are noted for their heavy, but funny use of slapstick, especially with the film's most iconic characters, the yellow pill-shaped minions. Given their universal appeal (no pun intended), it makes since to give them their own movie. The question most people had with Minions was, ""Can these creatures carry their own movie?"".Through a great intro, we discover that the minions started a micro-cells whose only purpose was to serve the most evil on earth. They bounce around from dinosaurs to cavemen to supernatural creatures and real life historical figures, only to lose them one reason or another. After the death of Napoleon, the minions retreat into the Artic where they remain hidden for many years.Tired of waiting, a tall minion named Kevin sets off to find a new master. He's joined by Stuart and Bob where they set off into the wilderness and later end up New York. They play around for a bit before ending up in Orlando, going to Villain Con hoping that their new master will be there. They get their answer in a beautifully terrifying Scarlet Overkill (played by Sandra Bullock). She takes them to her hideout in London where she describes to them their job of steeling the crown so that she can take over England. They receive gadgets from her inventor husband Herb (played by John Hamm) and set off, yet due to their silliness, take matters into their own hands.The good news is that the minions can carry their own project, but they still might need Gru to do so. The problem here aren't the minions, as they are expressive creatures that get a lot of fantastic slapstick gags, but it's with the people. The big selling point to Minions is their master Scarlet Overkill who may have Sandra Bullock, but is not that interesting of a character. They needed to make her a lot funnier if she wanted to match up to Steve Carrel's level.As I've said, the first half hour is filled to the core with some of the best physical gags in a comedy I've seen and sets the movie up for a big adventure. But instead, we get more of a British Caper. This wouldn't be an issue if the situation was more unique and funnier, but it's the typical spy scenario that we've seen before. Had Minions been a bit more consistent in tone, or perhaps spent the entire story just looking for a master, it might have been hilarious, but I see this more chuckle worthy then pee in your pants worthy.I'll give this six minions out of ten. Chances are, a lot of kids are going to want to see this, andyea, this defiantly feels more geared towards kids then a family audience. It's strange to say that Minions plays their game a little too safe, even though they would be very likely to play something else entirely. Let's see what they learn before making Minions 2 (I know this will definitely happen).",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

It seems best suited for kids 4-8 years old. I'm a fan of the first two movies and love the minions but could not get into this one. They probably just don't have enough substance on their own to fill the time for a full length feature. At least now we understand the origin of the species. The kids seemed to enjoy themselves.

What's not to love?,"""Minions"" is, without a doubt, worth all the hype. I saw this ""kids"" movie at 9:20 pm on a Tuesday night the theatre was packed.. with adults. The movie follows the evolution of Minions from pretty much the dawn of time until their latest misfortune with their master, Napoleon, puts them into isolation. It is not until Kevin and two volunteers - Stuart, who doesn't really know what he's getting himself into, and Bob - the most enthusiastic, unassuming and freaking adorable minion of all, set off on an adventure to find a new master that the Minion tribe have hope of fulfilling their purpose of serving the most despicable master on the planet.The minions go through one mishap after another - from starving in the middle of the ocean - to landing in 1960's New York City and spending the night in a department store - to hitchhiking to Orlando with bank robbers - to working for the first female villain, Scarlet Overkill - to Bob becoming the King of England (What, Really?

A fun prequel that creates more questions than answers,"Stories can be told in any direction and when it comes to movies, studios love to make franchises involving sequels and prequels. Despicable Me (2010) was a surprise hit that had intelligent writing, amiable main characters, plenty of comedy and heartwarming character development. When Despicable Me 2 (2013) came out, it not only continued its success financially but also critically by preserving the elements that worked in the initial installment. Of both films the character that became the official mascot of the series was the minion; the yellow, googly eyed, muddle mouthed, squishy, denim overall wearing pills that followed Gru until the ends of the Earth for him to accomplish his mission to be the greatest villain mastermind. It is because they became so popular that a film revolving entirely around them was made. Thus this prequel serves as the back story to how the minions got to the point of Despicable Me (2010). The question is, does it serve its purpose - kind of but not entirely.The plot to this prequel is actually a bit convoluted. Since the beginning of time minions have roamed the earth looking for a bigger and badder antagonist to follow. After trying through multiple time periods and failing miserably, the minions finally go into isolation. Over time their life becomes stagnant and three minions named Kevin, Bob and Stuart (Pierre Coffin) decide to go out into the world and find their groupies an evil leader to follow. On their travels they see an add for VillianCon - an underground society where evil geniuses around the world come together to celebrate being bad. There the trio find Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock), an outlandish hyper-stylized fem-fatale who has the rights of being the first female villain. For this feature, Brian Lynch (Puss in Boots (2011)& Hop (2011)) served as the screenwriter and seems appropriate since Puss in Boots (2011) was also a prequel film to that of Shrek (2001). However even with this credit given, there's a lot that isn't answered.The voice acting performed by Pierre Coffin and Sandra Bullock are the highlights in the acting. There are other voice appearances throughout like Jon Hamm playing Scarlett's boyfriend, Michael Keaton as a rogue father of a crime family and Geoffrey Rush as the narrator of the story. Yet none of the other characters are that important because they do not appear in Despicable Me (2010) or Despicable Me 2 (2013); it's rather disappointing. Animation and direction is also a plus. Kyle Balda (Co- Director of The Lorax (2012)) took full reigns of the project and it is competent. The lead character animator credit belongs to Christophe Delisle who has also worked on The Lorax (2012) and Despicable Me 2 (2013). Delisle's animation is smooth, colorful and is comical when it needs to be. Another interesting thing to take note of is the gradual alterations that have been given to Kevin, Stuart and Bob. There's a difference in their designs seeing them from Despicable Me (2010) to now. Possibly the most notable change is that Bob isn't so wide, he's been thinned down some.For writing other than the main plot, there are several parts that don't make a whole lot of sense. For one, are minions immortal? Besides surviving some of the most hostile environments, did anyone else notice that they haven't aged since they came onto the screen? They lived from the dinosaur age, medieval times to mid 20th century. There's not even a real explanation to where they came from. Another big question are historical records. If minions have existed for this long in time, just how exactly do people in later times not know who they are? Surely someone must have documented such indestructible and loyal creatures. Then there's the whole separate issue of the humans in this particular universe. Unfortunately for England, London was the choice for setting and some of what is displayed is overly exaggerated. The UK police have car chases while pouring hot cups of tea - alright. The whole country of England hands over their entire kingdom to anyone who wears the crown - ummm yeah. I don't think the humans from Despicable Me (2010) or Despicable Me 2 (2013) were this silly.The human character reactions to what the minions say on screen is also half and half. Sometimes they look like they understand and other times not. This too goes for the audiences' reactions. This feature unfortunately suffers from taking a supporting character and making it a main character. Sometimes it's not a good idea, especially if you can't grasp their language. Remember The Star Wars Holiday Special (1978)? Yeah it's not as bad as that but same concept. Lucky for us the minion- ese language consists of various common words so it's not as tough as understanding wookies. The music was adequate for the film. Series composer Heitor Pereira returns and maintains the same feeling of the music although there is no main theme. Adding to that are a bunch of old school soundtrack songs from popular English rock bands during the late 1960s such as The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Monkeys and others. It's appropriate for the setting.The voice-acting is fine, the animation looks better than ever and the music works. Honestly for a prequel it is not as well crafted as Despicable Me (2010) or its sequel. Even though it nicely ties in the events that took place before the minions met Gru, it leaves a lot of big questions in its place. Those minions are lucky they're so likable because otherwise it would not have been as enjoyable even at the most minimal level.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The better movie out of the Despicable Me franchise.,"After reading mixed reviews, I was still pumped to see Minions, but a little bit suspicious about if it will be an average kids spin-off that's meant to sell plush toys and Happy Meals. Therefore, I saw the 3D 3:20 screening of the film and- surprisingly, it was a great, cute, and fun movie for all ages to enjoy! The story at first parodies documentaries in a genuinely quirky technique, followed by a few hilarious antics caused by the minions!! But the story also follows the quest of three minions(Kevin, Bob, and Stuart) to find a new boss to work for. This part also is executed very cleverly, with plenty of British stereotype jokes that made me laugh hard and slapstick comedy that made me giggle like Looney Tunes!! Although a few of the funniest gags are in the ads and Sandra Bullock feels phoned in, the movie was hysterical, beautiful to look at(especially in 3D), and the voice actors are top notch. Plus, there is a cameo that I won't spoil, but it's pretty damn awesome. Hell, even the soundtrack was EPIC, no pop songs at all!!

It did have a solid ending I will say (most people could probably just as well guess what it is story-wise if they know the series enough). As I would agree with one other audience critic: it did lack the Despicable Me charm I will admit, which is really the only real negative to this besides one of my overall opinions: I feel like it would be hard to make a film only starring the minions (Gru stole both shows the most I would say, with even the minions not quite making second place).

couldn't get enough of this movie,"MINIONS review by: Mike SmithFor centuries of looking for the most despicable boss and coming up short, 3 Minions, Stuart, Kevin and Bob search for a new leader to bring joy to the rest of their tribe. After being recruited by super-villain Scarlett Overkill, Stuart, Kevin and Bob go off on an action packed adventure.This maybe the best film in the trilogy. The story is fun, funny and action packed; the story never really has a sad point like most animated films and the story never has a dull moment. I laughed out loud throughout the whole film.One thing that stands out in this film is that most of the dialog is the minions and most of the words are gibberish. But you don't need subtitles to understand what is go on because it plays like Pingu or Mr. Bean. Our two other main cast members are played by Sandra Bullock and Jon Hamm; they did an awesome job because not for one moment did I think of them as anyone else other than their characters. One set of characters I enjoyed in this film are played by Michael Keaton and Allison Janney who are a family of robbers; I'd like to see a spin off based on them.The animation is great and Minions uses some different styles of animation, there is 3D animation which is throughout the whole film, some 2D animation and even a bit of stop motion animation. I think all of the different styles were all done by computers instead of the traditional ways for making stop motion and 2D, but it still looks great.With action, comedy and all around fun; I had a grin from ear to ear, I couldn't stop laughing and I couldn't get enough of this movie.

Then animation happened, something that was supposed to be funny because the main characters were bumbling mumbling cretin yellow balls with eyes that somehow managed everything by mistake. And then it was over.Don't get me wrong, I am not against childish cartoons, I liked Despicable Me, even the second part, sort of, but this was beyond boring, utterly inane story telling, targeted for idiotic three year olds. And while I may appear to be ranting, that is an artifact of text reviews. I am very calm and objective when I am reporting that watching this is a waste of time for anyone that has lived more than 5 years.Bottom line: Sandra Bullock, John Hamm, Michael Keaton, Geoffrey Rush and Hiroyuki Sanada were actors for this nothing of a movie. The minions should have been green, with a big $ on them.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Children's comedy, no deep story.","I can highlight of this film is an extraordinary animation, the technology used in this film is fascinating, the colors, effects and also carries hand the great music. Each character and landscapes and locations are wonderful. I also want to emphasize the original ideas that were used in the movie, the plot twists and resolution of conflicts for me were quite interesting. OK! but the movie is full of completely stupid jokes, coupled with the dumb language of Minions. This is a clear example that is directed to young audiences, even for adults and adolescents, the movie can be very silly. The Minions are made to cause tenderness and pleasure to everyone, but the dose of these characters can be too. Spanish dubbing in this movie were very bad, especially Ricky Martin and Thalia was not the best choice and this may be due to the script. The human characters were not featured in the best way. And summarizing the plot is very simple, not complex and does not have moments of tension, and the biggest mistake for me was that there was no message, nothing deep in the plot of the movie, which is necessary in these animated films, because otherwise it does not leave you anything this film. 6.1/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nothing more than a time killer,"I had watched Despicable Me just to understand the memes and to get within the lines of the pop culture. I never understood the deal with the Facebook memes which have pictures of Minions in them and have quotes written next to them. So I used to think Minions always speak out funny one liners for the audience to have a quick laugh at. After watching Despicable Me I realised this was nothing but cheap publicity, but then I decided to watch the whole franchise anyway, and so here we are. After having watched the original trilogy, this one feels a step back, but that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining enough.Minions is a spin-off to the Despicable Me franchise (the name of the franchise is Despicable Me or Minions, I will never know). This tells the story of how the Minions found Gru and became his, well, minions. In the beginning the Minions were only wild animals who used to serve whoever was evil. They move on from one master to another, until they have none left. And that's when three Minions set out on an adventure - Bob, Kevin and Stuart (isn't it funny that they have English names even though they were born before humans existed?).The franchise has a really good animation style. It looks cute enough to be memorable, especially seeing the Minions take part in activities in the things they see for the first time. Even the action scenes of these movies are incredible. Scarlet Overkill being shown as a total badass and then getting her comeuppance made this movie so much fun to watch. Queen Elizabeth's mockery was also very funny, especially the part where one of the Minions tries to pull the sword out of the stone. The ending with Gru was also very unexpected and gave the movie a happy (?) ending.What this movie lacks in, however, is the storytelling. This is not a good movie, but rather a good ""enough"" movie. There's nothing in this which you haven't seen before. The plot is mostly predictable, many parts are very annoying to watch, especially Scarlet being a generic female villain who always wins with martial arts. Other than Queen Elizabeth and Herb there weren't any memorable characters. Herb was memorable and still I forgot his name.Minions is one of those movies I can imagine kids going crazy over, since the movie is targeted only for them. If you're an adult you will find this movie very childish. It's not like the Despicable Me trilogy which is fun for the whole family. It has just selected all the things which made the franchise marketable and went all out in showing them here, namely, Minions.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The law of the strongest (and of those around him),"The intuition belongs just to the firsts two chapters of the saga. ""Minions"" works like more or less all the mascot spin-offs: his aim is confirm to the audience the reason of the mascot's success. So ""Minions"" is none other than a tracking shot of gags, supported by the fact that the yellow little monsters have to reach the despicable and associate with him. The most interesting element is in this archetypical need of survive and fraternization with the strongest specie: something of cruelly Darwinian is hidden behind the small banana-lovers. But for the rest, the line is weak: a movie to take for what it is, a funny tribute to a character impossible not to love. With also some undercurrent philosophical hint.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious but with Clichés,"Minions is the prequel to Despicable Me when the minions are seeking the greatest villain to serve. Unsuccessful in their search, they retreat to a cave in the arctic, but Kevin (one of the minions who makes the most appearances in the Despicable Me films) refuses to give up and so ventures on a quest to find the minions a master. Joined by Stewart and Bob, they travel to Orlando where they discover the most celebrated villainess to date: Scarlet Overkill. After a competition, she hires them to work for her and her first assignment for them is to bring her Queen Elizabeth's crown. However, the minions do something entirely different...Having watched the trailer, I already acknowledged the plot. If I dissect it, the first half an hour is golden and thoroughly enjoyable. The humour came thick and fast and I felt eager to see what the remainder of the film would bring...needless to say, I was slightly disappointed. The villainess determined to prove that females can be as malicious as males, not to mention the fact that she desires the queen's crown in order to become the queen herself, is all too familiar. What could have been an invigorating plot that distinguishes itself from that of other action and adventure stories for children starts as superb but becomes cliché-ridden and predictable from the middle onwards. Despite this, the ending was perfectly satisfying and Gru being introduced to the minions was a great addition.The minions are all likable with Kevin, Stewart and Bob delivering the most laughs and being the three minions which are different from the rest. However, the human characters were much less impressive. Scarlet Overkill is the stereotypical villainess who intends to prove that women can do evil as well as men and dreams of being queen, when she could have been a single woman who craves company and some thrills in her life. She is the main issue I have with the film, whilst the other humans who made an appearance were just plain.I must commend the animation used, for it is impeccable. The same foulproof animation which is used in the Despeicable Me films is used here and it is pleasing to the eye. Clearly, just as much dedication has been put into this film than what was put into the Despicable Me films.Overall, Minions is a brilliant family film which both children and adults will admire, but it could have been so much better had it not been for the aggravating clichés which crop up in the middle.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Real Great Prequel for Viewers And Fans To Watch,I enjoyed watching this film but not too much. The storyline clearly could have been much better but it was enough for viewers and fans to watch. I got the feeling that the crew did not put too much effort into creating this film. The cast selection was great. This film revealed the cast pushing themselves out of their comfort zones and pushing themselves to the limit.This film does connect to the whole storyline of the series but there were some pieces missing. The storyline reveals to viewers and fans the many sides of life. This is a nice film for everyone to watch but it could have been made better for the whole storyline of the series.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unrelentingly awful.,"I also have a high tolerance for bad but fun films. And kids' films. And films where one has to suspend reality and just jump in the deep end of silliness. But this is just 90 minutes of unrelenting awful. This film had such potential - the Despicable Me movies were fun romps, with character and emotion. This fails on all counts. There is no bonding with the characters, no real plot and so many inconsistencies and holes as to be cringeworthy. There's one decent fart joke 5 minutes in and then it's just plot less, racial stereotyping, unfunny, repetitive dross. I really wanted to like it, but if I hadn't had the kids with me I'd have walked out part-way through.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stuck on the Minions,"Very funny and cute movie. Some of the comedy is probably over the heads of the little kids but the visuals can keep them entertained.The storyline is obviously a prequel and was interestingly written and flowed well into current minion lore. Since I did not get into the minions through the Despicable Me movies, I'm a late bloomer but definitely a fan now.This was the first time I could actually hear real words that the minions spoke...too funny. They are lovable, adorable and funny. The new movie franchise I think as long as the writers can keep the stories interesting, clever and funny.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good fun,"Introduced as the henchmen of Gru in Despicable Me and reappearing alongside Gru in Despicable Me 2, the Minions now get their own movie. We see their history, from prehistoric times to the late- 1960s. Their purpose in life is to serve a despicable, villainous master. After falling foul of their last master, the Minions end up masterless, living in a cave and leading a pointless existence. Then three Minions - Kevin, Stuart and Bob - set out to find the Minions a master.Reasonably good fun. Basic in plot, hardly profound and not exactly laugh-a-minute it is still fairly entertaining. While the humour is sporadic there are some great comedic moments. There's also a sweetness and innocence to the whole thing that is quite delightful.Voice casting is spot-on. Sandra Bullock, as Scarlet Overkill, is the pick of the bunch.Kids are sure to love it and adults should find it enjoyable enough too.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Torture,"Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 were adorable, cute, funny, and lovable, so I did something I almost never do--spent the money to catch this as soon as it came out, rather than waiting for the dollar theaters. It was a mistake. This was pathetic. The first 5 or 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes are the only truly funny parts of this seemingly 16-hour movie. I took my 10- and 7-year-olds; the only time they laughed were as mentioned. It gets 1 star for cute cultural references, which goes straight over the heads of the kids; even most parents of children that age don't recall the late 60's. It's not particularly cool when your kids are having to interrupt the movie to get an explanation of what's supposed to be funny. The rest of the ""humor"" is of the 12-year-old boy kind and largely relates to missing pants, bodily functions, and the like.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

Silly and cute,Is this movie a cynical cash-grab? Yes. Is the plot flimsy? Yes. Is this movie art? Oh hell no. As movies go you'll definitely see much better. You'll also see worse.

Minions,"Given the megalomaniacs the poor ""Minions"" have had to work with over the years, it's not really surprising they are a bit flaky! Now, though, they are also rudderless. They have no guiding light. They have to find someone so dastardly to be worthy of their loyalty - but whom? Well, ""Kevin"", ""Stuart"" and baby ""Bob"" find are determined to settle this, and so are easy prey for the scheming ""Scarlet Overkill"" who has plans to commit the mother of all crimes. Not since George Zucco tried it in 1939 has anyone ever tried to steal the Crown Jewels from the Tower of London. She's tired of playing second fiddle to the men in the criminal fraternity but can her diminutive yellow henchmen facilitate her way to the Queen's throne itself. Loads of daft escapades and some duplicity later things come to an head with Beefeaters, a dungeon, dinky police cars and a good soundtrack to accompany their adventures. It's quite good fun, this, with loads of quickly paced action and some quite wittily scripted scenarios keeping ninety minutes of goggle-eyed action worth watching. The garbled baby-squeak does grate after a while but this is clearly just an introductory means to an end, this film, as the denouement shouts sequel at us and we meet a true nemesis of the law-abiding world.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Bright and colourful, but not that funny.","Bright and colourful with a few funny moments, but hardly any jokes that will make you laugh out loud. The main trio (and their tribe) are comical and fun to watch, but the story is nothing special and the other characters are boring or underdeveloped. Lots of British culture and 60's references, but there should have been more gags in the other time periods.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good Family Fun,"Whilst these gooey lemons weren't the focus of Despicable Me, they were without a doubt the stars. As great as Gru was, not a single kid or adult left cinemas without at some point going ""Bannana!"" So it makes sense that they should end up getting a movie all of their own, that still has the same great animation and visual gags that made the franchise enjoyable to begin with.It starts out giving a brief back-story for the history of the minions. Turns out the minions have been around since the dawn of time, always following the most evil bosses they can find. But their masters don't seem to last long as the minions end up accidentally causing the downfall of everyone of them, from Genghis Khan to Dracula. After hiding out for several years (leaving them oddly absent from having to work for the likes of Hitler or Stalin), 3 of the pint sized ducklings (Kevin, Stuart and Bob) go off to America in search of a new master in the 60's. Thus they go on an adventure, finding a new master called Scarlett Overkill, stealing a crown and accidentally taking over England.The plot never actually takes any form, never remaining focused for long with the small yellow blobs getting distracted by every passing thing. But with the slapstick and chaos of the minions you don't really need one. It's less of a story and more of a series of sketches for the minions to put them into different situations going from hanging out with a family of bank robbers to being stepped on by the Beatles in Abbey Road.An unexpected joy of this film ends up being the soundtrack. Not just because of the great Minion renditions (it starts off on a particular high note with the minions singing the 20th Century Fox theme), but also just a great selection of classic 60's tracks that should fill parents with nostalgia and introduce kids to some classic tracks.However the film does have one key problem, which is there's too much from the minions. Their slapstick is funny, but it's not enough to carry the film for an hour and a half on it's own and ends up feeling worn out towards the end. The Despicable Me films mixed in Gru's brand of humour where he played the victim, that stopped the minions slapstick from becoming repetitive. It's also lacking the same emotional core that a character like Gru brought to Despicable Me, with his bittersweet story of a man becoming a father being far more engaging than a crazed villain wanting to own a crown.But whilst the minions work much better as side characters, this spin off never feels like a misfire. It still has enough humour to be fun for the family, but just lacks the same level of rewatchability as previous films of the franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
To much violence,"I love the minions but this movie is so violent. A bank robbery, a crazy woman and a torture chamber. Come on you don't need to put that in a kids movie. My 4 and 5 year old were crying hysterically by the end of the movie. I was not laughing at all. I was bored and trying to keep my kids who were begging to leave calmed down. This was the worst follow up to the despicable me movie. Wish I had asked for my money back. I was so excited to see this movie because I was told Jon Hamm was really a funny character and at times he was but his character is also pretty much stupid and unnecessary. Sandra bullock having a kid of her own should be ashamed of giving her voice to such a violent character. The only part of going to see this movie that I actually enjoyed was the preview of another movie about what our pets do when we leave the house.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
I guess a movie about yellow creatures who can hardly talk is just not worth it,"This could've been better, I guess, I was really excited about this movie because I love the Minions and Despicable Me is a fun franchise but this one just lacked a bit of heart.

I was quite disappointed that there was no Gru until the end and even then, he was a child with a voice too old for his age and even Tina's voice doesn't fit the kid very well.The characters in there are basically annoying, even Scarlett, who was pretty likable until the film's final.The film is cute and somewhat funny, but not as funny as the Despicable Me movies and is also really boring for the most part.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as bad as I expected,"The minions have a reputation for being annoying characters so I was hesitant to watch this at first. It was better than I thought! True, the minions are only funny in small doses so their presence gets tiresome in a feature length movie, but there is a surprisingly heartfelt plot to tie it all together. However, the film is let down by some of the awkward and overly long gags that slowed down the film. Also, there is a big emphasis on Scarlet Overkill who is just not as interesting or memorable as Gru from the main Despicable Me series. To be honest, I had the most fun watching this film once I realised that the minions were actually speaking real languages and tried to guess the origins of each of their phrases.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cute Family Flick,"I am always entertained by the Minions. I did not find this to be hilarious as I did the last Minion movie, but I enjoyed it all the same. I was born in 1960 and I find the animation jaw dropping. Movies like this can take you away from all the stress in your day. The last Minion movie (the title alludes me right now) was up there with the best of all time. Such as Shrek, Toy Story, and the recent Cinderella. Yes, it is worth seeing. This may be your favorite as what ingredient that brings us humor is different for all of us.I am grateful for the film industry. Entertainment like this being brought into your home on TV screens of all sizes and HD is wonderful and affordable! My next investment is a theater room in my home.

Slapstick at its best,"To remove all doubts, this is no masterpiece, no one making it pretends it is. This is simply a good fun movie that doesn't insult its viewers intellect. About 90 minutes of shameless slapstick, that's both clever and never resorts to vulgarity, even though some fart jokes do squeeze in. As far as I'm concerned this is as good as directing animation can get, considering the fact that one of the two directors does the minion's voices this means more than just technical knowhow and good control over the movie's pace. This is good comedy, and comedy as we all know ""is hard"". So don't underestimate some plain good fun and the absence of pretension is in my book one more big plus. Bottom line, for me, this is the best animation movie I've seen this year, tied with Big Hero 6, though it's considered 2014. I simply count the last 12 months.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cute movie that doesn't know what to do with its story,"There's a lot of hate for this movie here, but overall I really enjoyed it. Making a movie about characters that talk in gibberish and were mainly designed for slapstick gags in a different film is not easy, but they created a whole mythology for the things (I always figured they were invented by Despicable Me's protagonist) and manage to build a story around them. And it has a lot of the same silly humor of the original films.I'd say it was really very enjoyable for about an hour before it got away from the writers. The last half hour is hectic and doesn't make much sense, including things like a big chase scene that comes out of left field. It's a lot of noise lacking the cleverness of the first hour.Even that last half hour though isn't bad, it's just weak, and I say, ignore the haters and take a look for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Un-apologetically insipid, and therefore awesome. Exceeds (low) expectations.","My expectations were very low for this. It came and passed in the theaters and I didn't see it. I only rented a DVD at a friend's request. I was prepared for the worst and received a pleasant surprise: the most amusing, fun cartoon of the year.This is an absurd cartoon with basically no plot and every 60's reference not previously hogged by Men in Black 3, and yet it is fun to behold. It has slap-stick, pop-references, political-references, and plain- out likable characters.The movie starts so-so, mediocre. But by the time they are hitch- hiking to villain-convention, the movie suddenly gets really creative and goes full-speed ahead with funny moments and interchanges. What the plot lacks in structure it more than makes up for in pacing. For me the best part of the movie is the late-1st Act to the 2nd Act. It's one of those movies that progressively gets better as time goes on... until it jumps the shark. BIG TIME. By the 3rd Act the movie manages to over-step my BS-limit, which is a shame. By the climax the movie strangely goes full-circle back the mediocrity and staleness of the beginning.But man, that 1st-to-2nd Act was awesome. The characters are very likable - mind you I'm not talking about the minions, but the secondary characters. Scarlet was so-so, pretty good but not as awesome as 'VECTOR!', her husband though, was I thought perfectly done, it's so weird how for all the couple's insanity, they still have a very healthy, loving, supportive relationship. Most villain- couples break in to bickering when things go wrong, whereas these two actually stick with each other to face their arbitrary, nonsensical enmity with the minions. Also, I hold that the family that picks the minions up hitch-hiking has got to be the best scene of the movie.The problem is really that the ending is contrived, and the 60's- references are heavy-handed and wear old after the first 5 minutes. Also, the plot has no structure.Upon the end of this movie, it strikes me that this is a perfect prequel. In every way. It is very much in line with the tone and message of Despicable Me 1, without relying on pandering with cross-references. There are almost no references to the future films. Everything happening is more or less self- contained within this film, and sets up the original only in tone and humor --- the polar opposite of what Lucas did with the Star Wars Prequels. The characters are just as strong as the depth achieved in Gru's in the original. The minions are still rather blank, the extras are still shallow stereotypes. But the supporting characters are beautifully scripted and performed -- just like Despicable Me's strengths and weaknesses. The plot is still rather loose, the dark-to-slapstick-to-dark humor is still strong as ever.I always felt that Despicable Me 2 was crap. Still do. In Despicable Me 2, the plot was more cohesive -- and incredibly boring and generic. The humor lacked punch in every way. The ending was lame and over-blown. The Characters were flat.Minions is rather a step back to what worked, they fixed the problems of DM2 and returned to the strengths of the first one. Looking at the strengths of Minions, it is identical to that of Despicable Me, but with a different plot and different characters. If you called this film stupid, you'd be right, but that's not the point. What matters is: how is the stupidity delivered? In 'Minions', the absurdity is shamelessly embraced and executed very cleverly in non-generic ways. Whoever wrote this was a very intelligent and very twisted individual.This is a film that is bat-guano insane, completely pointless, and written by a genius. Not good, but by God do I RESPECT it.If you're an adult looking for an intelligently mindless 90 minutes, I recommend no better film. It is also good for kids, oddly enough, my 6-yo brother was jumping on the couch in excitement during the high points, and showed genuine concern during the low-points. Quite a balancing act, to entertain two completely different ages for completely different reasons with the same optimal result. I'm not sure why everyone hates this movie - I blame the marketing- over- saturation; it gave people the wrong expectations. So if you watch this... do yourself a favor and keep an open mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too Much Whipped Cream,"The Minions in the Despicable Me movies were used perfectly - within moderation and only for embellishment. A side-character is their role for a reason - because their isn't much more of a story beyond that (or at least one worth exploring).Giving the Minions their own movie is like putting too much whipped cream on a Sundae - too much of one loved added flavor that totally overrides the actual course of the meal. The Minions were the whipped cream that added great flavor to the movies, but making a whole meal out of a topping usually doesn't last long and in the end is not that great of an experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Think about this,"I think movies like this are very particular to your type of humor, and (I'm not sure if I should say this but) I really thought it was funny. It was more complex than a simple good-guy bad guy plot, not because of the plot itself, but because of the elements and settings of the movie. It moves around the world and while of course there are going to be stupid parts, if you come in expecting a movie about little yellow guys, the nice touches on the parts of the minions traveling through New York in the 1960s and the beginning with the minions evolving from organisms go a long way. I didn't care that much about the evil lady whatever her name was, but I guess that's just me.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

If you have seen Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 then yes I would recommend this movie to you and if you are big fans of the minions go and see this film. This movie is set is get before Despicable Me and the Second Despicable Me and yes it is hillaorious and I wont tell you what happens in it. Go and see this film and enjoy this film.

A worst movie.,I like minion jokes in despicable me but in here it is so boring to see.I think minions film is better that despicable but in my opinion the worst movie in whole series.They are doing silly jokes in here and they are not funny to me.I think this is a great fun for children under 5 years but this is not a fun for me and a very short story to me.A small story going around this story and no characters like in despicable me.Only minions.despicable me is much better than this movie.To me I want some comedy in animation movies or some adventure scenes like in toy story series.I think this a great comedy but I got really disappointed when I watch this and I an animation film must to more to entertain children and adults.To me still toy story 3 is the best animated movies to me.It is good for adults too and it is not boring.I think that is how a film would be.In this story only they are showing how they found a leader and nothing else.An animation must have a comedy scene anywhere.I know some like this but to me it is worst movie.I am not recommend it to others because it is boring to me.I hope a better minion movie will come to enjoy and have a fun.,1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not bad.,"Minions is a decent comedic adventure, I never really liked the Minions as characters I think they're childish (even if they're meant for children!!) and some of the jokes were cringe worthy, the slapstick got boring after awhile.That being said I really did quite like the main villain Scarlet Overkill(!) and her plot to steal the crown jewels and became Queen was suitably both funny and outrageous. The best moments in the Minions film was when the Minions were not the highlight...which may be a bit of an issue considering they're often the highlight.6/10: Light hearted and occasionally very funny but nothing extraordinary.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the worst movies in the list of worst movies,"Illumination animation has done it again by adding a spin-off movie despicable me and adding a movie with only minions and you well get minions.I hate the minions movie because the casting for the movie was sub-par I mean they had a narrator for 6 minutes or less for absolutely no reason as were the movie can be told through visuals and my god the animation for this movie was terrible but take this for example, I draw a simple face it looks cute but then I start adding more details to it to make it look like something hideous.The minions movie has a tad bit of eccentric comedy and there are two terms of comedy: Surrealist comedy and silent comedy and there were two more animated movies on 2015 which was SpongeBob Squarepants Sponge out of Water and Shaun the Sheep the movie.Let's start with the SpongeBob movie, it is a live action movie and it was pretty clever for having Antonio Banderas as the evil pirate and so onethen came the Shaun the sheep the movie however it is told through visuals this means that no one talks during this movie other than gibberish which is also funny.But when minions try to do this it is not funny anymore it is just boring and stupid.
So here's the plot, the minions are in a search for a master(villain) and one becomes the king of England another one Jacuzzis with two fire hydrants just to make an innuendo for some weird reason, the plot always falls into plot twist and they are not even consistent.And on that year they discouraged kids to watch the lego movie even though it shows good morals and responsibility, they want to dumb them out by watching a minions movie how stupid is that",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good But Lacking a bit of Magic,"If you re a fan of Despicable Me and the Minions then it's really hard to dislike any of the content. The writers knew they tapped into a good thing that sells, and for good reason, with the Despicable Me series and it seemed only a matter of time until the Minions got their own gig so to speak.I enjoyed the first little minion backstory the movie starts off with but then in comparison to the Despicable Me series I found the story to be not as compelling. When all is said and done there are moments that make you laugh but I don't feel that I'm likely to remember any details about it too far in the future.Overall decent family movie that you re sort of obligated to watch if you follow the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Spin-off piffle,"While the Minions were amusing characters in the ""Despicable Me"" films, they can't carry a movie on their own. The opening sequence about their evolution and ongoing search for an evil overload was imaginative filler, but once the main story took over, the movie degenerated into a series of repetitious sight gags, only some of which were particularly funny (such as the minions riding the Queen's corgis). Neither Sandra Bullock's ""Scarlett Overkill"" nor Jon Hamm's ""Herb Overkill"", the principal speaking characters, added much to the story and I quickly grew tired of the Minion gibberish/language. Comedy may be the most subjective of genres, so this is especially ""IMO"" but, unlike ""Despicable Me"" (2010), I didn't find ""Minions"" to be either particularly humorous or particularly entertaining (never-the-less, it made a boatload of money, so others must have).",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's certainly not as clever or as funny as the Despicable Me movies. This movie was obviously made for small children.

The perfect family movie of the year!,"""Minions"" is one of the most anticipated movies because of its child-friendly concepts and storyline. The story's concept about finding a master was very detailed. It started from the pre-historic time up to the present. The hilarious and outgoing personality of the characters will fill all the viewer's eyes with laughter and tears of joy. The director has successfully brought the essence of loyalty and stewardship. I like the entire storyline because it never brings a single boring and dull moments throughout the film. To sum it up, the movie will surely crave people to look forward for the next episode.

I'd rather watch the emoji movie 10 times,"What is this. When the top review right now on IMDb is a troll review giving it a 10/10 you know something is wrong. I get that this film is trying to appeal to kids below the age of 3 with the lack of dialogue and utter absurdity, but at least make it enjoyable to the general public as well. If you want to get an idea of much you might enjoy this film (out of 10), you can simply take the inverse of your age and multiply it by 10. For example, a 1 year old would rate this film a 10/10 and a 25 year old will enjoy this film 0.4/10.OK now onto the real review. I'll first preface this by saying I really liked the first Despicable Me, and I watch many animated comedies - I'm not some sad old man with no sense of humor. But the attempted comedy in this film is so dry and stupid that it's honestly hard to laugh. Perhaps you can laugh out of pity. At least the emoji movie is a film had expectations so low and responses so bad that we could laugh about it. All this film does is have minions laugh and ""speak"" (more like make random sounds) in an annoying voice. Honestly there's no way you wouldn't hate minions after watching this film. The jokes in this film are unoriginal and poorly integrated.Plot: There is no plot.Characters: Lol. (can you really call minions ""characters"" when they have no personality and all look the same?) Setting: OK I'll be honesty, the animation and setting is pretty well made, but there's no reason to watch it for that. It's literally just a high budget DreamWorks animation :/ My advice is don't even take your 1 year old kid to watch it cuz even they will cry at how horrible this film is.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Watch only if you are a die hard fan of minions!,"Bananas! Minions are back, yes they are; with yet another movie of the franchise. Have they lived up to their expectations? Lets find out. The movie narrated by Geoffrey Rush begins with the introduction of the Minions and a recap of how they are always in search of villains to serve. But this time they have been without a master for three years. So three Minions—leader Kevin, Stuart and Bob set out to take boredom out of their lives. Do they succeed? They reach New York where a villains' conference is being held. On learning that Scarlet Overkill is the biggest super villain these days, they are excited and take part in a competition where the winner gets to be her henchmen. On winning the competition they are assigned a task to steal the Queen of England's throne or face death.Minions are a crazy phenomenon these days. They are cute but this time they are not funny. All you get is overloads of cuteness. But apart from a few scenes, is the movie worth a watch? Well the movie will leave kids entertained and rolling with laughter as was evident in the theatre.

Th Minions Begin,"Minions is the third film with the yellow creatures of the same name and is the start of a prequel trilogy to the Despicable Me franchise. It shows the beginnings of the minions as a species until the point they met Gru, and the sequel Minions Rise of Gru would continue from there. There's plenty of typical minion humor throughout. It is interesting to learn more of the story behind the minions. I prefer the first two Despicable Me movies though I still find this one alright. It's meant for younger audiences and I have grown out of the target audience, though I was in it when it originally released. Even when I revisit it 9 years later, I believe it still holds up today despite not being as good as the original 2 Despicable Me movies. Would definitely recommend it to anyone with kids.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Minions,This is so much fun... My family was laughing and coughing on popcorn from the humor. 10 stars!! For me seeing the movie was enjoyable and allowed my family to share a fun afternoon together. I liked many of the jokes in the movie and was a pleasure. Can not wait to play it at home on DVD. Great film... I loved Sandra Bullocks voice and Jon Hamm. Sandra to me is such a versatile actor. There is no role she can not do well. Jon is equally is great with awesome range and great looks. I know that they had fun doing these voices. As I said we laughed throughout the movie.

"Not Horrible, But Still Bad","Minions follows the minions from the animated movie series 'Despicable Me' as they search for the most evil master they can to serve.How do I even review a movie like this? I really can't name a whole lot of specific things I didn't like, it was just too childish and didn't make a whole lot of sense all the time. You could argue that it's a kid's movie so I can't say that, but that is probably the least valid argument you can make about any movie. Considering the amount of kid's movies that have been enjoyed by all ages, you really can't just pull out that excuse for this movie specifically.The movie really just wasn't that funny. I could tell that it tried to appeal to an older audience, but it didn't work for me. It was all just referential humor that won't be funny in a few years when those trends have expired and no one has any idea what they meant. I can't say the characters were good or bad because I didn't know what any of them were saying. Although I can say that I don't think Sandra Bullock was a good choice for Scarlet Overkill. She just didn't feel right with the role. Her voice didn't match with her character very well, nor did she seem to be at all into her role.Overall Minions is just a poorly made movie. It's not completely terrible, I chuckled a few times, but it's just not any good regardless. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"never trust ratings, see for yourself","I was skeptical when I saw ratings, but it wasn't the first time I was pleasantly surprised. I don't see this movie only as a children's entertainment, but also as a deep artwork. Just look at the fact how their invented language works and how they used so many languages to construct ""Minionese"". Beautiful. The paradox between the good, sweet and bad was the main wheel from the first movie, and they kept it in this one. So many details (just look trivia section) shows me that this was not either fast or superficial artwork. And my favorite is the Queen. Shown not as she probably is, but what she's supposed to be - kind, good to people, a true leader. Only thing that was not so great is a choice of music. Yes, it's obvious - it's late sixties early seventies, but in my opinion they could put more effort to it regarding to everything else. Conclusion - see it for yourself.

Franchise officially ruined.,"Despicable Me was a pretty good film. It was funny, kids-friendly and had a very talented voice cast. It's sequel was pretty bad. This? This officially ruined the franchise. There was a little bit of hope after Despicable Me 2, but we all know the next one is going to be terrible. The first few scenes were pretty funny, and featured great narration by Jeffrey Rush (Captain Barbossa). But it all goes downhill after that. The villain, Scarlett Overkill, is flat, clichéd and her one-liners are terrible. You just start missing Gru. I mean, the minions are funny, but the franchise needs Steve Carell. It needs all the human characters from the first one. And most of the humour just isn't funny. Some of it's good, but the rest is just bad humour. This might entertain small kids, but it won't entertain the rest of us. Guaranteed.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Silly w/out Substance,"I've loved the minions in Despicable Me. Their comic-relief was really a mainstay of the movie. I, like many others, assumed that their own movie would be absolutely delightful - I was wrong.The magic of the minions' appearance is that they are comic 'relief.' Taking the nature of these momentary laughs to create a full feature film turned out to feel actually quite empty. There's a plot-line, there's a hero, there are villains (often confused with the hero, on purpose). Yet, none of it seems to really matter. All of our main characters were not made to be main characters.This isn't to say there aren't some funny moments. There are three or four truly hilarious situations, in true minions style. However, on the whole, this one is not worth the time.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the worst and cheapest cash-grabs in movie history,"This has to be the most uninspired cash grab I have ever seen. I came in with low expectations, watched it bored, and left in anger. Even though I didn't pay to see this, I still feel cheated as a moviegoer.Nobody tried on this movie. None of the characters were interesting and I wanted the minions to die every time they got in a life-threatening situation. I don't understand why they're so beloved.The thing that makes movies like Pixar films and a FEW of Dreamworks' stuff good is the humanity, emotion, and storytelling. This had none of that. You don't feel anything. You shouldn't even CARE about the minions. They're just living merchandise that can move and talk on screen. The first Despicable Me definitely had emotion to it and it was decent. This was kinda like Despicable Me 2, but far worse.I could also tolerate a movie with few emotional substance, if it at least had enough humor to make it watchable. But it didn't even have that many jokes either! I didn't laugh once, except for a chuckle or two. The people in the theater that did laugh didn't even laugh that hard.The 60's references were predictable (Look! The Beatles are walking across Abbey Road!) and while the soundtrack was my kind of music, it was all just generic 60's music hits. Like every major artist from the 60's had a song in the movie. Nothing you haven't heard before.The only thing holding me back from giving this the lowest possible score of 0.5/5 is that it didn't have Video Brinquedo-quality animation. But it still wasn't incredible or impressive in any way. At this point it's honestly hard to find a CGI movie with unique and stunning animation, except Hotel Transylvania or Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.If you have a faint interest in seeing this, just don't buy a ticket for it. Watch Inside Out or Ant-Man or another good movie then sneak in to see it. But even seeing it for free wasn't worth my time.Destroy Illumination Entertainment. Destroy the people behind this movie.

Very disappointing considering all the merchandise made and expectations we had for this movie..,"I honestly don't write reviews very much but I felt like I had to for this one. Long story short, Illumination Studios MESSED UP real bad with this movie. We were all expecting some amazingly funny movie from the previous movies (despicable me 1 and 2), but maybe we were spoilt with the humor and quality so much that we were all just expecting too much for this movie. I mean it wasn't a train wreck, but the movie felt very forced and it just didn't have that magic to it that so many animations have these days. All of the jokes were pretty much shown in the trailer for this movie, and I don't really think the movie should have gone the way it had, it was Way too focused in London for some reason. This movie is completely different to despicable me despite still having the minions in it and I think this movie was only meant for kids this time despite previous movies still being entertaining for adults and teenagers. My advice is to not watch this unless you really can't find anything else to watch, most of the laughter is summed up in the trailer anyway I guess everyone makes mistakes lets all just hope despicable me 3 is good (if it ever gets produced after a failure like this that is....)",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Go and watch it with your family, your friends, or even your girl-/boyfriend and you won't be disappointed.

Nothing Special,"I was never a big fan of Despicable Me (haven't seen the second one) but Minions turning out so mediocre still disappointed me because the trailer promised a fun film that seemed to be a lot better than what we ended up having. The problem is a lack of engaging story-line, there were no real stakes to it.At the start of the film I was fairly amused but by middle I felt bored. If there had been another protagonist to focus on maybe that would have made things better. Like say a character who can actually speak English and who we could root for because the Minions alone can't carry this film. It's now abundantly clear that they belong in the background.Also there was nothing special about Scarlet Overkill. Gru at least was a distinctive character whereas Scarlet was the Strong Independent Woman that we have seen a million times before. So the film also failed in having a memorable villain.So basically if you are an adult and you still have retained your love for animated films then there is nothing for you here.

Well done, Sandra Bullock!And of course I have to mention Pierre Coffin's incredible work as the Minions, which must be the hardest cartoon character to voice ever after Donald Duck, yet he pulls it off without even questioning whether the voice is a human making a weird voice or a species never discovered my mankind.Thank you for reading my review.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Limited spin off and poor story,"Went to see this with my family including two sons, 7 and 13. That is usually the reason I go to see animated films of course, though as parents they are usually the only reasons to actually get to a cinema.Sadly, although I was quite looking forward to this one, it was a let- down. The best feature (to start positive) was the incredible skill of the animation - but that's also kind of a given these days, isn't it?On to the bad aspects - there's a huge lack of story involved here, unless you can call some fairly random events and experiences a 'story'. The lack of real language holds the minions back as characters. Not as much a problem when they were only 'supporting' characters. Some scenes and jokes do not seem child friendly to me either - too retro or borderline inappropriate (torture being funny?). My kids didn't laugh all that much either when watching.Perhaps it had something, as I was browsing IMDb afterwards and felt like adding my first review due to this film.

I did not even know who Gru or the minions were before I saw the Minions' trailer -while attending another movie in the theater. But somehow that Minions trailer got my attention and did not leave me for a week: I simply had to see this cartoon that created such an original language for its protagonists. A linguistic grab from the get-go. I grabbed 3 friends with a sense of humor -we are all mature adults- and off we went to see Minions. We loved it!My personal take? MINIONS is not a children's film: it is way too good for kids! To start with, it is sprinkled with cultural references from Mozart' s Magic Flute to Prokofiev to the Beatles to the Monkees to the Who to Napoleon to Godzilla to James Bond to 60s politics and more. I am very sure the viewers who claim they were not entertained by this movie failed to notice the amazing level of culture placement, high and low, packed in that tiny plot. Pretty remarkable for a children's cartoon. Hey, a children's movie that does not bore the parents out of their gourd? Banana! Yes, the plot is silly, but the script is clever. Take the reference to the ""fake US lunar landing"" every USSR citizen grew up with, for instance: it zips by for a micro second, but what a zest that mini scene packs. The ""Papagena"" pick-up line by Bob to a fire hydrant in New York? What a beauty of a cultural mash up!But to me the hilarity palm goes first to the crazy linguistics of the 3 minions' speech. The 3 minions speak gibberish, but with such Esperanto gusto that all viewers understand what they mean. A difficult premise to start a film, but a gambit that works here against all odds. I don't know who the makers of this Minions cartoon are, but I think there is genius to their madness.The choice of soundtrack music was fun, the action was never flagging, the visuals were pleasant and often spectacular. No kidding: that movie was sweet candy to our ears and eyes, and, banana!, to our brains as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Huge fails and they don't speak English,"This movie starts out boring and ends morning. While despicable me was great this movie fell very short. Oh and Ps they don't speak English. It's mostly in Spanish with a few English words here and there. fail.Stick with the first two movies. This movie proves my sequels usually never live up to the originalsI give it a 2 out of 10. It was hard to watch all the way. The comedy isn't there, nor is the story, I found myself strugeling to stay awake. Even the children in the theater weren't laughing or entertained. They really blew this movie. And the fact that they speak Spanish is a huge let down and makes it even that much less enjoyable.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Minions is annyoing and not funny.,"I watched movies with these characters, they are not funny, they are annoying. I recommend watching the YouTube video ""Grobir Reviewer evaluates: Overrated animated movies"", in which the critic and his companion looked at the trailers and video clips of things like ""Minions"" or ""Despicable Me"" and then started fighting the minions.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun heist,"I'm kind of surprised that this was as good as at was. Considering the Minions don't speak English, I thought it wouldn't really work as a full length movie if most of it was in Minion-ese. However, it does work and somehow you can understand what they're saying perfectly. This is an absolutely hilarious film. I'd say it's one of the best of the year! It's even got references to the original ""Despicable Me"" movie. Most of the humor is visual, rather than from the writing. It was great seeing everything tie in from this prequel to the original movie. It helps explain some things. Although it took away my theory that Gru created the Minions, their real origin is no more ridiculous than mine. It's fun for the whole family, and I look forward to ""Despicable Me 3."" I need more Minions, and I need them now.Grade: A+. 10/10. 5/5 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Totally Hilarious! 8/10,"Review: I couldn't stop laughing through the whole of this film and the fact that the little Minions didn't even speak English, proves that expressions and gestures are good enough to tell a story. Right from the history of the Minions, at the beginning, to the bonus material on the DVD, brought a smile to my face and the way that they joined the movie with Despicable Me, was a touch of genius. Even the Bradley Wiggins looking villain, Herb Overkill, made me laugh and all of the characters funny face expressions were spot on. Anyway, the lovely little Minions keep on, mistakingly, killing there masters through many generations, so they try and live without one for a while but they soon get bored of there own company. Kevin then comes up with the smart idea to go and look for the perfect villain, so the Minions have the perfect master, but none of the Minions want to go with him except for Stuart, who is quite a little rebel and Bob who is there lovable little brother. They then hitchhike there way to America and they find out about the Villain-Con from a bank robbing family who offered them a lift. When they get to the Villain-Con in Orlando, they sight the perfect villain, Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), who can save Minionkind from total boredom and after winning a competition between many other villains, the Minions are recruited by Scarlet to get the Royal crown from the Queen of England. After bonding with there new master, they head to London and the Minions attempt to steal the crown with the help of Scarlets husband, Herb Overkill (Jon Hamm), and his handy gadgets. Whilst on the run from the Royal guards with the crown in hand, Bob pulls out a sword from a stone to tackle the guards, not realising that the person who takes the sword out of the stone, immediately becomes King so he gladly rules England along with his two friends while the rest of the Minions are struggling to survive in Antarctica. Anyway, Scarlet soon realises that the Minions are ruling England, so she convinces Bob to change the rules and appoint her to be the Queen. As she is still upset about the betrayal of the Minions for not getting the crown, she banishes them to the basement while she is taking over England. On the day of her crowning, the Minions escape from the basement and they disrupt the ceremony by causing havoc in the palace. She then gets all of the villains whose attending the crowning, to kill the Minions but Kevin shows true leadership by using his brain to outsmart the villains. I know that a lot of people preferred Inside Out to this movie but I personally think that this was much better. I was thoroughly entertained right from the get go but it does get a little crazy towards the end. There are clever little touches, like the little rat and massive dinosaur, which are very well written and each little Minion bring something different to the film. There contagious laughs always brought a smile to my face so the movie really gets the thumbs up from me. Brilliant!Round-Up: Because of the ending, it's doubtful that they will bring out another Minions movie, which is a shame because it's in a class of its own. The person who provided the voices for the Minions, Pierre Coffin, also directed the movie with Kyle Balda, who also co-directed the Lorax. Pierre Coffin also brought you the Despicable Me franchise, which I also enjoyed, so he must be over the moon with the success of all 3 movies. I also liked the Minions short films that came on the DVD and the Christmas sing-a-long which has the actors names who provided the voices. Anyway, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to work out that I really enjoyed this film and I can't see anyone, not finding the little Devil's hilarious. For this year, Jurassic World has taken in the most money at the box office with a whopping $1.6Billion, with Furious 7 and Avengers: Age of Ultron coming a close 2nd & 3rd and this movie is clearly in 4th place, which I personally think is well deserved. Although Inside Out is a better film in a lot of people's opinion, it comes in at 5th place in this years chart, right behind this movie. Anyway, the only reason why I didn't give this film full marks is because it does go a bit wild near the end but apart from that, I highly recommend it for all ages.Budget: $74million Worldwide Gross: $1.15billionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/family/comedies starring Sandra Bullock, Michael Keaton, Steve Carell, Jon Hamm, Steve Coogan, Geoffrey Rush and Allison Janney. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
would rather have the plague than watch this again,Why......just why do films do this. The trailer i saw of this film a while ago i thought mmmmm could be a good film but like most films recently the trailer for the film has all the best bits and the rest of the film is a waste. 2 minute trailer great the remaining 1 hour 58 minutes of film AWFUL!! Pierre coffin done all 899 minions voices and also this was first time sandra bullock played a villain there is the only 2 items of interest regarding this film. Don't get your hopes up high for this film as you will be very disappointed the soundtrack is decent. films like inside out and home show us just how to make entertaining films maybe if they do make another minion film they should watch the films above first so they can take notes.,2.0,Anonymous,Animation

The 7 and 10 year old actually fell asleep during the movie. We all loved ""Despicable Me"" So this one was a huge disappointment. I am not sure what age group they were going for, when they made this movie. Maybe 2 or 3 year old. It put me in mind of the Teletubbies, but even they were more entertaining.

"It says the movie is in English, but the Minions don't even speaking English","If the Minions can't succeed at speaking English how can there be a full movie about them. This is what really bothers me. Even if their taught English they refuse to understand. I know it's supposed to be for Comedy, but I still think it's unnecessary to make a movie about the Minions you want them to speak English. I'm not good at long posts, since I'm more used to the 500 character limit YouTube used to have, But the minimum on here is 10 lines. So yeah, the minions don't need a full movie unless they can speak English. I know I said it many times in this post, but at least I had a reason to say it. I don't have too many things to say about this movie. The movie itself could be better.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Sure, don't see it. You'll be the only one...","Stuart, Kevin & Bob are just about household names by now. Who doesn't know these lovable banana craving midget freaks who speak in a gibberish language which seems to be composed of Spanish, French, Indian and English? since Despicable Me 1 came out the popularity of these creatures has been steadily growing. For Minions Universal pulled out all stops: the combined advertisement value of all promotions done by Universal's partners for this movie is about 600 million $. The faces of these critters could be seen on 500 million chiquita bananas, boxes of cereal, whatever you could think of they were on it. So unless you've been hiding under a rock for the last year you've probably heard of 'the minions'. Now with all this anticipation the film has large shoes to fill. Though I seriously enjoyed this movie I have to say that it can't match the heavyweights in the animation genre created by Pixar. Those movies work better on an emotional and storytelling level. Minions as you would expect has a story but it is nothing more than a vehicle for these yellow monkeys to do silly stuff and to goof off. And that they do very well. The minions have become icons -like Mickey Mouse- who will long be remembered after this movie has been forgotten because they will live on through the merchandise produced by the 850 manufacturers with whom Universal made licensing deals. So do I have to recommend this film? Probably not, coz in a couple of years there won't be many people left on this planet who haven't seen it yet...",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A boring and uninteresting cash-grab. (What you expected.),"Be honest. You knew this was gonna be bad. I went into ""Minions"" expecting exactly what I got in return.The ""Minion"" characters were first introduced in ""Despicable Me"" (2010), and were a very creative and original concept. the idea of yellow, gibberish-speaking freaks as side characters was actually kind of funny. ""Despicable Me"" was a huge success financially, and was generally received well with most critics. After this, the minions were everywhere, and I mean EVERYWHERE. Toys, video games, clothes, backpacks, mugs, even amusement park rides. So naturally, a sequel was inevitable. And so came ""Despicable Me 2"" (2013). They did a good job ""upping the ante"" with the laughs and and the characters were even better than the first. I really enjoyed the combo of Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig, but the main antagonist, while funny, was not as good as Vector. The ""Minion Craze"" however led to most of the film focusing on them. It could be funny at times, but overall didn't work, which was really my only problem with the film, other than the lack of a little more character development.So just when you thought Illumination Entertainment were going to make another original movie, in comes the announcement of a Minion spin- off, literally called ""Minions"". Original, right?I really didn't know what they were going to do with their ""characters"" in this film, which are Bob, Kevin, and Stuart. Yeah, remember those minions that were mentioned like once or twice in the previous films? Yeah? Well now they're main characters for some reason. I mean, what else could you've done? The Minions are a completely disposable group of ""characters"" with literally no personality traits to differ one from another. There are literally THOUSANDS of them, kinda like the Clone Troopers from ""Attack of the Clones"" (2002). They ended up giving over-used, boring ""personalities"" to them. Kevin was the leader, who only wants to be respected by his tribe. Bob was the kind-hearted, lovable one. And Stuart was the idiotic ""bad boy"" who liked music for some reason? What makes these traits even more stupid is that they are never mentioned in the originals, and they probably won't be in any upcoming sequels either.I am glad, however that there are actually HUMAN characters in the film. Scarlet Overkill, played by Sandra Bullock, is the films main antagonist. Sadly however, her personality and monologue are also over-used and generic. A female antagonist seemed pretty cool, and you can tell she has some traits similar to a ""James Bond"" villain. Until they explain that the reason that she's evil is that she was abandoned as a child, and only wanted to be adored and loved by the world, like a queen. Yeah. You've heard it before. Not to mention that to me Bullock's voice acting seemed pretty wooden, like she just kept her eyes on the script the whole time she recorded her lines. It may be just me, but probably not, considering how many other problems this movie has. Her boyfriend Herb, played by Jon Hamm, while sort of funny at times, was also pretty flat and boring, like literally every OTHER human characters.Back to the humor. Again, after TWO other movies, the Minions just aren't funny. Not to mention all the 60's and 80's pop-culture jokes and British stereotypes that I'm sure no kid in the theater would understand, as well as a flat-out SEX JOKE, that oddly enough, I'm sure most kids in the theater WOULD get.However. There was actually one bit that I laughed at, where Kevin is fooling around with one of Herb's machines. It quite possibly was the only thing I could call funny about ""Minions"". (But I won't explain it in detail, because this is a no spoiler review.)I just don't get it. Both kids and their parents busted out laughing at the most dumb attempts at comedy you've ever seen. I just don't understand why people are still eating up what I dubbed ""Minion Humor"".But again, it is what I expected: Not god-awful, but not good whatsoever. But I might be going a little to rough on it. It's just difficult for me to understand why everyone wanted a solo Minion feature so badly. To be honest, It would be sort of idiotic not to make one, considering how much money they've made with the franchise. (They even recycled music from the other installments) But it's not like they didn't try, considering how clear and detailed the animation looks. It just seemed very rushed, and if they could flesh out the human characters a little more and add better humor (Considering most of the ""okay"" humor was in the trailers), it could've been a lot better.Sadly, it wasn't.The kids for sure will enjoy ""Minions"" (below 10 yrs). Parents (More than likely) will find this boring at times or somewhat entertaining. (But who knows, everyone else on IMDb seems to like it.)""Minions"" was a huge success on opening day and, sadly, will for sure be one of the Summer's award-winning, block-busters.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointed,"We were Looking forward to another Despicable Me based movie, but this was awful. The first ten minutes were cute, with a historical look back at the minions evolution through history. Fast forward past this segment and the movie went from promising to awful. The plot gets stuck in the 1960s for the remainder of the film. UGH, no one under 60 could relate to this era, let alone any children. The theater was silent for most of the movie, very few audience responses.Also the Minions themselves (again past about ten minutes) grew boring and bland from lack of coherent dialogue. They cannot carry a film for this reason, unlike the Penguins from Madagascar. We guess we expected more, but got way less. We will not be adding this to our Blu-Ray collection.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun animated comedy to enjoy with the family,"A quite very funny spin off to ""Despicable Me"" focused on the beginnings of the Minions before meeting Gru, I must say that this movie offers quite funny moments in the journey of the three yellow protagonists to find a villain to serve. It goes without saying that the animation is quite good because it's already obvious and Sandra Bullock gave Scarlet Overkill a lot of personality with her performance, making her one of the best characters in this entire franchise. Minions is undoubtedly a fun children's movie to enjoy with the entire family and for all the above my final rating for this movie is 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Strictly for Kids.,"Minions is without a doubt a money spinner which didn't consider the depth and options that would be available when making a full length feature movie with such a limited script.The Minions were my favourite aspect of Despicable Me, they were funny and fresh, bringing fantastic support to the lead character Gru. This is where they are best, being offered in small portions, supporting other characters. Introducing them to the big screen, alone, without a leader was always going to be difficult to pull off and personally I feel like they failed. They benefited so much as supporting characters that putting them centre stage simply didn't work.The greatest characteristic of animated movies is how they appeal to all audiences equally. Minions is very much a kid orientated film. It has little appeal to adults and it simply doesn't try to target that market. It is extremely more childish than the Despicable Me films which is to be expected I suppose but I will still disappointed nevertheless.All the funny bits are in the trailers, which was massively disappointing. Gone are the days when you can watch a trailer to give you a sneak peak of a movie, still leaving you with some surprises when you view the movie. 3-4 minute trailers are ruining the film experience and I tend to stay clear of viewing them.Overall Minions lacked any real depth and having 90% of the movie script-less hurt it badly. The story follows the minions on their search to find a leader but ironically, not having a leader is what made this movie fall short.A generous 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good for kids and for the family, but not for me","My face while watching this movie (-_-)The story is about the origins of the Minions, the little, yellow creatures have always attached themselves to the most ambitious, powerful super villain with one mission - serve them with all their might. But when the masters are killed, the Minions find themselves without a purpose and thus go into a self-imposed exile. After years, the Minions finally return and in the 60's attends a super villain conference where they hope to find a new master - and the first female super villain Scarlett Overkill seems to be the obvious choice.Who the hell doesn't love those little yellow one eye or two eye minions. They made Despicable Me one and two watchable and stole the show for us. Minions have become a fan favorite and everybody couldn't get enough of them and now they got they very own stand alone movie starring them of course. I was looking forward to this movie, I mean the trailers looked funny and yes the real reason is for Minions. I thought a full feature movie starring them would be a blast to watch as in the Despicable Me movies they are good with they slap stick humor. Now after seeing the movie I'm a bit disappointed of what we got.The movies animation is stunning as always. Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment never seem to disappoint me when it comes to animation and the little details with the model for the characters or just stuff in the background, they always look great and well made. I bet they animation will still look fantastic in the late future.The Minions themselves are once again enjoyable to watch. They humor and slap stick are just the same in Despicable Me movies put I got a issue with the slap stick in the movie as the movie is focus on the Minions and they do they normal slap stick humor and it dose get a bit old and kind of stale after a while. In the Despicable Me movies the Minions only have a small screen time when it comes to they slap stick humor and it's funny all the time, but a full feature movie of all that got kind of old to me. It's was the same thing over and over again to the point where it wasn't funny anymore. You may like the slap stick humor for a full feature movie, but for me it got old really quick.Sandra Bullock as the villain of the movie was decent enough, but nothing really special. It wasn't terrible or anything amazing, it was on the level of okay. Sandra Bullock is a great actress and even when she's in a bad or okay movie she normally dose a great job in the movie and here she did the best she could and I give her that. Not one of her best but it's decent enough to let it pass.This is a good movie for kids and for the whole family. It's cute, it's bright, colorful and enjoyable and I can see why some people may enjoy it. You may think I got a cold heart for giving this movie a rating like this and your right.Overall this isn't a bad movie and yes you may look at the rating and straight away think it's awful, but really it's not bad but it's nowhere near good. I was looking forward to this movie as I thought this may be this years second best animated movie, but to me it sadly fell flat. But hey, who knows you may like it and yes I do say that a lot but it's true. I get lots of people who have seen my review and gone to see the movie and came back with a different opinion compared to my own. If you disagree with me that's fine, but at the end of the day I'm sticking of what I said.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disappointing,"A group of adult friends watched this movie on the evening of Christmas day and found it to be very disappointing. One friend commented that we had sunk to a new low. Only a couple of times did it cause a trickle of laughter, mainly to be polite to the person who supplied the DVD. We have enjoyed animated movies such as Big Hero 6, How to train your Dragon, Frozen, Penguins of Madagascar,and Maleficent and always look forward to a new animation that we can watch with our grandchildren. If we had taken them to a movie theater, it would have been a waste of good money.The actors who supplied the voices must have had a treat, not having to memorize (read) any lines, as 90% of the movie was a mumble jumble of a made up language, basically causing the viewer to guess at the gist of the story.

"not a classic, but has more then few decent laughing moments","So, watched the ""Minions"" today, and was surprised that this film has so much love and so many great reviews. I mean don't get me wrong, i think a child will love the film and the little rascals that the minions are. But....The film starts off with narration and origin story of the minions and what is their purpose in life. That quickly grows a little to tiring, it was a good concept when it was part of the opening credits, but feels like it dragged on a little bit. Then we are introduced to our 3 main heroes, Bob, Kevin and Stuart. The three stooges of the minion world. Now, there is no point in going into details about it as the film is mainly for kids, so Kevin, Bob and Stuart go on an adventure to find the tribes their new boss. Which takes them to England.Now i know that little kids probably found the whole film very enjoyable, seeing the little yellow minions talk in their language and run around, for me as an adult, i found that only a handful of scenes had me truly laughing like i was a child.For that i give the film a modest 5/10 stars.

"A boring animation movie, even for the kids!","When are these spin-off movies gonna end? OMG this is the first time and hopefully the only time i say this, i hate Minions.When people said Dispeciable Me movies are a hit because of minions, i did not agree and with this movie my argument just stands tall.They came out of no where in Dispecable Me and stole our hearts. And i think that is where they should have stayed. For instance, you go to a 7-course meal and don't just wish you had more of the cup cakes? and when you have more of them and nothing else you don't want to eat anymore, that is this movie in one line.Minions with their mannerism and slapstick gave us a real treat in the first two movies, in this they are just plain annoying. If you guys have seen the trailer then that's it. That is all the laugh you will get out of this movie. I was really surprised by that, i thought trailers were supposed to be a sneak peek into the fun adventure we were expecting, not in this movie.Iam OK with the minion language, it is funny as long as you have some actions showing what they actually mean, but here they just talk in the Gibberish and every minion laugh (The Coronation scene). I mean what is that all about? i paid money to watch the movie and don't even understand the language in which the joke was said? How is that fair.The movie lacks any purpose at all. If you are making a prequel of how minions are with Gru, i just guess the movie could have started with Gru and how they bond, but it choose another villain for the heck of it and ended up making minions a hero? Sounds confusing, minions are adorable but they are henchmen for an evil guy and hence they are evil, why would the movie want them to be proclaimed Hero, no idea. So if the minions are working for another villain isn't it a rehash of despicable movie? It shouldn't have been scripted like that Aside that fact, i wanted to see some fun minion moments, again that was missing. Nothing even made me chuckle and as the movie went on and on, i started hating them. Making the Universal music in Minionese, not cool at all but i know what was into, still to bore with the same thing over and over is not fun.Movie lacks story, fun, logic and conviction. If you just want to watch for Kevin and Bob just go for it, otherwise don't even bother.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Too much violence!,"I recently watched Minions with my family. I figured minions would be similar to Despicable me. Sadly I was completely wrong. For an adult the Minions movie might be hilarious, however, I found that it is way too violent for children. They definitely pushed the envelope with the PG rating. This movie includes scenes such as a bank robbery where children assist, children playing with weapons in the back of a vehicle, and during the robbery get away one minion fires a rocket launcher at a police officer. Although an adult might think these scenes are funny, the influence they have on children could be damaging. Keep in mind what children are watching influences what they do. I kept thinking the movie would get better and yet again I was mistaken. I ended up walking out of the theater with my family when the character Scarlet Overkill said, ""This is not a coronation this is an execution."" I have a 7 year old and 4 year old. I watched Despicable Me (1&2) prior to allowing our children to view the movie and the minimal make believe violence in the movie was tolerable.

A money-making machine.,"As I've had the opportunity to say before, in other reviews, animated cinema has been prodigal in the emergence of films that, following box office hits, give prominence to secondary characters who, somehow, won the public's sympathy. ""Minions"" does nothing more than repeat this recipe again, knowing in advance that it would be a box office and a merchandising hit. For the studio, this film was worth it only because of the guaranteed cash flow, and the film reveals this to us because of the little investment made in a quality plot.Really, the film doesn't have a specific story: we just see an outline of the Minions' life trajectory, extremely light and far-fetched, before we follow three of them on a trip to the US, in search of a new boss, a villain to who serve and, of course, to annoy. The film works as a prequel to the first movie in the ""Despicable Me"" franchise, an expendable prequel, made with money in mind, based on unthinkable characters for protagonists: suffice it to say that the Minions make me think of cheese puffs. It's not the kind of character I would bet to star in a movie.As a result of all this, the film is excessively long for the plot it brings, it is predictable and is full of problems of logic and historical rigor (it is set in the 70s). I'm willing to forgive the anachronies, but the problems of logic and the film's uneven pace are harder to put aside. Being a comedy, I found the film excessively lukewarm. There's really almost nothing to laugh about, especially considering that the Minions' nonsense, which was funny in ""Despicable Me"", loses its force here. The overture scene works reasonably well, but it keeps getting worse from there. It lacks, above all, creativity and good ideas, a dose of commitment in creating a film that simply relies on the cuteness of its characters. It was, from the start, doomed to be a disaster.On a technical level, the film also doesn't do as well as it would be desirable. The most salvific aspect turns out to be the visual style, colourful, vivid and vibrant, pleasing to the eye. However, this is something that almost becomes mandatory and demandable in a film that was composed with the most modern resources of computer graphic animation. The satisfactory work of the voice actors is also noteworthy. With his well-modulated voice and impeccable diction, Geoffrey Rush has done very well as a narrator, Pierre Coffin was very competent at voicing the Minions (although the voices never sound very different from each other) and John Hamm seems to really enjoy his work. Jennifer Saunders was OK, but Sandra Bullock didn't convince me. The film also features several other very good voice actors, such as Steve Carell, Michael Keaton or Steve Coogan, but does not give enough time or attention to their characters. Another positive technical aspect of the film is the soundtrack, which uses several outstanding rock songs wisely and without exaggeration.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Minions: A Hilarious Spin-off that Delivers on Laughs and Charm,"""Minions"" is the spin-off prequel to the ""Despicable Me"" franchise, and it delivers on all the laughs and charm that fans have come to expect from the series. The film follows the mischievous and lovable minions as they search for a new evil boss to serve. The animation is top-notch, with the minions' expressive faces and physical comedy stealing the show. The voice acting, led by Sandra Bullock and Jon Hamm, is spot-on and adds an extra layer of humor to the already comedic script. The story may not be as strong as the previous ""Despicable Me"" films, but ""Minions"" more than makes up for it with its non-stop humor and likable characters. Overall, ""Minions"" is a fun and entertaining addition to the franchise that will delight fans of all ages.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Will kids like this? Yes. Will adults? No.,"I am a huge fan of the ""Despicable Me"" movies. They are very good examples of films that could make kids crack up but also have enough heart to get adults interested in the story too. ""Minions"" does not follow in the footsteps of it's predecessor. The animation is obviously well done and the minions make a very likable protagonist. But two hours of that silly minion language is just too much. It can be funny from the start, but by the time the movie ends, they just start to irritate you. The supporting characters such as Scarlett and Herb Overkill aren't as interesting or compelling as Gru and Lucy. ""Minions"" doesn't give enough reasoning on why you should care about the story. All this movie is is just silliness, conflict, more silliness and then it ends. Verdict: The kids will be occupied with fun cheesy minion weirdness but will leave adults bored out of there minds. I recommend you just stay at home and watch the original ""Despicable Me"" movies.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funny and back to the start,"The film's slapstick animation and pop-culture-literate content make it a must-watch for fans of the series. The Minions, a billion-dollar business, have been given their own standalone movie, Despicable Me, which serves as both a prequel and origin story. The film takes viewers back to the dawn of time, when the Minions evolved from tiny organisms into banana-loving henchmen whose only goal was to serve the most despicable master they could find. The Minions evolved through the ages, locating and serving villains during various eras, including the Jurassic era, the Stone Age, Ancient Egypt, and the Dark Ages. When a series of baddies die, they retreat to Antarctica to experiment with a master-free existence. Without a scoundrel to serve, the Minions become aimless and depressed, inspiring one of their number, Kevin, to set sail with fellow Minions Stuart and Bob in search of the biggest, baddest villain on the planet. The film's strongest section is the Minions working best when left to their own devices, with no human as funny or strange as these lovable oddballs. The bulk of the movie takes place in New York, Florida, and London in 1968, featuring interaction with human characters who aren't as amusing as their yellow co-stars. The Minions eventually meet a family of bank robbers and head to VillainCon in Orlando to search for the world's first female super-villain, Scarlett Overkill. Sandra Bullock's character, Overkill, lacks personality and one-liners, making her schemes the focus of the movie. John Hamm's portrayal of her husband Herb also fails to make an impression. The film shifts to swinging '60s London, where the Minions steal the Crown Jewels, find the fabled Sword in the Stone, and engage in jams with tea-drinking Bobbies and the Queen. The set-pieces are imaginative, but the spectacle becomes larger as the finale nears. The jokes are thick and fast, with enough slapstick and silliness to satisfy young audiences and more mature jokes at the expense of The Beatles, Richard Nixon, and the moon landings to make parents laugh. However, the film lacks a compelling plot and the heart that made the Despicable Me movies resonate with audiences. It eventually turns into a Scarlett Overkill vehicle rather than focusing on the title characters, making the film feel like it lacks the courage of its convictions.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Watch if you have ADD; otherwise: AVOID!,"This movie may seem harmless in its content, but where it's toxic is where it decides to use its story and direction to make clear that it doesn't care about kids' potential intellect for subtlety. Minions doesn't give anything the audience doesn't realize it wants: it just plays it safe with fart-jokes and gibberish (the yellow-people's gimmick to start off with) and pop-cultural references because it is an empty shell with nothing to show for itself. It suffers from Shrek the Third-itis, where the movie doesn't care that it exists as long as it makes money and exploits the families paying to see this crap. The story, if there is any really, is just focusing on sentient yellow tic-tacs and their 'struggle' to find a villain they can follow blindly: fitting metaphor for impressionable kids who haven't watched PIXAR movies yet (REAL CGI animation done right, with actual story)!

Well it's mostly a combination of being narrated by Geoffrey Rush, jokes, and generally having an idea of the topic.It funny with laugh out loud moments and has jokes for adults and children, awesome voice actors (Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton and Allison Janney) and beautiful, smooth animation. Also worth a mention is the awesome soundtrack, much like the previous films.It was awesome to see them from their creation to looking for a master throughout the prehistoric ages, dark ages through to the '60s and all the different masters they had and their eventual demise.Minions is an awesome movie with 91 minutes of lighthearted fun and if you are a fan of the first two Despicable Me films, then you should watch this.

"One star, but only because we cannot rate a film no stars","Minions - good grief. An hour and a half that I will never get back.Back in 2015 my son went with his cub/scout group, for a special treat, to see this movie. When he got back I asked him how it was; as a family we all liked the Despicable Me films, and this was part of the deal. Surprisingly he was a little reticent - he loves going to the cinema - and non committal. I now know why.This is an utter abortion of a film. They could have made 18 five minute cartoons, or maybe two good ones, rather than invest the time this move took to drag out in a full length feature.There was a plot; not a good one, admittedly, and - weak and lame as it was - it looked like someone had taken just two minutes to outline it on one side of a damp sheet of toilet paper. In crayon.
There were characters; again, not good ones (mostly forgettable, in fact) and the director appeared to have tried to make up for the lousy plot by telling most of the voice talent to ham it up like their lives depended on it. There was also quite a bit on national stereotyping, always the sign of a lazy scriptwriter, or a director looking for an easy life.
Even the animation appeared to be of a lower calibre than the usual Despicable Me quality (!); maybe because this was a movie set in the past, possibly to give the trainees and apprentices some on the job experience, but I suspect it was more just to save money.
The soundtrack was the best thing about this film, but then all you can credit Illumination with is choosing it; yet the target audience is 15 and under - who amongst them is going to listen to or even care about a bunch of songs from nearly 50 years ago?I like the Minions, as characters. It is a concept that has a history in slapstick, and they can be as violent as can be gotten away with in cartoon form because they are quite obviously not human and appear to be indestructible. They work well as criminal, erm, minions in the Despicable Me films and they do make for amusing five minute fillers on the DVDs; this was one or two five minute cartoons stretched full length and packed with filler to pad out the slack. And there was lots of slack.I doubt if we'll see a Minions 2 anytime soon. I certainly hope not, anyway.

Stretched out gag,"After the tremendous success of Despicable Me and a sort of cult following for the minions (those things are everywhere!) we get a spin off movie that belongs entirely to the evil little yellow creatures.I'm gonna be completely honest, I'd be lying if I said this movie didn't crack me up in more than a few occasions. Yes, the jokes are childish and dumb, but some of them were really funny. The only problem is all of this happened within the first 30 minutes of the movie. The truth is the movie does wear down a little bit after the first act, but the main reason I didn't enjoy most of Minions was I got sick of the Minions themselves. I think the problem with this movie is they stretched the joke way too much. The Minions were hilarious in Despicable Me, yes, but it worked so well because they only appear for a relatively small portion of that film. In this movie, we see what is basically the same gibberish-fueled jokes for nearly 90 minutes and it grows old.I have to give this movie credit for making me legitimately laugh in quite a few scenes in the beginning and for the great job they did in placing the story in the late 1960's, the music was great and it was an OK depiction of that time. But the movie does grow old fast, the plot doesn't make much sense, so I can't really say Minions was a satisfying movie experience for me, personally.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

I really enjoyed the in-depth look into the minions lore,"I'll never forget the first time I watched this film. I woke up early, pulled off my minions blanket, ran to the bathroom, pulled aside the minions shower curtain and began my shower, thinking all about the movie that would change me forever. Fast forward a few hours to the midday showing of minions, as my stepdad drove me to the movie theater, I honestly had moderate-severe anxiety. It's like the feeling you get right before graduating middle school, so many feelings of excitement. I have to admit though, I've never felt more confident with my appearance as I stepped foot into my local 2 star theater decked out in my minions overalls, as well as my minions gloves & boots. I walked up to the front counter ""minions for one please"" i said as I handed the attendant my weekly allowance. ""Would you like any snacks or popcorn?"" Asked the attendednt. ""Oh no thanks, I'm fine"" I replied. But little did they know, inside my overall pouch lay hidden away, 3 minions twinkies, and of course 1 ripe BA-NA-NA, so I could maximize my viewing experience. I walked to theater number 4 & found a sweet front row seat, directly in front of the screen. Eventually the trailers came to an end and the lights began to dim. ""Here we go"" I said as I pulled my minions goggles over my eyes. The next hour and a half was pure ecstasy.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
10/10,"I am a huge fan of the Despicable Me movies And the Minions were always my favorite characters in them. It made sense to other people I guess that maybe the Minions should get their own movie, intelligently called, Minions. I think I first saw Minions at the theatre and liked it but I recently picked up a Blu-ray copy for another viewing. The film is still very cute I have to say, the animation is well done and the Minions are lovable. What lets the film down however is that there isn't much substance to the story and after a while the singing and silliness just get boring. Each Minion has his own personality and even though they look almost identical it's easy to tell them apart with Stuart and Kevin being my favourites, Bob was a bit too silly. There's a number of songs and brief musical numbers which were funny and endearing to start with but after a couple they became cheesy. My favourite scene was the opening sequence detailing how the Minions came to be and all the failed ventures with previous ""bosses"".Final Verdict: It starts well but very quickly it becomes apparent there isn't going to be much substance here, just cute slapstick and some colorful animation. It will certainly keep kids entertained but as an adult I was left wanting more. It's not bad though.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Happy family movie,"When I heard that this movie is popular for adults not only children, I didn't know the reason. However, after I finished watching it, I understand why this is popular among people in wide age. The story is so simple that everyone including children can understand, but there are many elements make this movie interesting, for example dreams, hopes, friendship, loves, funny, and so on. Minions have dreams to find the worst and the strongest boss. They always do their best to make their dreams come true, and they try to get over many problems while their journey. The interesting thing I think is that we cannot understand the language minions speak hardly. Some parts of their speaking sounds like English, but others are just sounds we can expect that is their language. But we can understand what they mean as if we can know their language in each situation from their facial expression and tone of voice. That is important elements to make this movie interesting and funny. I'd like to recommend all people in all ages, not only family accompanying small children.

"Instant Classic, Must Watch - Fun, Funny & oh so memorable","Such a fun watch. Been a while since I've seen it last. Going to watch the entire Franchise in chronological order.It's funny because the best thing about the film is them speaking Minionese. Who would've known that language could impact a film so much.There's a few clever adult jokes hidden throughout the movie. I like it as an adult myself, but I question why filmmakers do this. Kids are very impressionable and it could affect them in some way. Who knows. It's a very minor thing, but worth mentioning. It's been going on for a very long time as well. So I guess it's okay.The pacing of the film is spot on, there's never a dull moment. For most movies this is what I would want, but sometimes I felt overwhelmed. It was one thing after another and another and then roll credits. This isn't a negative toward the movie, just a personal thing.The characters are all wonderful and will have an impact on cinematic history. They are loving, loyal, funny, and despicable. (See what I did there. Ha) They are a household name now, and it's because of fun films like this.All the dated English cliches add a whole other element to the film. It gives it character and does it with respect.I'm rambling now.

Not so good both as it's own movie and a prequel to Despicable me,"I think that Despicable me franchise is good, not as good as Megamind (seriously, that one was great), but it's still had it's own charm and style. After I fell in love with Inside out back in 2015, I was interested to see Minions, after all, the trailers seemed funny, so I thought that the movie will be too. Nope! It wasn't. The plot has a lot of potential, to show history to the young audience in a fun way. It showed us the prehistoric times, middle ages, and even 1810s. Kinda upsets me that they forgot the trojan horse, Joanna D'arc, Hammurapi (the Babylon ruler) Christopher Columbus, the pirates (that was advertised), the king (also advertised), yet count Dracula was in this (despite not actually being a vampire, was a real person.) But let's move on. So minions after ruining Napoleon's life (By the way, he wasn't that short, he was average, it's a myth)
Decided to live in an ice cave isolated from humanity (Like Elsa from Frozen?)
Until everybody got depressed, and Kevin decided to find the big bad boss to serve along with Stuart and Bob. And they go on a boring journey. They later meet Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and she was happy at first to meet such cute creatures (who wouldn't?) And gave them a mission to steal the queen's crown. But they dissappoint her because Bob (the kid) pulls a sword in a stone and becomes king (just like king Arthur) and Scarlett's mad. The rest is spoilers. The story, like I said, isn't all that bad in theory. But the execution is rather boring. I didn't even laugh. How's that possible for a comedy kids movie?Most jokes are about bananas, villainy, butts or 60s references. I'll admit, I did like the scene that referenced Madagascar twice in a row. Where Stuart acts hungry and sees bananas everywhere (like where Alex the lion sees steaks) and a boat that swims from New York that looks suspiciously like the one from Madagascar. I now have a feeling that Madagascar 1 and Minions take place in the same universe and time. That surprised me! Also, some gadgets like hypnohat, metal arms and lava gun are creative in their own way. But I was really bored watching it in a cinema. I thought that this was the worst movie back in 2015. Now I hate it less and I think I was way too harsh back then. But still, 1 billion dollars? That's way too much. It's not worth your time unless you want to see a boring movie with a wasted potential and maybe coming with a couple of theories. But I think even children will be bored of it.As a prequel though, it's still bad, because Gru is only in the end of it, and yet, he's the main character in the franchise, minions are vise versa, minor in the main movies and main in here. I still have hope in the sequel, maybe it can fix some problems from the first one. Maybe it will be good with Gru being the lead. Maybe it will be great.

Lacks The Substance To Justify Being A Feature-Length Film,"I enjoyed the Despicable Me films. However, I was never really all that crazy about the minions. They would make me chuckle occasional, but I never found them to be the main attraction of those films like a lot of people do. I feel like they've just been really overexposed now to the point it's become annoying. With that said, I was really hoping this movie would surprise me as Despicable Me did.Unfortunately, it's was pretty much exactly what I expected to be. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's terrible, but it's not good. The main problem with the film is that the Minions don't provide enough substance to justify a feature-length film. What made Despicable Me work was that it had fun characters and humor that could be enjoyed by both kids and adults. Minions on the other hand relies almost completely on the simplest of slapstick humor which gets old quickly. As far as the plot goes, it's pretty weak and feels almost non- existent at times. It honestly felt like more of a television special than an actual movie. There were a few moments that made me chuckle, but by the 40 minute mark I was bored and ready for it to wrap up. Sandra Bullock's character was disappointing as well. I was hoping she would be sort of a female Gru, but she was very generic and rather dull. I also found the animation to be pretty bland compared to a lot of other recent animated films.Even though it does have some chuckle-worthy moments and features one of the best soundtracks in a film this year, I can't really recommend it. Even with a short running time, there just isn't enough here to justify this feature-length spin-off. While it never gets quite as annoying as I feared, the humor is just too repetitive and shallow for it to really appeal to anyone over the age of 10. This one is strictly for the kids. Minions ends up being another example of what happens when Hollywood tries to milk too much of a good thing.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A wise move to take a lovable, adorable, and hysterical character and spin off it's own film.","This movie takes the best feature of the movies Despicable Me (2010) and Despicable Me 2 (2013) and turns it into its own feature filmsthe minions! This movie take place BG—that is ""before Gru."" We learn that minions are creatures whose only satisfaction is to serve the evilest villains on earth. We see that since the dawn of time, the minions have served the worst villains from cavemen to Dracula—albeit not to the greatest success. The minions fall on dark times, where they have no villain to serve. This causes the entire minion civilization to fall into a great depression, until one day, the minion Kevin decides to set off on a quest to find the most evil villain on earth for the minions to serve. Kevin begins his quest by finding his way to Villain-Con, a convention for all of the world's super villains. It ends up that Kevin and his two apprentices Stuart and Bob fall under the employment of Scarlett Overkill, the world's first female Super-villain. Together they plot to steal the crown of the Queen of England, and the adventure unfolds. This movie is non-stop laughs from the Universal Pictures presents screen right to the Illumination Entertainment logo after the end credits roll. Much of the movie takes place in the minion language (which while incomprehensible borrows words from French, Spanish and Italian; and those are just the languages I detected). Still without understanding exactly what the minions are saying you can understand the messages conveyed, particularly when they are mocking each other for failing—some of the funniest scenes of the movie. For the third movie in a franchise this movie lives up to the first two films. A wise move to take a lovable, adorable, and hysterical character and spin off it's own film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An unneeded film that barely works a quarter of the time.,"Minions is basically Cars 2 or Planes from a logic standpoint. The only reason it's made is to sell minions merchandise to billions of screaming toddlers. The Minions were funny comedic reliefs but they were far from what made Despicable Me and its sequel enjoyable. IMO, it was Gru and his unique relationship with everyone.From a film standpoint, it's only slightly more enjoyable than Cars 2/Planes. Unlike the other two, this one has it's funny gags going for it. I'll admit, the Minions are funny. Not hilarious, but funny. However, the positives stop there. The film is so, so predictable, it's funny. It is literally every origin story you've heard before. It is literally Monsters University except with Minions. Also, it uses every kids movie trope you can think of. ""Hip"" and ""Cool"" talk? Check. Pop culture references? Check. Bathroom jokes? Check. Annoying voices from anyone who's not yellow? Check. It's the same pandering clichés we've seen from every Dreamworks film in the mid-2000s. In terms of the characters, besides the Minions, a few cracked maybe a slight laugh out of me, but the rest are either stupid or annoying. Again, typical trope of mid-2000s Dreamworks films.How about the animation? Of course I like the Minions' character designs, and some of the backgrounds and textures look nice- in the first quarter of the film-, but MY GOD are the character designs awkward to look at! All of their humans have thin heads and fat bodies or the other way around. Oh, and don't forget the ultra tiny eyes! This was one of my biggest (and only) gripes about the Despicable Me films, as well as in that garbage known as ""The Lorax"", and it's no different here!So to sum up, Minions has no purpose other than merchandise. I wanted to be surprised by the film. Even coming from someone who loved the Despicable Me films, Minions is a completely predictable, clichéd, and pandering movie that sort of works as a prequel to its predecessors but does not work as a film by itself. Yes, it made me laugh sometimes, but being funny can't be the only trait of the movie. Everywhere else it fails.Adults are going to roll their eyes at this movie, even ones (like I said before) that liked DM and/or DM2. This film is mainly a time waster for children, and those who live the minions at that.

Come on, writers? Are you in preschool and you want to insult a three years old intelligence? I know they are minions with no language, but everything has a limit, even for Hollywood stupidity...

Minions,I discovered this film after hanging out with my 4 year old son who already knew about it. This film is very fun to watch with the kids. The film takes place over several years. The Minions are trying to find a master- and they are not exactly the smartest characters. Well to be fair some are and some are not. They have several opportunities with several famous world leaders- Like Napoleon. There is just to much fun and silly references in this film. What i like about this film is how the characters stick together and they make so much fun for the audience no matter what your age is. I would recommend this.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Does not have the snarky attitude and the good humor of the first installment.,"Whereas Despicable Me was a movie remarkable for its unique sense of humor and unconventional story, starring an evil genius along with his army of delightfully stupid sidekicks, the sequel *and* the prequel are sadly dumbed down to yet another film that can be described merely as ""cute"" and I guess ""funny"".The first movie set high expectations and the minions were a raging success. Regrettably, most people enjoyed mostly their cute looks and silly antics, and less so the sarcastic point of view that elevated them from adorable, silly sidekicks, the kind that's present in every other movie, to hilarious creatures of pure bliss and stupidity that get anything done out of pure dumb luck. The second movie softened most of the sharp edges, toning down the underlying sarcasm and mischief, and finally the prequel, ""Minions"", barely feels anything like the first except that it includes minions and ""evil"" people. I put that in quotes, because even the ""evilness"" gets dumbed down during the series, from hilarious acts of random and sincere malevolence -like popping a passing kid's balloons or letting your dog take a dump in the neighbors yard- in the first one, to cliché stuff like stealing the queen's crown in the last - that one had me gasping ""oh no"" right from the trailer. Because the theft of the symbol of the British monarchy is the one thing that will keep people from ages 5 to 95 sitting on the edge of their seat.The use of a narrator should immediately alert the viewer that this is a movie whose selling point is ""adorable yellow creatures doing silly stuff for an hour and a half"". Sure, there's a plot to keep things moving as well, but it's blatantly obvious that the Target Audience is mainly people that can spend 30 or more minutes watching videos captioned ""lolcats"".This is a warning to the prospective viewer, who might expect something similar to Despicable Me: this here is definitely NOT an unconventional movie about hilariously dumb creatures in search for an evil master to do questionable deeds with. It is a movie about funny little thingies acting all cute and getting involved with evil masterminds (I wonder why they even kept that part, I mean these new minions are so softened up that any association with evil seems out of place. Some could argue that this is before they met Gru, so he hasn't trained them to be really nasty yet, but they're the same way in the second movie with Gru too.) Most of the funny scenes are already shown in the trailers, and almost all of them consist of minions saying silly incomprehensible things or making funny sounds to inanimate objects.To my disappointment, the series has taken a direct turn towards the cute silly minions featured in memes about eating too much, sleeping too much and being single. If you liked the first for its fresh sense of humor, do not watch. If you liked it for the funny thingies that do funny stuff and are adorable, watch em all-- the last two come complete with ""awwwww"" moments to hug your cat under the blankets while eating chicken nuggets. Okay movie as a standalone, but another sad continuation of the Despicable Me series.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
The murder of Minions by Universal.....,"Like most of, let's called fans, of ""Despicable me"", I was with great expectation for ""Minions"". The super, loony, character's.... nothing will go wrong with that, with movie about them, right? Well, I should know better from the start, the very start, when I realized that Minions are not produced by Dream Works, but by Universal. Why is that? Well Universal have that tendency to ""overkill"" the story, for real. They literally overkill a story about Minions. This ""movie"" reminded me of a child play. When boy play with his G. I. Joe's or something like that, the story goes with too much blah, it's maybe fun to you when you are the one who is playing, but it is not too much fun to watch someone to do it. It's like some Japanese cartoons on steroid, and that is a murder of something that should be cool, like Minion's. It was just too much of everything, and that everything become a stupid, non funny movie, maybe just fun for director's, who done a lame work, and I don't know, maybe for the writers of this horrible story.

OK Summer Air Conditioned Fun,"I had a choice of seeing ""Ant Man"" or this light fare when deciding on a movie. As much as Ant Man is being lauded as good craftsmanship, I am getting a little fatigued on Super Hero movies. Yes, Ant Man is not a sequel, but I grow tired of the same origin story, the same kind of villain, etc. My decision to see Minions was based upon the idea of watching something diverting with perhaps some originality.I had a grudgingly agreeable time with the Despicable Me movies, partially because they were a little more risqué. The minions were obvious a comic relief for young children, as they constantly were doing physical gags. One reviewer likened ""Minions"" to a Looney Tunes cartoon, for which I have a fond regard from childhood. So perhaps I thought this big budget outing of the little side characters could have some inventive sight gags. Looney Tunes was created for adults back in the day, Minions is aimed almost strictly at the kids.The biggest letdown was how lame the villain was. Another thing perhaps worth mentioning is the majority of the film consists of gibberish dialogue that has no captioning. This prevented me from getting that connected with the three main minion characters. In general, the adventures the three minions go through was not driven with much purpose. Yes, there is the overarching story of the minions looking for a new villain to serve, but almost the entire film consists a series of set pieces (like a visit to a department store, with the retched 'clothing montage') that do not advance the story at all. The hyped up ""Scarlet Overkill"" is just an empty shell of a character compared to Steve Carell's inspired Gru. This is more than obvious when a young Gru appears as part of the closing credits, and I find myself laughing and getting far more excited about these few sight gags than I did for the entire film.Laughs were few for me, although the crowd of kids in attendance were laughing quite a bit. The lack of laughs came from; uninspired villain, main characters that were too superficial to care about, and set pieces that provided too little bang for the buck. I think it is obvious that this was meant to be a lighter and fluffier animated film, not meant to evoke Pixar (like the movie ""Planes"" never tried to be a Pixar caliber film). So for me it comes down to whether the brisk pacing and short running time is your best bet for sitting in some air conditioning on a hot summer day. If you're tired of yet another super hero movie, the answer is a not so enthusiastic yes.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sweet, charming and stay through the end credits!","This was a very solid kids movie, personally I loved the crazy language chatter from the minions, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea. Sandra Bullock and Jon Hamm were good voicing the villains, but honestly those characters were the least interesting part of the movie. Instead I loved seeing the evolution of the minions, with crazy scenes of their DNA mandated attempts to find an evil leader, and total destruction in their wake. Dinosaurs, Napoleon, the Abominable Snowman, no one is safe from their earnest brand of ""help"" Big laughs as the guys try to attend ""Villan Con"" (look for Easter eggs) and please stay all the way through the credits for the cutest Beatles jam ever.

It's probably an OK kids' film.,"'MINIONS': Two Stars (Out of Five)A prequel/spin-off to the popular 'DESPICABLE ME' animated film series. It tells the origin story of the super-villain Gru's little minion helpers. The film was directed by Pierre Coffin (who also co- directed the two 'DESPICABLE ME' movies) and Kyle Balda; Coffin also voices all of the minions, in the film. It was written by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy and costars the voice talents of Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton, Allison Janney, Steve Coogan and Geoffrey Rush. The film is pretty silly, and rarely funny, but it's probably an OK kids' film.The story starts at the beginning of time, when the minions were first born; as single-celled yellow organisms. They evolved into little naive creatures, with just one passion; to serve the most despicable master they could find. After killing every villain they've ever met, they go into hiding in Antarctica. But after years of depression, three minions (Kevin, Stuart and Bob; all voiced by Coffin) decide to venture out into the world, to find a new master. They meet Scarlet Overkill (Bullock), in Orlando, and find a purpose to live again.The movie is probably the kind of stupid cartoon I would have liked as a kid, but it's painful to watch as an adult. Most of the jokes are really stupid and there's no really likable characters to root for (just the minions). A few moments are funny, but it's definitely not as good as either 'DESPICABLE ME' film (which I'm not a big fan of either). Kids will like it though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/uINe8REiZw0",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great prequel to this popular franchise.,"When this movie was first announced, I was so excited because I lived the Minions in the previous two movies. And after watching this movie, I had a lot of fun and while there are some issues with the movie, it was still a fun watch in the theater.Positives for Minions (2015):
The Minions continue to be some of the most entertaining characters that I've seen in any movie that I've ever seen in my life. I also really enjoyed seeing Michael Keaton as one of the many villains in this movie even if his screentime is very limited. The highlights in this movie are easily Sandra Bullock and Jon Hamm as the main villains of Scarlett and Herb Overkill. Sandra Bullock is able to be both very funny and very intimidating at the same time. Jon Hamm is very hilarious during his scenes. I also enjoyed Geoffrey Rush as the narrator. And of course the action sequences are a lot of fun.Negatives for Minions (2015):
The movie opens up with this montage of the Minions accidentally killing their masters that was just too much for me. Also, the Minions didn't really work as the main characters in this movie, but thankfully that wasn't a problem with the second Minions movie. And finally, this movie has the prequel problem where they answer questions I wasn't asking and providing me with answers I don't care about. In this movie, they answer the question as to how the Minions met Gru and it was really stupid.Overall, I had a blast watching Minions (2014) in the theater and it's definitely one of the better prequel movies that I've seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Greatest biopic of all time,"This biopic tells the story of the Minions on their journey to find their evil leader. You would definitely believe that this is a documentary if you didn't know otherwise, the acting is on par with films such as Citizen Kane and The Godfather.

Overall this is one of the greatest films of all time and I would definitely suggest it to anybody who is able to follow the mature and complex story.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
a Mindless Flick,"In order to have fun with this movie, you have to shut off your brain COMPLETELY before going in. I did not care about the main story of this movie whatsoever. The plot was really weak and just way too silly. That it is not the minions' fault. Minions themselves were hilarious at times, but they simply cannot carry an entire movie about them. I love the minions, they are great secondary characters, but during the movie I felt like their silly activities, that I adore in small portions, were just getting too repetitive. Even though the movie is only hour and a half long, I was already bored half way through, because of the plot.Overall, ""Minions"" is not a terrible movie, and if you are a fan, you will definitely have some fun with it, but don't expect anything like the ""Despicable me"" movies.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Family Movie Experience,"When this film was released two years ago, I had the opportunity to see it at the drive-in. It was playing as a double feature with JURASSIC WORLD, not sure who decided that! Either way, seeing it on a huge screen while in the privacy of my own car with my family was a great experience. Sadly, one we might never get again since the drive-in closed soon after.The animation was great, the story wasn't all that bad. Sandra Bullock's voice was okay. It was not that impressing, but better than seeing her in a live action film. The film was missing Steve Carell, of course, since the Minions had yet to meet Gru (the film is set in the 1960s).And as this year approached and the announcement of DESPICABLE ME 3 and a sequel, MINIONS 2, to be released in a few years, is great.

Oh dear ...,"Armed with my young son and ready for an afternoon's entertainment, we sat down to ""Minions"" with eager anticipation. Sadly, the film is simply not up to the hype that surrounded it.

The pre-show ads got more laughs. The story is simple enough and is easy to follow for any pre-school audience member. It is always worth watching an audience leave and to try to follow the buzz. In this case, the audience left within the first seconds of the credits starting, and the auditorium was empty (save for us) before the credits ended.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
An appetizer simply cannot serve as the main dish,"Watching ""Minions,"" the latest installment in the ""Despicable Me"" franchise, is like going to the finest restaurant in town and expecting an overpriced appetizer to fill you up so much so that a main course isn't even necessary. The Minions, the now-ubiquitous secondary characters from the aforementioned franchise, played second banana (no pun intended) to supervillain Gru and other characters, and while they provided for an cute, quickwitted diversion, forcing them into the forefront to maintain a feature-length spotlight was no doubt a daunting task for the writers and directors of this project. There's little chance that five years ago, a spin off film of these small, yellow, pill-like creature would've even been a thought in an animator's mind.""Minions"" was a movie coming from a mile away. ""Despicable Me 2"" hinted at its inevitable existence early on, with its teaser trailer focusing entirely on the creatures and carrying the characters over to the forefront of the film's marketing campaign. Furthermore, the amount of Minion merchandise, with everything from stuffed animals, Lego knockoffs, and Tic-Tacs being made in celebration of the film, comes close to the sickening level of franchising that Pixar's ""Cars"" did. While even a hardened cynic would find it difficult not to at least crack a smile at the cuteness and insane likability of these little creatures, a ninety-minute affair with these rascals proves to be a muchness.The prelude to the film, most of which included in the theatrical trailer, bears some of the funniest, most relevant humor of the entire film. We see how Minions have inhabited the planet long before human beings, with one goal in mind - ""serve the most despicable master they could find."" The Minions worked for everyone, be it Dracula, a Tyrannosaurus Rex, Egyptian Pharaohs, and even Napoleon, all of whom wound up tragically killed at the fault of the Minions. Finally, after unintentionally killing their last master, the Minions set up their village in Antarctica, serving nobody else but themselves. This works for a little while, but the Minions gradually become aimless and disinterested in life, rapidly losing their ability to function.One brave Minion, Kevin (voiced by co-director Pierre Coffin, as all the Minion characters are), stands before the Minions to see who, if any, will venture out to unknown parts to return with a master that all the Minions can serve. When the roly-poly rebel Stuart is selected, in addition to the sweet and simple Bob, the trio set out to find their master, eventually getting word of a large gathering of villains at ""Villain-Con,"" an annual convention. They hear of Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), the evilest female supervillain in all the land, and make it their prime mission to serve her and all her needs upon visiting the convention.When you're in the company of sweet, primitive little yellow cylinders that bask in their own naive ways and speak a combination of languages amongst gibberish, it doesn't take much to realize that this film will undoubtedly inspire a few smiles and chuckles. However, sporadic smiles and chuckles do not usually amount to very good films, and because the Minions were once secondary characters that did just that, and are rather limited characters in a narrative sense, it's difficult for them to break out and be much more.Because the Minions can't speak in a manner that we, humans, can decipher, the story must be kept simple and linear, something that DreamWorks does to a fault here. This is a film, I feel, is destined to only satisfy little kids, who are overjoyed that this film doesn't bear the kind of emotional and narrative weight Pixar's ""Inside Out"" did. The simplicity of the story, again, allows for a handful of cute moments, and some remarkably limber comedic setups, but once you realize how light, airy, and forgettable the film's characters and aura is, it's then ""Minions"" begins to fade from your mind before the end credits even begin to roll.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

A huge letdown considering the previous titles.If you've seen the trailers, you've seen all the funny bits and know the entire story. I hope that the writers and just Hollywood in general learn that these films, while they sell (sadly), are never good. This is simply because they can't write (or milk, really) a complete movie out of a few minor characters that are only ever funny in small portions.Unless if for some reason you HAVE to see this movie because you're THAT big of a fan, or you're less than 7 years old, don't see this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Please come back Steve Carell,"Like Pixar putting Mater the tow truck in a lead role, this movie also confuses garnishing for the main course. Although the Despicable Me series never made it into Pixar quality territory, the films do entertain largely due to the comic timing and likely input on the script of multi-talented Steve Carell. Leaving these secondary characters in charge results in a tiresome, dragging light entertainment that will stretch the attention span of the younger set (you'll see much texting in the theater during this film). Beyond a lackluster script the basic limitation of the minions is there inability to communicate with the audience. They speak a non- subtitled variant of gibberish. While this was annoying in the Despicable series, having long stretches of it in this film makes for some baffling passages. With affable, approachable Sandra Bullock ineffective as an villain eventually John Hamm's sidekick character becomes the point of focus and, put simply, his English accent is worse than Mike Myer's Austin Powers. Speaking of that series of films, ""Minions"" is set in 1968 London (mostly). How many of the film's core demographic will get late 1960's English references is a question the marketing department was surely asking when told they would have to sell this clunker (explain the ""Abbey Road"" cover gag to an eleven year old). To these complaints add one more - the first 20-25 minutes are pure exposition. Towards the end of that period you wonder whether you could just go read the book instead if the all the director plans to do is to explain the tale to you. In short, the Despicable series ""Cars 2"".",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Should have stayed as background characters.,"Here's the thing, I liked the minion characters when they were introduced in ""Despicable Me"". They provided some of the comic relief but were generally harmless. But they made such a splash with kids they had a much larger role in the second movie which I felt was too much. Much like Mater, from Pixar's Cars, he was popular with the kids so they gave him a much larger role in the second movie to it's detriment. So it wasn't a surprise that Illumination decided to give the minions their own movie.The whole thing just feels soulless and corporate. And I admit the only reason I watched it was because I was on a plane and I had either seen or rewatched all the movies I wanted to see and figured it would at least help to pass the time. And it did. But I was not entertained nor did it help with the boredom I find myself in when flying.The problem with movies like this is they rely too heavily on a character or joke carrying the movie. In this case, it's the minions that need to be minions. They are supposed to follow the strongest and most powerful villain they can find whether it be a dinosaur, Napoleon or the main villain of this movie named Scarlet. And along the way they mess things up in their attempt to be minions to these villains. And that's the movie. Are you laughing yet?I totally get why they made it. Hollywood isn't interested in making a good movie. They're interested in making money so anything that could net them a profit is then produced. And in Illumination's case it's literally doing whatever they can as cheaply as possible.Sure their products look good and are popular with the kids but is is asking too much to have a movie that adults can appreciate too?",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lose Emotions. ♦ 40%,"Adults generally relate with the Despicable Me franchise not because of the evil factor, but because of the emotional connect that is present in its oddball narratives. In Minions, however, there is a gaping lack of emotions.Three minions are on a quest to find a fitting, evil master for its tribe who, we are told, have been around since the dawn of the time. They were friends with dinosaurs and still there was no mention about them in Jurassic Park (1993). In the year 1968, the trio go to the Big Apple and then to the English capital, after having seemingly found their master, a female antagonist (Bullock). Then the plot is more or less about her evil plan.One will not feel touched with the things that happen in the film, most of which are straight mindless. While there are too many factors that betray the film of originality, even the minions fail to deliver. The sequels (2010 and 2013) are good, relatable films that are high on humor. But in here, the humor is all situational and these are boring situations that I am talking about.Also goes a bit annoying towards the end with that save the world crap. As is apparent from the sequels, minions are again only a small part of the film. The duel between good and evil is also badly handled as the climax ends the charade with a delightful surprise.BOTTOM LINE: Minions is a perfect example of a studio that has run out of ideas and is only making films to make some moolah out of ""gibberish.""VERDICT: 3 stars out of 10.

"Too Much of A Good Thing Isn't A Good Thing in ""Minions""","If you've ever seen Despicable Me or its sequel, you will definitely remember the little yellow tic-tacs called the Minions. They stole the show in almost every scene they were in, and they were memorable and cute little sidekicks. However, too much of a good thing isn't necessarily a good thing, and the origin story for the Minions is the perfect example of that. Minions shows what those little bananas did before they met Gru as they journey to the International Supervillain Convention in 1968 and become henchmen to the world's most notorious villain, Scarlet Overkill. The issues with Minions are present from the very first scene and continue throughout the entire film. Much of the humor, as agonizing as this sounds, is supposed to come from the way the Minions talk. That wears out its welcome extremely quickly as you can imagine. Even the jokes that don't concern the Minions are reused numerous times throughout the film, making this movie tedious and repetitive. That could be somewhat forgiven if Minions had interesting characters or a compelling enough story, but unfortunately, this film has none of that. The Minions aren't exactly dramatic characters; they're always the sidekicks, destined to be overshadowed by the villains they serve. Even Scarlet Overkill is a fairly generic villain. She doesn't have any sort of special powers or a unique personality to distinguish herself from other power-hungry female villains. There's never any sort of drama or development with her character. Now onto the unfocused and rushed plot. If you have the attention span of a goldfish, you might find the plot of Minions to be fun, but anyone else will feel like they're being suffocated by the insanity of this film. This movie just never takes a break. There's never a moment where you can calm your senses from the insanity of the previous scene, and it's not because it's some action-packed spectacle. It seemed like the filmmakers were trying to fit as much as they possibly could into each scene so that much younger kids wouldn't be bored. Minions might entertain the least demanding moviegoers and their very young children, but anyone else should stay away from the contrived plot, tired jokes and dull characters littered throughout this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
4.5/10,"You have to give kudos to Illumination Entertainment for having found the cheapest way to make a billion dollars: Minions. They will just sell tickets no matter what with their mix of humor and adorable. Unfortunately, the ""cheapest"" part of that statement is true for the quality of the movie too and not only for the idea value.Look, I get it, a Minions movie right away from inception does not have the potential for higher concepts or sophisticated storytelling, so I wasn't excepting the next Pixar movie or a ""How to Train Your Dragon"" level masterpiece. You might argue the opposite, but out of one thousand movies that you could make called ""Minions"" there is maybe one that could fulfill the task, yet it certainly wouldn't make a billion dollars worldwide. So I was excited to have some good fun and come out with a delighted smile on my face. Reality is, I came out with a frown.I will say it up front that there is nothing to get angry about here. This is a more than fine movie to bring children too and I am sure they will have their fun, though they will certainly not come out and talk about it for days as they would have with a ""Toy Story"". What is bothering is how lazy the filmaking is and how boring the choices are. It is such a package for children only I can't see anyone of the directors, writers, editors etc. putting into this anything more than the lowest standard acceptable. This is really passionless. They always choose to dumb things down and never go for something more sophisticated that could have elevated the joy and the energy. The most bothering example of this is the choice to have narration at the start of the film. Other than being bland it just doesn't add anything and doesn't leave space for what could have been a first dialogue-less 10 minutes of delightful visual storytelling and gags which are replaced by Minions doing exactly what a narrator is telling us, uh what a bore. Not to mention the story overall which culminates in a dull and generic ending that I have probably seen countless times already in animated movies, I was really phased out by then.I will say that there are redeeming qualities: throughout the film we are served a few smart gags that do deliver some more interesting humor. The minions work overall and don't get boring or annoying, on the contrary they always kept a smile on my face and worked best when they were used for some more intelligent humor, when they were just acting like childish babies they continuously made me check out, they simply don't work like that. It is so much more interesting to have them thrown into unlikely situations and see how they react to it, those were the fun moments for me.As I said this is perfect for a child, but if you were excepting to have some adult fun with smart gags and sophisticated humor you will be partially disappointed.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Everything that was great about Scrat (the squirrel) from ""Ice Age"" was done badly with the minions. I hoped to see them less and less, but unfortunately they decided to make an entire spin-off dedicated to them.The movie has kids humor and some of the worst narration I've ever experienced: Not only is it poorly written and delivered (can't tell whether this is Geoffrey Rush's fault or the director's) but the thing is that it's completely needless. There is simply no need to narrate the obvious. Again, I understand the target audience is kids, but even THEY don't need such a narration for such a simple story.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

The funny thing about the minions in the first two movies was that they were mean to each other in loving, small ways - slapping each other, tripping each other, sticking out their tongue... In this movie? They failed to show this. In the first two movies they were funny stupid. In this movie they were just stupid. Only twice did I smile at the minions behaviour. The rest of it was actually pure garbage.The silly plot MIGHT have worked if they would have based the story on what made minions funny in the first place - slapstick humor. Now it just falls flat.

Making a movie like this where the main characters do not speak any known language has to be tough, but surely they could have done more with it. I'm a big fan of the Despicable movies, but this one was off.The only humor came from various Minions falling over or running into things, which obviously got old after 15 minutes. Sandra Bullock's character was surprisingly annoying and was the main human voice in the film. The producers set the movie in the 60's, however the 60's pseudo-hippie soundtrack was completely out of place here. Pharell added magic to the first two movies and should have done the soundtrack here as well, the 7 year olds in the audience would have appreciated that more than the 60's rock. The British jokes were so tired...it's 2015. The first time I heard someone make a joke about British people drinking tea was in the 70's. Is all creativity lost?On the flip side the Minions themselves are very charming and lovable, and made the movie. The ending was nice as well. You're going to have to see it anyway, so go ahead and go, just don't expect to much. At least they left out the ""required in kids movies"" out of place ebonics speaking random character. That was another huge plus and made the movie watchable.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Obnoxious and Boring,"Are we in the midst of a terrible new trend? In 2014, Penguins of Madagascar provided a funny, if generic, spin-off of the popular Madagascar films, which focused on the comic relief side-penguins. This year, there's Minions, which is similar to Penguins on the surface, but with none of the decent humor or narrative sense. It could've been mindlessly entertaining, but full of clichéd and unfunny jokes, it's instead annoyingly tedious. It's honestly astonishing how something so obnoxious can also be so boring, and feel like it would never end. The minions from Despicable Me are inarguably the best aspect of the uber-popular franchise. However, sometimes a decent side-item isn't enough to replace an entire meal. There's not a single character to invest in here, as we barely get to know the new characters, and the minions have no discernible, individual personalities. Not that these things are absolute necessities for kids entertainment; just provide more than a dull story and played-out comedy to keep people from focusing on the lack of logic anywhere (i.e. why is no one in this very real 1960s setting wondering who these little yellow dudes are?). Even the jokes and surprises failed as they were forced on us through the ever-ubiquitous marketing campaign. Honestly, none of this really matters; if you're a parent, you will be (or already were) inevitably dragged to this. That's a shame, since I think kids and families deserve better than clichéd story beats, bright colors, 3D tricks, and the basest of humor (farts, pain, underwear). For a fully entertaining family-movie night, just give Inside Out a (second) look.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not for me but a younger audience will love it,"Minions is the prequel to the Despicable Me franchise featuring everyones favourite Minions. I have to say i didn't really like this movie, i was quite bored for a lot of the movie as this movie didn't have much in it for anyone over 10 years old. There were a few funny moments here and there, but very few, and even then they weren't laugh out loud moments. Now, i am definitely not the target audience for a film like this but it would have benefited greatly from having a little more humour that a wider audience could enjoy, just look at pixar films aka Inside Out. The plot also wasn't anything great, it was your standard villain vs the heroes scenario but being a kids movie you can't knock it down for doing what it intended. The minions of course were the stars of the film (hence the title) and whatever good moments there were to enjoy came from them. If you loved the minions in the previous films you will love them in this as you get much of the same type of humour.There isn't that much i can say about this film, i guess it accomplished what it set out to do for its intended audience, but unfortunately didn't offer any more than that. The performances and the characters weren't the problem, both the new and old characters i thought were well written and acted. Just the humour didn't really work for me most of the time, so i'm going to rate it a little low but if you really love the minions or are taking young kids to see it you and/or they will definitely get more out of it. - 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is proof that I do not like the Minions.,"I never liked the Minions in the Despicable Me movies, I even had fun times, but it was rare, but I recognize their popularity, a lot of people like them, so I was not excited about the Minions movie, well the movie was not as weak as me Wait, I had fun, but I still do not like the Minions, the movie starts very well, it shows the Minions with several historical characters and this is very cool, the voice work is good, highlight to Sandra Bullock who does a great job , And also has Michael Keaton, Jon Hamm and etc, but the film has a very tiring rhythm, I almost slept in a few moments, I found the 2 and 3 act dragged, the best was first of all, the soundtrack is cool, but the Script is very problematic, Minions is a medium movie, has even good moments, but misses a lot, mainly in script and direction.

If I know the minions enough...,"If I know the minions enough, I felt like this could have been quite a bit funnier than it turned out to be. The storyline for the most part was okay, but the movie certainly was no real classic. If you're into the whole Despicable Me concept, it is still fairly interesting at how the ""history"" behind the little yellow creatures came to be in the first place. For one thing, I just didn't feel like I was laughing as much as I expected and some of the dialogues and jokes just didn't feel, well, ""Despicable Meish"" as much. It did have a solid ending I will say (most people could probably just as well guess what it is story-wise if they know the series enough). As I would agree with one other audience critic: it did lack the Despicable Me charm I will admit, which is really the only real negative to this besides one of my overall opinions: I feel like it would be hard to make a film only starring the minions (Gru stole both shows the most I would say, with even the minions not quite making second place). However, this prequel was okay overall, with a solid ending as I mentioned before.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
An unnecessary film made only to sell Minion Merchandise,"Minions is a mediocre film. It has a decent plot, but the film completely wastes any potential it could've had. The problem I had with it is that the film revolves around a side character that was fun in small doses, but annoying in long ones. For example, the first Despicable Me film was a great flick. It had a good plot, good characters, and good writing. The minions were in it, but they were funny and only shown in short bits. However, here, they're on the screen all the time and the jokes with them aren't really all that funny.

I'm afraid this Minions Movie really paled in the shadow of that experience. Gosh' I really hung in there too! About 2/3s of the way through I might've started playing on my phone. It just seemed aimless and wandering to me. No real central character development to follow.

"Minions brings superficial fun, but nothing more than that. The script does not bring anything new and tires us in the first half hour","One of the great reasons for the success of the Despicable Me franchise in theaters worldwide, is in the figure of the cute minions, the helpers of the villain Gru. The success was so great that the yellow characters won a film to call their own in this new onslaught of Illumination. Much of its charm, however, as well as its counterparts in the other cited animations, is the short screen time they count, often functioning as the unexpected aspect of the narrative that guarantees the audience's laughter. Naturally, aiming at a greater profit, this period of exhibition of small beings increased in Despicable Me 2 and, now in 2015, they gain their own design, which could easily be considered a gigantic error, in view of the dependence of his grace on homeopathic doses that appeared before. But, as in The Penguins of Madagascar, money spoke louder.Even so, there is hope, naturally based on the possibility of a creative script, which is not just a constant repetition of oneself for the ninety-one minutes of projection. In the first few minutes, at least, Brian Lynch's text seems to offer us something different. It is a story of origin, which goes back to the origins of life on Earth. Always looking for a eviller master than the other, the minions follow from the T-Rex to Napoleon Bonaparte, always, of course, making jerks that force them to look for a new someone to serve. With an unnecessary off-screen narration, which practically calls children and adults imbeciles (everyone would be able to understand what's on screen calmly), we jumped from century to century, millennium to millennium, until we reached the status quo that motivates the beginning of the journey of Stuart, Kevin and Bob, who are now looking for a new villain to serve. As in the original franchise that gave rise to the creatures, a large part of the comedy is based on the clumsy and silly way of the yellow beings, in addition, of course, to their somewhat exotic language, which is nothing more than a creative mixture of different languages, such as French, Italian, Spanish, English and Portuguese.So far there is a narrative line, there is a motivation, there are funny situations. However, what you see from here is a technically very good animation, which uses elements to make the audience spend (unnecessarily) a few more nickels in the 3D rooms, but which has a very fine plot, which wears out over its 91 minutes and just barely tears. The choice to set the story in the late 1960s also proved to be quite right, allowing this spin-off to differentiate itself visually from the main series even following the same aesthetic logic, in addition to opening a whole new range of gags, unfortunately little used. Arriving during the 1960s in New York, the trio of brave yellow beings soon fell in love with the best of rock 'n roll and met the greatest villain of those days: Scarlet Overkill (voice of Sandra Bullock). It is impossible to say that the recreations of the time in New York and London were not extremely fun, especially on the soundtrack, which has songs from The Beatles, The Doors, The Kinks, The Who, Jimi Hendrix and other rock anthems.Minions have a clear objective, which is to profit. The trio of creatures that star in the film - Kevin, Bob and Stuart - appear on screen in the most varied jokes and jokes (often physical), using to the maximum the charisma acquired to captivate the audience. However, this does not work. The characters are too flat, and the fact that their lines are unintelligible prevents the development of a deeper connection. The most relatable ends up being little Bob, for looking like the baby of the group, thus combining the lines and attitudes in a more harmonious way. In addition, the entire story of the film lacks content. Minions travel the world, find a new villain to try to serve (Scarlet Overkill) and then move on to the confusions they always cause when they are on screen. The story becomes a small support for the comedy that the screenwriter and directors preferred to use, which may work at times, but soon gets tired of repetition.And that is where Minions' biggest problem comes in, as he doesn't always get his jokes right. The story was mostly planned for children, but we have several moments and jokes that go unnoticed by this audience, such as some involving films of monsters and terror, or even one involving the trip to the moon filmed by Kubrick. Add that to the stereotype used to represent England (where they go) in the film - like the joke about drinking tea all the time - and the audience's attention fades throughout the film. There are some hits in this medium, such as the idea of Villain Con, a big joke with comic-cons around the world, and female representation, with Scarlet having her moments of discourse on women's empowerment, and the Queen of England herself being represented in an interesting way, and even the English jokes work, like the one involving the Beatles, but they are only perceived by a smaller portion of those who see the film.The production can be described as a heap of small skits that try to tell a unique story. As much as some of these sketches make you laugh, there is not enough cohesion between them to generate a satisfying cinematic experience. One of the big problems of the first act, which was supposed to establish the minions without Gru, is precisely the fact that ALL the gags and jokes from these opening minutes were spoiled by the trailers. The second and third acts, on the other hand, which deal with the tenuous plot conceived by Lynch are simply not very interesting and are held back only because of the sympathy of the trio of protagonists. There is also an off-line narration that is abandoned almost out of nowhere, with no consistency in the way the story is being told, demonstrating the producers' haste to launch the film (and related products) on the market.The completely different personalities of Kevin, Stuart and Bob make them unique within the crowd of minions that arise during the projection (899, according to official information). This makes us identify with the courage of the former, the musical rebelliousness of the latter and the childish naivety of the latter. Scarlett never shows herself to be an efficient character, even with a lot of corny and exaggerated potential combined with exaggerated effort - in the good sense of Sandra Bullock. Someone is lacking to complement the minions and the family of pleasant criminals and sociopaths presented at the beginning of the second act would supply this need more efficiently than the ""muse of villains"".This humor, which ends up captivating us in Despicable Me, however, ends up tiring the viewer through the dreaded repetitions and repetitions. The jokes are the same throughout the projection and those that are minimally different are poorly constructed, offering us nothing more than a distinct feeling of shame from others. Such a comedy may even work with very young children, but what did it cost to offer a little more depth, as in Pixar's Divertida Mente? Therefore, we have entered the most problematic aspect of Minions. It is an empty feature film, which practically offers us absolutely nothing, only remnants of wild entertainment that can even bring some laughter, but that, in the end, makes us leave the cinema room without something that moves us by inside.With few inspired moments, Minions becomes less of an exciting adventure and more of a frustrating experience for those who expected the characters to grow due to their importance in the title of the feature. However, even as protagonists, they seem to continue acting as supporting actors, since they always need external agents to move on. Perhaps a problem with the characters' own genesis. In general, it is a film that clearly should be made for children, but tries to embrace a larger audience and ends up letting everyone escape. In addition, the lack of a larger story or message to be passed on turns it into something simple, which is not worth it in the face of so many other good films being released.The question in everyone's mind was whether the yellows who stole the show in two films would be able to hold 90 minutes of projection as protagonists. Even if the answer is negative, the production is not a complete disaster, saving itself due to the gigantic charisma of the title characters. Minions is a typical film to watch at home, when it is shown on television. It brings superficial fun, but nothing more than that. Your script does not bring anything new and tires us in the first half hour. Clearly, the little creatures should have stayed in their original feature, being presented in homeopathic doses that, yes, would bring us a good laugh.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Uninspired, unimaginative, annoying, but still somewhat fun.","Minions, the prequel to the 2010's hit, Despicable Me, attempts to tell the minimal story of how the loved yellow creatures came to meet the criminal mastermind, Gru. Without a doubt, the little banana lovers have an undeniable charm, and from a marketing point of view, Minions has everything to become a major hit, as it seems it was built to please the huge amount of fans all over the world and to support the unlimited capacity for merchandising of the franchise, and as such, Minions succeeds. As a movie, not so much.The filmmaking is left in second place. There isn't an actual narrative, character development, conflict or consequence. Everything is shallow, emotionally blank and devoid of any meaning. The film just exists.On the bright side, there are still quite a few laughs in the film, even though, the humor gets old soon, as the creatures early begin to lose their appeal and start to become more annoying than anything else. There is a reason why the minions work as a support piece in Despicable Me and it is because they are built to be just that. It's not surprising that the film looks like a collection of short clips stitched together, as the storytelling power of the creatures is more limited that it looks. Still, it is somehow shocking how unimaginative everything is. Almost every scene is built around an overused sequence with minions in it - it's often hard to tell if the movie is built around references and tributes or if it is the result of a baffling lack of imagination.But overall, it is still, somehow, fun to watch and there are still some things to appreciate in the film. The inadequacy of political correctness of the franchise and the sometimes dark sense of humor of the little creatures, are more than welcome in a family movie and certainly appreciated by older audiences.In the end, and despite everything, viewers who unconditionally love the characters or viewers with young children will surely enjoy the film - very young audiences will probably love it, but it's questionable if anyone else will.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Watch Inside out, not  dull, horrible, cheap, lazy, unfunny, heart lacking cash in","Now I really liked the Despicable me movies, but now that the minions got their own movie, lets take a look.First off, I'd like to say that this film can be predictable at times and a bit fast paced, and the film gets really dull. Most of the jokes are cheap too. Like, the only chuckle worthy and best jokes are in the trailers. The way how the 3 minions are trying to find a villain for a leader makes no sense because since the other bosses weren't evil or in-fact animals, there's no reason why they should find a villain if their fine with a bear being their leader. Plus this film lacks heart. There's isn't any real drama or heartwarming moments unlike Inside Out, which has them. The best parts of the movie were the first 30 minutes of it, which is probably the only redeemer other than that great music that brings a feel to the 60s. But this story is seriously pitiful.The animation looks pretty good like the backgrounds are great, but the character design is decent but very simplistic as always., but as for the characters, the minions are extremely cute,(Bob is my favorite, he's so cute!)but one dimensional. Scarlet feels too over the top and forgettable/bland at the same time, and the rest of the human characters are forgettable. Like the actor Michael Kenton was totally wasted playing a minor character whose only purpose is to bring the Minions to the Villain con.So bottom line: This film is a lazy cash in and the D me films were better. The story is lazy, lacks heart, and is boring and unfunny. The animation does look good, but the characters are one dimensional/ My recommendation is: If you want to watch it just rent it. Inside out is better than this. Adults should watch inside out, avoid this. It's only amusing to 6 year olds.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

They finally find an inspiring figure for their criminal career (the minions, despite being immortal, do not know how to distinguish good from evil) and enter into a series of situations until we finally see an element that gives meaning to the film well over its ending.

A silly spinoff that misses the mark,"""Minions,"" directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda, takes audiences on a wacky adventure with everyone's favorite yellow henchmen from the ""Despicable Me"" franchise. Set in the 1960s, the film follows three minions named Kevin, Stuart, and Bob as they embark on a quest to find a new villain to serve.While ""Minions"" delivers plenty of slapstick humor and zany antics, it struggles to sustain interest beyond its adorable characters. The plot feels thin and disjointed, relying heavily on sight gags and nonsensical humor.Despite the best efforts of the voice cast, including Coffin himself as the gibberish-speaking minions, the film fails to capture the charm and heart of its predecessors.

Let Bob be Bob.,"Undeniably one of the funniest aspects of the Despicable Me films was the small yellow henchmen called the minions. One might wonder how best to make the most of this, given that the normal route would be to give them a spin off film – but the challenge would be to construct a film around small yellow creatures which speak in gibberish. This challenge remains, because with this film it feels a lot like they simply decided that if the minions stay themselves and remain funny, then probably few people will care that the plot is a mess.And it is a mess, with characters all over the place, no meaningful throughline, and generally the thinnest excuse for the setpieces. Of course, it is still fun thanks to the minions being themselves, and when this is happening the film is absolutely fine. The human characters are the problem though, because they are weak – mostly just devices to make things happen. Although they are voiced by some very big names, mostly the cast do very little of value, and occasionally seem out of place or poorly used. However when the main three are doing their thing, the film is funny, fast, and enjoyable – just a shame that the actual frame it all happens within is so weak.Despite this, it does have enough silliness and fun to get by, so I forgave it the mess of the plot and just enjoyed the trio being daft, which to be fair is probably what the makers were banking on.",,Anonymous,Animation
