Amazing Soundtrack of 80's,"What makes a good film for me is that it is enjoyable, entertaining, gripping, likable and emotional. Flashdance without a doubt ticks all these five boxes. Flahdance is a very retro, cheesy entertaining film that is at no point boring and never drags, and is also a very clear symbol of the great 1980's and the night club exotic dancing scene of the time. Jennifer Beals puts down an amazing performance, as a dancer and as an actress. I guess the story comes down to the fact that reality bites, that life is tough, but if you push hard you just might make it.All in all, Flashdance despite its few undeniable faults is a very decent and enjoyable film in my opinion. As it mostly meets all of my requirements I am happy to give it a positive review. This film is one of the quintessential 80's films, that works well as a symbolic artifact of its time. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves 80's.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Bad but really fun,"Okay - the dancing is done by someone else, the script has a bunch of flaws (dialogue being almost the worst), and the basic premise is absurd - an 18-yo dreaming of starting a career in ballet? (In ballet, you're just about approaching the peak of your career at 18.)However, the movie has some heart-grabbing moments, the score is wonderful, the girls are pretty, and the moral of the story (keep on trying until you win) is as true as it ever was. This is probably the worst movie you'll ever have a wonderful time watching.As a past professional dancer, I probably watch this movie about once a year. It's an essential part of any dancer's library, regardless of its flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Flashdance clearly provides what many viewers want,"There are already many comments on this film in the IMDb database, and I had no intention of writing another until to my surprise I noticed that it was frequently being replayed on several different local TV channels. Flashdance is a very outdated movie that has never appealed to most film critics, so I felt this was sufficiently unusual to justify an attempted explanation.Since the DVD of Flashdance was released, it has appeared for hire in many small local convenience stores and service stations that only maintain a very small rack of films for hire Clearly although it is now very much of a period movie, it continues to retain an enormous appeal for many of those who have seen it before. Personally I have watched our tape of Flashdance more often than most of the other tapes we have at home. This is not because it would be my first choice, but because it is a film that my wife loves to watch again and again; whilst I find I can view it repeatedly more readily than many of her other favorite tapes, so when we are discussing what to view and have rejected a number of other possibilities we tend to turn back to Flashdance. This reinforces the comments already made in your database about Flashdance being a ""feel good"" movie for which most people seem able to ignore the faults and just enjoy the music, the dancing and the romance. (It also features ""Grunt"", a very appealing dog, who remains one of the reasons why my wife is always ready to rewatch this film.) As a film Flashdance is therefore something of a paradox. Originally the final product was not very highly regarded by the studio and only received a limited release. This was severely panned by most of the critics, and  not surprisingly the film initially received very little support from the public. The reviews and the low attendance led to plans to withdraw it from circulation early, but before these were implemented the audiences started to grow and continued to increase until cinemas showing the film were mostly packed out. Clearly those few who saw the film at an early showing started telling their friends to ignore the critics and see it. This escalated exponentially until the film finished up as a major hit. In commenting on this film it would be equally invalid to ignore the very real concerns of the critics or the equally real appeal it had, and still seems to have, for most of the public.The story is trite - a female welder in a steelworks dreams of being a ballet dancer and practices her dancing in one of the local bars at night. Here she meets and starts to fall in love with her fairly young divorced boss. With his support she is able obtain an audition with a major dance company who are essentially only interested in her dance training, and lose any interest they may have had when she says she has never attended a dance school. However she proceeds to audition for the very bored selection committee and gives an electrifying free dance performance that in true fairy story tradition brings the committee to its feet. Some critics have complained that doubles replaced the star Jennifer Beals for this sequence, but this is surely not important - the real question is how effectively the film plays, and this sequence has rightly been very widely admired. About the time the film was released, modern dance companies were being formed alongside traditional ballet companies in many major cities in North America and this sequence certainly added to the appeal of the film at the time, but it is decidedly not the only reason for watching it.I could spend pages criticizing the screenplay in several different respects, but other comments in your database have already done this, and these criticisms are ultimately not damming. The important thing is that the film maintains an ongoing flow which sweeps most viewers along and earns it a place as one of the finer musical comedies to have been released in the past quarter century. The object of a film is to entertain the public and in ranking Flashdance I feel I must base my rating on its undeniable success in doing just this. So 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A surprisingly charming film!,"So here's this movie ""Flashdance"" which has been staring me in the face for years, both in pop culture for over half of my life and on the video rental store shelves, and yet I've never gotten around to checking it out until now.I was fifteen when this movie was first out and popular. I heard the soundtrack, of course, and loved it to pieces... but I had never been able to watch the movie because it was rated R.I had grown up having it be, in an odd sort of way, both a part of my life and at the same time *not* a part of my life. I was familiar with its music, images, and even its basic plot outline, but had never seen the movie.And as an adult, I felt extremely dubious about checking it out. Over the years, I had heard that people either loved it to pieces or hated it. I've heard critics both call it uplifting and fun while others called it nothing more than a string of glittering little music videos strung together on an extremely thin strand of plot (a creation device for a LOT of MTV-era movies such as ""Top Gun"", ""Footloose"" and ""Purple Rain"").To add to my confusion about whether or not I should give it a try, I had had the same experience with ""Saturday Night Fever"": I grew up loving the soundtrack to pieces but having never seen the movie... and when I finally did I felt utter disappointment at first, discovering the film to be far darker than expected. Oh sure, I later liked ""Fever"" okay (actually, I should use the term ""appreciated"") but still preferred the gorgeous soundtrack to the actual film that was the basis for its existance.Would I have the same experience with ""Flashdance""?Tonight, I finally decided to, as one character in the film puts it, ""hold my breath and take the plunge"".As it turns out, I found it to be a surprisingly charming, entertaining and uplifting film. I was fearing it to be something raunchy, but at it turns out it has a very special, starry-eyed sweet innocence that is difficult to define.The performance of the equally starry-eyed and innocent Jennifer Beals helps, of course. She brings a wide-eyed sparkle and hopefulness to her role, plus a determination to keep her life on the right track precisely as she feels it ought to go without any major morality screwups, and this adds a wonderful flavour of hope and childlike wonder to her character Alex that just simply grows on you.Now, it IS true that there are a few flaws here and there, and a couple of editing flaws as well. Plus, the other characters aren't really as developed as hers (but they are developed just enough to demonstrate to her personally the various dos and don'ts regarding attitudes to have while pursuing a dream, voices for her to observe and learn from representing both directions). But none of that matters because the film has a charm all its own. Looking at it today, I can easily see why so many out there loved it: its a beautiful and very encouraging little film. It has a heroine whom anybody could relate with and like; it has wonderful music in it; it has a delicate and lighthearted touch to it which, language and a couple of scenes aside (such as the film's most heartbreaking scene in which Alex saves a desperate friend from throwing life away in a strip joint (a sequence which only lasts about two minutes long--but it's sad and disturbing, not ""Oooh, let's put this in to grab male members of the audience!""--which is most likely the only ingredient to earn the film its R rating)), is nevertheless still so pure and true that it could have come straight out of a '70s-made Walt Disney Productions movie (!!!); it's touching and moving... and, of course, it has dance sequences which are fun to watch.In other words, it was a comforting and uplifting movie released during a time when people, youngsters with career goals in particular, needed one. And if anything, folks still need movies like that out today. It's a happy little film with a happy ending which isn't overdone or unconvincing, and precisely the sort of flick which should be perscribed to those suffering severe depression. Heaven knows that I myself certainly felt encouraged about my own career and life in particular after watching it!It might not be for everybody, but if the above description I've written voices the sort of movie you personally enjoy then do yourself a big favour and give it a try. Chances are that if you are as naturally starry-eyed and hopeful as Alex is--and believe me, *I* certainly am--then you will easily relate to this delightful little fable.",,Anonymous,Music
Lively Popular Entertainment,"In recent years there have been a number of British films based on the theme of working-class people who find fulfilment through their cultural activities; examples being Educating Rita (the first and most distinguished), Brassed Off, The Full Monty and Billy Elliott.  Such films are frequently described as `quintessentially British' or `something that we can do and Hollywood can't', whereas the truth is that twenty years ago Hollywood was indeed making very similar films, mostly centred upon dancing, such as Saturday Night Fever, Dirty Dancing or Flashdance. Whereas these American films may not have had the covert (or, in the case of Brassed Off, highly overt) political message of their British counterparts, they nevertheless concentrated on differences in social class far more than Hollywood movies usually do.The heroine of Flashdance, Alex, is a young woman who works as a welder and whose main joy in life is dancing. She moonlights as a dancer in a local nightclub, but her great ambition in life is to become a ballet dancer. The film tells the story of how she achieves that ambition, as well as the story of her romance with a wealthy middle-class divorcee, set against frequent dance sequences as Alex and her ice-skating friend Jeanie go through their paces. The climax comes with a scene in which she auditions for a place at a prestigious ballet academy and treats the judging committee to a bravura display of breakdancing. (Would a ballet school really be prepared to offer a place to a candidate whose dance skills owe more to the disco than to Swan Lake and who seems completely ignorant of balletic idiom?)The film has its weak points. Although the plot is not as non-existent as some reviewers have felt, it nevertheless tends to take second place to the showpiece dance numbers; at times, it felt as if I were watching an extended series of pop videos. Potentially interesting themes are ignored; for example, Alex is a practising Catholic, but this seems to be a plot device to enable scenes set in the confessional to be used as soliloquies in which she can air her emotional problems. No attempt is made to explore the possible conflict between the demands of her religion and her sexually provocative dancing or her love for a divorcee.The acting is undistinguished; Jennifer Beals makes an attractive and personable heroine, but it is clear why, despite the success of this film, she did not go on to become a major star. Her acting is too weak to enable her to carry a film; certainly I felt that she would be out of her depth in one that depends more upon plot and less upon song and dance. The other characters are little more than ciphers, with the exception of Hanna, the old lady who acts as Alex's mentor. I could certainly have done without the tasteless ethnic jokes told by Alex's comedian friend.Yet, despite its faults, I enjoyed this film. Its redeeming feature is the zest and energy of its dance sequences, set to some well-chosen music such as Laura Branigan's Gloria or Irene Cara's title song. It may not be deep or significant, but it is an enjoyable, well-made piece of popular entertainment. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
What a feeling,"Astronaut John Glenn once said (about seeing earth from outer space) ""To look out at this kind of creation and not believe in God is to me impossible"". I bring this up because I more or less said the same thing when Jennifer Beals first lifted up her welding mask in 'Flashdance'. Wow. But she's more than a pretty face. The material may only be thimble deep, but Beals brings just the right mix of energy, grit and old fashioned spunk to the part and instantly gets us on her side. That she was only 18 at the time is mind boggling. No, it's not her dancing, and this is painfully obvious on a large HD TV, but she does just fine with the dramatic heavy lifting, such as it is.Born out of the BIG Bang that was MTV, 'Flashdance' became a phenomenon in 1983. Marrying the visual style of the former with an old fashioned underdog tale in the spirit of Rocky, it captured people's imagination and remains a well loved guilty pleasure for many. So much so that it recently inspired a musical in the UK that has since traveled the U.S. as well.It does one no good to hold the film up to any sort of deep scrutiny. Just put on your legwarmers and go with the beat. What a feeling.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
40 years later,"I just rewatched this movie with my teenage daughter 40 years after its release. It was great nostalgia for me, though the choreographies seemed way better when I was a child. All in all it is a great representation of everything 80's: the music, the fashion and the American Dream. All style and looks and no depth.The storyline is underdeveloped, and dialogues (and acting) are bad. There is some kind of voyeurism feeling with the close ups on body parts, especially thighs and legs throughout the dancing and working out scenes that I didn't get as a child, of course.What struck me the most is how Alex is able to leave her bicycle anywhere ouside with no lock and it's always still there when she comes back.The 80's were good times!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
An 80's iconic movie,"I know how much Flashdance became such a huge hit of the 80's, it defined a whole new generation of clothes, behavior, and dance moves. That's what made Flashdance so special. Now I was born in '85 so I kinda missed out on these things, but I understand it's importance. I just bought this movie yesterday, it was back to back with Footloose, two iconic 80's movies, and I watched Flashdance this afternoon. While this film defined a huge part of the 80's, it was an average film with a simple plot. The acting and story is just pretty average, but it's a cute and fun one.Alex is a welder by day, but at night she is a sexy exotic dancer who grabs the attention of all the men. But she has big time dreams to become a ballet dancer, she has promised her grandmother that she would apply to the top ballet school and try to get an audition. But Alex is always intimidated by the other ""proper looking"" dancers with tons more experience than her. She falls in love with a fellow co-worker, Nick, who wants her to make it just as badly. She goes through rough times, but she just wants to make it and will do anything for that chance.Flashdance is one of those must see movies if you wanna see the important films of the 80's. I just wanted to see what this movie was about since it's such a huge part of film culture. Jennifer Beals actually did a great job as Alex, she was absolutely beautiful and made the character very likable. While this film did not live up to my expectations, it still was a good film. It has an awesome sound track and really is a lot of fun to dance too. Now excuse me, but I wanna try to take my bra off without removing my shirt, lol.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Great movie from a guy's perspective,"Flashdance is one of my Top Ten Films.  I don't care that it has no twisting plot.  I don't care that Jennifer Beals used a body double.  I REALLY don't care that it's a chick flick.  I love this movie!! Some people, after seeing Flashdance, choose to see a movie about exotic dancing.  For one reason or another, I see a movie about chasing dreams, taking chances, and maximizing life.Jennifer Beals' character Alex Owens's dream of attending a formal dance school and becoming a ballerina is the central theme of the film.  Her friends Jeanie and Richie are aspiring figure skaters and stand-up comedians, respectively.  However, Alex is the only dreamer receiving any encouragement.  Her senior citizen friend Hannah, a former ballerina herself, gives Alex practical advice and unconditional faith.  Jeanie's father openly criticizes Jeanie's dream as well as her beau, Richie. Richie, a cook at Mawby's Bar, is put down by his boss for wanting to go to Hollywood and being a comedian; ""You're too short.  They don't let short people into Hollywood.""The sub-plots facilitate Alex's dream to create a captivating story.  To support herself (and possibly, to keep life interesting), Alex holds 2 jobs: a welder by day and a dancer at aforementioned Mawby's Bar during the night. Her welding boss Nick takes a liking to her and pursues her.  Alex resists his charms but gives in eventually.  Johnny C., the sleazy strip bar owner continually tries to lure Alex into dancing for him.  As mentioned before, Alex's friends Jeanie and Richie have dreams of their own, and we see where their dreams take them.The factor that made Flashdance a hit was the music, of course.  ""What a Feeling"" took away an Oscar for Best Song.  ""I'll Be Here Where the Heart Is"", sung by Kim Carnes (""Bette Davis Eyes"") fits Alex's personal-crisis scene perfectly.The first time I watched Flashdance was 4 years ago; I bought the video knowing I'd like it.  After 20+ viewings, I still love it.  Flashdance is for anyone who has a dream but not the courage to pursue it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Michael Jackson ripped ff Moonwalk from Flashdance,"This was a decent movie and it kicked off a lot of the fashion trends of the 80s.But the most notable fact is that this is where the moonwalk was first seen. Contrary to popular belief, Michael Jackson did not invent the moonwalk.There is a scene where Nouri and Beals are taking a romantic stroll. They momentarily pass a group of people break dancing on the street. This is where the world was first treated to a moonwalk.It wasn't until years later that Jacko took credit for inventing it. He never gave proper credit to the unnamed street dancer in Flashdance.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
memory of the 80s,"It was a very 80s movie -- the music, the dance, the way people look in the movie. I have only watched it once, and that was more than 10 years ago when I was a kid going to a primary school in Beijing. I am Chinese and I grew up in Beijing, so I don't know how much my opinions reflect the typical audience. This movie made a very deep impression on me. It was in the late 80s when I watched it, and it, along with other movies, introduced me to American culture. And I was just fascinated. I remember for a while everybody in China was doing breakdancing, partly because of _Flashdance_. I realize it is not a very good movie, but for me this movie brings back memory of the 80s, when my friends and I first learned about American culture, and how we tried to learn everything about America as we grew up.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A Good Message About Following Your Dream,"This musical movie shows several unsuccessful people who had dreams that they eventually gave up on. We see a cook, who wishes to become a comedian and follows his dream to Los Angeles only who have his dream crushed. We also see a skater who follows her dream to skate in a big show, but falls several times causing her to give up on her dream.We also see Hanna a former ballerina who never became the star, and is mentoring a young lady named Alex. Alex is played by Jennifer Beals, and is a welder working for Nick (Michael Nouri). Alex also works as a FlashDancer in a bar at night, expressing herself in various costume dances,to music in front of a large appreciative audience.As Nick gets involved with Alex we find out her dream is to become a ballerina, but she has no ballerina training and is fearful of the judgment and possible rejection in auditing for a ballerina company. She also saw dreams of her friends being crushed by reality, and feels it will happen to her. There is a quite a internal struggle within Alex regarding the audition for the Ballerina company.The power of Music is a key element in the movie. Alex's father once told her, ""if you close your eyes you can see the music"". This statement is key in the outcome in the movie. This meaning music can make you see, feel and sometimes do powerful things. There is an important scene done to the song ""What A Feeling"" a powerful uplifiting song.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The Music and the Dancing is What Matters,"I was a teenager when I saw this movie and since I didn't go to a movie house very often in those days (even less now), of course the movie had an impact on me. But what I remember mostly from my perception back then was how great the music was and how the dancing was out of this world.This said, I hadn't seen it since then and I wanted to watch it again with an adult perspective to review things properly. It might be unfair to judge Flashdance with our modern eyes since as an audience we are so much more sophisticated being deluged with special effects and amazing technical achievements in movies then we all were in the 1980's.But even as a 15 year old and not knowing much of anything about editing or technical aspects of movie making, I remember that I instantly noticed that the dancing was not done by the same person. This is no big secret now and is even mentioned in the trivia here but Marine Jahan was the one who danced in most of the sequences that were supposed to be done by Jennifer Beals. I recall being startled at just how carelessly they had filmed Marine in medium shot with her face clearly visible in many segments inter cut with a few shots of Beals in close ups to maintain the illusion.I also remember an award show in those days where they finally exposed the truth that Marine Jahan was the dancing double and she even performed a dance routine that blew me away. I can just imagine how frustrating it must have been for her not even being credited here or anywhere else for her work. Her dancing is amazing and I don't know why they couldn't use someone who could act the scenes as well as dance but I guess we're talking about a different era.Today of course, they would find an actress who can dance or a dancer who can act and they do exist. This brings me back to the ultimate frustration I felt with this movie. Cynthia Rhodes has a small part as Tina Tech one of the dancers and I will never figure out why they didn't give her the lead part of Alex Owens. Not only was Rhodes gorgeous and an amazing dancer (her one big dancing scene is the highlight of the movie to me...) but she could also act. She deserved that part but I guess Beals had something that the producers preferred.I have to say that I was disappointed in Jennifer's performance. For some reason, I didn't connect with her portrayal and even though she is the lead, the fact that I keep seeing someone else's face every time Alex dances pulls me out of the story which by the way, isn't much at all. Nothing really happens and except for the dance scenes which are spectacular, nothing else attracted my attention.Which brings me to my final point. This is I think one of the very first movies that was truly made successful by the soundtrack. The music is of course the main star of this movie and on that front, they struck gold. Even today, those songs are so powerful that they uplift the so-so movie into the stratosphere.So a 6 star rating felt fair because even though this is by means a great movie and should mostly be viewed as a collection of music videos, the dancing and the music makes it an enjoyable depiction of an era gone by and I for one can respect the fact that this became such a monster hit that it defined a whole generation.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Nostalgia,"As other users have said this film is very dated, but not necessarily bad. It was looked upon as a bit of fluff that was very successful in the box office. So now, it would come across as nostalgic (in the same vein as Dirty Dancing). But the thing I do like about it, is just that. Adrian Lyne perfectly captured the time, a post disco era when Break-dancing and Synth Pop were all the rage - Who could forget the FANTASTIC theme song, sung by Irene Cara (Fame) and composed by Synth Pop genius Giorgio Moroder (I feel love - Donna Summer among many others). So what if Jennifer Beals wasn't a great actress? So what if it wasn't her dancing? (Think one of them was a break dancer from ""The Rock Steady Crew"" - see? All about the era!) she was a good looking girl, and this was a harmless bit of fun at the time.",,Anonymous,Music
Question bout alex's family,"I love this film. It is on in the UK right now. I loved it when i was at university but it has always bothered me that the film never explained whether she had parents or not. Was she an orphan? It also seemed a bit odd that at 18 she was a welder.IT is a skilled job. How did she get that job as a girl at 18!! and 20 yrs ago!! And the rest of the male workers seemed to accept her .. which I find hard to believe. Their must have been a lot of male chauvanism in that environment.

Dance ... a lot,"The infamous water scene ... while she is dancing. Jennifer Beals got quite famous because of the movie and that scene. Well because of the movie overall of course. But the movie is decent and might not have aged particularly well. The music it has still resonates though. And what a great soundtrack this has - just amazing.The movie or rather the story is quite simple. The main character seems quite resistent in many ways. Help me to help you - could have been one of the dialogs. Although it is more ""help you, to help yourself"". But her mind is set in blocking herself. So there is a blueprint in here in how to self sabotage. In that sense it is really well told - but is it enough to make the viewing worthwhile? Something you have to decide ... the dance scenes are nice, the compilation and especially the ending ... uplifting, no pun intended. Predictable but overall fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Inebriating charm,"This film is an inebriating flow of 80s pop culture, its amazing soundtrack, the way people looked and dressed, the dancing styles, its overwhelming sensuality. It is a dive into those years in which everything seemed lighter and surely looked more colourful and appealing.The story is pretty straightforward: Alex, the protagonist, is a beautiful young woman who loves dancing and who works as a welder to make a living. She is too afraid to follow her dreams until she starts dating Nick, her handsome rich boss. It is a simple romantic comedy. Anyway the appeal given by this movie cannot be found in its plot, but rather in its surroundings, the music, the dances, the hypnotic looks and wonderful Jennifer Beals in one of her best performances.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Not completely feeling it,"Love musicals. Love dramas. Love a lot of films from the 80s, despite being aware of some of my friends who consider it one of the weaker decades for film. While there are certainly far worse musicals, there are also far better. 'Flashdance' is not without its moments but overall left me not completely feeling it.Where 'Flashdance' is most successful is in the soundtrack and dancing. The soundtrack is toe-tappingly infectious and is infused with a lot of energy. This is particularly so with ""What a Feeling"", wonderfully sung by Irene Cara, which won a worthy Oscar and became an iconic hit of the 80s. ""Maniac"" is a close second. The dance sequences are clearly strenuous, while also being high-octane in energy and having surprising grace.That is not to say that it doesn't have other good things elsewhere. Adrian Lynne directs very well, capturing perfectly the post-disco visual mood and general atmosphere of the time. 'Flashdance' looks good too, being cleverly shot and atmospherically lit and designed.However, the acting is really not great. Jennifer Beals seemed too lightweight for a pretty lewd character, and when showing a more aggressive, harder side it comes over as annoying and like she was uncomfortable doing it. She does fare better than Michael Nouri, whose character is obnoxious, bland and clichéd, all of those accentuated in Nouri's acting. If the rest of the cast are not being mentioned, it is because their contributions were not memorable.'Flashdance's' script is a complete mess. Cliché-ridden, cheesy and often tasteless. The story is vastly overshadowed by the film's style, music and dancing, it is barely existent and what there is pretty dull and preposterous, too often the opposite of feel-good or charming while the sordid-ness also feels over the top. Nice message, if not exactly new, but the very frothy and severely underdeveloped romance belongs somewhere else entirely.Overall, has good points but am not completely feeling it. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Fun Hollywood fantasy,Can a beautiful woman work as a welder in a steel plant and not experience sexual harassment? Does a welder have enough energy at the end of their shift to be able to dance at night as a second job? Can someone with no formal dance training audition for a ballet academy? Can you really park your bike anywhere in Pittsburgh without locking it up? Why don't all women take their bras off in front of me like that? These questions are about as relevant to Flashdance as questions about space travel are to Star Wars.

"Reaks of the 80's, but I can't help to like that stench...","Obviously, this movie has ""80's"" written all over it. The plot is very thin, clichéd and predictable. The acting isn't really that strong either (but Jennifer Beals is soooo hot I can't believe it), nor are the characters. Sure, the characters are likable, but not very deeply developed. You pretty much don't know anything about the characters backgrounds, families or history in general. This movie isn't a masterpiece, but gosh darn it that soundtrack, the dancing and the whole feel of the movie is fantastic. If you are a grumpy person who thinks everything about the 80's was cheesy and lame, for the love of God don't watch this film (you might go out on a killing rampage if you do) However, if you are not a person like that, watch this film cause' it will make you feel awesome. It is a great feel-good romance flick with awesome grooves and great moves.Give it a chance!7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A 94 Minute Music Video,"I give ""Flashdance"" a lowest rating of 1 out of 10 because it's nothing more than a series of music videos with a movie short surrounding the music videos, in order to clock in as a feature length film. Since when does that count as film? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, an aspiring 18-year-old dancer, who, incomprehensibly, has a job as a welder in a Pittsburgh steel factory. Not a line of work most older women find their way into, much less 18-year-olds fresh out of high school. Meanwhile, at night she works as an exotic dancer, who never actually takes off her clothes, in a greasy spoon bar called Mawby's. Yet looking at the well choreographed and well polished dance routines the girls do every night at Mawby's, you would think they were working at the best casino on the Las Vegas Strip.Alex ends up having a predictable romance with her boss, Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who is about twice her age. After resisting Nick's advances, because going out with the boss isn't a good idea, she wastes no time in going all the way with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job, which makes no sense given how it is likely to look to Alex's co-workers.When Beals isn't being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie, her character spends most her time throwing temper tantrums. Alex's dream is to get an invitation only audition at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably, when her boss/boyfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of, she's throws one her tantrums. She angrily tells Nick she isn't doing the audition because of his intervention, and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making this.Of course, Alex does eventually get her audition at the Conservatory. She puts on a dance routine before the Conservatory board that is so ridiculous that you would think it was in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. Oh yeah, it is a dance routine in a movie marketed to the MTV generation.I don't think I can judge whether or not Beals can actually act well on the basis of what I saw in ""Flashdance"". This is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written, that I don't think it is a fair litmus test of her acting abilities.You have to hand it to the makers of ""Flashdance"" though. This movie is proof that the poorest film making can be covered up by a slick marketing campaign. In this case a best selling and award winning soundtrack and music videos for said soundtrack in heavy rotation on MTV. If they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script, then they might have been able to come up with a plot and a story with characters that I cared about. Instead what we get are stock characters put in ridiculous scenes any viewer with a functioning brain can't take seriously. A truly forgettable ""film"".",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Some may call it heavenly in its brilliance, others are just entertained","Although I've long known, generally speaking, what this movie is about, I never saw it when it came out in 1983 or 1984, because I was too busy ""living"" the 80's (yeah, right, whatever that means!). But I just saw it recently, in its entirety, the other night on TV.I don't know, maybe it's the current sorry state of affairs of the world today that made me want to watch this film, just so I could revisit the ""happy days(?)"" of the eighties, when, although the world was also in a sorry state of affairs, at least there was an underlying pretense of hope and glory, a pervasive (albeit childlike) adherence to the belief that wishes DO sometimes come true, miracles CAN happen, and for every ugly frog there IS a beautiful princess waiting to kiss him...This movie sucks, bigtime... but it also rocks! And that, people, is the honest to God truth. This movie is so bad it reeks of the stench of the very phoney-baloney on which it is based (and we all know how awful THAT is). BUT, it also rocks you to your very soul, and hey, how can you possibly fault a movie that dares to offer people (and not just young people, but ALL people) that little thing called HOPE???I hope you don't take my ""critique"" the wrong way... Honestly, I don't think the movie is really all that good, but the message, and the feeling, and the spirit of this movie, are all very wonderful and infectious indeed and should NOT be discounted. It makes it a wonderful movie. Strange, isn't it? If those of you reading this are parents with up-and-coming kids, make them sit through this film!! Make them watch it!! I guarantee you, at least there is not a single scene in it where some teenager just HAS to have sex with a baked pastry object!!Finally, let me comment on the fact that many in filmdom have dissed Jennifer Beals over the fact that a stand-in dancer performed various or several of her dance segments. Well let me just mention, that at the very end of the film, in the credit roll, there is a disclaimer that states: ""The people and events in this film are fictional. Any similarity to actual people or events is unintentional."" So, with this in mind a stunt double performed some of the dance steps!?? I was shocked, shocked to find that stunt doubles are used in Hollywood!!",,Anonymous,Music
"The dance version of ""Rocky""","Released in 1983, ""Flashdance"" is a drama/music/romance film starring Jennifer Beals as, Alex Owens, an 18 year-old welder in Pittsburgh who dreams of being a professional dancer and longs to be accepted into a prestigious school. She dances at a nightclub in her spare time, which is contrasted by the strip club across the street, owned by a sleazebag who tries to lure the respectable dancers into his seedy lair (Lee Ving). One of her friends aspires to be a figure skater (Sunny Johnson) and another friend a stand-up comedian (Kyle T. Heffner). Meanwhile her tall, dark and handsome boss takes a liking to her (Michael Nouri).This is an entertaining dance flick with the requisite early 80's soundtrack. All the dance sequences were performed by the uncredited French dancer Marine Jahan, who later sued the producers for not crediting her (the brief break-dancing scene was done by a dude). While the wide-eyed Beals and Jahan are in top shape and comely enough, I favor Sunny (the skater).I was impressed by the quality characterizations for a relatively short sports movie. I call it a ""sports movie"" because that's essentially what it is – ""Rocky"" with a female protagonist and dancing instead of boxing. I also like the Pittsburgh locations. Despite my positive feelings, the less-popular ""Heavenly Bodies,"" which came out 9½ months later and stars cutie Cynthia Dale, is superior IMHO.The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"It's not the best, but it's a keeper...","While this movie probably isn't the best out there, and could have been alot better, I still think it's a keeper.Yes, the plot was pretty much non-existant, but the story overall was solid and was a good bit on real life.

It's no wonder Jennifer Bealls had trouble finding good work after this movie. Bad acting bad directing and bad continuity. The woman is actually wearing metal buttons on herself, as a ""welder"" which is a no-no. The storyline is supposedly meant to be uplifting and a struggle to prove one's self. I easily proved I could uplift myself from the struggle to sit any further the second time I gave this movie a chance. This title is still in print?

People wonder where the style changes come from, well they come from movies and this one Changed Life, Dance and style as we know it today. The movie had a kind of vibe that let you know to ""follow your dream"" and enjoy your life, love and most of all Dance. It added the love of your elders mixed with the life of the young.

80s cheese with heart,"Alex Owens (Jennifer Beals) is a Pittsburgh steel welder by day and exotic dancer by night at Mawby's Bar. She dreams to be a ballet dancer but is too intimidated to apply.

Flashy and Trashy at the Same Time,"In 1983, an odd romantic drama dance film known as Flashdance hit the big screen. Despite being met with harsh critical reviews, the film became a smash hit with audiences and helped launch the careers of its star Jennifer Beals, director Adrian Lyne, co-writer Joe Eszterhas, producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, and many more. To this day, the film has remained a huge staple in both 80s pop culture memorabilia and its soundtrack that is still being performed by the general public alike. Now appraisal for style alone does not equal a satisfying experience, so how flashing is this movie overall?Set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the film follows a young woman named Alex Owens (Jennifer Beals) who works as a welder by day and as an exotic dancer at night. In acknowledging her dream to become a real dancer, Alex's boss/boyfriend Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri) encourages her to take her passion and make it happen. While a fairly emotional story might lie in store, Flashdance suffers from a lack of proper substance to remain engaging from start to finish. On top of not offering much screen time to know much about Alex beyond her basic passion of dancing and wishing to get out of her miserable life, the film would rather spend more time on the sleazy dance industry and the cliched romance between Alex and Nick. Uncomfortable age gaps aside, the bawdy chemistry between Beals and Nouri overshadows what should have been more of a focus on Alex's life, including that of her ballet mentor Hanna and her own friends at the club she dances at. Whatever pathos or emotional connection should have been onscreen is sorely lacking in this poorly rendered story.However, even with these glaring narrative problems prevalent throughout, it's clear that the filmmakers intended to put on a show in lieu of its dramatic tone. Thanks in part to the ambitious cinematography and dazzling choreography, anyone who remembers this movie today can think of at least one dance number that rocked their socks off. Giorgio Moroder's eccentric electrical score is enough to send one in a dancing frenzy just from timeless beats like Maniac and the Oscar winning Flashdance...What a Feeling, aided by the vocal talents of Michael Sembello and Irene Cara. As this film dawned some outrageously steamy costumes that revolutionized what dancers wear in their performances, it's no wonder people still get turned on by this feature today. Also, while Alex lacks much of a character in her own regard, a lot of her friends are far more interesting from their actors alone, who do the most in improving the weak material through strong improvised dialogue and dance moves. If the film fails on a narrative level, at least its visual direction is what makes it eye-catching.Now with all of these negatives and positives mentioned, it might be safe to say that the movie is both hopelessly dated and remarkably timeless. Today's audiences might find the movie impossible to stomach when most of the women in the feature, even the dancers themselves, talk more about men than a gossip column. It doesn't help that many of them, Alex included, can best be described as hollow sex symbols generated from the filmmakers' fantasies rather than fully fleshed out heroines one can gain much understanding from. And yet, there is somehow a polarizing honesty in how the feature prefers to be more of a techno musical experiment by showcasing the real passion from these exotic dancers. As showing is preferred in cinema over telling, it is possible that the feature was initially intended as a visual journey seeing these crazy dances, through stumbles and triumph. In some way, the film could be seen as relatable to anyone who has worked so hard to get to a place of internal and external satisfaction through dancing, albeit on a surface level.Flashdance might be one of the most polarizing experimental dance films out there, as its narrative and characterization shortcomings also benefit from its gorgeous choreography and filmmaking techniques. As far as recommendation goes, even if you end up disliking the feature, I would argue that it must be seen in order to be believed. Whether you walk away stunned by the innovative dancing or groaning at the paper thin writing, there's no doubt that the film will stick in your mind like a slow glowing dream. It's up to you to see whether or not this flash of a feature is worth the hype or not.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Fluffdance,"Oh boy I just saw this movie on TV after of few years. It is still entertaining but cornball. I remember when it first came out, it was a major hit. And Jennifer Beals was still passing for white. I am glad to see she is not doing that anymore. With movies such as All Saints and shows like the L Word. People actually aspired to be strippers after seeing this movie. Since all it was is a cleaned up stripper movie, not a dance movie. I still think that Flashdance phenomena is still going on to this day. Ever since that movie came out every stripper is a stripper because they use the Flashdance excuse, they are aspiring dancers who are paying for college..school. It is hilarious. The movie is kind of creepy now that I am older but at the time I thought nothing of this 35 year boss chasing after his 19 year old employee. Talk about a lawsuit waiting to happen. Also no way in Pittsburgh will there be a 19 year old arc welder. That is a very good job which takes years to master, a big union job. She surely could afford to go to any school she wanted if she was making welding money. And that bike would of been gone a long time ago with the bad weather Pittsburgh has in the winter. I liked that she did have friends too many of these movies the women seem to have no friends. But just boyfriends and perhaps a family member. And they all got along. I liked that. It was very sad that the actress who played Jeannie, Sunny Johnson, died the next year. She was very popular at the time and I remember being shocked. Jennifer Beals is very engaging in the movie, Micheal Nouri is creepy and entirely too old for her. It was a joke at time when people use to do Jennifer Beals imitations with her running in place to the music Maniac because it was the only scene in the movie you actually saw her face while she moving. What was distracting about the movie was the dance doubles, they did not even have the same body type and in the last scene, the one that is suppose to be the showstopper, that took away from the movie. They actually used a man named crazy legs to do the break dancing spin And you can see it! I was happy to see Cynthia Rhodes who is a real dancer..why didn't they use her for the lead since she could really dance? Since she married Richard Marx she hasn't been seen. I almost forgot about her. She was all over the place in during the 80's. I am happy to see Jennifer Beals career doing well. She really has picked good edgy roles. All in All the movie is very entertaining. Not The Red Shoes , but good for what it is...fluffy, not to be taken seriously. But Nouri is too old for that girl.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Flash Dance was inspirational,"A city girl trying to make it on her own; working two jobs, has her own apartment that used to be a warehouse, and trying to pursue her dreams. Alex is an admirable character. She is strong-minded, strong willed, confident, and takes no BS from anyone.Though Flashdance was very boring, it was however, quite inspiring. Throughout the slow paced, dull film, there was a very well received underlying message; try for your dreams or you never know if they will come true. Without our dreams we die.This movie took place in the 80's and we knew it. Everything was very 80's. The hair, the clothes, and the music were very true to the 80's. Normally I love dancing movies but the dancing style of the 80's just wasn't my taste so I didn't enjoy the performances, though I did enjoy and much appreciate the inspirational message.This is a feel good movie to see when you are feeling hopeless and in need of some encouragement and inspiration.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
a twenty-something perspective,"Last thing Flashdance page needs is another review, but I felt so compelled to write one, and I will keep it short. As someone not even born in the 80s I have only heard about Flashdance, but I knew the song before watching the movie.Sure the storyline feels sappy and the dialogue at times is very cliché; I don't want to give any spoilers I rather suggest you watch it before reading others' comments to get a feel of it yourself. But I guess what draws you in is not only the amazing song selection that works so well with the movie's rhythm but also Alex's character overall. She is very relatable, dignified and so much soaked into her own world of dreams that she takes you there with her. Here as far as the acting goes, I can say that Beals does a fine job; you can tell she feels Alex in her bones. I loved how comfortable Alex seemed in her own skin and surroundings meanwhile feeling isolated and lost.Would I watch it again? Maybe just to watch Alex's character and see some of the dance sequences. Yet, I recommend watching it to everyone else, as it is already a part of pop culture history.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Will the real JLo(Jennifer Lopez) please stand up!,"The one over-riding theme in a lot of the comments here about Flashdanceis how it does not hold up to the test of time! What a load!

Most of us have dreams or had them.When I first saw this movie I was 23 and I was full of hopes andambitions. And looking back now, this movie makes me see what happenswhen you don't go for them. I loved Jennifer Beals when I saw the movie back then. Little did weknow that Jennifer was the original Jennifer Lopez. The whole PuertoRican babe with the bubble butt that drives men crazy these days wasactually on display in Flashdance! This movie sparked a fashion craze with the torn and cut-up sweats andthe leg-warmers. Who can forget the scene where Jennifer and MichaelNouri character(who seemed too old for her actually) are in herapartment and she takes off her bra from under her ripped up sweat top.Was that erotic or what?!! It also had a memorable sound-track thatstill has numbers like 'What a Feeling"" and ""Maniac"" being played onthose 80's disco radio shows. All in all this movie was like  the movie Rocky! Instead of Philly yougot Pittsburgh! Instead of a boxer, you get a dancer! Instead of thetheme song "" Gonna Fly Now"" with the line "" feeling strong now"", you get""What a Feeling"". Like the nobody club boxer with no real formal boxingtraining, you get a dancer with little formal training who rises to thetop.

Flashdance,"Aside from the toe-tapper that was Irene Cara's title song, the rest of this film is really only notable because it shows the sheer determination of a young woman - ""Alex"" (Jennifer Beals) to make it. Initially, in a man's world as a welder more than holding her own, whilst at the same time she wants to swap her night-time dancing pole for a ballet school bar and prove that she has what it takes to become a top dancer too. Fortunately, her wealthy boss is also her boyfriend, and ""Nick"" (Michael Nouri) is keen to help her along - sometimes a little too keen, which can lead to the odd bit of tension as she finds herself with an audition that could change everything. It is a very positive-looking film with an upbeat theme and that helps carry what is otherwise a really rather poorly acted affair with some clunky dialogue and a narrative that follows a fairly predictable pattern - before the ending that we just know is coming. Laura Branigan and Giorgio Moroder had a hand in the rest of the soundtrack, which when you watch this film again after all but forty years proves remarkably memorable (if not great). Like it or not, this was a groundbreaking piece of cinema that though it struggles to exude much punch now, certainly did quite a lot - cinematically speaking - back then.

What A Feeling,"This is the kind of movie where everything is a prelude to the climatic  sequence with the ""Oh, What A Feeling"". Jennifer Beals is cast as the  main star of only her second film. The rest of the cast is a group of  little known support players. Biels is the star and this remains her  best film.  The climatic sequence is the main draw to this film. The viewer forgets  almost everything else in the film once you see it. I say almost  because the most often published photo graph of Beals pulling that long  shirt over her buff 20 year young body does get a lot of attention & is  memorable to be sure. That photo was used to sell tickets.  This very much early 80's period piece is an OK movie with a great  song. It is not a classic film but if this were your blind date, you'd  enjoy the date but unless forced too, you might fore-go a second one.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A representative of the 80's to be sure.,"But it's the good 80's, and I'd like to point out that this is more of an artistic movie than anything else, especially with the lighting and the main character's quirks(even though it doesn't seem like that was the producer's intention!) Also the story of how this was cast makes me wonder (I would've voted for Demi Moore, but oh well)if the producers knew how this movie would've fared. It's started the 80's new wave look I'm told, and it actually enpowered women in it's own shallow way, so we can safely say it was a breakthrough, kinda like The Matrix restarted the whole industrial-cyberpunk goth trend. Still, why does she want to be a ballerina? It's doesn't make sense, she'd be better off in a chorus line where the people are likeable as she was!!! As a dancer back in the 80's (and yes, it was hard to admit to being a male dancer back then!!) this movie was cool to watch and the soundtrack was pretty awesome!!

Pure 80's vibe,"I saw this movie for the first time in my life a few days ago and i must say i loved this movie.If you think about the 80's the picture you have in mind is pretty close to what you see on the screen when you put in Flashdance. From the first second onwards it blasts 80's synthesizer-sound in your eardrums, you see the typical hairstyles and clothes (that you would instantly relate to that era in your head). It's just a perfect emulation of that period of time, i felt like i was there, totally immersed and ready to go.So regarding the atmosphere it was just perfect for me. In addition Jennifer Beals as the main character Alex Owens delivers an enchanting performance. She acts in a natural and relatable way, i was with her from the beginning till the end and felt all of her struggle to become a professional dancer. Her female role also struck me as rather atypical. She works in a man dominated job, she is living her life on her own and takes the active part in her relationship to the male love-interest.It's impressing how dynamic and fast-paced the movie is, there is not a single moment that leaves you bored. To me it represents a perfect example of a feel good movie.Even though i seem to only have praise for it, i am completely aware that there are multiple doubtful performances and that story-wise it has not that much to offer. It's not something you think about for days or something that leaves a deeper and lasting impression inside of you. But it leaves you with a smile on your face, with energy in your feet and makes you ready to dance yourself.Yeah I know that all mostly sounds like I am an all-out fanboy, but what should you do when you catch the Feeling?",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A great '80s film.,"Flashdance is a good film, carried almost entirely by Jennifer Beals acting performance and dancing performance. Despite these acts being the central appeal of the film, there is also a nice story set to serve as context that encourages the pursuit of dreams, in spite of reality constantly knocking on the door. It was a daring move to showcase a female steel worker moonlighting as an exotic dancer, it was courageous to show a female lead working two jobs on her own, with no male support whatsover, she's her own woman. Adrian Lyne has always portrayed smart,
determined and brave women in his films, Jennifer Beals' Alex Owens being one of his firsts.Primarily known for its dance audition scene, along with some exotic dance scenes famously displayed in Irene Cara's What a Feeling music video, although this film is much more than just dancing, it's about the passion of it, giving all that it takes to make it professionally, to have a unique opportunity and seize it, about standing up on your own two feet and chasing your dreams.It highly evokes nostalgia, because it screams 80s, that's why is so enjoyable, apart from the dancing. So revisit, re-live it, or watch it if you haven't, I wouldn't call this a classic but it's a well-known '80s movie that deserves to be seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"One look at that collarless t-shirt, and you're back in the '80s","""Flashdance"" is an iconic 1980s film, memorable for its terrific music, the collarless t-shirt and sweatshirt, and some fabulous dancing. It also launched the career of beautiful Jennifer Beals.The interesting thing about ""Flashdance"" is that there's really not much to it at all. It's a bare-bones story about a Pennsylvania welder (Beals) by day, men's club dancer at night - the dances are sexy and creative performances without nudity, money being thrown at you, etc.The boss of her day job (Michael Nouri) sees her dance and falls for her. She wants to audition for the Philadelphia Dance Repertory Company but she has no real training, she's just naturally gifted. She's encouraged by an elderly friend (Lilla Skala).The reality is it plays like a bunch of music videos. The photography relies heavily on the use of shadows and silhouettes during the dancing, which is quite effective.The acting is so-so; Michael Nouri is fine, but he doesn't have much to do. Cynthia Rhoades, a fabulous dancer who retired after marriage, is pretty and credible as a friend.Beals, who put her career on hold to finish college, is sweet; her acting improved over time. None of the characters are particularly well developed - it's all dialogue in between the music.Nevertheless, ""Flashdance"" is an exuberant film that appeals to the youth in all of us, that ""take your passion and make it happen"" mentality, with all that music making you want to get up and dance.There were three different dance/acrobatic doubles used for Beals. I can remember it was a semi-scandal when the woman who did most of the dancing was revealed; the studio kept it quiet and didn't credit the dancers.A light, fun film that gave the '80s some great music and fun fashion.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A Bad Way To Sell Records,"This movie was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea to sell some records . No seriously it was . The thinking behind it is that if you made a film full of pop songs you could stick the tracks on a LP , sell it and make even more money for the studio . You could also release a few tracks as singles and intercut the promo video with clips from the movie so that when MTV play a track you're actually getting free advertising for the movie . This is a good business deal but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood movies from the 1980s and I rate the mid 1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for American film making and FLASHDANCE opened the door to this "" Let's make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie "" type film makingJennifer Beals plays Alex Owens a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet and right away logic disappears with this career choice . Welding is a fairly sophisticated trade , it's not something you walk into and learn in five minutes . There's other gaps in logic like ballet dancing and "" flashdancing "" being somehow similar . ie if you apply to be a ballet dancer and do some hot , dirty flashdancing the male judges might want to meet you after the audition but you won't get the job . it's kind of like saying that screen writing , novel writing and play writing are somehow the same when they're notBut I guess none of this mattered to Jerry when he asked director Adrian Lyne to make the movie . Actually Lyne almost makes a very sexy movie , JenniferBeals is very sweet and innocent looking . Fortunately I sussed out why her face is brightly lit in close up while her silhouette is darkly litin long shots except when the camera cuts to close ups of her heavenly toned body . That's because a body double is used most of the time and frequently the body double is a man ! I bet there's a few naughty boys who are feeling guilty not to mention slightly disgusted to know that",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Finally on DVD,"I grew up in the 1980's.  So, for me, 80's music, shows and movies are nostalgic.  I think this is one reason I really love this movie.  I loved it when I saw it the first time and now I own it on DVD.  This movie is uplifting, charming, and has the best ending to a film I have ever seen. The music makes the whole movie work.  It is almost like the movie was created to go around the music.Jennifer Beals plays a lonely, attractive, yet scared 18-year-old woman, even though she acts much older.  She is mature, intelligent, strong, and full of life.  Any man, including myself, would go gaga for a woman like this.   But, most importantly, she chases her dream.  It is this part of the movie that I feel captures the entire film.  The main character, as well as other side characters, chase their dreams even though they are all scared to death of failure. Some of them do fail but some succeed in varying degrees. They all chase what they want out of life and that is truly the message of the movie. The ending you will have to witness for yourself but every time I see it I get goose bumps.  It makes me feel like I can do anything I put my mind to. Excellent film.

"A nice piece of movie-candy, though with some gross, inappropriate humor...","From the soundtrack music to the break dancing to Jennifer Beals' big poof 'do, everything about ""Flashdance"" looks and feels like old news. Even the steel mill setting is passé (most of the steel mills in Pennsylvania went under due to Japan's steel at cheaper prices). However, at the time of its release, ""Flashdance"" was a piece of movie-candy, with a romance subplot between welder/dancer Beals and boss Michael Nouri that is exceptionally sweet. Lilia Skala has a pleasant supporting bit as a former ballerina and the late Sunny Johnson (who died while this picture was still in theaters) shows echoes of Sharon Tate in ""Valley of the Dolls"": vulnerable, naked, and touchingly doomed playing Beals' ice-skater friend. Unfortunately, there are some really ungainly jokes in the film (re: 'honkies', small penises, Polish jokes, a gross lesbian joke, and a real stinker about cockroaches in hamburgers), but the basic outline of the picture, corny though it may be, still works a little magic. It's hard not to get worked up by the propulsive editing in the final scenes and during Beals' ""Maniac"" number. But looking at it now is just a little bit embarrassing. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Atmospheric, almost perfect","You know when a work of art just clicks with you? This was one such film.One an initial level, I admire it immensely artistically – it's beautifully shot, and the lighting is amongst the best I've ever seen, hazy, dim, soft and warm, it really added to the atmosphere. And then there was just the catalogue of amazing scenes, from the strobe dance in the club against the white background (an epileptic fit waiting to happen, I'd have thought it'd warn you on the box), the scene outside the club in the driving rain when she drags out the semi-naked Jeannie, the dance in the spray at the start and of course the final audition.The acting is great, too, especially Beale, who is extremely empathic whilst remaining feisty and full of character. The story moves quick and visually the film is very distinctive. Some scenes seem pretty risqué for the time, though never forced, and the dialogue is excellent and well delivered.The soundtrack is pretty perfect too, most of it written by Moroder so that's to be expected. The way the songs connect with every scene is so skillful and understated. They also got all the little things right, such as locations and choice of shot. One of the most perfect films I've ever watched. The only criticism is the ending, which is abrupt. And it also feels very 80s, which I think is a good thing but some may find aspects dated.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
What A Bad Feeling.,"Flashdance's theme is a great song. So great, its the only great thing about this movie. This movie showed me that Dance Movies are not that good. There are some I think that might be good, but if I watch something like Dirty Dancing for the first time, I will remember about Flashdance.The film has no plot. Simple as that. Its just some girl doing exotic dancing. She is very unlikeable. Very, Very Unlikeable.This film introduced me to the worst cliché of all time, Slapping People Twice. We get it. You hate them or are disappointed or upset with them but you don't need to do it again. Seriously.The dancing is not impressive and the ending is also abrupt. I have nothing else to say About Flashdance.50/100 C",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Thugs do Pretty,"There are dirty, moneygrubbing thugs in this movie, not ashamed to make money from sex. They operate a strip club, from which one of the characters is ""rescued."" This movie is made by the same sort of moneygrubbing thugs (Gruber, Peters, Bruckheimer) , and there's no doubt that sex is at the top of its values. It has essentially no story, only a series of setups. Its clearly designed to sell music, which then was LPs.And yet it works for me. The reason is that its cinematic, a and finely so. I'm usually pretty tough on films that feature dance, unless the camera itself dances. This one doesn't. But what it does have is crisp editing and superb, absolutely superb lighting.I think dePalma started this and did the stuff that works, the storyboards, the lighting design. I imagine he supervised the scouting of the dirty sets where we see smoke, glow and sparks. I imagine he worked out the tricks where the face is occluded so that we can swap our actress with real dancers, several of them.So you can find three things to like here: the fold where the smarmy guys are in the movie, the fantastic lighting, beginning with the very fist shots, and the dancing. It almost seems as if the dancing came after the major cinematic decisions. It was unusual for the time: more energetically sensual. Tight in energy but lose in inspiration. All of the dances have an on screen audience, but one: the ""manic"" dance. That lack of on screen audience after the deliberate inclusion of one invites us in.And this dance is photographed differently. We don't see the whole body: we see parts, and while the camera doesn't spatially move, it does temporally. The editors dance. The visual rhythm invokes voyeurism, identification and syncopation all at the same time. This is significant movie-making, hidden in a rather trivial-seeming wrapper.Gruber at the time advertised this as ""Rocky with a woman,"" but there's no resemblance story-wise. There is with the energy though.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Music
A brilliantly entertaining if flawed classic,"Flashdance is such an oddity. It has so much wrong with it yet it makes you feel so good? Maybe it's the brilliant music. Maybe it's the style of it all. Maybe it's the flaws that make it so watchable. I don't know. What I do know is that this movie is an absolute blast.Jennifer Beals is a dream in the lead role, bringing a great fire and energy and charm to her performance. Her acting performance that is. The dancing not being done by her really doesn't bother me as I'd rather both the acting and dancing be great that one be mediocre. Speaking of which the dancing scenes are all terrific. So punchy and full of life and passion.The plot is paper thin. Really paper thin. In fact the whole thing is basically just a collection of music videos with largely vapid filler in between. There is a corny cliche relationship. A lot of dated and awkward interactions between men and women. Cringe dialogue.Yet despite all this, Flashdance is a brilliant watch. It will leave you with a smile on your face guaranteed.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Awful,"MTV started making music videos into a popular format to advance the careers of musicians of little or no talent such as Madonna, etc. The trend then unfortunately was discovered by Hollywood. The hybrid result is the 95 minute eyesore known as Flashdance.Alex(Jennifer Beals) is a welder at a steel mill, complete with hard hat for authenticity, during the daytime and at night she is a dancer of yet undiscovered natural grace and ability. She lives alone with her dog, Grunt; I am not making this up. Oh, and by the way, she has been accepted into a prestigious dance academy, how could I forget. It only gets worse. Here comes the father figure, Nick(Michael Nouri), her boss at the steel plant, happens to see her performing what looks like a semi erotic number on stage at a local club. Nick gets horny for his young employee. He and his ex wife fight over his new youthful trophy girlfriend, Alex. More stupidity follows and my only advice is to avoid this long form video and read a book instead.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie is less outdated than many people nowadays might think,"I've seen Flashdance about 15 to 20 times during my whole life since 1983. And all the times I've seen it, it was in the Spanish version. Yesterday I saw the original version and I just couldn't believe how different it was from what I've been watching all this time. While in the original version, Alex seems to be a candid 18 year old girl trying to find her dream, in Spanish her voice makes her look like a much older and experienced woman with an empty life. From what I have noticed about the film production, it is indeed a low-cost movie whose success had nothing to do with its editing, set-ups or actors. I would say that the thing that definitely made a hit out it was the music. I don't think this movie is outdated at all nowadays. In fact, I would say that a remake of this movie would be a hit at the box office. However, I don't think it would be such a good idea to place Jennifer Lopez as Alex, like some people say it would be.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"What a feeling. What an icky, sticky feeling...","*Flashdance* -- what a feeling. What an icky, sticky feeling, like cotton candy that you can't get off your fingers -- total Eighties swill that has failed to congeal over time. So many funny, and so many dreadful moments that peck at the memory like a relentless chicken: Jennifer Beals dancing frenetically in place to the unbearable ""Maniac"", removing her bra without removing her sweatshirt, digging her foot into the guys crotch under the tableand the fashion statement  it is one of those rare movies that has a huge impact on fashion. Who among us wasn't ripping our sweatshirts to shreds and wearing legwarmers? Well, maybe not all of us, truebut she was certainly the most stylish welder to come down the pike in quite awhile. But *Flashdance* is not anything so much as a two hour music video about achieving your dream. Winning Oscars, Golden Globes and Grammys, the soundtrack was a huge success. Selling 700,000 copies in two weeks, not only for the title track, but for the regrettably aforementioned ""Maniac"" by Michael Sembello, ""Romeo"" by Donna Summer, and ""He's A Dream"" by Shandi, the soundtrack, along with the look, still haunts aerobics studios today. ""When you let go of your dream, you die."" But he's wrong  when you listen to dialogue like that, you die.",,Anonymous,Music
High concept 80's feel good movie,"Jennifer Beals shines as the would be ballet dancer who is a welder by day and, in contrast, an exotic dancer by night at the local Mawby's Bar. She tries to pursue her dream of getting into ballet but is held back until one day her boss at the factory spots her talent and encourages her to go for a potentially life changing audition.It's a wafer thin plot but British director Adrian Lyne's stylish direction, Irene Cara's title song and Beal's likeable performance adds up to a high concept feel good movie that was probably inspired by fellow Brit Alan Parker's Fame (1980) and went on to inspire Footloose (1984) and Dirty Dancing (1987), all examples of how best selling soundtracks can really sell a movie.This is nothing new of course because soundtracks to musicals always sold well and popularised the respective movies they featured in however the run of feel good movies in the 1980's like Flashdance were not strictly musicals because no-one started to break out into song, instead they were full of infectious dancing, catchy pop tunes and aspirational stories.Movies like this were regarded as all flash and no substance on their release but the music has endured and the high energy scenes and visceral visuals still work to provide that feel good factor that audiences respond to. The tagline of 'What a Feeling...' really sums this film up.Despite being a great springboard for Beals she never became a big star that this film promised. Flashdance was also one of Producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson's run of mega hits they had in the 1980's along with writer Joe Eszterhas, who would later find notoriety with his script for Basic Instinct (1991).",6.0,Anonymous,Music

It's An Ok Movie That I Still Mostly Enjoy,"Basically i like nearly everything in Flashdance besides one thing that unfortunately the main center of the movie, and that was Alex and Nick relationship, i did not buy them at all, on first Alex was kinda refused Nick in some way, and suddenly only in the first time they in the same room and they do the thing with Alex's will and it just weird for me, if a movie try to make a relationship between two character, just be passion, slowly but works, until the end i have no feeling at all for both of them, i still get Alex because she still got lot of scene without him, but every scene with Nick is with her and it did not work for me at all, besides the main big problem of the movie, in the more positive i was really impress on the dance sequence, the music and how they shot the scene is very stylish, the lighting is all great, the performance was good for the rest of the cast, Jennifer Beals was actually good too if of course not with Nick, so overall Flashdance is not a movie that i'm gonna rewatch but it's an ok movie that i still mostly enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Alex at times is very mature for her age but at times she acts very immature.The dance sequences in this film along with a great characters and great original soundtrack made this film a huge hit.I am shocked that this film never got a sequel.

Indeed) this dull-edged story about an 18-year-old welder-cum-dancer (Can you believe such a preposterous scenario as that?) would have been a major flop-eroo like no other.Released in 1983 to great fanfare - Flashdance was produced on a relatively modest budget of just $7 million.

In its first year, alone, it actually grossed over $200 million, worldwide, at the box-office.And, speaking about anyone seriously thinking about taking up welding as a means of employment - Believe me - It's definitely one of those super-unhealthy trades where one is up close and inhaling all sorts of noxious fumes and gases, non-stop.

But the overall heart of the story is good. Go for your passion, make it happen, what a feeling, etc. This movie makes you feel good and want to pursue your goals in life.

"Don't expect high art, but this was the 80s.","I give this a reasonably high rating of 6 or 6.5, but that is with some serious caveats. First, more than half of the charm of this movie is nostalgia. If you grew up in the 80s, this movie was cutting edge for a teenager. It captured the feeling of energy and mania at the time in the music scene. On the upside, the characters are sympathetic and you can care about their story if you can overlook the ridiculousness of a few aspects of it. The downside includes those ridiculous aspects, and the fact that the story romanticized a lot of bad things. Like pretty woman, it gives the illusion that if the ""bad girl"" gets vulnerable enough, a sensitive man will save her. In Pretty woman its a prostitute, In Flashdance its a stripper.

Freeze Frame,"You might think that this iconic movie is a spiritual successor to dance themed classics like Saturday Night Fever or Fame. In reality this shallow epic works best as pseudo-sequel to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner - another film that features animated mannequins posing in clouds of smoke, sparks and steam. Producers Simpson and Bruckheimer perfected this kind of style as substance filmmaking in the early 80's where every shot is a magazine ad and every scene an MTV video.

What i liked, however, is the constant tension between femininity and masculinity throughout the whole movie.

I'd understand if people don't like the plot, but to those of you who think FlashDance's a joke because it doesn't look like a movie, I say gimme a break. This picture has a simple plot, perhaps, a story about a wielder/dancer going for her dream and falling in love with a man might not be enough for a lot of viewers. however, the movie en-powered itself with what is arguably the best ORIGINAL movie soundtrack of all time, I think someone mentioned earlier, if the studio was to release every song on the sound track as a single, then everyone one of them could have topped charts. And, those who didn't like the movie also complained about acting, well now, I personally thought there was great acting on Jennifer's part. I think, maybe what people do not see is that, given the plot, there was only so much to act for, so instead, she created an attitude, which translated into the music, the cloth, and everything else in the movie. and that, made the movie an icon. The fact that Flashdance made a huge impact on people(hell, it defined a whole generation!!)just like any other memorable moving pictures, is more than enough for me to say it's an excellent movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

But then again, it's not really a movie--it's a bunch of MTV videos slung together with only the faintest gleam of a plot.This was (somehow) a huge hit back in 1983--I didn't like it then and I still don't like it now. I'm giving it a 5 just for the music, the message of the movie (follow your dreams no matter what), the good direction by Adrian Lyne and Beals (she can't act at all, but I like her...and she's a hell of a lot better than Nouri).How did such a stupid, shallow, foul-mouthed movie become such a big hit?",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"The Soundtrack, the Performers, the Heat, the Cool, the Shirt With No Shoulder....","Pittsburgh welder (Jennifer Beals, easily the best looking welder I have ever seen)/night-time exotic dancer dreams of a better life by becoming a ballet dancer. She has nervousness and inferiority complexes galore, but she is a good person with a good heart and soul. Soon she finds love from her day-time boss (Michael Nouri, who knows she is a stripper) and constant encouragement from him and an elderly German lady (the priceless Lilia Skala of ""Lilies of the Field"" fame some 20 years before this was released). Typical situations occur with soap opera-styled results and a smashing soundtrack that represents the very best the 1980s had to offer in the way of cinematic music dominates the action.

This fact does not really benefit or take away from the picture though. The characters are likable, but seem so phony and under-developed. For a time though every girl of the age wore those shirts that hung off one shoulder and every man wanted to be cool like Nouri and be with a hot woman like Beals (ah, the 80s). And of course naturally everyone had to have that soundtrack (which of course was highlighted by ""What a Feeling""---the runaway Best Original Song Oscar winner for 1983).

Royalties... what a feeling.,"Let's not beat about the bush here: 'Flashdance (1983)' is nothing more than a cash-grab, designed specifically to feed off a cycle of royalties. The intention, even as described by those making the movie, is for the film to sell the soundtrack, which then sells the film, and for the soundtrack to be played in public (via, essentially, pre-made music videos), which leads to further free marketing and brings in a hefty royalty cheque. As such, the piece is pretty much as bare-bones as you can get, its thin story stretched over the ninety minute mark simply so it can be classed as a 'feature'. It's about an eighteen-year-old woman who works in a steel mill by day and dances in a non-nude exotic club by night and... well, that's about it, actually. There simply isn't a proper plot. Instead, the flick moves through short-lived subplots that don't amount to a cohesive whole. I mean, the protagonist's ambition is to be a ballet dancer but we only really see her attempt to do this twice. There's no real drive to her oft-promised but never delivered arc, as she seems quite content with the life she lives and doesn't actually come across all that many obstacles. In fact, whenever she reaches a small hurdle, she throws an absolute fit and acts as if she's starring in 'Fatal Attraction (1983)'. This would be fine if the piece were willing to explore her inner demons but it seems as though it actively goes out of its way not to. There's just nothing all that interesting about the picture. It's shot in an utterly inoffensive but generally effective way, it has a few decent dance sequences (with some really bad doubling, I'll add) and it is, when it comes down to it, absolutely watchable. However, it's neither engaging nor entertaining. The best thing about it is its custom-made soundtrack, which has a number of genuinely good songs on it (including 'Flashdance... What A Feeling'). Of course it is, though; that's the only part that received any real attention. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Wonderful,"This show is the best movie i ever seen. The actors are nice.... provided the songs are pleasant to my ears too. This story has a lot of moral behind it, like telling us to strive for our dreams and stuff like that. I really love the last part when the lead actress when ahead with the audition in this prestigious theatre. Despite the fact that she never had any dancing in her entire life, ( which she is required to fill up in the audition form, and she do not have any dancing shoes ) she still went for it. Her moves were marvelous, combining the moves of break-dance, ballet, street-dance and most importantly, flashdance. Even though she failed 1 or 2 times in the audition, she take her chances seriously and she was accepted by the judges. So I would really recommend this show to everyone, whether young or old, male or female.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Influential beyond quality,"An 18-year old female welder (what the...?) Alex Owens (Jennifer Beals), who doubles up as a flashdancer at a night club, reluctantly falls in love with her employer, the always well-groomed jaunty Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri). Self-taught she dreams of entering a ballet school, something seemingly impossible given lack of any recognised dance schooling. In true fairy tale fashion we glide through specious drama involving an elder ballerina, a piteous stand-up comedian slash cook, a waitress turned stripper and the inevitably beguiling rags-to-riches princess meets her prince.Whishing through a tirade of dance sequences (including two ice-skating routine) about 30% of the movie consists of musical numbers, whilst the remaining runtime is rudimentary adhesive pretending to tell a story, with the dramatic excuse burdening the lead actress Beals, who has endless enamour and childishly vampiric sex appeal. The dances themselves are undeniably the highlight, most dimly-lit and featuring fast-editing montage, aimed predominantly at hiding the fact, that all sequences were performed by doubles. Inadvertently this gives ""Flashdance"" a surprising allurement, which came to be deeply influential to future cinema and video-clips, making the movie carry much more weight in filmmaking history then the banality of its story would even deem possible.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't get why this great movie is always being put down!,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The music and dancing are equally as good. Some people say that there is no plot. ???????? There is so! They're always like ""Footloose and Dirty Dancing had plots, but Flashdance didn't!"" What was the plot of Footloose? A bunch of kids want to have a dance in a town where dancing is forbidden. What is the plot of Dirty Dancing? A young girl goes to the Catskills in the summer of '63, only to fall in love with the dance instructor. What is the plot of Flashdance? A struggling young woman dreams of becoming a ballet dancer. Keyword: DREAMS. Don't get me wrong, I still like Footloose and Dirty Dancing, but people shouldn't be so hard on Flashdance! It grossed like 10 or 20 million more than Footloose, the movie in which people usually compare to this one. I personally found Footloose to be not as entertaining as Flashdance, but I still liked it a little. If you want to be entertained, RENT FLASHDANCE!",,Anonymous,Music
Faux Gritty with a winning Beales performance,"Hmm, I feel like I'm being sold something here, just can't put my finger quite on it.... anywho, I'll tell my kids that this is the plot of CODA (which of course they'll see before that. Best Picture? Phooey, this won for ""What a Feeling"")Anyone else notice those ladies working out in that white space from The Matrix?This is Faux Gritty, as shallow as talking to the lamest Valley girl imaginable. Come to think of it, there are probably a plethora of Valley girls with more substance than this. And I almost feel bad comparing this to CODA now, as that has a slightly sinar push-and-pull element of ""I want to follow my passions but I also have this life of work ahead of me,"" but that, even as dusty as that plot is, is a plot. Flashdance feels at most points like a hang-out movie where Alex is mostly surrounded by the more or less working-class stiffs from this bar where she does uh... dancing of a kind (not stripping of course, not Go-Go dancing, just... music video circus act stuff), and it sounds like basic Screenwriting 101 crap that I shouldn't have to tell it, but it lacks a sort of driving conflict to make it interesting.And I know you might say that ""jack her conflict is she doesn't know if she can have that WHAT A FEELING"" and yet that seems woefully underdeveloped and then gets time by Alex throwing tantrums when her well-off boyfriend cum boss gets her the audition she's applying for (with her long list of credentials you know). The rest of the movie is just episodes of Alex doing this or that, sometimes trying to help her Would-be skater friend (who omg falls on hard times for a scene), and like walking around steel factories with her guy set to lame synth ballads. And I think that I'd be more fine with the movie having less of a real story if the characters we are hanging with were better or (except for Beals) better acted, but we aren't getting that here.The other movie that's impossible to not (pun intended) flash to is Showgirls, which is also a Joe Estzerhaus scripted joint and it's uncanny to ponder that experience as that was... not good, but it was wildly entertaining and had these giant performances with the arms-akimbo (anti)magnetism of Berkley. There's really a number of similarities that's hard to shake, albeit here there's also the unmistakable influence (that's putting it lightly) from Saturday Night Fever, as a character does a gig by day to follow a passion by night, though here with the added kick of ""I am a Serious Artist Dancer, people"" while also, again, throwing fits. But and I can't believe I'm defending Showgirls against this, but we understand Nomi far more than Alex. Like; why is she a welder? Shouldn't we get, convention and all, a character asking her what she's doing as a (chortle) 18 year old as a Welder, which is a, uh, union profession? And we only get like a couple of cursory scenes with her family, why aren't they involved a little more with their 18 year and and... nevermind.This is shallow nonsense, surprisingly based off a real person (how about a documentary today on her, natche), but that makes it sound more interesting than it is. It's intermittently exhilarating, even once or twice trashy/sexy (ie that restaurant), the climax is very good and with a fun energy the rest could use more of, most of Moroder's songs and music are sweet, and it's no wonder Beales became a (minor) star for the time. But it kind of sucks. Oh, hey, Robert Wuhl for one minute!",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Generation changer,"As a movie Flash Dance was not a great film, but what this film did was appeal to the masses. When the movie came out in 1983 I was living in Pittsburgh, where the movie was filmed and based, and dating a ballerina, so the movie was near and dear to my heart. The plot was totally unbelievable, the sets were unrealistic and the people were too shallow, but still, our generation suspended reality and just enjoyed the movie.Through the years I began understanding what an impact Flash Dance had on my generation, it especially hit home when I met my future wife in New York City and saw pictures of her and her sisters during that time period. Their hair was modeled after Jennifer Beals', their dress and many of the things they did developed from the movie. An entire generation of young women embraced the 'big, curly hair' look, the off the shoulder sweatshirt and tank-top look and wearing tights and ankle warmers, much to the enjoyment of the men around them. Jennifer Beals' big eyes, brilliant smile and joy of life became endearing qualities that only a lucky few women could properly emulate, I still enjoy that look today.This is a wonderful movie where one should not criticize the fine technical details, instead the viewer should just sit back and enjoy a very nice feel-good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
I can't have it all.........,"Oh, what a feeling I had when I watched this movie. Instead of making me believe I could dance right through my life, this film made me want to sleep right through it. I usually enjoy musicals involving many astounding hits from the 80s, but still, the sheer star power of Joan Jett and the Blackhearts performing 'I Love Rock and Roll' was just not enough for me this time. Though what I enjoyed most was that funky dance music that came after Joan...It was sooooooooo FUNKY!But funky music aside, there was not much else to enjoy in this film. I felt empty as I watched Kyle T. Heffner perform the role of Ritchie. He subtly reminded me of Mike Damus and the funny, hilarious and extremely corny jokes he told. Oh Mike, if only you were old enough to play Ritchie back then.But getting back to me, often, all alone I have cried silent tears full of pride. So I thought I could relate to this film because I too was once a dancer like Jennifer Beals, sadly it was much more of a difficult road to acceptance for me. Yes, Flashdance ended on a positive note, and I can only hope that one day I could be like Alex. But digression is something I do often, so let's get back to my review, I give this film 5 out of 10 because the story was rather weak, and the acting was so bad, I felt I could have acted all the parts out better than them...except maybe the part played by Jumbo Red. For him, I watched until the end.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Doesn't wear well,"Having just watched Flashdance for the first time, I can't appreciate the effect that it obviously had at the time on so many of those who've commented here.  But looking at Flashdance from almost 20 years later, it doesn't seem to have worn well.  The story seems utterly predictable and rather contrived, and the characters are weak.  The music (which I *do* remember well from that time) is still excellent, and some of the dance routines are inventive.  Others were pretty bad.  The closing dance routine is indeed fabulous, but much too short -- for a dance movie, Flashdance doesn't show that much dancing.  Even the gorgeous Jennifer Beals (and her dance doubles) couldn't hold my interest.  As short as Flashdance was, I was looking at my watch about halfway through.  One viewing is plenty for me. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"It's kind of cheesy, but fun to watch.","Flashdance follows the story of a welder by day, exotic dancer by night super-girl.  She wants to be a ballet dancer, but seems to lack confidence at the beginning.  It is, for the most part, a trendy story about perseverance.This was the start of fluffy MTV movies.  As much as I hate those types of movies now, I can't help but smile at this one.  The scenes are cheesy and akward, and the story is rather implausible, but it's still a cute film.

If it wasn't for the great soundtrack...,"Jennifer Beals exploded onto the movie scene with her portrayal of Alexandra Owens in 'Flashdance'. She stars as a young girl, who is a welder by day and an exotic dancer by night. She dreams of being a ballet dancer, but doesn't have enough confidence.Her boss is Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who sees her dance one evening when he goes to the club with friends. Realizing she works for him, he approaches her at work the next day and almost immediately becomes infatuated with her. Needless to say, they start seeing each other.'Flashdance' can be seen as the straight man's aphrodisiac, with constant focus on the female anatomy. This is sexy and sensual - if you're a heterosexual male, or a lesbian. Talk about sexual exploitation! Having said that and the female anatomy aside, 'Flashdance' is definitely more of a chick flick when it comes to its cheesy premise. For a classic, I found it so bo-o-o-o-ring!!The film is driven by a stunning soundtrack, and - quite honestly - if it wasn't for the soundtrack, the movie would have been an absolute waste of time.

Flashdunce,"I just watched ""Flashdance"" for the first time since it came out and my opinion has not mellowed over time.  I dubbed it ""Flashdunce"" then and it remains ""Flashdunce"" now, a film so lame, inconsequential and annoyingly dumb that it actually made the comparably silly ""Footloose"" look like ""Singing in the Rain"" by comparison.  Actually, I'm being too hard on ""Footloose,"" since it actually had a plot, some interesting characters, and a point-of-view (to say nothing of a POINT), as opposed to the pointless and silly ""Flashdance.""But then why should I be surprised?  ""Flashdance"" was co-written by notorious flop-meister Joe Eszterhaus, who followed this up with the intelligent ""Jagged Edge,"" then dropped such neutron bombs as ""Basic Instinct,"" ""Showgirls,"" and ""An Allen Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn"" on an unsuspecting public.  At least ""Flashdance""'s seemingly untalented director Adrian Lyne went on to redeem himself with the ""Play Misty for Me"" rip-off ""Fatal Attraction,"" to say nothing of ""Lolita"" and the superior Richard Gere-Diane Lane starrer ""Unfaithful.""  Here he directs the nonexistent story as a serious of brain-numbing music videos, in which the lead actress (Jennifer Beals, who followed this up with an incredibly forgettable film career) is replaced by an obvious double in the dance sequences and then the audience treated like a bunch of idiots when the filmmakers denied a double was used and refused to give her credit for her obvious hard work.  I have long contended that the incredible success of films like ""Flashdance,"" which were written in crayon and cynically slapped together without a thought as to whether the plot makes sense or not, have led to the increasingly abysmal state of Hollywood films which are terribly written and forcefed to a braindead audience of Pavlovian dogs who are trained to drool and devour garbage like this.Okay the plot:  Beals is Alex, who dreams of a career as a serious dancer. She's only 18, yet she works as a welder by day and an exotic dancer by night.  And by exotic dancer, I mean one that doesn't remove her clothes and gets no more dirty than dousing herself with water and shaking her fully-dressed booty at the audience.  She ends up romancing her wealthy boss, helping out her loser collection of friends whenever she can, and visiting a little-old-lady friend who acts as a defacto grandmother to her. Can you see where this is going?  Will Alex get an audition to the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance?  Will she fall in love with the boss?  Will he help her get an audition?  Will she get mad at her meddling boyfriend/boss, even though she meddles in everyone else's life? Will she see him with his sister and jealously break up with him without even asking who he's with?  Will ""Grandma"" die?  Will she pass her audition? Do we care?Incidentally, not once does the film answer the most obvious question: just what the hell is a flashdance anyway?  And why did audiences care so much about so little?  Even at 94 minutes the film seems padded.  As for nightmare double features, imagine this:  this film was eventually paired with another megabomb from 1983, the Sylvester Stallone-directed ""Saturday Night Fever"" sequel ""Staying Alive,"" which was rightfully considered the worst film of 1983 (""Flashdance"" being runner-up).  Pity poor Cynthia Rhodes, the beautiful and talented ingenue who is best known for co-starring in the infinitely better ""Dirty Dancing.""  She appeared in both ""Flashdance"" and ""Staying Alive.""

"Fair simple, rocky-type story...","1st watched 8/27/2010 -- 3 out of 10 (Dir-Adrian Lyne): Fair simple, rocky-type story about a young woman from Pittsburgh who is a steel worker by day, a dancer by night, and wants to get into a local dance school following the example of her grandmother. Jennifer Beals plays the busy and feisty 18 year old with the dream in this Adrian Lyne directed video-like story. The movie is full of music and video snippets without a whole lot of dialogue and this fills up the movie instead of a story. You never really get a chance to understand the characters because of this choice by the director. You understand what the characters want, but you never really get a fully-developed ""why"" for any of the characters. There are some other minor characters that carry dreams as well -- like a cook who wants to be a comedienne at the local bar where the Beals' character dances. So the real purpose of the story is to show you not to stop reaching for your dreams, but the shallowness of the characters do not help you care. Beals is sexy and enticing at times but is never really given much of an opportunity to act, and when she's given it she doesn't do it that well. The boyfriend, played by Michael Nouri, is just an older middle-aged guy honkering for a younger chic and the Beals' character fits the bill for him. So, overall, you have a very shallow movie about reaching your dreams and never giving up that just doesn't quite cut it despite some good music and OK dancing.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Feeling IT!,"I'm infatuated by 80s movies. But even i gotta admit, Flashdance exceeded my expectations. Jennifer Beals' performance specifically took me by surprise. The 80s was full of acting that made you question if these people had chosen the right occupation. That is not the case with the lead actress. She poured her heart out for this role. I've seen many movies where people are crying but no tears are streaming down their face. There are at least three instances in this film where Beals is crying ""real tears."" For that, I applaud her. It's easy to forget she was 20 because at times i'm convinced she's 30. Flashdance was nominated for four Oscars but Beals' performance was snubbed out. I think the Academy made a mistake, especially since there aren't many instances of an actor wowing me in this decade.Other things to note: The plot on the surface may not seem like anything special. I was thinking it was gonna be something along the lines of Footloose (it wasn't). I tried to think of a movie it reminded me of but nothing crossed my mind.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Impressive as a technical exercise but it feels more like a series of montages in search of a story,"Alex Owens (Jennifer Beals) is a welder by day and exotic dancer by night. However, neither of these things satisfy her so she decides to try and fulfil her true passion by enrolling in a ballet school.Let's get one thing out of the way fairly early on - Flashdance is not a particularly good film. It's a film that opens up with a story, but it's a story that is never really expanded upon - director Adrian Lyne fills much of the running time up with montages that are mostly a cross between music videos and fitness workouts. The film also contains way too many scenes which seem to exist merely to elongate the running time - such as the 'ice skating' scene and the rather random scene where a police officer and a member of the public are directing traffic whilst dancing. From a technical point of view these things are quite impressive, but they have absolutely naff all to do with the story and consequently add very little to the picture.Whilst Jennifer Beals was never going to win any awards for her performance here I actually thought that she did show moments of greatness; her scene with Michael Nouri about halfway through the film where she seemingly cries on cue was a good piece of cinema and Lyne takes full advantage of this moment. Although her performance here is hit and miss across the board, Beals is never less than charming at any given point in the film - she's adorable, charming and easy on the eye and she really does light up the screen whenever she's in front of the camera. Sadly this never really extends to her chemistry with Nouri and their romance is never convincing and this aspect clearly weakens the film slightly.Although the film is filled with lots of excellent technical moments it's the story that really lets the film down as it seems to only be used to start and end the film - there's very little of substance in between. For this reason it's going to something that lovers of cinema or lovers of a good story are going to have a hard job caring about. Having said that it is perhaps passable as a date movie or may even work for those who can't resist a bit of 80's cheese (which this film reeks of BTW).Where the film really stands strong is in its technical areas such as Choreography and Editing (which it receives academy nominations for). Whilst it's mostly good, sadly some of the hard work is undone in the final dance scene where it's pretty obvious that a body-double is used for some of Beals' scenes - check out the moment where she dances right in front of the judges where you can quite clearly see that it isn't Beals doing the dancing!!!Despite some of the negatives it is a passable film, but with a story that's practically non-existent throughout its running time it's a pretty unmemorable film even though it is mildly entertaining at times.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Jennifer Beals Is Hot; Incidentally, It Has A Good Story.","SpoilersThe good story in this movie is about the power of the human spirit and how it overcomes any odds.Jennifer Beals, who I considered world's hottest woman, between 1984 and 1989, stars as Alex, a welder by day and an interpretive dancer in a club by night. Alex has an unstated dream of becoming a ballet dancer. She meets her welding supervisor Nick after he catches her act in the club. He likes her, and they date. She expresses her secret dream of doing ballet to him. He gets her an audition for her dream of joining a ballet company.She finds out in the middle of the Fort Pitt tunnel in Pittsburgh that Nick got her the audition and goes into a rage at him, stopping all traffic under Mount Washington (""Stop the Car Nick!""). She refuses to go to the audition and goes into a big depression. Prior to the audition day, after she has not shown up for work in a week, Nick talks to her and tells her she is using him as a scapegoat for her real problem, which is her fear of performing poorly in front of all those well trained dance/ballet people. He then makes the true statement, when your dreams dies you die. Effectively he was telling Alex, you got to go and give it your all or you'll die inside. She then deals with a death of a relative, and has time to think about things.Realizing that Nick had a belief in her that went beyond their relationship and Nick was also risking his reputation by telling the ballet company to take a look at her, and Nick has no say in which dancer is selected during these auditions, she shows up compete with the better trained dancers for the spot. She puts on the Irene Cara song, ""What A Feeling"" and dances showing her tremendous love for dancing. It has no resemblance to ballet, but the people judging can feel her incredible exuberance for dancing as she brings them alive and the movie audience can also feel this. You want to cheer when she runs gleefully out of the audition and jumps for joy to tell Nick she blew away her better trained competition and made it into the ballet company.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Somebody Stop Her, She's A Maniac!","This movie tries to pass off a stretching scene as a dance sequence. By the way, it is not a good idea to bounce when stretching, that's how muscles get pulled.

From the movie it's obvious that Adrian Lyne understands the difference between cheerleading, gymnastics and actual dancing. On the positive side there aren't enough movies made about welders, so I gotta give credit to writer for coming up with that profession. Although a more interesting premise would have been about a ballet dancer dreaming of becoming a welder.",,Anonymous,Music
Love this movie,"I absolutely love this movie! It chronicles the story of a young women encouraging her friends to try and succeed (or fail) at their passions while she waits on the sideline for her big chance, afraid to take the plunge at her own dream.Alex is a beautiful woman who works in a steel mill by day, but at night dances which is her true passion. She longs to be a professional dancer and pursue her dreams of being on stage but is too afraid to go out and get it. She is a loyal friend and encourages her pals to go out and give it their all while she stays stagnant.In pure 80's fashion, the movie plot isn't a masterpiece (imagine how they remade footloose in the 2000's and it seemed odd and very out of place) but I find it to be genuine and kinda heartfelt as you root for Alex throughout the film and watch her pick up her friends to dust them back off so they can get ""back on the horse"" so to speak.

The Rocky of the strip club world,"Flashdance is the iconic underdog story of a working class welder with bigger dreams of attending an exclusive ballet school but has to pay her dues on stage in a downtown strip club first. Beals is sensational as Alex, the dance scenes are iconic, tasteful and beautifully directed.

Fun movie - Relax and enjoy,"I'm not interested in dance, I seldom like movies with female leads, I have no interest in films portraying everyday life (I already live there). So I shouldn't like this movie - but I do.Don't take Flashdance too seriously - it's a fairy tale. Sit back and suspend disbelief, get into the inspirational theme and don't dwell on the minutiae of the script. There are flaws - but so what? All films have flaws, some more than others. It's the overall effect that counts, not a list of individual faults. This movie is far better than the sum of its parts; the ending alone is worth more than the whole of many other films.A little piece of the early 80's in form, style and spirit. For those who were there, a reminder of what was. For those who came after, a joyful dance through a time that is no more.7/10",,Anonymous,Music

Underrated unbelievably beautiful romantic charming movie,"I have seen other movies by very peculiar American director Adrian Lyne such as ""Fatal Attraction"", ""9 1/2 weeks"", ""Lolita"" long time ago but I skipped ""Flashdance"" for some not obvious reason.Thus I have watched this movie which was filmed in old good (relatively speaking of course) 80s', such an interesting time of technological breakthrough, cassette tape players, neon lights and free open-minded people's revolutionary spirit. Indeed here is selected a mixtape of one of the greatest and catchy songs. All time while I was watching my body and my feet just went to move and dance by themselves with no particular intention. What can I say, I think I'm probably overestimate the significance in ""Flashdance"" among other movies but wow - this really got me. I figure this film will be liked by me forever and has earned its special place in my heart. Foggy streets, falling raindrops on the door windows, street shots, choreography performance, cute Jeniffer Beals face, there are too many really damn good visual frames. You just like watching at a really beautiful and delicious pie and you really want to try a bit of it as soon as possible. Well I want to recommend ""Flashdance"" to everybody who wants to cheer up and start believing in yourself in all terms. The leitmotiv in here is obviously striving for success and fulfilling your own ambitions.Check it out if you haven't this this picture yet, you won't regret; get a glass of white white (or whatever on your preference) and easily relax on your comfy bed while listening to this beautiful soundtrack.Very light, inspiring, beautifully romantic, classic, well made film.

Great because of the impact it created on many lives,"when flashdance was released, i was a teenager still searching for my place in life - what do i want in life, what are my ideals, what are the principles to follow in life etc       watching flashdance made a number of these questions clearer.   the personality and nature of alex (the character played by jennifer beals) moved me a lot, and that became the ideal girl that i would look for, and indeed find, later in life. in some ways, the movie actually ""created"" such girls, as my wife confesses. she was quite influenced by the same character, and the movie helped shaped her own thinking, attitude and behaviour at the time when she was also a teenager and building her own personality.  alex was a strong antidote to the dominant materialistic, ""me first"" attitude at that time (and indeed even now). it was refreshing.  a check with my group of friends (guys and girls) revealed a similar influence on them.i think that, in a nutshell, was why this movie is such an important one for those who were teenagers in the early eighties. it created a lasting impression, and significant influence, beyond the superficial ""music story"". hence, its status as a classic for many people.  combined with a feel good story, great music, and a moral to tell as well, i would recommend this to all who are young, young at heart, those in love, those who have lost their love, and those who have become cynical in life.",,Anonymous,Music

Eye-popping 1980s View,"Lovely Jennifer Beals plays a young woman who is a steel worker by day, an exotic dancer by night. Her dream is to get into a real dance company and with encouragement from her boss-boyfriend, she may get her chance. The city of Pittsburgh co-stars. There is plenty of music in ""Flashdance,"" but none as memorable as the title song performed by Irene Cara. What a feeling! And who can forget that exhilarating scene when Beals is doused with water or when she dances to ""Maniac."" Never mind that Beals's best dance scenes were done with a body double; this is still a worthy film for young people with terpsichorean dreams. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Kind of ""Made For TV"" budget ""Fame""...'80s nostalgia!","Jennifer Beals kicks up her heals high, or as high as possible, in this slice of life from 1980s Manhattan, and the blue collar dreamers, incl., comfortable construction workers (Beal) who struggle to make in on Broadway.She jumps into the sack on the first (Or second, I don't remember) date, with her Boss, who is about 14 years older than she. Sexy scene. I am assuming she was playing an 18 year old character (she looks about 16) because she works on a construction site.Making great money, in a ""non traditional job"" (expression then for women working in a profession dominated by men), will not satisfy her soul! Her boss/lover/svengali has connections. Will he use them to help her?

Oh yes, there is a grit to this film, and it takes time for the story to develop. But when Alex Owens meets Nicky,(Michael Nouri) a man she ultimately trusts, things get interesting. The soundtrack in the film is fantastic, it makes the feel, the passion come alive as it drives the story and gives it a soul. The workouts this young woman goes through are incredible, and it is that fantastic soundtrack that makes that, and the whole film for that matter, simply come alive.

Dancing,"The story goes, there was another choreographer originally, a really hot New York/Las Vegas choreographer who was known for rhythmic, sexy movement with style and real jazz technique. She was also a top teacher in New York at the time, with shows running in Las Vegas, Reno and Atlantic City, also Toronto. She had also worked on Broadway. She was signed and spent about six weeks on the movie. The producers would not give her any of the music to work with, and as a musical choreographer, this would not do. They couldn't give her even a sampling of what it would sound like. After six weeks, she was bored to tears, and quit, going back to teaching crowded classes. Her career continued as it had been, but if she had stayed, she would have been famous or infamous, but the movie would have been completely different in tone. The Beals character would have really danced like a showgirl, with class, style, and hot, hot, hot. There would have been no running in place, no aerobics, fitness class moves with no rhythm or funk. Alas, we shall never know how it would have turned out. Jennifer Beals would have still needed a dance double, though, for the moves I'm talking about. If you want to know who the choreographer I'm talking about is, ask Jennifer Grey. She knew her quite well, took her class for years.",,Anonymous,Music

"Tacky, outdated 80's dance flick falls flat in the test of time.","The dance flick- after the professional death of the musical, the `dance' genre took over in the late 70's with `Saturday Night Fever'. Of course the main problem with this new type of movie was the fact that the music would soon become outdated as times and attitudes went by. And `Flashdance' is the epitome of this doomed genre. Cheesy music, tacky clothes, big hair, fuzzy images- 80's enthusiasts only.In fact the only times in which this is actually good is when Irene Cara's Oscar winning song swoops onto the soundtrack. So, a good 90% of `Flashdance' is absolute drivel. The limp narrative bumbles along and is weaker than one would have imagined. Perhaps it would have been a better picture had it focused on the protagonist and she alone. But too much attention is put on supporting characters and their boring stories.Weak, unimaginative, thoroughly formulaic directing styles don't help matters either. To put it as bluntly as possible, there is little if anything good about this perceptibly low-budget film. The main character (Alex) isn't interesting or unusual enough to be worthy of anything more than a passive attention. Alex is nicely, though not brilliantly, portrayed by Jennifer Beals. The (then) 18-year-old actress shows talent but has completely wasted her potential on made-for TV movies ever since. Meanwhile, the unrecognisable supporting players, a who's who of `Where are they now?' are the cinematic equivalent of walking, talking clichés. I could go into depth about how mediocre they are, but I just couldn't be bothered.If you have photosensitive epilepsy, I advise you to stay away from `Flashdance'. You will either have a seizure or you won't make it out alive. One scene carries on with gratuitous strobe lighting for what seems like 10 minutes. Even if you're not an epileptic, you should stay away. Of course it eventually dances its way to a feel-good end that was semi-parodied in that Geri Halliwell music video. It leaves a good-taste, but doesn't compensate for the unforgivable dross that proceeds.A flat, shallow effort from everyone involved, the only saving grace is an above average turn from Jennifer Beals and Irene Cara's `What a Feeling'. I could go on for another while, but I'll summarise with this statement. `Flashdance' is a near dancing disaster. My IMDb rating: 3.8/10.",,Anonymous,Music

It joins the ranks of films such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club, Footloose, Dirty Dancing or the other classics by Adrian Lyne such as 9 1/2 Weeks.The camera, the scenes, everything about this film is iconic, so you can forgive the simple story.You should always look at films in the context of the time.

Memorable images and a few catchy tunes do not a good film make,"Alex works at a steel plant during the day and as an exotic dancer in the evenings to try and make money to get by.  Her ultimate dream though is to get into an exclusive dance school and train to become one of the top ballet dancers.  Even though it seems impossible her boyfriend encourages her and she trains hard and sticks at it to make her dream come true.The reasons why this film was so popular and has remained so well known are bewildering to me.  The film's main selling points are the few catchy tunes (`what a feeling' being the most memorable) and pop music video images, these are the things that have stuck in the mind (and been repeated in other music videos) but the film itself lacks anything of substance whatsoever.The plot is very weak.  Another user compared it to Saturday Night Fever with the genders swapped but that is just unfair, Flashdance has no plot to speak of and, when it does try to act events and depth to the characters it just doesn't work.  Instead it frequently just falls back on dance numbers in the strip club or footage to music of Alex welding or somewhat.  The striptease dances are a total joke - I'm not sure what they were seen as then, but now, when lapdance clubs are the mainstream for men and women, the over-designed things that go on in the club here are just silly and certainly wouldn't draw the club of working men that supposedly pack the place out.Beals is pretty poor apart from looking good semi-dressed.  As a welder she looks so out of place it's funny, and delivering her lines she feels just as unnatural.  I would love to say that she did such a good job dancing but a lot of that was picked up by Marine Jahan (who clearly didn't do enough for a credit!).  None of the rest of the cast make any impression at all - Nouri's boyfriend is bland and all the rest are working class clichés to a man.Overall this film is all style and no substance whatsoever.  Why it was so successful or has remained so well known is a mystery but must be down to a few memorable scenes that stick in the mind and work as music videos rather than anything else.  If you haven't seen this film then what would probably be preferable for you is to track down the video for Jennifer Lopez's `I'm Glad' (she released it on dvd single) - it is basically the film of Flashdance with all the memorable scenes put into a montage for the one song.  It is shorter than the film, sexier than the film and has almost as much substance.",,Anonymous,Music

Time changed my view on this one,"OK, being a child of the '80s, of course I loved the movie the first few times I saw it. Suspension of disbelief is much easier at 13. Now, being 30, I just rewatched it, and my perspective is quite different.How did I not notice before that the male lead ""Nick"" is a total stalker?!?!?! He first hires a guy to find out who ""Alex"" is after he sees her dancing. He hunts her down at her job at the steel mill, and she brushes him off. Not convinced, he waits for her outside the bar where she dances at night, and when she refuses a ride from him, he follows her home. After they get together, he watches her go into the Ballet Company, and even after she tells him to go to hell, he finds out where her audition is, kidnaps her dog, and waits outside the building for her. OK, that is just creepy.Adding to the creepiness is that she is only 18! 18 YEARS OLD!!!! He's like 40 something. It's almost like a weird father/daughter thing going on. EEEWWWWW.",,Anonymous,Music
Biel Hits All the Right Notes,"Flashdance (1983)** 1/2 (out of 4)A tough Pittsburgh girl (Jennifer Beals) works as a welder by day and an exotic dancer by night so that she can save up enough money to try and get into a ballet school, which is her dream. The young woman has hopes and dreams for the future but she feels that her background might keep her out of such a high class school. It's easy to see why FLASHDANCE was such a hit when it was released as it has the early 80's written all over it. Director Adrian Lyne adds some style and flash to the picture but the screenplay is pretty much full of clichés and is way too predictable from start to finish. With that said, Lyne at least helps keep the film moving at a good pace thanks to the style he adds to everything. The film at least offers up some great cinematography and there's no doubt that the director does a nice job during the dance sequences. The editing and pacing to the sequences bring out the style and help make them quite memorable. Another benefit to the film is the performance from Beals who is quite believable int he role. I thought she perfectly nailed the part both physically as well as mentally. I must admit that during the final act I was really turned off by the character herself but at the same time Beals really made you believe and feel for this person. I think this is where the screenplay does something right in the fact that the character is well detailed. What I didn't care about was the rather hockey love story with her boss, the predictable relationship with the elderly woman and the preaching to her friend subplot. There's quite a bit going on in this film and a lot of it is just one giant cliché and it's way too predictable for its own good. I'm certainly not expecting Bergman out of a mainstream flick but a little drama would have been nice. Still, there's no question that the film has its appeal and is worth watching.",,Anonymous,Music

The idea is better then the movie itself.,"Flashdance is about as dated as you can get. The problem with this movie as i've found is that the story itself is rather flat in certain areas. Also, you have to really like the music featured in this movie, because if you don't, being that there's SO MUCH of that type of music it maybe irritating.I did like this when I was a kid moderately,  but not for the story at all-for the music. But now, that music just seems dated as anything and I really am not into Flashdance at all anymore.There is nothing wrong with the movie. But it can't touch something like Saturday night fever(it's been compared to that). I wouldn't call Flashdance a classic, not really and the movie lacks the electricity of a ""saturday night fever"". It is an empowering movie though and shows if you have a dream-never give up. But I did give up on repeated viewings of this, didn't age well with me and I'd give it a 5 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Music

Tacking on a last dance,"It takes practice to probe ourselves for insight of how we felt about something, it's not easy. Easier to numb ourselves, watch and forget it afterwards, but in this way we never really know anything. This is also in a roundabout way the point behind musicals, easy to be numbed, takes practice to probe and push yourself to create something that is true.The enemy of the protagonist in the musical or dance film then is compromise, mediocrity. It's the nagging worry that life will never amount to something, it will be drowned in routine—the antidote is dance, love, staging the circumstances that will permit purity of expression. In the musical this usually took the shape of showmen and women fighting to stage a show that sublimates the difficulties, this is also the case here, but with a twist.A final show is promised early on, a dance audition that makes or breaks her future (she thinks), failing which she's going to become just another 9 to 5 person chasing after the next bill. The place is glum Pittsburgh, she works in a factory by day. Around her we see the people who have been numbed by failure, lost their color—the failed comedian, her ice-rink dancer friend who ends up on the floor of a sleazy titty bar after a bad performance.They could have done something here. A bleak urban landscape instead of Broadway, the factory as the place where self is constructed to be only another cog in the machine—and yet in this place, dance, expression, sexuality. Her latenight show (she's an exotic dancer by night) struggling to find purity and truth in the midst of cheap thrills, still exhilarating in spite of how viewers consume it. Can dance become routine? Does it matter how the viewers see it?Their twist was something else. The final show is always postponed and the fight to stage it and dream to be someone are dredged from a pseudo Cassavetes desperation about life instead of using the snappy cadence of the musical. A bit of dance in the beginning and end and the whole middle is an hour of wallowing. The idea must have been, first make the viewer bleed, serve us 'reality' instead of a musical fairytale.But what I see is no less of a fairytale.A materialism about the difficulties but when it comes to the last release, the dance audition, we go back to the snappy, idealized Hollywood dance we expected all along. She triumphs of course. An awestruck committee member claps childishly at how good. The slice- of-life was merely an idealized style, a trope rather than commitment, so that it manages in one swoop to kill both the fun and the honesty. Terrible.",,Anonymous,Music
Passable musical,"I don't remember watching Flashdance(It's a chick flick right) but my opinion is pretty much on par with the general consensus- Flashdance is a perfect example of a movie that's better known for its impact on pop culture than for what exists on celluloid. It is not a particularly good film, nor is it memorable on its cinematic merits. It proffers cheesy drama, amateurish acting, and a staple fairy tale plot. But it was a huge success. Part of that had to do with the music - the soundtrack album was amazingly successful. The movie became a pop culture touchstone, much like Saturday Night Fever in the late '70s and Dirty Dancing in the late '80s. With the Musical all-but-dead in this era, melodramas containing song-and-dance elements were able to capitalize on the opening. Given Flashdance's popularity in 1983 and its continuing name recognition during the quarter-century since its release, it's surprising that Hollywood has not yet gotten around to remaking it. It's probably only a matter of time. Only for musical lovers.",,Anonymous,Music
