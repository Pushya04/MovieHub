"Thrilling story about loyalty , friendship and political intrigue during the horrible war in Cambodia","Thoughtful and thought-provoking war-drama based on the memoirs of N.Y. Times correspondent named Sidney (Sam Waterston) and his relationship to journalist assistant and guide named Pran (Haing S Ngor ) . Extraordinary feature debut for Ngor who won Best Supporting Actor Academy Award . Haing S. Ngor a real-life doctor who had never acted before and who lived through the deeds depicted at the movie , he became the first Southeast Asian , and the first Buddhist , to win an Oscar ; furthermore also first film for John Malkovich who gives an awesome portrayal as an intrepid photographer . Ngor's own experiences (in real life he lived Cambodian war ) echoed those of his character and usually played Vietnam roles (Tortures of war, Heaven and Earth , In love and war , Vietnam Texas , Eastern condor) until his violent death by an Asian band . This exciting story depicts the war chaos , Cambodian turmoil and primal bloodletting , but most of the movie is a shattering re-creation of hell on Earth . Marvellous cinematography by Chris Menges who also deservedly won Academy Award and filmed in Phuket , Railway Hotel , Hua Hin, Thailand and Royal York Hotel , Toronto, Ontario, Canada . Screeching and sensitive musical score by Mike Oldfield that accompanies perfectly to the film . Roland Joffe's direction shows a generally sure-hand with a bit of melodrama at the end . Alain Resnais's seminal documentary ¨Nuit et Brouillard (1955)¨ was a touch-point for both director Roland Joffé and prestigious producer David Puttnam when they were preparing this magnificent movie .This excellent movie contains a relentless criticism to Pol Pot regime , but also US and an exact description about historic events . In power , the Khmer Rouge carried out a radical program that included isolating the country from foreign influence, closing schools, hospitals and factories, abolishing banking, finance and currency, outlawing all religions, confiscating all private property and relocating people from urban areas to collective farms where forced labor was widespread. The purpose of this policy was to turn Cambodians into ""Old People"" through agricultural labor. These actions resulted in massive deaths through executions, work exhaustion, illness, and starvation. In Phnom Penh and other cities, the Khmer Rouge told residents that they would be moved only about ""two or three kilometers"" outside the city and would return in ""two or three days."" Some witnesses say they were told that the evacuation was because of the ""threat of American bombing"" and that they did not have to lock their houses since the Khmer Rouge would ""take care of everything"" until they returned.Money was abolished, books were burned, teachers, merchants, and almost the entire intellectual elite of the country were murdered, to make the agricultural communism, as Pol Pot envisioned it, a reality. The planned relocation to the countryside resulted in the complete halt of almost all economic activity: even schools and hospitals were closed, as well as banks, and industrial and service companies.During their four years in power, the Khmer Rouge overworked and starved the population, at the same time executing selected groups who had the potential to undermine the new state (including intellectuals or even those that had stereotypical signs of learning, such as glasses) and killing many others for even breaching minor rules . The Khmer Rouge forced people to work for 12 hours non-stop, without adequate rest or food. They did not believe in western medicine but instead favoured traditional peasant medicine; many died as a result. Family relationships not sanctioned by the state were also banned, and family members could be put to death for communicating with each other. In any case, family members were often relocated to different parts of the country with all postal and telephone services abolished. They committed crimes against humanity , the Khmer Rouge government arrested, tortured and eventually executed anyone suspected of belonging to several categories of supposed ""enemies"". Today, examples of the torture methods used by the Khmer Rouge can be seen at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. The museum occupies the former grounds of a high school turned prison camp that was operated by Khang Khek Ieu, more commonly known as ""Comrade Duch"". Some 17,000 people passed through this centre before they were taken to sites (also known as The Killing Fields), outside Phnom Penh where most were executed (mainly by pickaxes to save bullets) and buried in mass graves . Of the thousands who entered the Tuol Sleng Centre (also known as S-21), only twelve are known to have survived.",9.0,Anonymous,History
It's not about Vietnam folks!,"I've read only 20 comments so far, and it was surprising to learn that some viewers (namely 'gregory.messine' and 'RBarse', both of US of A ) think it's set in Vietnam. Come on lads, I've heard that education in America is not great but I didn't expect it to be so bad. Have you ever opened an atlas. Maybe the sound in your theater didn't work or sth. THIS FILM IS ABOUT A WAR IN CAMBODIA. Cambodia is a neighbour of Vietnam. It's set in 1973-79, just after the Vietnam War!!!!!Anyway, back to movie. It's brilliant, not too sentimental, not too cold. The acting is simply marvellous (to be honest I didn't know any of the actors except for Malkovich), cinematography is a touch of genius. Some people complained about the score. Well I can agree, that the lyrics of ""Imagine"" in the context sound like a Khmer Rouge anthem, but the rest is beautiful (Oldfield did a good job).The scene when Schanberg watches some TV programme about the Cambodian War while listening to Puccini's opera is so moving, just like the sight of thousands of Cambodians being ""evacuated"" by the Khmer out of Phnom Pehn.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Honest, Worthwhile film-making...","I saw this film a while back and just saw it again on TV. If you are interested in seeing a great, tense drama this is a good start. Honest and unapologetic directing from Roland Joffe and fine performances from Sam Waterston & John Malkovich (plus nicely played small parts by Craig T. Nelson & Spalding Gray.) Above all of them, however, is Haing S. Ngor as Dith Pran, the Cambodian journalist assisting the New York Times reporter played by Waterston during the conflicts in Cambodia around the time of the Vietnam war. This was Ngor's first film and had no previous acting experience. Quite a performance from Ngor, earning a well deserved Academy Award. Interesting note, Ngor himself led a very similar life to his character. Wonderfully touching film, you should see it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"All-time, no-holds-barred, 100% favourite","I can't put my finger on exactly what it is about this film that gets to me so much, but it is THE most haunting, emotional film experience... and I've only ever seen it on video.Excellent performances from Waterston, Ngor and Malkovich.  A brilliant score by Mike Oldfield.  Scenes of high emotion, tension, drama, horror and even one or two pieces of light relief (well, it has got Australia's Graham Kennedy of comedy fame).The stand-out scenes for mine are those in the French Embassy; I can never watch the final scene from this sequence with a dry eye.An excellent film and the soundtrack is not a bad investment either.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Joffe's best work to date,"Based on the Khmer Rouge revolution in Cambodia, this is an excellent tale of hardship and friendship. Basically director Roland Joffe` did an wonderful job in exposing the detailed facts so simply in the film that you believe that you are in that time in person. The two actors, Sam Waterson and Haing Ngor both displayed godlike pieces of acting. It's unfortunate Waterson couldn't join Ngor in Academy Awards. In addition, the director's credit is to highlight both the characters' points of view. That's why the movie became so interesting to watch. John Malkovich brought out a fine performance as a photographer.In the course of the story of adventures of the two men, the film also has vivid descriptions of the public life during the war. Several detailed scenes of war violence are presented here so indifferently that you are bound to be convinced about its historical accuracy. Here we find the magical cinematography of Chris Menges. Again, during the time of Dith Pran's suffering, it never seemed that the director is showing too much.One of the most important, and my favorite, aspects of the film is its ending. You cannot imagine of a better alternative of this happiest ending possible in a war drama. And with the fantastic use of Lennon's ""imagine"", it has got to an enormous height of perfection. 5/5.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The best war film ever made.,"Rating: **** Out of ****Hard to say, but I believe when it comes to the war genre, The Killing Fields manages to edge out even Saving Private Ryan, and without a doubt, there's no better war film out there that's done a better job of capturing the realistic details and emotional loss of the time period (that being, the 70's in Cambodia/Vietnam).Thus, I've always considered it a little odd that no one I know has even heard of this film. When lists of the greatest war films are decided, I don't believe I've ever seen this film crack any list. And the reason is simple: The Killing Fields is often ignored because it doesn't come from a soldier's point of view, and neither does it feature any adrenaline-pumping battle sequences. The fact that a strong portion of the film (about 2/5's) comes entirely from a Cambodian man's viewpoint might throw off a few viewers here and there. And yet, the film does just as fine a job as any anti-war film in creating a frightenining, chaotic world.The performances all around superb without exception. Haing S. Ngor, who was tragically killed a few years ago, delivers a riveting, emotionally wrenching turn as the guide who is trapped in Cambodia and forced to fight for his life. He deservingly won the Oscar, though it's a shame he was snubbed for the best actor award. Inarguably, he's the film's central character and he also has more screen time than top-billed Sam Waterston. Despite my complaint on that matter, Waterston is also excellent as the journalist with a guilty conscience.The Killing Fields is a suspenseful and exhilarating experience, a journey through an apocalyptic landscape that features one shocking image after another. Watch, and you'll see why the film is so acclaimed.",,Anonymous,History
The Ultimate Ugly American Movie,"Oh, this brings me back alright. It was the last days of 1984, and earnest college students like me had much to talk about. Wasn't it wonderful that Walter Mondale had chosen a strong woman like Geraldine Ferraro to be his running mate, and wouldn't the Democrats sweep the Northeast at least for that brave move? Does buying a Coke at the local convenience store signal support for the apartheid government in South Africa? Did anyone else see that amazing film about the human price of American involvement in Southeast Asia?It's nearly 20 years later, and I've managed to shake the ill effects of my youthful liberalism easily enough in most cases. This film, however, packs the kind of punch that isn't explained away by political trendiness.""The Killing Fields"" is a great film that tries and succeeds in capturing much of the carnage and tragedy of Cambodia as the radicalized Khmer Rouge and the U.S.-backed regime of Lon Nol controlling Phnom Penh clash in a fight to the death to be/not be the next domino in the Communist rollover in Southeast Asia. By particularizing the conflict to that of the true-life relationship of two men, New York Times reporter Syndey Schanberg and his Cambodian apprentice and aide-de-camp, Dith Pran, the film forces a level of empathy that is at once uncomfortable and absorbing. It is possible to walk away from this film hating the manipulation, the America-bashing, the easy liberal guilt. But it's impossible to walk away from the human experience borne witness to before the movie's done, if one has any pretense of being human, and that's its great strength.Oh, it's polemical alright. We hear comments about how the Khmer Rouge's excesses were the direct result of Nixon's secret bombing campaign. (U.S. Counsel: ""After what the Khmer Rouge have been through, I don't think they'll be exactly affectionate toward Westerners."" Schanberg: ""Maybe we underestimated the anger $7 billion in bombing would unleash."") It makes its point, absolves Pol Pot and condemns Kissinger with the same broad brush, and it feels a bit jaded and hollow for that, but I don't know. Schanberg betrays the attitudes of a knee-jerk liberal, and I outgrew that, and maybe I feel superior for that, but Schanberg had AK-47s pointed at his head by 12-year-old brainwashed boys, and I didn't, so shut up already, know what I mean?The performances are incredible in their verisimilitude, particularly the leads. Sam Waterson burns with righteous anger as Schanberg, and I like his performance for what it is and how he creates that extra level of tension, but he's a butterfly compared to the condor that's Dr. Haing S. Ngor, one of the Academy's most obscure best supporting actor recipients (there was even a joke about it in an episode of ""The Simpsons"") but someone who didn't just walk the walk. He relived his experience surviving a holocaust that was, per square mile, even more savage than the Holocaust itself. The fact he won a Best Supporting Actor award (Waterson instead was nominated for Best Actor, and lost to F. Murray Abraham for ""Amadeus"") is one of those perversities of film history, given he carries more of the film than Waterson (who slinks to the background two-thirds of the way in) but also that he personalizes the story in a way that makes the incomprehensible immediate and involving.We lost Ngor to a senseless murder a few years ago, and have little left to explain what was going through his mind as he relived an experience that cost him his wife and child when he actually lived through it. Roland Joffe does a nice job in the DVD commentary, though, a commentary I put up there with P. T. Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" and William Peter Blatty's ""The Ninth Configuration"" for being worth the price of the DVD and then some by itself. He recalls Ngor's reaction to one child actress whose hard face in enacting a scene convinced Ngor she wasn't just pretending to be Khmer Rouge, and Ngor's request that Joffe participate in one critical scene by muttering real torments Ngor suffered at the hands of the ""KR"" as a way of enhancing his performance. At one point, trying to convince him to come aboard, Joffe said something about Ngor owing it to his country to bear witness to his story, and that of Dith Pran, and that did the trick, though Joffe seems to wonder if the same sort of manipulation Schanberg pulled on Pran wasn't going on here, too.It's a great movie because it doesn't shy away from uncomfortable truths, because it never loses sight of the human dimension, and because it gave a pretense of understanding to one of the great human traumas after World War II. We never wallow in gore, but the cost of this war is always with us while we watch. The experience is both endurable and humiliating.I just wish they reshot that ending, with ""Imagine."" Joffe in his commentary even notes the lyrics are the sort of thing Pol Pot would have gone along with. It feels forced. Did Yoko Ono give her approval after they explained the scene her dead husband's song would appear in, or after they told her the first nasty execution scene would be shot while ""Band On The Run"" issued forth from a soldier's radio?A great movie, of an awful moment in human history. If we have any chance of overcoming man's sorry past, it will be because movies like this one get made once in a while.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Irony!,"This is a good film. You should watch it. It starts a bit choppy, but really gets good as it goes, and tells an excellent true story (as close to true as you ever get from Hollywood films, I'm sure).But there's something we need to talk about, and it's really pretty bad. At the end of the film we get updates about some of the real people from the story, as well as the ""current"" situation in Cambodia (circa 1984).And playing over all of it is John Lennon's anthem and love song to Communism, ""Imagine."" Seriously. What the hell was director Joffe thinking? This is literally a story about Communists committing one of the worst genocides in human history, 1.5-2 million people killed, roughly 25% of the entire population of Cambodia, and they decided that the appropriate song to play as they describe the genocide is a love song to the very Communists who were responsible for killing all those people?It's rare that words fail me, but I'm not sure what else I could say about this. How do you make a film drawing attention to (yet another) Communist genocide, and then play a pro-Communist anthem over the closing shots? Talk about mixed-messaging. This has got to be the most bizarre and perplexing choice in film history.",6.0,Anonymous,History
poignant,"I watched this movie with my father shortly after it came out on video, so I would have been only 9 or 10 at the time. I did not see it again until this year, but I could still remember the scene of a lone man stumbling across a field strewn with the skeletons of his countrymen. Watching it again was both a moving and a worthwhile experience.There are so many scenes which will, as the movie case says, haunt the viewer long after watching. The scene already mentioned, Waterston and Ngor wandering through the remains of the homes of Cambodian civilians destroyed by American bombs, a little girl, her hands over her ears, crying and screaming, surrounded by explosions and gunfire.The acting performances are top notch all round, particularly, of course, by Dr. Ngor. The team of Joffe and Menges is superb, as they also are in The Mission. Both films are in my video library.As an aside, whatever happened to Joffe? Super Mario Brothers? The Scarlet Letter? The Mission and The Killing Fields are such rich, well-crafted films. It's a shame that actors and directors are pulled towards Hollywood. Artistic integrity is priceless. Perhaps that's why it's given away by so many.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Review,"The Killing Fields is one of the most influential films of the 20th century. Its provocative and dangerous subject matter stresses the importance of communication and the freedom to communicate. Based on the Khmer Rouge occupation and genocide of Cambodia in the 1970's, the film tells the story of two men, catapulted into chaos and peril.The movie is first and foremost, a historical account. The events are based off the true story of Dith Pran and Sydney Schanberg. Given that I had not known much about the Cambodian genocide of the 1970's prior to seeing this film, I must herald the piece as a successful feat of cinematography that served as both informational as well as inspirational. The film is believable, realistic, and heart wrenching. I immediately felt for the two main characters as they quickly exchanged trust and fell victim to the powers of political violence. While it is slightly romanticized, The Killing Fields still manages to produce a message with real life implications.",,Anonymous,History
masterpiece and important history,"In 1973, New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) goes to cover the war in Cambodia with Dith Pran as his interpreter. They cover the war along side other journalists like Al Rockoff (John Malkovich) and Jon Swain (Julian Sands). A military adviser (Craig T. Nelson) tries to cover up an accidental American B-52 bombing of an innocent town. Eventually the Khmer Rouge threatens to overrun the country. Dith Pran decides to stay despite the danger while his family leaves. After the fall, Phnom Penh is evacuated and the group finds refuge in the French embassy. The foreigners are allowed to go home but Dith Pran and the locals are not so lucky.Director Roland Joffé creates a masterpiece. It is shockingly intense without warning. It is deep emotionally. He captures the desperate instability and the unknowable fear of the fall of the capital. The chaos and the random brutality is perfect. The acting is superb. Developing a picture has never been more intense. Then the movie does the unthinkable. It hands over the lead and the movie to a no name amateur Cambodian actor. The great surprise is that the movie is as compelling as ever. This is a historical biopic masterpiece from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,History
You have to watch this film,"It must be impossible for anyone not to be affected by this film. Each and every component combines together to form not only a hard-hitting political statement, but also a focus on a deep and pure friendship.Images of the injured, bloodied, distraught and destitute, leave lasting effects and obviously prove uncomfortable to watch sometimes, but they put us in the positions of the journalists who were stepping into the war zone of Cambodia at the time. In contrast, there is the compelling scene in which Sydney Schanberg plays video footage of Nixon blatantly lying about America's involvement in Cambodia and also shows Cambodians who have been injured by the fighting. While this still evokes feelings of sadness, it stirs up more angry emotions aimed at the dishonesty of the government, and, if looking at it from a wider perspective, most politicians. This is one of The Killing Fields' great strengths - its ability to make us feel a range of emotions throughout the course of the film.At no point is there any attempt to glamorise the subject matter or try and put a Hollywood spin on it. For instance, when the group of journalists are captured by the Khmer Rouge and forced into the back of the tank, the close-ups show the sweat and fear on their faces in the near darkness, with no wisecracking lines or dramatic music, just the sounds of the tank travelling to an unknown destination.The music moves away from the traditional sweeping classical score (apart from the hauntingly beautiful main theme) and relies heavily on synths and other electronic sounds. This actually works to great effect - possibly better than a classical soundtrack would - emphasising the confusion and fear of the people and the drama of the fighting. However it is John Lennon's Imagine, played in the final scene, that encapsulates the message of the film and provides a subtle yet powerful ending.All the cast excel but it's Sam Waterston and Haing Ngor who particularly shine and make their characters' relationship seem completely believable. It would have been ridiculous to have asked Ngor to put any more into his performance, due to his own experiences under the Khmer Rouge regime.To put it simply, you really must watch this film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Good, but far from perfect","After finally seeing this film, which I wanted to watch for many years now, I'm actually not entirely positive about it. On the one hand, it's based on a real story worth being told and overall a solid drama.That said, I couldn't help myself but notice some flaws that keep THE KILLING FIELDS from being a truly great film. The score in particular is just awful and mostly out of place. There are several serious scenes within the film that are suddenly accompanied by melodramatic and at times almost goofy music and thus ruined. Aside from that, I didn't find the setup for the friendship between the protagonists particularly convincing. The American journalist Schanberg treats Dith Pran like his employee for the first hour of the film. Only when they are separated emotions suddenly run wild and the viewer has to believe in this profound friendship. Besides, the infamous ""killing fields"" are in the film for approximately ten minutes. Joffé could have definitely laid more focus upon this horrifying part of the story.Nevertheless, I suggest seeing THE KILLING FIELDS - not least because of it being one of only a hand full of films covering the Khmer Rouge subject.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Powerful, Important Film","I've finally seen The Killing Fields, more than 20 years after it was originally released.This is one of the most powerful, important films ever made. It is so important, now as ever, for everyone to understand what evil truly is. This movie shows evil in its worst form: the form of mass murder thinly disguised as ideological cleansing.What makes this film so special is not only the bare-faced method of its delivery (including some horrid shots of the dumping grounds of the murdered), but the way the film keeps a decidedly Southeast Asian feel. The filmmakers worked to keep that style, in the scenery, the music, the set design, and, most importantly, by keeping the Cambodian journalist front-and-center in most scenes. In fact, the only time the film doesn't work is when it focuses on the New York Times reporter (the main reason I give this film a 9 instead of a 10 are the pace-stealing scenes stateside). Far too often we only see such stories from our own viewpoint, it's incredibly refreshing (and bold) to film a story like this from the viewpoint of the foreign country whose ruin was precipitated by the careless policies of our own government.Wonderfully filmed, well acted, brilliantly scripted, The Killing Fields is a timeless, important classic. A must see for any student of history or film.9 out of 10 Barky",9.0,Anonymous,History
Better as a documentary than a movie,"I myself have been to Cambodia, I've seen some of these locations, I've looked at piles of skulls preserved from the genocide done by the Khmer Rouge. This has made me very interested in the workings of Pol Pot and the history of these atrocities, and I have been looking forward to watching this movie for some time.When I finally did see this movie I was relatively disappointed, although I was intrigued by seeing what I had studied put to film, the movie was occasionally hard to follow and overall disappointing. If it had been a documentary I would have loved it, but it seems to fall by movie standards. Yes, it is about a very sensitive subject and gets a very important message about the terrible acts committed by man, but movies require more than just that for a great review, and I don't think the Killing Fields quite delivers.

A harrowing tale of courage,"""Cambodia is the Nixon Doctrine in its purest form."" - Dick Nixon
""People starve, but we must not grow food."" - Dith Pran on the Angka (Pol Pot's regime)Gut-wrenching stuff. A tale of friendship, the senseless carnage of war, the importance of a free press, the sins of America, and the cruelty of communism under Pol Pot. Mostly it shows incredible courage set to human tragedy and the jaw-dropping scenery of Cambodia. The cinematography is sublime, the gore, often to innocent people and their kids, is horrifying.As moving as the film is, I wish it had been told completely from the POV of Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor), the Cambodian translator/journalist who ends up imprisoned after his family and Western journalists escape (including those played by Sam Waterston and John Malkovich). I would have liked to have seen his family life before the war, the dialogue in Khmer subtitled, and a little more Cambodian context. The first half of the film is certainly good, but suffers because of its attention on the Western journalists.However, it begins soaring at about the 90 minute point when Waterston is sitting in his NY apartment listening to Nessun Dorma from Puccini's Turnadot, and then cuts to Pran toiling in the mud with other captives at gunpoint. Those moments gave me goosebumps. We then see Pran suffering at the hands of brainwashed kids who are toting weapons and putting the populace through reeducation camps, and it's gripping. I can think of few better scenes that depict the horror of war and genocide than when he stumbles through that endless field of skulls and bones. Whenever the film focused on Waterston or Malkovich, such as that silly argument they have in the bathroom, my interest waned a bit, even though I admired the courage of the characters and their convictions.That second half overall is brilliant though, and it's inspiring that it's a true story, with Pran ultimately joining his friend at The New York Times. That last line, coming from a guy who has been through hell, is stunning: ""Nothing to forgive, Sydney. Nothing."" It's too bad it's set to John Lennon's Imagine; as fantastic as that song is (probably my all-time favorite), it's misplaced here.",8.0,Anonymous,History
What should be moving is steeped in cheese.,"What was taken away after a viewing of The Killing Fields is not any sort of empathy with those poor Cambodians or the plight of Dith Pran, but a genuine hatred of Roland Joffe for believing his audience is made up of moronic dolts so ignorant and unsophisticated that they need to be told that the insanity and murder on display is a very bad thing. Really, thank god for the 30 inserts of crying children while overpowering sadness-score swells exponentially. Feel bad! You must FEEL BAD FOR THEM! Joffe's narcissism viciously attacks us at every turn with how goddamn important he knows this film is. It's brutal and insulting.This is a shame, as there are some skillfully choreographed sequences where our protagonists are shuffled from place to place in total confusion as to the situation. These contain little to no dialogue and articulate a great deal through imagery. Of course there is the outrageously bizarre musical accompaniment that deflates any interest in the scenes. It's as if Joffe hired Trent Reznor and Danny Elfman and told them to meet somewhere in the middle. The much hyped performance of Haing S. Ngor is not Earth shattering but definitely impressive, especially as a non actor who totally out-acts the rest of the cast. The tragedy is that as a man who actually survived all the misery we see in this film, he deserved to be in a far better portrayal of the insanity the Khmer Rouge put Cambodia through. All we learn about the calamitous conflict is that ""it sucked."" Granted, the focus of this film is on the characters of the reporters, but the audience should know a bit about what they are seeing. The Khmer Rouge appears like a magical force that simply showed up and took over. This might be asking for too much of a different film, but it seems necessary for something that clearly wants to be the total embodiment of the Cambodian conflict. A film that bastardizes John Lennon's ""Imagine"" in such a horrific, tug-at-the-heart-strings fashion deserves no such moniker. It's an ending so overdone and steeped in cheese that all in the audience will cry, but not for the intended reason.",4.0,Anonymous,History
The Killing Fields (1984),"Directed by Roland Joffé. Starring Sam Waterston, Haing S. Ngor, John Malkovich, Craig T. Nelson, Julian Sands, Spalding Gray, Athol Fugard, Bill Patterson, Monirak Sisowath, Graham Kennedy. (R)Frightening, powerful true story based on American journalist Sydney Schamberg's memoirs, ""The Death and Life of Dith Pran,"" focusing on the rise of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia toward the end of the Vietnam War, depicting not only his experiences in escaping the wartorn region but also the agonizing hardships suffered by his friend and fellow journalist, Dith Phan (Ngor). A gut-wrenching film, but also one about the triumph of the human spirit; there may not be a dry eye in the house when John Lennon's ""Imagine"" is fittingly played over the final scene. A non-professional when he was cast, Ngor lived through similar events in his own life (with an even more harrowing outcome), and he's pretty much perfect in his Oscar-winning role. Long and occasionally pedantic (especially in some of the scenes with Waterson in the second half) but gripping all the same. Also won Academy Awards for its editing and photography.88/100",9.0,Anonymous,History
My mother and her friend interviewed Dith Pran.,"When I was seven, my mother and her friend were working on a radio project about the Cambodian genocide, and they went to New York to interview Dith Pran. Through all of this, I learned about Cambodia. It wasn't until I was fifteen that I saw ""The Killing Fields"", and I was horrified at the Khmer Rouge's brutality. You can't even begin to imagine the awful things that they did until you see the movie.I also read Haing Ngor's autobiography ""A Cambodian Odyssey"". What he experienced was basically the same as what ""The Killing Fields"" portrays. But the really surprising part is that of all the groups who were in power in Cambodia during Haing Ngor's life there, the Khmer Rouge were the most honest. The French were the colonizers, Prince Sihanouk was a royalist who suppressed the insurgent movements, Lon Nol was a military ruler installed by the CIA, and then the Khmer Rouge. When US planes started bombing the countryside after Lon Nol came to power in 1970, the Khmer Rouge explained to the Cambodian people what was going on. So, the people began supporting the Khmer Rouge. So whether or not anyone wants to admit it, the Khmer Rouge were driven to their actions (although that's still no justification for their atrocities).The whole issue is so complex, that it takes a while to think about. But either way, you have to see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A shatteringly superb film,"It was hard for me to understand my own emotions after watching The Killing Fields. It was more like watching a documentary with actual events and people than a feature film. I was not able to say or even think anything straight, such was the impact that the film made. Hiang N'gor as Dith Pran lives rather than acts the role; I have never seen any on-screen or on-stage performance to match where the actor put his/her heart and soul into the role that he/she was playing. Before watching the film for the first time over 20 years ago, I had only a disjointed view of the horrors perpetuated by Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. But since then, I have visited the country, spoken to the people and can form a far better picture of what happened to it during those terrible years. The film depicts the atmosphere with stunning clarity, complemented by superbly imaginative camera-work and sound effects.

8/10 - Won't be forgotten (in a good way!),"Brief Summary: This movie depicts the story of one Dith Pran engulfed in one of the most tragic genocidal regimes to ever grace this planet. Pran has been caught in the Year Zero program, an attempt from the Khmer Rouge to wash away all preknowledge of societies and start everyone over as simple farmers. 'Wash away' is being used in a light context though, people such as doctors, students, teachers, etc are being killed. Children are being honoured and respected as their minds have not had the time to be corrupt by the western traditions. This explains the fact that many of the Khmer Rouge are in fact teenagers. We experience through our eyes the many horrid nightmares Dith experiences at the hands of these young tyrants.Review: A pretty typical story of an individual being caught in a 'wipeout' program much akin to the many holocaust films out there. What makes this film stand out is that it shows the viewers a different regime in history with very much the same effects on its population as the holocaust. The acting is superb by all degrees, in fact, the main actor Dith Pran (real name Haing S Ngor) has actually been through the horrors of Pol Pot's regime. In conclusion, a nice movie to watch just to see the power of a regime other than the Nazi's as well as a man who has to go through all of it.8/10 - Won't be forgotten (in a good way!)",,Anonymous,History
Harrowing,"The Killing fields takes the great tragedy of Cambodia and America's involvement in its fall all the more harrowing and comprehensible by centering its story telling on two men, one American and one Cambodian. The American is a journalist for (if I recall correctly) the New York Times, while the Cambodian is a local colleague name Dith Pran (played by a real-life escapee from the killing fields). The early stages noisily illustrate the collapse of Cambodia under the strain of American interference aimed at supporting the South Vietnamese government climaxing in the chaotic scenes at the American embassy as the American journalist tries and fails to get his colleague onto the helicopters to safety.The emotional heart of the movie is, however, the quieter second half as Pranh faces the deadly ""re-education camps"" and finally escapes to freedom.The Oscar winning cinematography is excellent but the film just fails to make it into the ""great"" category due to a slightly stilted script and (despite nominations for both leads - and a win for Haing Ngor as supporting actor, when he was actually lead) acting.Well worth your time and money, especially if you can see and hear it on the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Falls short, here's why..","This film fails to capture the true horror of the Cambodian war and collapse, and tells it from the perspective of a westerner caught in the middle, really falls short.

Tedious and Long-Winded,"The first hour or so feels like an overlong documentary about the war in Cambodia. There's no rhyme or reason to the narrative. It's just a random collection of scenes depicting a country in turmoil, and it becomes tedious. Joffe used the same heavy-handed and long-winded approach in his next film, ""The Mission."" Ngor is likable and sympathetic as the Cambodian journalist. The same can't be said of Waterston, who basically comes across as whiny, humorless, and self-centered as the New York Times writer whose memoir is the basis for the film. Malkovich is notable in only his second film. Surprisingly, there are long scenes with Cambodian dialog but no subtitles.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"A Very Great Film, Gets Better WIth Time","I first saw The Killing Fields when it came out. I recall watching it on the big screen and being totally enthralled and impressed. Everything about it has the ring of reality, with a gripping sense of the brutality and evil of war. I think the sequence in which the journalists are arrested by the Khmer Rouge is one of the greatest moments in film history. The brilliant soundtrack that sets the mood as are they held hostage, while Prahn pleads and bargains for their lives, is perfect. You feel as though you are right there with these men as they experience desperation amid the shocking violence of war. The palpable mood of gut-wrenching fear and tension that the actors project goes far beyond the standard Hollywood fare. This movie is a subtle collage of sound, sights, and emotion that is very rare. The cast is uniformly excellent, and in technical terms the direction,cinematography,editing, soundtrack, sets and screenplay are as good as it gets. It should have won Best Picture as far as I am concerned. Haing S. Ngor deserved his Oscar, and Sam Waterston should have won Best Actor too. This is an incredible story and an incredible movie. Too bad they don't make more like it. I've seen it many times over the years and it gets better with time. It's a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent film about friendship,"It is a mistake to see the killing fields simply as a war movie. The backdrop of the movie is a  violent revolution that was really sparked  by the U.S. bombing and making little incursions into the neutral country.  For most of the film this just explains how the true story of real life friends the movie was based on.The story is about an American journalist and his translator who basically gives his life for his story. The terror and genocide in Cambodia is not overlooked in this story indeed it fits perfectly aside this tale of friendship.The acting is great and the Cambodia doctor .. Turned actor gives a oscar winning performance. He never acted before but he did survive the Cambodia revolution even though his wife and child did not. Sam Waterston was great, And first time director Roland Joffe nailed this film by focusing on the friendship.Great Film and highly recommended!",7.0,Anonymous,History
Skimming over complex situation,"The Killing Fields were made in 1984 and as far as I can recall quite a lot was already known about the development of Khmer Rouge genocidal regime, its extreme communist ideology and ties to China. Strangely, none of that is reflected in the movie. For a person not very familiar with history of the region key elements of the plot must come as a surprise. Khmer Rouge appear like Deus ex machina and if not for the fact they occasionally wave refuse flags there is no mention of the genesis of the movement or driving ideology. Why they kill their compatriots? They just evicted evil foreigners, so why they would kill other Cambodians? Why they would hate journalists? Why they were attacked by Vietnamese? Weren't Vietnamese their communist brothers?Instead of giving us some background and heavens forbid deeper insight into the complex situation we are treated to a soppy story about a NYT journalist (who else!!), who sadly cuts rather unsympathetic figure as he will sacrifice friends if that benefits his career. This personal moral shortcoming doesn't stop him from moralizing about the US policy in the region. We are to believe that a journalist that doesn't speak a word of Khmer (nor French for that matter) and after brief stay in Cambodia would come up with a much better geopolitical strategy than all think tanks in Washington combined.Oddly enough the movie.ends with Lennon's ode to communism, which is as mawkish as the movie itself. As movie closing.credits roll one is left to wonder whether the anachronistically placed song (it was written in 1971) is supposed to reflect director's quite adoration for the ideology or a lament over communism's failings in practical implementations. What Lennon himself would think about it we will never know. I don't even know whether his personal enthusiasm for utopias was tempered by the news about genocide in Cambodia. He certainly lost much enthusiasm for extreme left causes after commercial (and probably artistic) failure of his.1972 political manifesto Some Time in New York City.",3.0,Anonymous,History

The cinematography is excellent.  First, Cambodia is photographed as almost a paradise.  Then, we see the horror of warfare, also stunningly photographed. It looked so realistic, that for a moment, I felt like it wasn't a movie, but a documentary.The acting is top notch as well, especially from Dr. Haing S. Ngor and John Malkovich (in his screen debut).Everyone needs to see this movie at least once.  Although it might be a little disturbing, the violence is not gratuitous.

"Good, but could have been so much better.","Let me count the ways:1. Better casting.Malkovich and Ngor are terrific, but surely they could have found a more compelling (not necessarily better, just more compelling) actor than Waterson to play the lead.2. Better score.What the %$&# was that? You know, I think ""Tubular Bells"" works well in *The Exorcist*, but they never should have let this guy score a whole movie. It's ugly and overwrought, and I swear to God that in places, it's over-explanatory character almost crosses the line into ""Mickey Mousing.""3. Better closing song.""Imagine""? ""I""-freaking-""MAGINE""?! The killing fields of Cambodia represent Lennon's idiotic totalitarian fantasies taken to their logical conclusion. This is what happens when you try to reshape human nature to fit an ideological mold. You can't do it, so you just end up killing everyone. The use of this song demonstrates that the filmmakers had no idea what the hell they were making a film about.4. More honesty.It might have behooved the filmmakers, when they were giving Sidney Schanberg (in the person of Waterston) free rein to spew his puerile blame-America-first leftism, to have acknowledged that Schanberg wrote pro-Khmer Rouge propaganda intended to convince the American people that a Communist takeover of Cambodia would be a very fine thing indeed (including, mere days before the Communist victory, a piece headline ""Indochina Without Americans: For Most, a Better Life"").5. Less racism.OK, Dith Pran wants to stay in Cambodia because he's a reporter and it's his job. But it's Schanberg's fault that Pran stays because...well, apparently because Pran's just an Asian who shouldn't be allowed to make his own decisions. I can't see any other reason why it's Schanberg's responsibility. Pran is a grown man.And I touched above on the film's blaming America for the Khmer Rouge atrocities. Apparently Asians can't be expected to know how to behave. If they kill millions of people, it can only be because of something Great White Father did.But for all that, I still recommend the film as a depiction of what Communism is in its essence--even if the filmmakers don't quite seem to have grasped it themselves.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Tough to watch, gripping and impeccable","I've liked Waterston since I first saw him, probably on Law & Order. There's only one possible exception in what I know of, as far as him being talented. This is the performance of his that I am most impressed by. Malkovich does great as always, and does not steal the show(which we know he could), does not take the attention away from the subject, where it is intended. Ngor has to be mentioned... he's fantastic. The Oscar was completely deserved. The plot is well-told and never stands still. The pacing is spot-on. The direction is effective and masterful. The shocks are all proper, not a single fake or cheap one among them. This is powerful, engaging and disturbing. The violence and blood is never gratuitous. I doubt anyone could sit through this and not be affected. It does not make for a pleasant viewing, but it is important and should be respected, not ignored. While there is some humor in this, it is seldom if ever a light experience. The script is well-written throughout.

The film grabs you early and takes you on a journey not necessarily comfortable but absolutely enthralling.

The Killing Fields,"""The Killing Fields"" is a film that is one of those unlucky ones, based on a premise so strong, but sadly, made in an era that churned out mediocre fare, perhaps! Set against the backdrop of the war-infested Cambodia, where Khmer Rouge had taken charge during the mid-70s, this is a story of those brave-heart journalists who made it back alive! And honestly, that is the only story this film tells! Khmer Rouge is merely a 'backdrop' as mentioned earlier in this paragraph and that is the very fact about this film that lets it down.This is a film that begins on a chaotic note and continues it further, and hence, for the viewer, the tension never really develops...it is already there, at the outset! The story centers around two of the main characters, Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor) who are trying to cover the war situation in Cambodia in 1973. Things turn uglier soon enough when an American B-52 bombs the town of Neak Leung by mistake! Two years later, the Khmer Rouge seem to be taking over, and evacuation begins. Some Cambodian locals who have sought refuge in the French Embassy in Cambodia are forcibly trapped in the whole drama, including Dith Pran, who is there to assist Schanberg.The rest of the story focuses on how Schanberg is feeling guilty about letting Pran stay on with him and how Pran attempts to survive amidst the Killing Fields created by the Rouge.What this film doesn't quite clarify are the intentions of the Khmer Rouge itself on which the whole films seems to build its premise. The actions and the very reason of the existence of the Khmer Rouge isn't clear enough, neither is the actual situation in Cambodia. There is chaos throughout the film, so there isn't really any clear explanation given for the whys and the hows and the whats in this supposedly powerful drama.Sure, there are a lot of gut-wrenching scenes in this war-fest, but since we who are newly being introduced to the Khmer Rouge history aren't really told the inside story, it is difficult to relate to any of those who are mercilessly disposed of! So at this point, I would recommend the viewer to thoroughly study the Khmer Rouge story, in order to follow this film more closely! Good performances from the two lead actors Sam Waterston and Haing S. Ngor and a fine supporting act in an early role by John Malkovich, but that is just not enough to save this film based on a strong true story.""The Killing Fields"" is a film begging for a remake, with hopefully a more focused script.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Will put you to sleep,"I know a little about the terrible events that happened in Cambodia and was interested in seeing a movie based on some of those events. Killing Fields evidently was based on a true story. It is about a newspaper journalist, Schanberg, who got caught up in the chaos in Cambodia. He becomes friends with a fellow reporter, Pran, who is Cambodian. Schanberg leaves his friend behind and has some deep regrets.I felt hesitant criticizing this film, because I seem to be the only one who calls this movie boring and drawn out. I thought the movie sucked. Killing Fields could have easily been shrunken to half it's length. But my biggest complaint was the lack of chemistry between Schanberg and Pran. I really wasn't touched at all. Their ""friendship"" seemed awful shallow. Pran gives a good performance. But Schanberg's acting was a bomb. Also, I was surprised at how little suspense there was throughout the movie. To me, that's normally a requirement of a good film.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Review,"I recently saw this movie in my Modern War class at school and i was highly impressed. I found that the movie did an excellent job of devoloping its characters while at the same time stayed true to its historic roots. Whether you are a history buff or a drama lover, this movie will suit you. It reveals the horrors that occurred during the Cambodian Genocide episode that occurred some time ago. Despite being dreadful some people tend to forget about this event and this movie does a fine job reminding people of just how arduous a struggle this was to endure for the Cambodians and as we see in the movie some Americans too. I was very happy with this movie and i recommend it to anyone.",,Anonymous,History
"A hard film to watch, with a message impossible to ignore","The Killing Fields is a story that truly defines the meaning of the term 'man's inhumanity to man'. Imagine living in a country where it is illegal, and punishable by mutilation or death to speak French, where hospitals, schools and other public services are closed down, and where the entire population is forced to work long hours in the fields, and only being given one small bowl of thin soup with a few grains of rice per day to sustain yourself. That was Cambodia during the reign of the Khmer Rouge. The film portrays the story of Dith Pran, who somehow survived this nightmare and escaped to the West, but, as the film shows, many did not survive. If ever a film needed making, this was it. It's the most moving film I have ever seen, and the only one that has ever made me cry.",10.0,Anonymous,History
An Exceptional Film,"The Killing Fields is an important film. It tells the story of two journalists—one American and one Cambodian—struggling to stay alive in war-torn Cambodia. Of course, it tells a bigger story too, namely the result of the bombing of Cambodia by the United States and subsequent atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge: torture, slavery, brainwashing, increasingly indiscriminate murder on a mass scale. All very real and very terrible things. The film manages to tackle all of this heavy material without glossing anything over, (I'm looking at you Hotel Rwanda) and without making it so brutal as to be unwatchable.Unfortunately, the majority of the acting and dialogue in The Killing Fields isn't quite good enough to do the aforementioned atrocities justice. That is not to say these aspects of the film are bad, they're perfectly adequate. I just wish they were as flawless as some enraptured reviewers would have you believe.Ironically, (and perhaps even fittingly) it's the non-actor Cambodian children that give the most convincing, (and touching) performances in the movie. They may just be being themselves, but it lends the film an authenticity which few of the trained actors were able to capture with any consistency.The cinematography is spot on. Brilliantly balanced and flawlessly framed, it's practically symbolic in a few shots. Just beautiful. All of the filming appeared to be shot on site, in Cambodia and elsewhere, a practice that the majority of modern directors seem to have forgotten about, which is a shame since no amount of CGI or special effects are as convincing as the real place. The sets look 100% real, nothing looks staged.The music ranges from moving, to merely fitting, to downright strange and painfully 80's. Fortunately, there's more of the former than of the latter. With the exception of a few crude sound effects, The Killing Fields sounds quite good overall.While important, The Killing Fields is unlikely to ever be a very popular film. While it's technically a ""war movie"" (in part) it never glorifies violence, or tries to make it look cool. There's plenty of violence, of course, but it's more of the uncensored 6 o' clock news variety. Obviously, the film also draws attention to a very dark page from the United States past, and raises a lot of uncomfortable questions, which is bound to turn some people off. However, for anyone mature enough to handle its subject matter, and empathetic enough to explore the wide range of emotions covered in the film, The Killing Fields should really not be missed.7.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Year Zero...,"""The Killing Fields"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch a journalist getting trapped into Cambodia during Year Zero of the tyrant Pol Pot and its actions.An amazing movie that everybody has to watch in order to learn the truth about that part of Cambodia's history and for those dark times. I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because Roland Joffé made an excellent job in the direction of this film and presented very well and truly all the difficulties of the people of Cambodia along with the horrific actions of Pol Pot.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Director Joffé makes a Killing on his first feature film, as the bond between two men form during a situation of extremities is explored.","The Killing Fields opens with a voice-over telling us of a few brief, matter of fact items regarding the Asian locality of Camboida; a coming of speech which informs us of how The West see it as a lonely, isolated, untouched paradise over long shots of warm, tropical iconography in the form of low sunsets and palm trees. Where the compositions are rather picturesque and the supposed views glowing, The Killing Fields is a film more about the death and destruction going on within a corrupt and putrid nation; those of whom run it share similar characteristics. The suggestion that something is very wrong with the established Western view is hinted at when a large aircraft used for bombing raids ominously flies overhead, before we cut to a closer shot physically bringing us a little deeper into the locale thus revealing a young boy wearing a war helmet. In a basic sense, Utopian iconography of an ""untouched paradise"" has been replaced by standard war genre codes; an un-Earthing of the truth after a prior stance has been just been deconstructed, the film itself a documenting of the atrocities that occurred within the nation of Cambodia between 1973 and 1975, and whose opening from the lead wonderfully ties in with his own experiences as we observe him at various points in the film try to uncover the truth about an event, within an event.Roland Joffé's quite wondrous film covers the true story of a man, an American journalist, named Sydney Schanberg here played by Sam Waterston and his friendship with several other men of western origin as well as native Cambodian photojournalist Dith Pran, played by the Oscar winning and now tragically deceased Haing S. Ngor. Joffé's film is a systematic deconstructing of this supposed myth the opening voice over speaks of and a somewhat effortless encompassing of post-war mental states linked to that of predominantly guilt as well as life as a prisoner of a new order on top of that. The film is a taut, mediative piece on one's actions and the decisions one makes in the heated coven of wartime whilst battling on the front-line, not as soldier with a gun but as a journalist with a camera, and how these shape the immediate situation as well as how these decisions made come to affect those involved years later; the centrepiece of which is a harrowing race against time when several characters are holed up in a building located in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, as a man's life seems hours away from being ended due to incoming dangers.How it came to that is a tale altogether; the resulting misadventures born out of it additionally something else with the story of two men coming to understand one another under intensified circumstances the film's first port of call. When we begin with one of these men, we begin with Pran being chauffeured around town in a Mercedes, something which suggests importance; the presence of the car radio set to an American station playing out in English also suggesting bilinguality thus an education and the dialogue-free interactions he engages in with two passing monks as he walks past them on a public street hinting at not only respectful characteristics but perhaps a decent, positive reputation that he himself carries resulting in people stopping and bowing their heads to him. The characteristics are that of a binary opposition when placed up alongside those in the Cambodian Communist organisation known as The Khmer Rouge, the chief instigators of hate and fear throughout the film and the chaos and terror they instill into both the film and those involved later on because of the finale of the Vietnam War spilling out into the neighbouring nation.The film scatters the nationalities of most of the other first world, usually Capitalist, officials Schanberg and Pran deal with; a deliberate deploying of varying nationalities representative of The First World attempting some form of aid to those of Pran's ilk involved in the hardships, everything from Australia to Scotland to England to Russia. But the film is less bothered with the politics than it is of the true story of these two men linking up; Schanberg's relationship with Pran, like Pran's characteristics in regards to his own natives The Khmer Rouge, is in stark opposition to that of his getting along with The American Government, whom he berates from the beginning and clashes with on a number of personal and political points. After initially arriving and meeting with a relatively spaced out photojournalist named Al Rockoff (Malkovich), Schanberg is forced into travelling to the site of an American bombing raid with some locals when denied access to fly out along with the Americans; a later event as Schanberg attempts to practise liberalism in trying to photograph some atrocities leading to arrest and later realisation at press fabrication with what they perceived to have happened there that day.Pran's staying in Cambodia following evacuation orders on behalf of Schanberg leads him to a nightmarish post-war space of authority, totalitarianism and a strong military presence operating under a banner of a 'Year One' mentality. The distinction as to what sorts of environments each of the respective parties, Pran still in the Far East and Schanberg in New York City, inhabit in this: their post-Cambodia living, is pointed out via the kinds of mediums and sources of cultural indulgence they have access to or the ability to be exposed to. Where Schanberg is free to engage with the news; home video and opera, Pran is having to surrender to a dictatorship wanting to eradicate free thinking and bring everybody down to the same level. The finale and what transpires in leading up to it is fraught with angst and terror infused within both parties; a nerve-shredding trek in both a psychological and physical sense of either man desperate to be reunited. For this a many other things, the film is a triumph.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Incredible portrayal of friendship, one man's struggle to survive, and an apocalyptic vision of hell on Earth.","**** out of ****After nearly 20 years The Killing Fields still remains one of the most powerful films ever made, a brilliant piece of moviemaking that leaves a searing imprint in the mind long after viewing it.  This is not a film to be taken lightly, but a serious examination of the horrors of war and individual conflicts and struggles, and for that it is on par with Steven Spielberg's work on Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, certainly a noteworthy comparison.The film opens in 1973, with the Vietnam War coming to an end.  But the horror is far from over.  The Khmer Rouge, a radical political group, are slowly taking over war-torn Cambodia.  The film's first 2/3's chronicles the journeys and friendships of two journalists, Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor), as well as photographer Al Rockoff (John Malkovich) and another photographer, a British man named Jon Swain (Julian Sands).The American Embassy makes the crucial decision to evacuate but Schanberg refuses to leave, and his partner Pran, out of a sense of loyalty, also willingly stays behind while his family is evacuated.  But trouble ensues, and Pran is eventually forced to remain in Cambodia and must struggle to survive re-education camps and the Killing Fields.Of all the films to involve the Vietnam War (technically, though, the focus of this is on Cambodia), The Killing Fields ranks above them all.  It is even more harrowing than Oliver Stone's Platoon, more realistic than Apocalypse Now and Full Metal jacket, and more intensely personal than The Deer Hunter.  This film remains something of a forgotten relic, losing the Best Picture award of 1984 to the undeserving Amadeus, but The Killing Field's importance and impact have remained, and perhaps by today's standards, has an even more terrifying imprint.Perfectly directed, this easily remains director Roland Joffe's best work to date (and he'll probably never surpass it).  It's something of a tragedy to see him take a step backward with every film he has gone on to make (The Mission, the disastrous The Scarlet Letter).  But his work on this film is still by far one of the most impressive I've seen in this genre.  He captures the insanity of the time period, the political confusion, the chaos, and the downright terrors of war; doing all of this not from a soldier's point of view, but from civilians, most particularly Dith Pran.The war-torn chaos featured in the first hour-and-a-half give way to an intense struggle for survival in the last hour.  The focus is on Dith Pran and the tortures he goes through.  It is here that the film takes an apocalyptic look and stance, and the sight of hundreds of dead bodies in a long, single ditch remains one of the most horrifying and shocking sights ever put on film.Suspenseful is a way to describe the film, yet it is far more nail-biting than the usual Hollywood-churned thriller.  It's impressive how director Joffe creates so much tension from so many situations.  From the beginning when we see the evacuation to the point where the journalists try to fake a passport to keep Pran in the embassy; all these moments are simply heart-pounding.Those scenes seem almost obligatory in comparison to the last 1/3, which focuses on Pran almost entirely.  Every scene in these last 50 mintues, I was left constantly praying and hoping he'd make it out and I literally gripped my seat every moment, wondering whether he'd be discovered or whether he'd be able to escape. The film is so riveting not only because of Joffe's direction, but also because of the individual characters whom we grow to not only care for, but also feel like we're in the same situation with.  Haing Ngor carries the load as Dith Pran, and comes through magnificently.  Having faced the actual terrors of war in Cambodia, Ngor is brilliantly effective, and he easily delivered what must have been the best performance of the 80's.Sam Waterston is almost as good as Sydney Schanberg, Pran's close friend who feels guilty for having let Pran stay behind during the evacuation.  It is his drive to get the news down that places Pran in danger, and though we're aware of this, there's never a moment when we aren't touched by Waterston's torn feelings.  This is his best performance to date.The supporting cast is also very good, most notably John Malkovich as the photographer who seems a little odd at first, but is pretty much the average guy who also sympathizes for Pran's plight (and, as a result, ends up arguing with Schanberg).  Julian Sands is also effective as the photographer whose life as well as Schanberg's and Rockoff's, was saved by Pran and he tries his best to return the favor.The Killing Fields, while certainly a bloody violent film and almost always depresses the hell out of you, is ultimately more inspirational than anything else.  This may be a flinching, no-holds barred experience, but it is one that must be seen.  This is truly an unforgettable film, and one of my personal favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Reality of Harsh Brutality and One of Friendship,"As the title suggests, this is a film you don't just lightly watch on a whim. This film takes the viewer into a world that does not value life, the civil war in Cambodia in the 1970s. This is the true story of New York Times journalist, Sydney Schanberg, covering the civil war in Cambodia along with his interpreter and guide Dith Pran as they attempt to shine light into this conflict and its atrocities. As tensions and violence rise with various local group vying for power, the American embassy orders everyone to withdraw the country. Schanberg encouraged Pran to stay and help, thereby missing his chance to flee earlier. Now when Schanberg leaves, Pran is stuck....in the Killing Fields....and sees first-hand how brutal the factions can be while also brainwashing the orphaned children to not value family and much more. This film does not hold back so be ready, but it did a nice job of developing the friendship, while the second half is Schanberg attempting to get Pran freed. Will he succeed or will Pran end up being one of the STAGGERING two million killed?",7.0,Anonymous,History
Powerful Drama But Hard To Watch,"It's been over 20 years since I saw this film and parts of it still haunt me.....brutal, emotional scenes which I do NOT want to see ever again. It's just too gut-wrenching and uncomfortable to sit through a second time. Generally, it's two hours of suffering and torture. Who wants to watch that?It IS a powerful story, though, based on the true life adventures of Dith Pran (played by Haing S. Ngor) who somehow survived the unbelievably-brutal regime of Cambodia dictator Pol Pot. Other reviewers here have detailed the storyline, so there is no sense me rehashing that.Suffice to say this is a movie that - be warned - is very tough to view in many spots - but will leave you emotionally drained. Ngor's harrowing performance is one to remember, as is the horrible story of what happened in the mid '70s in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. This movie was filmed with Thailand and the scenery there, along with the excellent cinematography, makes this a visual treat.Some have complained that the film is too slow for them.

Infuriates on several levels,"This movie is very disturbing for several reasons. First, its realistic portrayal of the war in Cambodia - focusing on the suffering of civilians, and the incredible horror some would inflict on others.Second, the rather cold, unsympathetic journalist, Sydney Schanberg (Waterston). Yes, that's what I said. It's not until after winning a Pulitzer Prize for his Cambodian assignment, does he begin to have some real guilt about leaving his friend to suffer. Great timing. He then embarks on a mission to save Dith Pran, but it seems less for his friend than to absolve his own shame.If you've seen the movie and didn't catch this, please see it again. The events leading up to Schanberg's veneration are anything but compassionate towards the real victims, Dith especially. A journalist who wakes up, conveniently after his ego has been sufficiently nourished, and decides to be a human being for a change. He's lying down in his N.Y apartment listening to opera, but that won't quench his guilt either. It was worth a try though.Dith's pleading for his life will forever haunt me. Waterston's accurate portrayal of this self-absorbed, blinded-by-the-truth journalist is even more abhorrent.Minor actor, Spalding Gray, based his entire monologue ""Swimming to Cambodia"" (1987) on a bit part in the movie. This is the second example of exploitation by the artsy-left crowd. The first is ""The Killing Fields"", for demonstrating how one can use unfortunate victims to further their careers and come out looking like humanitarians.",,Anonymous,History
Difficult Viewing But Necessary,"This is a very serious film that concerns a gravely serious subject, the genocide perpetrated by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia during the 1970's in which an estimated two million Cambodian citizens were murdered. As director, Roland Joffe is to be commended for his powerful portrayal of one of the most horrifying instances of human cruelty in modern times. As one who was alive and politically involved at the time, beyond the murderous brutality of the regime that plunged an ordinarily peaceful Southeast Asian nation into utter chaos and widespread bloodshed, where was the rest of the world when it allowed these atrocities to occur only thirty years after the European Holocaust of World War II? What was the United Nations doing at the time? I could not understand how this could happen as it was occurring in the late 1970's any more than I can today, and I applaud director Joffe for so effectively bringing a very dark chapter in modern history to the screen.Viewers should be cautioned about some very painful scenes that I found to be very difficult to watch, including the results of the mistaken American bombing of a Cambodian town, Neak Leung. The images of wounded and crying children are especially disturbing, but they represent an event that actually happened as the United States escalated its military campaign in Southeast Asia with the approval of both major political parties. If these very troubling incidents are difficult to observe in a movie, just imagine what they must have been like to experience in real life.As good as the film was, it did run exceedingly long, and I wouldn't have minded less of a focus on the American journalists and more on the experiences of Mr. Pran and his suffering compatriots, the Cambodian people. I found much of the dialogue between Shanberg (Sam Waterston) and Rockoff (John Malkovich) silly and even annoying, which truly degraded the rest of a very powerful film. The scene in the French embassy ran for much longer than needed. The music of John Lennon's song ""Imagine"" is very beautiful, but the lyrics are very naïve and seemed totally out of place at the finale when one considers the human horrors that had been revealed during the previous two hours and twenty minutes. As a human race, we must do much more than passively ""imagine"" a world without genocide. We must act vigorously to see that it never happens again.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The mixing of the music into the movie is unforgivable. I would guess that the director used the music in a different way than Mike had in mind. I'm not a big fan of Oldfield but if he's capable of doing soundtracks this good, why doesn't he make more of them ?",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Solid Deep Story With A Great Cast and Sad Historical Value,"The Killing Fields is a surprising film, that could have matched any Vietnam set film as its set in Cambodia. Most know of the Vietnam War, but almost only half of the world still remembers what Cambodia went through during Pol Pot's heinous ethnic cleansing of the people with the help of his brutal regime the Khmer Rouge. They systematically murdered over 2 million Cambodians who were to them 'undesirables' and needed to be removed.The Killing Fields is a film that realistically portrays the genocide, and the infamous Killing Fields where most of the genocide victims ended up, and attempting to cross the watery fields their remains made a soup to crawl through. This film is extremely sad and hard hitting, as the Cambodian genocide never really got much coverage as say the Vietnam War did. The filming of the event in this film is very well done and captures the horrific moments of the genocide. People being herded onto trucks bound for executions, children being murdered in front of their parents.This film could in my opinion match even most big-budget Jewish Holocaust films with how gritty the feel of this film is. The film follows American photographer for a US newspaper who is stuck in the country following the Khmer Rouge's take-over played by Sam Waterston, however it is the second and most frank viewpoint of character Dith Pran portrayed by real life Khmer Rouge survivor Haing S. Ngor who was sadly murdered in 1996 due to his views of the Khmer Rogue.Haing S. Ngor is amazing surviving the Genocide, seeing many of his friends and countrymen hacked down by the Khmer Rogue. This film is for those who wish to see a tragic event just as sad as the Holocaust and indeed the Vietnam War. Its disturbing at times but must be to portray the events of the Genocide. This is a classic in its own name now, and its a film I can watch over and over again.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Historically important, but it hasn't aged well cinematographically","I think Stanley Kubrick was right when he thought the story was un-cinematic. I feel the film struggles between the point of view of Schanberg and Pran. Schanberg's story is really boring, there's no depth in this character, we learn nothing from him. Pran, on the other hand, is a much richer character and Hain S. Ngor's performance makes it even better. The cinematographic approach might have been powerful back in the day, especially with the big production level, but the documentary style falls short since most scenes just pass by without any emotional weight but the intrinsic impact of the horrors of war. The last thirty minutes of the film are much more interesting in this aspect, but unfortunately, after almost two hours, I found hard to follow Pran's journey without just wanting the movie to end. I feel a better leading actor would have improved the movie greatly while also developing more the friendship between Schanberg and Pran. I really liked John Malkovich, such a simple character and yet full of life. I wish the movie would have had more memorable scenes like ""Apocalypse now"" by Francis Ford Coppola or ""Full metal jacket"" by Stanley Kubrick.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A chilling portrayal of the epitome of evil,"Many are aware of the evils that occurred in Cambodia, but few have a chance to see how this developed.The chilling genocide, which in my opinion is an example of the ultimate manifestation and epitome of evil, is a horrifying portrayal of the descent of a nation to the depths of human depravity.The systematic and brutal desensitization of the killers and the motivations, and the counterbalancing bravery and nobility of their victims, is testimony to the continuous struggles played out on this earth.The movie was cold, and sucked the life force out of me.  I could not, and still cannot, comprehend how such evil came to be.  The saddest of all was to see what became of the children of the Khmer Rouge; what they turned into and what became of them.It is necessary for any person living in the modern world to be aware of such tragedies in human history.

"The Killing Fields is a relevant, masterful, brutal eye-opener","When it comes to war movies, Hollywood either turns a blind eye to the real events in favor of a bloodless glamorization or the filmmaker takes the ""no guts, no glory,"" war motto to heart. British director Roland Joffe chose the latter approach for his masterful yet brutal 3- time Oscar-winner, The Killing Fields.Starring a then-unknown cast, Sam Waterston plays with conviction real-life ""New York Times"" reporter Sydney Schanberg who is covering the civil war in Cambodia, putting the story ahead of his life. Deservedly garnering him an Oscar nomination, it was co-star Haing S. Ngor who won the golden man for his scene-stealing portrayal as Dith Pran, a local journalist and interpreter. Ngor, an untrained actor and survivor of the Cambodian War, is obviously all too familiar with the atrocities of war that are not candy-coated throughout the unabashedly- graphic (and twenty minutes too long) 141-minute running time. However, with Joffe's eye for framing beauty out of destruction and captivating experiences, The Killing Fields never lets your attention wander.With the Cambodian unrest growing more extreme, the Americans are forced to leave. While departing is not a problem for Schanberg (or for his intrepid photogs played by Julian Sands and the quick-tongued tension-reliever John Malkovich), Dirth Pran is stuck in a hellish war zone. Here the movie seamlessly morphs into a nail-biting escape film.Released in 1984 and set in the '70s, The Killing Fields is eye opening in relevancy considering today's war climate. Important viewing to show that what you see on the news might be a watered-down version of reality, The Killing Fields points out that media silence to a civil uprising and ignorance of the public might be just as deadly as bullets themselves.",8.0,Anonymous,History

An Utterly Powerful Movie!,"Wow, what a punch to the gut! If you are about to watch The Killing Fields for the first time, be prepared to feel the same way. It is an emotional tale that describes the horror of the Khmer Rouge reign. It is a thought-provoking tale based from the memoirs of a New York Times correspondent. The performances from the cast are excellent, especially from Haing S. Ngor, a doctor who never acted before. This is Roland Joffe's first film as director and he really understood the material. It is not only a movie that describes the horror of war, but it is a tale of friendship, loyalty, and love. David Puttnam, who produced this feature, actually said Joffe was the only man who understood what the film truly meant. Indeed he did, because this film is an emotional gut punch!As a history major, this time period is actually one I was not all too familiar with. I knew the Cambodian Civil War was in part due to the Khmer Rouge taking over the country. This film taught me how horrible these atrocities they committed. They killed over 17,000 people. They wiped out the intellectual population (such as teachers, doctors, etc). They banned western medicine and books. They wanted to turn Cambodia into an agricultural sector, and thousands starved as a result. In terms of crimes against humanity, this is about as bad as it gets. They were also known for their ""Year Zero"" policy which outlawed all religion. One of the reasons why the film works because director Joffe, screenwriter Bruce Robinson, and cinematographer Chris Menges worked together effectively to bring these events to the screen. The film looked gorgeous thanks to Menges's exquisite camerawork. But sometimes it also looked brutal especially when we get a peek at the actual killing fields.The film is based off the eyewitness accounts of New York Times reporter, Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston). He is covering the Civil War in Cambodia along with his intrepid photographer, Al Rockoff (John Malkovich). They team up with local journalist, Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor) to cover the brutalities of this genocide. When the American forces evacuate, Pran sends his family with them. He, however, stays behind to help cover the truth of the war. When it is time for Schanberg to leave, Pran is forced to stay behind even with his family in the United States. That does not sit well with Schanberg. He uses all resources at hand to bring Pran to the states and to his family.Roland Joffe's casting decisions were interesting. He wanted to stay away from the big names which he felt would take away the emotional impact from the movie. Some names may sound familiar like Sam Waterston and John Malkovich, both of them had amazing performances. However, I want to focus on Haing S. Ngor. He won an Academy Award for his supporting performance, which was a very impressive feat. When he signed on for his role, he was a doctor with no acting experience. Furthermore, he actually survived the war that this film is based on. He spent four years at a forced labor camp, but eventually was able to escape to Thailand. He was only one of two nonprofessional actors to ever win an Academy Award. Very impressive feat and well-deserved because he did show amazing chemistry with the rest of the cast. On a side note, this is actually Malkovich's first film role as well. He also did an amazing job!The Vietnam War and the conflicts in Southeast Asia brought some powerful movies like The Deer Hunter or Apocalypse Now, but this story is a more grounded approach. It is about ordinary people being killed off just for the heck of it. The film threatens to become conventional at times as the story of a man going back into a war-torn nation to save someone dear to him is something that is done often. The Deer Hunter and Uncommon Valor are a few examples. That said, the film then throws that approach out the window when it decides to focus more on the Dith Pran's character. I liked that approach and it added more to the emotional impact.The Killing Fields is one of the best films of 1984. It is a very powerful film about love and friendship set in the backdrop of a terrifying war. If you do not shed a tear during the movie, you may not be human. The last lines of dialogue wrecked me. Perhaps, Mike Oldfield's score may have helped. The movie hits home the themes of friendship, but also how awful genocide is. This was an important history lesson for me, and I am glad to recommend this movie.My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,History

Well made drama.,"Director Roland Joffe did an incredible job in capturing the very essence of what friendship means. 'The Killing Fields' is a moving drama that sends out a strong message of friendship and loyalty.The shocking reality of war is so well depicted here. The film is just as unpredictable as life itself. The actors did a very good job in bringing the characters to life, especially Haing S. Ngor as Dith Pran. (Ngor himself, was a captive during the Cambodian war where he was imprisoned and tortured).Parts of the film looks like an advertising vessel for Coca Cola, which is a pity, but I suppose they were a big sponsor. Apart from that, this is a very well done film. I did find the latter part of the second act and into the beginning of the third act a bit dragged out. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't in the least boring, but found it too long. It does span a few years, though, so I suppose they wanted to show us the agony Dith Pran had to endure, making way for a good finale.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Looking for a reason,"I'm not sure what the point of this film is. On one hand it's a very well made film in how it depicts the horrors of war and the chaos and uncertainty. Other's have said that it doesn't show violence explicitly enough. I completely disagree, it's the only strength this film has imo. Back in the 60's there was an outcry about Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. The shower scene was too graphic both in violence and nudity according to some of the public. Even though we don't see her completely nude, nor do we ever see the knife slice her up. That's movie magic. The imagination of the viewer is often more powerful than anything the movie can show. The Killing Fields does the same. It doesn't show the violence head on but somehow in my head I see the violence that goes on just outside of camera view.Other than that I don't know what this film is about. If you're like me and you don't know much about the Vietnam war you're left in the dark. Just two lines of text is all you get in terms of context: It's the vietnam war and the war spreads to neighbouring country Cambodia. This film follows a reporter in Cambodia. That's it. That's all you get from context. Throughout the film we see soldiers that the main character say are ""Khmer Rouge"". I had to google what that meant as the film gives no explanation. I still don't know the details but apparently it's the name of the Communist Party and their army that was taking control and doing all kinds of murders and unspeakable acts at the end of and years following the Vietnam war.I'm seeing this now many years later at home so I have the luxury to pause and look it up. In the cinema I would have been in the dark the whole time.There's an argument to be made that the focus of the film is between the two main characters: the reporter and his local translator. Therefore one doesn't necessarily need all the context. It's enough to know that both these men are making tough decisions based living in a war-torn country.That could have made for an interesting viewing nonetheless. If these characters and their story was interesting. But, in the 2h20 minutes I spend with both of them I still don't know anything about their motivations. There is nothing in terms of character development and the story (if you can call it that) is paper thin. I felt zero connection to these people.Another argument one can make is that a movie doesn't need a coherent story in order to touch the heart. As I said in the beginning of this review, the atrocities are depicted very well. It's very powerful stuff. I can imagine how impossible life must have been for everyone living there. I'd still like there to be some semblance of story or character development and especially character motivation. In a 140 minute movie I'd like to have some more substance. A reason to keep watching beyond being curious about why this is considered a classic.",5.0,Anonymous,History
liked,"I personally enjoyed the quality of the film. Though at times it may have seemed too fictionalized, I think that it really made a good story out of a truly traumatizing time. The film starts off dramatic from the very beginning when the American reporter first arrives to Cambodia. Nothing is held back, and it is filmed in a way that truly makes everything seem very real. I think that this film is important to watch to have a sense of what has gone on in the world besides just the major events. Another good way to look at the movie, in terms of Emerson students, is to learn of the passion that the journalists have for their work. The two reporters in this movie followed the danger, rather than escaping, in order to make for a good story. The passion that they had to get out the word of what was happening really is inspiring. I think that overall this movie really teaches a lot, and I am happy to have watched it.",,Anonymous,History
Heart wrenching and compelling,"""The Killing Fields"" is something I recommend every person watch. The Khmer Rouge were one of the most evil organizations on the face of the Earth and without a doubt committed the worst acts of genocide in my lifetime. Even worse than Bosnia and Rwanda. Original estimates put the death toll at one million, later the number was upgraded to two million. The Khmer Rouge were not sub-human, that implies they had some humanistic qualities. They were in-human. To do those sorts of things you must have no heart, no feelings, and no soul. To them, human life is not cheap. It is worthless. And to allow these vermin to carry out this program of degradation and mass slaughter gives the whole world a black eye, not just America. America was involved in Vietnam, which spilled over into Cambodia. We were ""responsible"" for that, although it most likely would have happened anyway. To allow it to continue unabated for the next decade was the real crime. I suppose the real question here is ""Should America be the world's policeman? And if not, who will be?"" The easy answer is ""No. The U.N. is the world's policeman."" But the U.N. has proved itself time and time again to be unreliable at best and at worst completely useless. I honestly don't know if the U.S. has the right to interfere in foreign affairs. But if the U.S. doesn't do something, no other country will. And these kind of atrocities will continue in Asia, Africa, and elsewhere until the world ends.",10.0,Anonymous,History

One of the greatest films,"It's underrated films like this that don't get any publicity and the over-rated, pointless films do. I guess that's just the way Hollywood operates. This is one of the saddest, touching, unsetteling, scariest films I've ever seen. It's also one of the best. It shows the atrocities of war in a short amount of time, capturing and horrifying the viewer, but not sickening. It is a story  combined with the Vietnam War and two journalists who have to fight their way through Cambodia at the time of the Khmer Rouge and the fall of Penom Penh. Vivid imagery and music is outstanding, but the acting and intensity shown is very realistically. This is the greatest anti-war film and one of the most harrowing, gripping films I've ever seen.

It's the furthest thing from a fun flick, but it effectively takes you back to the Cambodian holocaust and provides a good idea of what went down. It's the furthest thing from a conventional war flick, so stay away if that's what you want.The best part is Dith Pran's mind-blowing experiences after his American buddies depart, but that doesn't occur until an hour and 28 minutes into the film, which reveals the weakness of the production: There's too much padding in the prior section. For instance, a dozen minutes is blown on a sequence at the French embassy concerning making a fraudulent passport for Pran, which turned out to be irrelevant anyway. Cutting 20 minutes from the runtime would've worked wonders.I should add that John Malkovich, Julian Sands and Craig T. Nelson appear in peripheral roles.

One wonders how anyone survived the devastation of Cambodia,"Filmed in Thailand and Canada, this epic film portrays the devastating effect on the land and its people when the Khmer Rouge plundered from the north. slaughtered and enslaved the population of Cambodia. The Kmer Rouge soldiers proclaim that this is year zero in the new order. Past years must be forgotten.Not having been to Cambodia, I can only say that the bomb-blasted area of Phenomh Pen looked pretty authentic to me. It was a massive job for the director to control so many actors spread over enormous sets. Crowd scenes must be difficult to handle and there were many. Lots of shouting and yelling and shooting maintained a lively pace and huge explosions added to the general confusion of the war scenes.The character Pran (a translator) had a sympathetic role almost sacrificing his life for the American journalist Sydney Scharnberg.This is a film to be appreciated or admired rather than enjoyed. There are so many harrowing scenes in it that one begins to accept death as the norm, Many Cambodians must have felt the same way doubting that there could be any future after the carnage.

Indubitably My Favorite Movie Of All Time,"As the subject line reads, this is, without a doubt, my favorite movie of all time. Haing S. Ngor is simply perfect in the role of Dith Pran and there was no one could have played it any better. He captures the poignance of Pran's situation and exemplifies man's will not simply to survive, but to rise above. The love and friendships presented in this movie are touching, but never cliched. There are many scenes which are quite disturbing (among them, the employment of children as soldiers for the brutal Khmer Rouge) but none that are gratuitously so. Sam Waterston, John Malkovich, and Julian Swain give strong performances, and Monirak Sisowath's performance as a compassionate Khmer Rouge leader is usually overlooked, though Ngor is obviously the centerpiece of the entire film. Mike Oldfield's soundtrack is riveting and appropriately jarring, and it's a shame that Roland Joffe's subsequent films have failed to match the quality of The Killing Fields. The only criticism I can give is that a large part of the movie is in unsubtitled Khmer, and the viewer has to figure out what the actors are saying by context and body language. At any rate, I highly recommend that everyone see this at least once (though given the intensity of the movie, I can fully understand people who would not be able to sit through it again).",10.0,Anonymous,History

The incredible performances by Sam Waterston and the late Haing S. Nor (whose real life paralleled his character's) make this movie one you will never forget.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"In the Name of Truth, Humanity and a deep, deep Friendship ...","The late Gene Siskel summed it up so neatly that I feel compelled to quote him. Yes, Roland Jaffé's ""Killing Fields"" is a wonderful story of ""professionalism, friendship and courage"", showing the true dedication of two professional journalists in their attempt to cover the on-going chaos in Cambodia at the Vietnam War's aftermath and their mutual support in the midst of a nation implosion announcing the worst. Naturally their collaboration produces the kind of fraternal bonds that can only bloom in worst-case situations, which is exactly what Cambodia is going through.The two reporters are Sidney Schanberg from the New York Times (Sam Waterston) and his Cambodian interpret and photographer Dith Pran (Dr. Haing S Ngor). Both had the courage to face every obstacle getting in their way to truth and each one tries to save the other's life at some point. That Sidney fails to get Dith his ticket to New York thus exposing him to the brutality (and that's an understatement) of the Khmer Rouge Army is profoundly affecting but never to the point that we blame him, we know he did his best. And so did his fellow co-workers, among them the photographer played by John Malkovich and whose efforts to get the right picture for a fake passport result in one of the film's most suspenseful sequences, one that goes without a single aimed weapon.But beyond the ""friendship, professional, courage"" tryptic, what the film accomplishes goes beyond its narrative format. It's perhaps the most notorious and vivid depictions of one of the worst atrocities of the last fifty years: the Khmer Rouge genocide. In a short lapse of time, about two millions of Cambodians were sacrificed at the altar of a 'Cultural' Revolution that annihilated every remain of civilization. Between 1975 and 1979, through starvations, exploitation and mass executions, the Army of the New Order enslaved a whole population, brainwashed the younger ones, cutting their family ties to produce a generation of zealous teenagers who wouldn't hesitate to pull a trigger. They also got rid of any citizen who represents a connection with the Old Order: doctors, engineers, intellectuals, as a matter of fact, wearing glasses could sign your death warrant. And so either you played dumb and resigned yourself to years of labour and hunger in Labour Camps or you were dead.A few survived the horror, I wouldn't spoil the fate of Dith Pran but if you read this review, I invite you to google the name of Dr. Haing S Ngor who played him. He too was a genocide surviror and a spokesperson for the Cambodian community until his untimely assassination in 1996. His death was classified as murder but the shady circumstances make it rather hard to believe that there was no connection whatsoever with Pol Pot (who was still alive at that time). Anyway, Ngor's death shows that ""The Killing Fields"" is more than a film, it's a testimony rooted in the past like a tree but whose branches were still growing, trying to reach, if not the peace, but the realization of the Occidental world. Because to add up to the misery, no one really cared about the tragedy and the world left thousands of innocents dying behind closed doors.It's even worse when you see in the film's early scenes a miscalculated American bombing destroying killing civilians. So the film is about the Free World's total indifference or in the best case, impotence. And I guess it's only fair that its most inspirational triumph (the film was in AFI's Top Cheers) didn't rely on a White Savior trope. Many great stories were built on that, ""Schindler's List"" is an example but ""The Killing Fields"" couldn't afford such a straightforward resolution. But it's still effective as a war movie, because what it does is portraying real people, played by not glamorous actors, some were relatively unknown at the time. Many scenes showing the Cambodian guerrilla, the arrests, the bombings or the random executions are shot in a way that channels ""The Battles of Algiers"" which impressed director Jaffé. But Jaffé also knows when to use synthesized music to enhance the emotional power or the thrills of one scene.Still, it's for these moments of fragile humanity that the film deserves our attention, the friendship between Dith and Sidney, their sweetness, their vulnerability, their fears and smiles. It's also for these little foretastes on the terror before the titular fields reveal the ugly secrets buried in their muddy holes, for these brief moments showing a little child crying in the middle of an intense bombing or the emotional farewell to Dith that the film is such an extraordinary journey, culminating with a tale of survival-b-keeping-a-low-profile that makes it closer to ""The Pianist"" than ""Schindler's List"".But there's little chance that this film has been watched as many times as these WW2 classics even with its status as a Best Picture nominee. A real shame because the 100th entry of the British Film Institute Top 100 should be exposed to the public eyes, to raise awareness of a tragedy as emotionally devastating as the Holocaust, if only because this time it was a Genocide of a regime against their own people. ""The Killing Fields"" is important film-making, it's a historical document that I recommend watching in the company of several Youtube clips that would provide further insights on the tragedy.Roland Jaffé would later make ""The Mission"", an interesting companion piece. Not to venture into hazardous comparaisons, but I guess what both films show is that men's evil might annihilate one civilization but not the universal extent of fraternal love ... immortalized by the film's emotional finale before closing on a picture of two child refugees, one looking behind, one helplessly staring at us... what a symbol!",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Sad Film,"Well I finally watched ""The Killing Fields"", having caught it on tv. I had wanted to watch it once to better understand what happened in Cambodia all those years ago. Those 45 years passed could be as nothing for an older person who was there, but they are an enormous expanse for a younger person of this new generation, which is why art and stories like ""The Killing Fields"" can be so important to pass on history to new generations, so that they can grasp it and hopefully not repeat the same mistakes and cycles.It is no doubt a tough watch though, with heartbreaking content, however at least the viewer is given a little bit of a happy ending with the two main characters being reunited to the great John Lennon song ""Imagine""; a memorable scene. But the film as a whole can be a slow plod and the Times reporter main character is a little bit unlikeable. Also the action and plot is so localized and narrowly focused on a few persons that the viewer does not learn a great deal about the broader aspects of what was occurring in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot's name is not even mentioned.All in all, it's a tough film to rate. An important work, though somewhat upsetting which may not appeal to everyone. And I will probably only watch this film once. So, I will give it a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Tasteful View of Genocide,"""The Killing Fields"" is overrated. As a study of journalists caught up in the horrors of Third World conflict it lacks the urgency of ""Under Fire"" and ""Salvador"", while even Peter Weir's romantic idyll set in similar circumstances, ""The Year of Living Dangerously"", seems a nervier, twitchier entertainment. This has the passive feel of a David Lean movie and while it is very well made, you feel removed from the horrors on screen; it gives us a tasteful view of genocide.The Killing Fields of the title are, of course, those in Cambodia during the reign of terror of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970's and Haing S Ngor, who plays the translator, Pran, was himself a non-actor and survivor of the killing fields (and like that other non-actor recreating something akin to his own real-life experiences in a movie, Harold Russell, Ngor was given the Oscar). One would expect, then, a greater urgency than first time director Roland Joffe gives the film.It is based on Sydney Schanberg's article ""The Death and Life of Dith Pran"" and Sam Waterson plays Schanberg, wracked by guilt and having left his interpreter behind in Cambodia when he escaped to the freedom of the West. Waterson plays Schanberg with moon-faced sincerity yet he still comes across as a decent, honorable man who probably could have done no more than the situation allowed. The superb cinematography is by the British cameraman Chris Menges who went on to direct ""A World Apart"" which told another true story about the horrors of apartheid and touched nerves far more deeply than this film does.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Overrated,"Well maybe I should have watched this when it came out to be as impressed as most viewers here, but I was 6 so even if I did I don't remember it. But I do remember the hype about it. I only watched it in 2018 because so many people reviewing Angelina Jolie's First They Killed My Father kept insisting that this is THE movie to watch if you want to know more about the Cambodian genocide. And that Jolie's movie was uninformative and cheesy. Well, this one is equally uninformative and way more cheesy! Maybe reviewers preferred the story being told my a guy rather than a girl? I have no idea. At least FTKMF left me intrigued to find out more about the situation and I was also immersed in its atmosphere. I can't say the same for this one. It looked like a poor man's Empire of the Sun. Such important stories that need to be told, but it doesn't work every time just because of the shock value. Lastly, as few others already mentioned, this movie was in need of editing. Too long with little substance. Sorry!",4.0,Anonymous,History
admirable   work,"a film about silence. because its subject is an embroidery of war, friendship, illusions and cruelty and hope. because it could be only a sketch for a history page out of definitions. the Khmere regime was one of the worst from the XX century and one of huge virtues of film is the presence of Hing S. Ngor in role of Dith Pran, himself a surviver from terror. each of that characteristics does the film more than a beautiful or touching one. it is a kind of surgery. that fact transforms it not exactly in adaptation of a case but in an unique testimony and in powerful homage. it is the film of a wise director, brilliant cast, splendid music and amazing images. in same measure, it is just one of films who Must see. not for cinematographic culture, not for discover a slice of the last century but for something who can be a better image about fundamental things who defines us as human beens.",,Anonymous,History
"A story of friendship, courage and the indomitable human spirit","The film's central pivot is the friendship between New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and Cambodian photojournalist Dith Pran (Dr. Haing S. Ngor) but the film really takes off when these individuals are separated in the wake of the Khmer Rouge's reign of terror. Schanberg is practically powerless to aid his friend, who faces a perilous task in escaping Cambodia's Killing Fields.The direction by Roland Joffé along with the Oscar-winning cinematography by Chris Menges bring the story to vivid life. The latter portion of the film, taking place for the most part in the Cambodian countryside is particularly breathtaking. Mike Oldfield's score, on the other hand, is not always successful and sometimes exudes a typical eighties gloss. There are a few times when the music distracts but, thankfully, those instances are the exception rather than the rule.Waterston and Ngor's portrayal of the two principle characters is convincing and the supporting cast isn't too bad either. Ngor won an Oscar for his role, doing so with a performance based mostly on nuance. The ending sequence, featuring John Lennon's ""Imagine"", is particularly touching though now bitterly ironic given Ngor's murder a dozen years after this film.This is a compelling story of hope in the face of tyranny. Sadly, despite the optimism of this film I'm sure that we'll see enough bloodshed to supply many more true stories of this ilk.",8.0,Anonymous,History
My perfect film,"Quite simply this is my favourite film of all time. It does everything a proper film should do it made me laugh and it made me cry, it was a roller-coaster of emotions. So different to the rubbish Hollywood films that pollute our screens nowadays and try and squeeze everything into their separate genres which bore the hell out of me. I was amazed when seeing the credits I had actually visited the location of the filming in Hua Hin and Phuket, Thailand without even knowing it. I think this movie makes me a lot more sad than films such as 'Schindler's List' because this was just before my life time and this is 'auto genocide' the killing of your own people and south-east Asian people are so nice and welcoming usually. I believe every movie lover should watch this film, which has modern connotations due to the harsh, unnecessary involvement of U.S. forces in global conflict leaving a power vacuum to be exploited on the people as in modern day Iraq. I will visit Cambodia next year with this movie in the back of my mind wanting to a find a beautiful people unfortunately still suffering today.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Film,"The Killing Fields is a brilliant film about friendship under extra-original circumstances. The film tells the story of American journalist Sydney Schanberg, who was reporting in Cambodia during the Vietnam war. America was secretly bombing Cambodia and then invade. He was present during the rise of the communists, the Khmer Rouge. Sydney befriends a Cambodian journalist and interpreter Dith Pran and both men see the country become war-torn and then see the Khmer Rouge become truly brutal against the people. Both men are forced by 1975 to hide in the French embassy with other journalists and Cambodians. Both men get split up, Sydney goes back home to New York whilst Dith is forced to under the brutal regime and goes into forced labour.This a beautiful film about friendship and both men do have a love for each other. It also show how brutal the regime of Pol Pot was and that he was on of the worst dictators in the twentieth century. It is well acted and Roland Joffe shows that he was once a good director. A aspect that I liked out the film was it felt like you were really they, you didn't know what was going one, like the people and you only got information from television or the radio. It also shows how difficult journalism can be in a situation like that. It also does shows the American government to be not doing enough to solve the situation.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Fields Of Gold They Ain't...,"A story about friendship and survival. If you're a journalist, you might be committed to your job, but perhaps you SHOULD be committed by agreeing to carry out reports from some of the warzones you get posted to. Especially in 1970s Cambodia, which is right on the cusp of Vietnam... and we all know what happened there in that decade. To risk getting shot and blown up every day... just for a few paragraphs in your local paper... nope, not worth it. The only column inches you could be taking up soon are in the obituary section.So this American reporter is right in the middle of the fighting, and together with two of his colleagues and a local translator, try to stick around for as long as possible... but are told to flee the country when things start getting too hot. But the three USA journos have made friends with the native guy, and they want to take him along. But after a failed attempt at giving him a phony passport, they're forced to leave him behind in the hands of a new fanatical regime. This sets up the best part of the film, as the newsmen try to track him down from the States while he suffers at the hands of his sadistic captors...Based on a true story, it is impeccably acted and holds the attention till the end, as danger lurks round every corner and people take extraordinary risks to help those they care about. It just goes to show that even in this hell on earth, lifelong friendships can be formed and whatever happens, NEVER give up hope. It's such an easy thing to say... but until you find yourself in a situation like the translator, how do you know if you'll cope? I pray you never have to find out... 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
There's nothing to forgive,"Roland Joffe's ""The Killing Fields"" is a nerve-shredding full film of power and emotion. The facts that the film is not based, but an actual true story, coupled with the knowledge that star Haing S Ngor was an actual Khmer Rouge prisoner, makes it impossible to turn away from the screen.Sam Waterston's performance as the determined turned guilt-ridden reporter Sydney Schanberg is good, but the show belongs to Ngor whose compelling performance gives us not only a person we care about but also a realistic, real human being, thrown into horrible circumstances of outside causes. If anything Ngor's terrific performance can be the sole reason of this film's raw power and brutality.But there is more to watch in this human film. Mike Oldfield's great, suitable score which perfectly suits the action without getting too dramatic or too subtle. The stunning cinematography which shows the horrors of war amidst the beauty of Cambodia. Terrific production value showing atmospheric, realistic locations filled with thousands of extras, a feat reminding me of the days of David Lean, only less joyous and much more terrifying given the context.I cannot recommend this brilliant film enough. Actions speak louder than words, so go see this as soon as you can, and prepare to be moved immensely. The use of John Lennon's ""Imagine"" is perfectly suited.Overall rating: 91/100",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Good idea, but unwatchable","Good subject, but unwatchable. First of all, all the screenplay no matter who or what the subject is, is exactly the same tone - light depression & confusion.Second, the film wants you to follow a guy who doesn't seem to know what he's doing, asks the wrong questions, doesn't seem to stand up for himself, just walks around as confused as everyone else.Third, the film is so vague, that when really important memorable scenes are shot, they're shot fast and zoomed in on things that don't matter. Such as one of the characters discovering the killing fields.It needed to focus on Pol Pot (or people nearby) and envisioning the entire process of coming to power in the country, eliminating foreign influence whilst ordering everyone to wear the same, ration food, no religious/political ideals.

Tale of hardship and friendship in the Khmer Rouge regime.,"My Rating : 8/10A very, very realistic war movie. It is about the years of brutality (between 1975 and 1979) in Cambodia by the Communist Party of Kampuchea which is also known as the Khmer Rouge.Very detailed, very brutal. The actors do a terrific job and the cinematography is magical and surreal. War violence is shown accurately and 'The Killing Fields' is ultimately a story of human survival.Please watch if you have any interest in war movies.As doctor/survivor/actor Haing S. Ngor - who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Pran - stated in 'A Cambodian Odyssey' - his own autobiography : 'Had the film portrayed the actual severity of what had occurred, no one would've been able to sit through it.' This is easily among the most harrowing tales of friendship and loyalty to have ever made it to the big screen; a film very much worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Darkness of the soul,"Set in the former French colony of Indochina, The Killing Fields centres on New York Times correspondent Sydney Schanberg, together with fellow journalistic aid and Cambodian national Dith Pran reporting on the military involvement of the United States in South East Asia in the early 1970s, Significantly, and the films main focal point, commentating on the latter stages of the Cambodian civil war. Due to the close proximity to Vietnam, and the United States wearisome involvement in the on-going communist and democratic conflicts in South East Asia, American foreign policy and public interest paid portentous attentiveness to the affairs of Cambodia.The film is introduced at the time of America's covert aerial bombardment of Eastern Cambodian military targets following the communist guerrillas refusal to adhere to the 1973 Paris Peace Treaty. Zealous journalist Schanberg is eager to and hindered from reporting to the American public the trepidation caused by the American bombing. Succeeding this introduction, the film moves intensely to the 1975 evacuation of foreign nationals from Phnom Penh during the seizing of power by the totalitarian communists Kampuchea before focusing on the consequent killing fields caused through social transformation and the year-zero policy. The film's final act, following a left behind Pran's escape from a national forced labour camp, is the eventual reuniting of the two journalist friends. From one stand point, British director Ronald Joffe does not shy away from exposing the human atrocities caused by armed conflict. Yet, Joffe does not over-embellish the horrors that inhabitant's encounter in a war-torn Country. Particularly, The Killing Fields centrepiece is the acts of humanity both moral, relationship between close friends, and immoral, the killing of innocent civilians and possible to a lesser extent, the unintentional minor selfish betrayal of Schanberg towards Pran. Rather than taking a more dramatic conventional route, the films interesting aspect is to view from a pragmatic everyday journalistic media approach. Also, interestingly The Killing Fields is one of a handful of English language films to call attention the violence, economics and political ideologies of twentieth-century revolutions. The horrors of the Khmer Rouge and the story told in The killing Fields draws parallels with events in the 1930's collectivisation of Ukrainian agriculture, the Nazi Holocaust of World War II and Mao's Great Leap Forward in the 1950's, all of which resulted in systematic extermination.Unfortunately I was unable to view the film in anamorphic widescreen 1.78:1 format. Although not as detailed, viewing the film in standard format did not eradicate the intensity of the film. As well as a story of friendship, The Killing Fields is an exceptional example of a former colonial countries dilemma when faced with dissimilar political ideologies following independence. Furthermore, the indescribable torment citizens' encounter in a brutal civil war and the mass suffering during the course of inhumane social experiments and the forced undemocratic reorganising of a society.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The story of local translators/facilitators who work with Americans in wartime,"It's a biopic set in Cambodia of Dith Pran, a trilingual Cambodian man who helped an American journalist cover the rise of the Khmer Rouge in 1975. Pran is forced to stay in Cambodia when the journalists leave and only escapes to America at the end of 1979.The film begins with journalist Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) arriving in Cambodia in 1973 on a New York Times assignment. Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor) is assigned as his translator/facilitator. Schanberg is arrogant and aggressive. We also meet Al Rockoff (John Malkovich), a laid-back photojournalist who frequently returns to the storyline. Schanberg and Pran cover an American B-52 ""accident"" that destroys a Cambodian village but is downplayed by the U. S. military.The story then jumps to 1975, when it is clear the Khmer Rouge will soon enter the capital city of Phnom Penh. There are dramatic encounters between the American journalists and the Khmer Rouge in which Dith Pran plays a central role in preserving their lives. After the Khmer Rouge take over the city, the journalists retreat to the French Embassy. However, local Cambodians are ordered to leave the embassy. Schanberg, Rockoff, and photojournalist Jon Swain (Julian Sands) try to forge a Western passport for Pran, but eventually, he is left behind.The film then alternates between Schanberg's efforts to discover if Dith Pran is still alive and Pran's existence under the Khmer Rouge for four years, and the persona he adopts to survive. Schanberg is sometimes accused of forcing Pran to stay in Cambodia when he could have been evacuated with the rest of his family at an earlier point.This powerful film tells the story of local translators/facilitators who work with Americans in their various international adventures. Haing S. Ngor deserved his Oscar, though it should have been for Best Actor, not Best Supporting Actor. Waterston was nominated for an Oscar, but the film portrays him as an arrogant American who needs the local Cambodian to save him. The cinematography is first-rate. The chaos and the uncertainty of life are clearly evident but without unnecessary gore. Closeups and quick shifts reduce the need for hundreds of planes and lengthy battle scenes. Fewer Sydney Schanberg scenes and more Dith Pran scenes would have suited me.There's a lot of fiction in the film. Its version of creating a fake passport is pure fiction. And the film omits the fact that Dith Pran was the administrator for a Cambodian village for much of a year after Vietnam overran the Khmer Rouge. He escaped to Thailand when he feared the Vietnamese would learn of his American connections; he did not escape from the Khmer Rouge.There is a supreme irony that Haing S. Ngor, who also suffered under the Khmer Rouge, died in Los Angeles in 1996 after being shot in a robbery attempt outside his home. He was a medical doctor that hid his professional skills while captured to avoid being killed.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The second half is more successful than the first.,"Made in Thailand while Pol Pot's brutal regime was still fighting for control of Cambodia just next door, 'The Killing Fields (1984)' is a timely biopic that aims to take a frank look at a horrifying situation while its ramifications are still very much ongoing. Starring unknown actor Haing S. Ngor, who experienced the unspeakably despicable actions of the Khmer Rouge first hand, and a handful of more famous (though certainly not A-list) American actors, the picture maintains an air of authenticity even through its segments that are pure fiction (an extended segment in the French embassy never actually happened, for instance). The film's first half focuses primarily on Sam Waterston's journalist character as he attempts to document the USA's secret bombing of and subsequent military presence in Cambodia. It also establishes the friendship between him and his translator, portrayed by the aforementioned Ngor. When things take a turn for the worse as the US prepare to pull out of the country, the two men must come to terms with the fact that one of them is going to be able to get to safety much more easily than the other. The second half then pivots somewhat to focus on the eponymous fields and the genocidal dictatorship their existence represents, becoming a survival movie that really drives home the inconceivable brutality that those who lived in Cambodia were forced to endure. For me, the second half is much more successful. The first is a bit too long and its pacing is often a little laborious, leading to an occasionally suspenseful yet mostly uncompelling segment that really feels less important than the one that follows it. The back half is tense, upsetting and typically plays out entirely visually, which makes it feel more cinematic while somehow also hammering home its reality. It also focuses on the Cambodian perspective, which is more interesting to me than seeing it through the eyes of a White American man approaching middle age (a perspective we've all seen plenty from). It can be somewhat grueling at times; the film itself isn't overly violent (it isn't too much to handle or anything like that), but the knowledge that it's showcasing just a fraction of the very real violence that occurred during the time it depicts is downright chilling. This sort of thing is an abomination that shouldn't be allowed to happen, which is why it's important to showcase it as honestly as possible and make sure nobody forgets how truly horrific the world can be if situations like this are allowed to occur. That's apparently a big reason that the filmmaker's contacts in the region were so keen to see it made, as spreading knowledge of the still ongoing conflict to an international audience could potentially inspire other countries to help with the scenario (although outside intervention is always tricky, as the inciting incident of this shows). The ending is a little distasteful due to the music it opts to use, but it's otherwise a generally decent moment on which to finish. Ultimately, this is an uneven yet important and typically successful feature based on an incredibly dark period in human history. It would be a bit more compelling if it were tightened up somewhat, particularly in its first half, but it's a solid effort and it's definitely worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,History
best film about KHMER ROUGE,"I wish I had seen this movie before going to Cambodia and visiting the Killing Fields last summer. Without a doubt, the movie is one of the most powerful masterpieces I have ever known and seen.For me, the movie is not just a product made in Hollywood, it is the history. Every single scene is so real that I couldn't help myself shivering with fear. It reveals the most brutal aspect of Khmer Rouge: like killing millions of civilians in the most barbarian way. To save bullets, Khmer Rouge made people half knee on the side of a very big hole and they simply chopped off people's heads mercilessly. The big hole then became a mass grave. When I came to the Killing Fields near Phnom Penh, there were still several mass graves which are so big. It is said that at least more than 150 were in each grave. The things I learned from Cambodia make me much believe the movie.One thing i like in the movie is that it tells the truth about Khmer Rouge cadres. They were all children  who had been very transparent before being trained into butchers. Phran made such a great escape for life.The film was produced in the year i was born. I heard of The Killing Fields so much but not until at the age of 21, i eventually saw it. I read about Khmer Rough, setting my feet on the ground which used to be grave, but not until seeing the film feel that ""crazy"" atmosphere stronger than ever.One of my regrets is that I failed to see the Cambodian map made of skeletons.

"Media talking about itself, and avoiding criticism of Communism","The awards and reviews for this film have come because it is a story about the media. Hollywood, newspapers and TV love stories which focus on themselves. This film suffers greatly by being the story of a journalist in Cambodia, rather than the holocaust itself.USA is bizarrely blamed for being the cause if the holocaust, while pol Pot is never mentioned. The Khmer Rouge are portrayed as plucky freedom fighters, while their Marxist ideaology and support from Soviet, China and North Vietnamese Communists is deliberately ignored. This reflects Western media bias which continues to favour Marxism.We need more films about how Communism is the greatest source of human suffering the world has seen, but unfortunately this film isn't one.

"of friendship, hidden motives, and the hazards of being slavish to dogma","The film depicts the relationship between New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg (played by Sam Waterston) and his Cambodian interpreter, fellow journalist Dith Pran (Portrayed by the late Dr. Haing S.

Although anybody can do a Wikipedia search on the people and the event and see what happened, it is the suspense and tension with which the events shown are presented that makes this a special film. It actually makes you feel ""you were there"" during the fall of Cambodia and the holocaust that followed.Sam Waterston didn't do that many films before his signature role as Jack McCoy on Law and Order, but he gives an intense performance here. Shanberg is one of the reporters deciding to stay in the danger zone and report on the Cambodian civil war, and on American bad acts during that war. He needs Pran as an interpreter and guide in a place where there are literally no Americans. But then comes the imminent fall of Cambodia to the Khmer Rouge, and Shanberg tells Pran he has to decide if he is to stay or go. And the question explored later on is, given that Shanberg decided to stay through the fall of Phnom Penh, did he subtly influence Pran to stay because he needed him?The genocide that followed the takeover of Cambodia by Pol Pot and his band are shown in all its horror. It makes me want to dig deeper and get the answer to the question - Did the American reporters who stayed behind just think that the Khmer Rouge were going to pass out lollipops and pat the little kids on the head and all would be hunky dory? This brings me to the hazards of being slavish to dogma. Pol Pot was a monster, but more than that he actually thought that these crazy ideas of his would work and instituted them en masse immediately. A good number of the up to three million dead in the three years that followed Pol Pot's rise to power were him actually believing you can transform a nation suddenly and completely and refusing to back down when he only brought ruin upon the land. But I'm sure he never missed a meal.There are great supporting performances by a young John Malkovich as a fellow journalist, and I tip my hat to Spaulding Grey who made a career of his one man show and documentaries built in part, at least, on his small role here.The thing that makes this really hard to watch besides the realistic horror of the war and the aftermath? There really are no ""good guys"" here. The Americans, the French, the Cambodian government pre and post Pol Pot, all had their hands dirty. I highly recommend this as this is practically a docudrama on the subject.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Timeless War Classic,"A war classic that exhibits the horrifying truths of the conflicting struggles in Cambodia as Roland Joffé brings a telling tale based on real events.Sydney Schanberg is a New York Times journalist who is assigned to cover the civil war in Cambodia with local representative Dith Pran to accommodate him on his trip. In such divided times, Schanberg is able to return home unchallenged, though for Pran, the rules are different.A simply astonishing display, capturing the strain and distress caused by such devastating affairs. The film is in a similar format to Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter starring Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, with its slow and careful approach, ensuring that all details are included and that the production is sincere and doesn't appear rushed.In addressing serious philosophical subjects, the movie's cast is what allows these topics to be explored with full strength; Haing S. Ngor, Sam Waterston and John Malkovich shine in their respective roles, portraying their characters to highlight the difficulties that each faced in tough conditions. The movie's brilliance was reinforced at the 1985 Academy Awards where it picked up three 'Oscar' wins for 'Cinematography' and 'film editing' as well as Ngor winning what would turn out to be his only Academy Award - receiving the honour for 'Best Supporting Actor'.Turning over $20 million in its Box Office was extremely impressive for the mid 1980s and The Killing Fields proved itself as an insightful, cultured spectacle that possesses an initiated polish to an already sublime script. The camerawork goes hand-in-hand with the sublime acting performances, in convincingly portraying the acts of pain and exhaustion.An eye-opening, jaw-widening, tear-dropping watch.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Killing Fields,"Sam Waterston is New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg on post in Cambodia as the civil war comes to it's violent, cruel conclusion. Working with local journalist Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor) they report on the rapidly deteriorating situation. When the American forces evacuate, Pran manages to get his family to safety but he can't leave himself and so Schanberg dedicates himself to the task of extricating his friend from the clutches of the brutal Pol Pot regime in the course of which he discovers just how extensive the ""Year Zero"" campaign that killed hundreds of thousands of the largely peaceful, agrarian population is. Roland Joffé has never made a better film; the poignancy with which he elicits loyalty and affection from the two principals, whilst at the same time pushing home the true horrors of the behaviour of the new government makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up- even now, 35 years later. The visions of skull strewn paddy fields coupled with a splendidly evocative score from Mike Oldfield really do hit home. The dialogue very much takes second place to that imagery; our eyes and ears do much of their own work with a sensitive, but really quite minimal guide from Bruce Robinson's screenplay. That's not a criticism; it's precisely nuanced to allow the story to breathe and develop in a truly engrossing manner that made me want to follow up. As an aside, having been to Cambodia in 2019, it is astonishing how this nation has healed after such a ghastly period in it's history, and I wonder how much that reconciliation had to do with the depiction in this film of just how horrific war can be.",7.0,Anonymous,History
When journalism was great,"Well, casting Julian Sands was the right decision because you can't go through hell without something beautiful to look at. He's gorgeous!

Yes, the film looks great, if you can stomach it, with the soundtrack that would make your hair stand on end. But, without the photojournalists in action, it would have been a little too boring. The most exciting scenes are the passport forging scenes. That one made me think - how I miss REAL MEN on screen. And in 'real life'. The four leading actors, Sam Waterston, Haing S.

"Necessary, but clumsy","The film provides a very partial, but astute overview of the situation in Cambodia in the 1970s, focussing in particular on the characters of two journalists - American Sydney Schanberg and Cambodian Dith Pran. The two play the part of witnesses to atrocities committed by the warring parties, mostly on innocent civilians - but their role in practice is much more central. Because this isn't a historical film, but rather a film about the enduring power of friendship.On that account, the film is a resounding success. Waterston and (especially) Ngor bring life to the drama between the characters, making their trials and tribulations painfully intimate. In fact, Joffe banks on this approach. He turns a film about a historical event into a series of vignettes populated by actors performing a very real-life tragedy. Because it's acted so ""authentically,"" the film works well enough to cover most of its faults.That soundtrack hasn't aged well, though.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Great Movie, Even with it's NY Times Slant","This was one of the all time great movies. My main peeve however, was the typical NY Times slant on the whole thing. Schanberg's leftist ranting made no sense in the long run. The domino theory was proved by these events, not disproved. If the US had stayed and supported South Vietnam and Cambodia, those tragedies would be avoided, ideas foreign to a leftist ranter like Schanberg. Bombing doesn't cause normal folks to turn into blood thirsty Communist tyrants. Did the people of London, Berlin, Tokyo or Malta massacre each other after WWll? The Khmer Rouge were merely following the well worn path of Communist tyranny and totalitarianism ala Stalin, Mao and Sung, but without the PR job that Ho and Fidel had! It was a real sad movie that did show the depth of evil that the Communists are capable of, the turning of the kids into Communist murderbots who had people killed because they wore glasses or had soft hands. The starvation and impoverishment of everyone except the ruling cadres should be a powerful antidote to the parasites who whine about the inequalities of capitalism. Unfortunately, the Khmer Rouge still persists today in a muted form, thanks to the mindless UN fools.",,Anonymous,History
A beautiful modern classic,"It's alright if you don't know your history before you watch The Killing Fields, Roland Jaffe's film that was nominated for eight Oscars and won eight BAFTAs in 1985; you'll gain a wealth of knowledge from watching the movie. It's a true story, focusing on the experiences and friendship of New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg, played by Sam Waterston, and Cambodian journalist Dith Pran, played by Haing S. Ngor, during the Cambodian Civil War in the 1970s.Beaten out by the incredibly overrated Amadeus, The Killing Fields should have absolutely won Best Picture. Not only is it a spectacular war picture, with surprises around every corner, realistic special effects and makeup, and harrowing struggles that will make you cringe and compel you to keep watching, but it's a beautiful, moving story of love and friendship. The two lead actors have such realistic chemistry together, it's sometimes difficult to separate them from their fictional roles. Haing S. Ngor lived a very sad life, and much of the film mirrors his own life experiences. The horrors he lives through in the film—and in real life, if you choose to look up his tragic backstory, which I don't really recommend—will bring you to tears more times than you'll be able to count.The Killing Fields will take you on an emotional roller-coaster, from fear to awe, horror, hope, sorrow, and inspiration. Some war movies are too upsetting to want to watch over again, but you're able to appreciate the craftsmanship and acting behind it. While the acting and production are fantastic, this is also a film that you can easily add to your home collection, watching it again and again with friends who haven't yet, so you can relive the emotions you felt during your first viewing. I've seen it three times, and each time, it has just as great an impact on my heart as the first. This is a modern classic that shouldn't be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,History
I like it!,"Despite its flaws, The Killing Fields is a movie that should not be missed. The film's world is depicted in a realistic manner, which is crucial. It accurately portrays the brutality and aftermath of war. The movie is a melancholic depiction that is far more truthful about the negative aspects and undesirable consequences of war than most Western films. The film begins by setting up the Cambodian situation, which allowed the Khmer Rouge to take over. The film is a reminder of America's decision to attack non-combatants. The destruction is enormous, and it feels like an Apocalypse Now set in Cambodia. The Killing Fields is a film about blood, tears, and screams and the role of journalists as photographers and observers of death. The Killing Fields portrays desperation and disorder as Cambodia spirals out of control.The film's world-building and portrayal of Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge regime is at its core. The story is fragmented, slowly revealing aspects of the complex event. The discovery of the title fields is the most shocking and revolting part, creating a powerful impact. However, the majority of the story is filled with artificially heightened moments created through editing and writing. Despite this, the storytelling is still impactful, and the manipulative scenes can be forgiven. It's important to note that The Killing Fields presents a unique perspective on history, showcasing individuals in exceptional and rare situations. The main characters are foreign journalists, not Cambodians, which is a significant departure from the story's focus on Cambodian journalist Dith Pran. Unfortunately, Dith Pran's arrest and release are primarily defined by his American colleague's viewpoint. Overall, the film highlights specific, intense events rather than providing factual information about this tragedy.And finally, the music is a bit of a problem. It's too loud and dramatic and sometimes seems silly instead of creating tension. In addition, the movie ends with John Lennon's ""Imagine,"" which is very cheesy. In this situation, what is there to dream about and be positive about? When the West was indirectly allied with the Khmer Rouge, it was uncomfortable to see The Killing Fields using ""Imagine."" Instead of offering practical solutions to alleviate the suffering of Cambodians, do you want to play a song that promotes a utopian world? It's nonsensical to use music instead of urging our governments to stop support for the perpetrators of such atrocities. Can a Western movie featuring the phrase ""Imagine all the people living in peace"" really help improve the lives of Cambodians?The Killing Fields is a significant piece of cinema that manages to tell a horrific story in a compelling manner. Although there are some minor concerns, the overall quality of the film is decent. However, in the grand scheme of things, the film falls short and has some limitations. Nevertheless, I commend the movie for its portrayal of Western involvement in Southeast Asia and for its ability to create a deeply emotional experience that leaves a lasting impact.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"intense and moving, full of brutal violence but also about the good in people","In the Killing Fields, there may be some things politically that you'll either not be fully aware of going in, or need to be brought up to speed on. The short of it that I know for sure is that the Vietnam war didn't stay completely within its borders, but rather spilled over into Cambodia, with the kind of guerilla warfare being raged, but more crucially (along with Nixon's own butchery intentions) rival gangs and groups were looking to gain control - and all of this at the cost of thousands of lives, mainly civilians' lives. What's good about the film politically is that it doesn't ask you necessarily to take a big side on one or the other in the Cambodian conflict, except as far as Pol Pot making madness and chaos even more extreme, and that the violence of these street gangs made into larger forms was horrible. But what's even better is that the emotional core, the pathos, is strong: this is a movie about friendship (writer Bruce Robinson, coincidentally, would make another key movie about friendship in the 80's in Withinail & I, on a totally different context of course).The friends - one might almost say lovers in the non-romantic, heterosexual sense - is author Sidney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and Dith Pran (Hang S Ngor, who won a deserved Oscar for his acting, which often feels very raw and wholly convincing, basically as though he was/is there). Sidney is there in Cambodia to get the scoop as a New York Times reporter, and not only won't soft-pedal anything, he despises the reporters sent/allowed in who will. Pran is nominally his translator, but he is a reporter as well (we don't see much of that aspect, but it's not difficult to see his serious intentions to get things down as they are). The two of them finds that they're stuck in the country as things become even more harried; the greatest tension and suspense of the film isn't even about being under the barrel of guns held by certain guerilla soldiers (though that's part of it) - it's simply how to get Pran out of the country.One may ask why Sidney just didn't get Pran out when he does, in fact, get Pran's family out. Maybe there was just more work to do. Maybe it was simpler that way and for Pran to stay it was necessary for the very on-the-street-on-the-run reporting that Sidney was looking for. But whatever the motivation, the centerpiece of the film for me all comes down to a photograph - this is what's needed for Pran to get a passport and go along with the Americans and French out of the country (it is explained why Cambodians can't leave, but it's not completely clear, or at much as it could've been for me).We see how Malkovich, as a photojournalist, takes the painstaking task of taking pictures on a beat-up, nearly broken camera, and has to develop the film in a very cramped bathroom with unlikely chemicals. It's not totally a spoiler to say it doesn't end up working - for half of the film, Pran is in a prison camp and it then becomes a 'how-does-he-escape' scenario - but this section is for me the most effective: trumping the violence of the world through the process of photography (if not art, then close enough), and just seeing the moment-by-moment events of that sequence is staggering.Of course, there's much violence here, and in a way this was a nice antidote to the barrage of mindless, at best usually guilty-pleasure action fare of the 1980's. Instead of something like Rambo 2, where one man goes in and single-handedly takes on the entire Vietnamese army, this is more like 'hey, you really have to be very, very careful here, because the one wrong thing said or done can get you shot in the head, immediately, or, if in prison, worse via torture'.Some of the events in the first act move rather quickly, but the important thing is that we get to learn who these people are, especially Sidney and Pran, and this is crucial for the emotional stakes: will they be torn apart, and if they are, can they reunite again? I kind of wish I hadn't looked up the trivia for the film ahead of time as I got in a way spoiled as the ultimate outcome (one hopes for the 'happy ending', though here that's especially relative). The tension mounts so well in the second half because we know, as capable as Pran is at thinking on his toes and acting quickly, he's up against a truly formidable, horrifying presence in these soldiers, all trained to the gills for brutal executions.If there is a political message it comes in a rather operatic moment: Sidney is back in New York and watching what looks like a primitive version of a VHS tape of some old news broadcast; it talks about Nixon's message to the American people about what the plan was for Cambodia, and how it was not the bill of goods he was selling. One almost gets the sense that had Nixon really had his way, Pran could've been wiped out by a barrage of bombs. But, again, The Killing Fields is interested in politics only up to a point: the power of the film comes from its male bond, and its depiction of survival and how one can keep a head when surrounded by death and destruction. A very good film of its time, and it holds up extremely well.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Interesting true story of friendship and survival, set against the backdrop of one of history's most oppressive regimes","Interesting true story of friendship and survival, set against the backdrop of one of history's most oppressive regimes.Set against the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia in the 1970s, the true story of New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg (played by Sam Waterston) and his Cambodian interpreter Dith Pran (Haing S Ngor). They are there in 1973 when Cambodia is a side-theatre of the Vietnam conflict. At this time the Khmer Rouge are on the rise but not a major threat. Then we jump forward to 1975 and the Khmer Rouge have the upper hand and are about to take control of the country. The US, and other countries, are evacuating personnel. Though both of them have an opportunity to leave too, Schanberg and Dith Pran decide to stay to cover what happens next. This will ultimately put Dith Pran's life in grave danger as the Khmer Rouge's reign over Cambodia was one of oppression and genocide.Interesting, though a bit dry. The movie starts very slowly and takes a very long time to find a second gear. Even when things do start to fall into place and you get to understand where the story is going, things still don't really move at more than a moderate pace.However, the last 40 minutes or so more than make up for this. We see the extent of the Khmer Rouge's oppression and atrocities, and the movie becomes a powerful, tense story of resourcefulness and survival. Great, emotional ending.Solid work by Sam Waterston as Sydney Schanberg. Haing S Ngor, a Cambodian doctor and refugee with no previous acting experience, gives a great performance as Dith Pran and well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar.The cast also includes John Malkovich (in only his second feature film), Julian Sands (third feature film) and Craig T Nelson, all of which give fine performances.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"a strong movie, despite the second-half stumble","Civil wars and political upheaval can often bring out the best elements in a film: suspense, emotion, and the immediacy of current events, in this case turning yesterday's headlines into a grim but gripping human drama. The 1975 collapse of Cambodia and subsequent 're-education' of its population (through brainwashing and genocide) by Khmer Rouge insurgents is reconstructed through an unlikely but true friendship between two journalists from opposite ends of the globe: hard-nosed New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg and his resourceful Cambodian counterpart Dith Pran. From their anxious refuge inside the French Embassy in Phnom Penh to the horrors of a post-revolution work camp, the film builds moments of agonizing intensity, although the latter half splits into separate stories of unequal impact: Schanberg, in New York, agonizes verbally and at length over the unknown fate of his friend, while Pran, in the newly named Kampuchea, endures a torment that surpasses words. The performances in general and the cinematography in particular merit special attention, with the moody colors suggesting the light of a solar eclipse: darkness in broad daylight.",8.0,Anonymous,History

An Incredible Movie,"What an incredible movie. It was incredibly moving, incredibly sad, and incredibly real. Sam Waterson was wonderful as the lead character, Sydney Schanberg, a New York Times columnist covering the Vietnam War.I had only known Sam Waterson as Jack McCoy from Law & Order. I like his performance as Jack McCoy--a moralistic but bland district attorney--but this character and performance as Sydney Schanberg is light years ahead of the well suited and often cozy Jack McCoy.What I don't know about the Vietnam War could fill volumes. And what I know about its spill over into Cambodia and the atrocities there is even less. The Killing Fields was a deep plunge into the bloody conflict going on in Cambodia and two reporters that braved it to cover it.Sydney Schanberg was a New York Times reporter being accompanied by Dith Pran (Dr. Haing S. Ngor), his driver, translator, companion, and also a journalist himself. As bombs were being dropped, bullets were being fired, and they were hustled to and fro at gunpoint, they tried to make deadlines and report the truth.For me, war movies are never an easy watch, and this was probably one of the hardest. The imagery of dead and dismembered bodies is so visceral that it snaps you out of whatever revelry you were in. Though there were multiple scenes that jarred me, one of the most jarring was that of a toddler covering his ears and crying as bullets flew and bombs exploded all around him. It was such a heavy impactful moment. Almost as if that scene was inserted in the movie to let you know who were the biggest losers and hurt the most in all of this. The movie would only plunge the viewer deeper in despair before giving him a modicum of relief.As horrendous, desperate, and anxious this movie was I loved it. I didn't love it like I love a Marvel movie in which everything that is occurring is fictitious and I can root for the good guy over the bad and all the destruction will be repaired by the next installment. I loved it for its authenticity and for punching me in the gut as it did. If I only loved it for letting me know that I haven't been desensitized by constant movie violence then that would be enough. But I loved it for more than that and one of the bigger reasons was the human bond made between Sydney and Dith Pran.

( you will see a haunting and strange ghostly image of the World Trade Center..anyone from NYC will notice this). The scenes of Vietnam and Cambodia are striking, because anyone who has lived in South Florida will see a similarity in climate and landscape, except for the mountains. Southeast Asia from a visual standpoint was respected by its people, Buddhists primarily, who respect their earth, animals and life source.I watched this over five times because it strikes me how little the brutalization, alienation and starkness of any war affects a person if they were in America at the time. I did not see the end of ""Saving Private Ryan"" because, although I wanted to watch it...my fiancée at the time couldn't ""handle the brutality and blood"".....what does this say.....what does it really say?...... I or any student wanting to learn about Vietnam must read the factual essays. The white phosphorus killings and attacks on villages are felt here, but not shown explicitly.I am struck by the sad and brutal fact that my family members fought, yet little is spoken about, whether Iraq or Vietnam was necessary. This is a tragedy. Even more so today.""The Deerhunter"" I recall my parents watching and remarking on the cold alienation of it. "" Who'll Stop the Rain"" an interesting piece with Nick Nolte and Tuesday Weld , but addresses only one part of the issue;it probably barely scratches the surface.There is so much to be learned and understood. It may not be pleasant but it is is real reality unlike the trash TV currently offered as pablum to American audiences who know better....or at least should know better if they have read any history since 9th grade. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"So Vivid, So Real, So Sad... is our world is really this bad??","The movie contains many incredibly realistic details worth being praised and exalted, but in this case what should be focused on is not the way the movie was made or even how detailed every scene was, instead the actual story, the story of the loves of those people who were deeply affected, those who had to give up so much for a cause they believed in.The Story Line was very well written, organized and realistic. It didn't miss a beat and answered all the questions we could come up with, leaving us with a soar feeling in our hearts and in our minds, in ever sense of the word, this movie is an eye opener. We take so many things for granted and yet, hundreds of thousands if not millions of people were killed while we were relaxing in our comfortable air conditioned homes. I know it's not our fault for being born into a world that contains such extreme violence but if people weren't so ignorant of the world around them then maybe the world could be a better place with more people willing to take action upon those things that are not morally right.",,Anonymous,History
Reality on Screen,"This movie is ""THE"" best movie ever. It shows how the Cambodian people suffered from Communism, violence and war. Nothing about this movie is untrue. All that is shown in the movie is the sad truth of what happened back then. If you have to read, watch a movie or anything that will help you get to know what happened to Cambodia back in the 70's, this is the movie to see. It'll probably make you cry. All the actors in the movie played beautifully. The thing about this movie is that it's a true story, so there is no plot to worry about. The only thing to worry about is how good the true story is represented. And let me tell you, this movie is a master piece: this film will immerse you inside it.

"A detailed and realistic Vietnam film, but slow at times","My mother bought, ""The Killing Fields,"" on DVD yesterday for the whole family. I never really heard about the movie and as I read about it, I thought it would be like another Apocalypse Now kind of film. My father said that it was a really good, so I decided to watch it with my brother and dad. The movie was very realistic with good performances by Sam Waterston and Dr. Haing S. Ngnor who an academy award for the picture. It was a depressing movie and very detailed and sharp but it lacks from giving me a ""big bang."" I thought the movie was going to be stimulating and wanted you to have more but to me it didn't and the film got really slow. I'm not saying the film was bad because it wasn't, it was a good movie and was different from other war films in which I liked.

Spoilers !  The best film of all time,"When I saw the Killing Fields back in 1984 I had read some of the reviews. Many reviews were rating this film as a love story. I went to see it just to find out what they were talking about. The first twenty minutes was a bit long but then it begun to warm up. The Cambodian situation was dreadful and certainly not a part of history anyone can be proud about. The Americans did nothing to help the people of Cambodia and it seem to be a repeat of Vitnam all over again. As you get into the film, you begin to sense that both Pran and Sydney were in a very dangerous situation. The French Embassy scene was the most heart rendering moment of the film. The reviews were right. It was a love story. I rate this film as one of the best films of all time. There was nothing ""Hollywood"" on it's label. It was gritty,dramatic, and very sad yet it was a true story which does have a happy ending.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Good movie of a bad time.,"The Killing Fields is an excellent film on many levels; at the least, it should be considered a good introductory film for those that want to realize the Cambodian people's suffering during the Cambodian revolution. However, it could also be considered a strong advocate against  war in general, particularly those with U.S. involvement--lest we forget how the U.S. tends to leave most areas worse off when they have no further use for them (think Liberia, Chile, Iraq...).The only downer to this film would be that the soundtrack/musical score leaves one wondering if the director was under the influence of illicit drugs at times.  One example of this, as others have mentioned here, is the song, ""Imagine"" by (a hypocritical) John Lennon.  While most would agree the basic premise of this song (peace/ending war) is very touching and would be appropriate, Lennon's tirade about having no possessions, no religion, etc. ends up sounding an awful like a Pol-Pot theme song.One note on the scene in which the Pran's picture fades... Apparently, this was entirely fictional and years later when Al Rockoff was interviewed about it he was visibly p***ed off that that scene was in the movie as it seemed like a discredit to his photographic abilities.",,Anonymous,History
A Milestone!,"'The Killing Fields' is about the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, which is based on the experiences of three journalists: Cambodian Dith Pran, American Sydney Schanberg and Briton Jon Swain.Now, 'The Killing Fields' is a really violent film. Faint-Hearted, stay away from this one. For those who don't mind Gore in Cinema, miss anything, but not, 'The Killing Fields'. It's an outstanding film, that proves yet again that bloodshed never wins.'The Killing Fields' unfolds with gore and ends with it too. This entire incident that took place in Cambodia, was a failure. Nobody won, be it the violent communist or the hand-over Government. It's sad to know that violence can be done till this level, where millions of people are brutally killed and tortured. Human-Kind needs the simplest reason, to bring in a sickle in it's hand to create a ruckus.'The Killing Fields' is brilliantly directed and acted. Roland Joffé has directed the film with flourish. The performances are absolutely flawless. The late Dr. Haing S. Ngor pitches in an Excellent performance as Dith Pran. Sam Waterston as Sydney Schanberg is outstanding. John Malkovich has done a swell job as well.On the whole, this true-human-tragedy unfolds remarkably in this acclaimed 1980's film. Very Strongly Recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,History

I was not only interested in the movie for it's war theme, but more importantly, for the theme of the incredible friendship between the two main characters. Such caring is rare and hard to find, and the beauty of the love between those two friends eclipsed all the horrors and struggles of the war depicted in the movie. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack is also one of my favorite movie soundtracks of all time. The backdrop of the music really does a fantastic job of giving the movie the impact that it has.

A Rousing Film About a Bloody Subject,"A visceral, kinetic and exciting film from Roland Joffe (whatever happened to him?).Set against the bloody backdrop of Cambodia during the civil war that saw the surge of the Khmer Rouge, ""The Killing Fields"" tells the story of an interpreter (the non-actor Haing S. Ngor) who befriends an American journalist (Sam Waterston) and then descends into the nightmare of Cambodia while Waterston sits helplessly in America wondering if his friend is dead or alive. It's one of those liberal films Hollywood loves to make, that asks us to feel guilty about our cushy American lives even as people in other countries are being butchered. It's not heavy handed or manipulative though, and Joffe films the whole thing with a journalistic approach that fits the subject matter and lends the film a documentary-like quality.Ngor, who had never acted before, is amazing, and though Waterston gets top billing as the most recognizable actor, Ngor is the film's true star.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,History
Ambiguous to a fault,"After all I'd heard about this film, I was pretty disappointed on several counts.The film makes it pretty clear that Dith Pran stayed in Cambodia mainly for the sake of Schanberg. At first the claim is that because Pran's a journalist he feels a moral obligation to stay behind, implying that he intends to cover the Khmer Rouge's takeover, but later says that he'd ""do anything"" for his Western colleague. So his intentions are not made clear, and this is a pretty important part of the movie. I could be mistaken, but there seems to be an almost sexual tension between the two main characters. The way the director deftly avoids this issue by allowing Pran's intentions to contradict each other from act to act leaves an unforgivable hole in the plot. And either way, it's not hard to take issue with the outcome: on one hand Killing Fields becomes an unsettling and sadistic paean to self-destructive altruism a la Breaking the Waves, and on the other it's a story of love across cultures, with Schanberg seeming like a domineering and selfish lover.Nonetheless, Pran is well portrayed as a man who genuinely cares about life. He is forced to steal to keep himself alive, but later selflessly risks his own life to save that of a child. Pran negotiates the release of several journalists, even though in doing so he loses a little pride by almost kowtowing to the captors. Perhaps the variances and apparent contradictions in his character are merely true-to-life portrayals of the extremes to which the vicissitudes of history propel us.",,Anonymous,History
Recuerdos de la Alhambra,"At the end of the movie a beautiful interpretation of Recuerdos de la Alhambra, by Francisco Tarrega is playing.

But, unfortunately, no credit is given to this gorgeous piece of music in the credits, why? Recuerdos de la Alhambra is a must in every guitarist repertoire. It has also been arranged for other instruments and orchestra. I believe it deserves full credit. The version played in the movie is a very special one, I believe they used Cambodian instruments to make such a great version. Credit is given to John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Franco Corelli, the artists who played this music deserve to be recognized too.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of the great films of the last 100 years.,"Seeing the Pianist after re-watching 'The Killing Fields' for the what seems like the 10th time, I feel compelled to make a comment. Compared to 'Schindler's List' and 'The Pianist',  both of which seem to be somewhat less than the sum of their parts,in contrast 'The Killing Fields' distinguishes itself by being more than the sum of its parts and is indeed one of the great achievements in cinema. As someone here said, ""Sam Waterston is at his self-righteous best..."", that is so true. But, Haing Ngor is a revelation! His performance is one of the great acting performances ever. I know that is a mouthful and sounds preposterous but it is absolutely true. This film reaches out and grabs you by the throat and engages you emotionally without bludgeoning like 'Schindler's List'.There is not an extra minute or unnecessary scene in the entire movie, as there is in 'The Pianist'. The supporting roles are given the time and space to make their impact and the acting is top notch. The photography is unbelievably real and beautiful as well as sensitive and nuanced. The direction is as tight as in a great thriller but respectful and beautifully paced. A Triumph. It disturbs me to note that this film is number 240 something out of the top 250 and 'The Pianist' number 29! That is shocking and not at all indicative of the relative merits of the two films. This says to me that many of the people who watch films and vote on this website are sorely lacking in a real knowledge of film history and indeed of history itself. Thus they are taken in by Hollywood's 'PC' attitudes these days and are unable to make distinctions between mediocre and great or or even between fact and fancy. Is this because of the youthful age of many of these people? My guess is yes. Many of the so-called generation 'X-ers' and their successors have been treated to a dizzying menu of mediocre films from Hollywood for the last 15 years or so. They missed the great films of Hollywood's apotheosis, they missed the New wave and also the great films of the '70's and lastly they missed the stunning films that came out in the early and mid '80's. I can only say that every film lover should go back into the vaults and look again or for the first time at some of these great films and then come back and look once more at 'The Killing Fields' and 'The Pianist' and then put them in their proper place. I give the this film a 10/10 and put it in my own top 20, if not top 10 of all time. That's where it belongs here at IMDB.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Great Movie, flawed by didactic elements","The Killing Fields has endured as an excellent film about post-colonial wars in Southeast Asia. The cinematography, acting and music are all superb, as is the script. However, it is at points over-the-top (as was the journalism of its main character, NY Times correspondent Syndey Schanberg) in blaming the U.S. for the civil war and the inhumanity of the Khmer Rouge. How many times and ways can you blow up Coca Cola? I'm nearly convinced that they actually paid for product placement--the poison-beverage showed up so often in the movie as a metaphor for American materialism, decadence, soft imperialism, corruption, etc. Vending machines, bottle distribution facilities, restaurant signs...Coke is always being spilled--almost as much as blood. (For the most blatant placement of Coke products--nay, a two-hour commercial for the product--see, no, don't see!, ""Strictly Ballroom""). Additionally, the Schanberg/Waterson character's self-righteousness and persistent blaming of US policy (""Maybe we didn't realize that so-much tonnage of bombs and billions of dollars spent on it's military could unleash such insanity"" or some garbage like that). Still, a very powerful film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A reporter film,"I refer to this film as a reporter film since it reminds me of Salvador and some other similar films were reporters are the main characters and the film unveils through their reporting experience of the horrors of some country. The Killing Fields is not a very good reporter film, it doesn't have the effectivity of Salvador and also I have a personal dislike of Sam Waterston, I am not sure why this is so. Maybe because I have seen him in so many b-level tv-movies and shows such as Law&Order and his somewhat preachy posture in his films.The story is an important one and it deserves to be told but the film doesn't suck the viewer in very well, possibly this is due to the fact that the Cambodian/Kampuchean conflicts are not as widely known and filmed as is e.g. the Vietnam war. Anyway, I suppose the film is good in that it tries to tell an important story and enlighten the audience.Something that was said by an earlier reviewer caught my attention, even though the film doesn't focus on the support that the NVA gave to Pol Pot and his movement I would definately not deem this film as false because of this. Also the fact that it was the Vietnamese army that finally toppled Pol Pot's reign is an indicator that he was not a very popular figure in the _very_ shattered sphere of communistic countries. I do not see this film as particularily anti-american or anti-nixon, the most poignant points are made about the actual acts of genocide committed by the Pol Pot regime.Anyway, this film is a fictive tale of horrific events that still haunt the lives of millions of Cambodians. 5/10",,Anonymous,History

A remarkable film that deserves to be viewed and that recalls a barbaric moment in the history of a country.,"When there's a war, there's bound to be a film about what happened during that same war. Human conflicts have always fueled the film industry. It's something instinctive, we are attracted to the horror of carnage at the same time that we feel guilty about it, and we get tired of condemning violence and cruelty. I think that only those who have lived through a war have the ability to overcome this paradox, not only because of the memories evoked, sometimes traumatic, but also because of the awareness that there is nothing truly beautiful about this.What happened in Cambodia (and Rwanda, Bosnia and other countries) was much worse than a war. It was a genocide, a crime against humanity carried out due to the political fanaticism of a small group of ""men"" who tried to impose their own vision of the world and kill anyone who disagreed. What this film does is give us a flavor of what happened, bringing us the true (obviously fictionalized) story of a Cambodian journalist who, in 1973, saved the lives of a group of colleagues from the West, but ended up being left behind. Behind, imprisoned in a Cambodian prison camp.I think I wouldn't be incorrect if I said that, considering the documentaries I've seen on the subject, the film shows a very light and attenuated view of the cruelties that happened there at the time. Roland Joffé balanced it well, giving the film a raw realism without making it excessively graphic, and focusing on the emotional charge, on the emotions that everything can awaken in the audience. We don't need to see more than what we see to feel the pain of those people and the fear they went through.Sam Waterston does an interesting job as an American journalist who desperately tries to find the man to whom he feels he owes his life. Julian Sands and John Malkovich also appear, but they don't have much time or material to stand out, limiting themselves to what they can do. Who is in the spotlight, with all merit, is Haing S. Ngor, a Cambodian actor who gave life to the central character of this story and who knew very well the horror that his country had gone through: he himself had seen the realities that he interpreted as actor, and had been a prisoner of the Khmer Rouge. Therefore, there is a painful load of realism in his interpretation that permeates the screen and reaches us, and to which we cannot and cannot remain indifferent.Technically, the film is perfect: filmed mostly in Thailand, it makes good use of the settings and creates something we can believe in. The sets and costumes are the most realistic there is, and the cinematography is a bit reminiscent of those old war films in Vietnam. There are good special effects and some anthology-worthy scenes, such as the one that shows us the prison camps and the ""brainwashing"" that their captors were subject to force. The soundtrack is not always effective, sometimes it sounds excessively melodramatic, but it is the only drawback to a remarkable production, which deserves to be seen, again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Gut-wrenching Depiction of Post-Viet Nam Era Will Stay with You,"The 1970's was a time of tremendous political upheaval in the US. In The Killing Fields, Cambodia is the canvas, while politics, journalism, friendship, and the human will are the paints used to depict an in-your- face, true story of survival against all odds.The US government takes its lumps as we abuse, then abandon a people who are then embroiled in a bloody internal cleansing that kills several million Cambodians. The journalists Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and local Dith Pran (Dr Ngor) capture and transmit the daily atrocities back to the states for US consumption.Dr Ngor was an actual survivor of the real Killing Fields. How he had he courage to portray Dith Pran, I don't know, but it speaks to the courage he had, and apparently to promises he made to his wife to educate the world about what happened in Cambodia. That Dr Ngor won an Academy Award is astonishing, but after you watch this movie, you really feel like you lived through this horrific event because of Ngor's tremendous performance.Sam Waterston also turned in a strong performance as Shanberg. He realizes he took advantage of Pran as a means to his own ends, but by then, it's too late. Waterston was at his best when he stands toe to toe with Army reps, like Craig T. Nelson (from Coach), or the politicians. But near the end, when he has to take criticism from his own colleague who was with him (terrific performance by John Malkovich by the way), Waterston has no valid reply, and he knows it.The war scenes are incredibly real, the suffering in the killing fields is palpable, and the hopelessness of those trying to stem the entire unimaginable craze of hatred overtaking the Khmer Rouge is smothering.Some scenes are a bit long, and the ending would have been better without that particular song,which introduced a bit too much of a Hollywood ending at just the wrong time. Still, this is a must-see film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The Killing Fields,"We recently watched The Killing Fields in my Modern War class. It was definitely one of the most moving movies I have seen in a long time. We all hear about the Cold War without really knowing what it is, and how many people it really affected and how many people died or lost a loved one. The movie wasn't too gory it did a good job on showing details without exaggerating it. The United States was scared of people traveling along the Ho Chi Minh trail and that is why they decided to attack Cambodia. As US intelligence received reports of communist supply movements within Cambodian territory, the CIA began to recruit Vietnamese of ethnic Cambodian descent and to infiltrate the border and stop the flow of shipments. In the movie we saw how the Khmer Rouge really did torture the people from the middle class. The history part of this film is an incredible one that many more people should know about. Mostly every scene is full of images that are very beautiful that represent Cambodia. It is hard to imagine so many horrible things happening in such a beautiful place.

Go search it out and watch a piece of truly horrifying history within living memory.,"'The Killing Fields', is Roland Joffé's ground-breaking, British-made drama about the Kymer Rouge's brutal, 5-year regime in Cambodia. This Academy award-winning film, made in 1984, tells the true story of an American newspaper journalist, (Sydney Schanberg) and his Cambodian Assistant, (Pran) before, during and after the takeover by Pol Pot and his murderous Khmer Rouge regime.The film is beautifully directed, shot and acted and it accurately portrays a truly harrowing and heart-breaking period in Cambodia's recent history. The Killing Fields should be compulsory viewing for anyone who lives in this region, particularly in Thailand, Cambodia or Vietnam. This genocide only took place some 37 years ago, yet for most people under thirty, they have little or no knowledge of what took place, right on their doorstep. Here in Thailand, there seems to be universal ignorance of tragic events that happened so close to their common border. Estimates of the total number of deaths resulting from Khmer Rouge policies during the period they controlled the country (1975-1979), including from disease and starvation, range from 1.7 to 2.5 million out of a population of around 8 million, or give or take, 25% of the population. One American reviewer recently described this film as 'The Ultimate Ugly American Movie' and goes on to say: '.that amazing film about the human price of American involvement in Southeast Asia.' The film includes some 'telling references' about America's dubious role in the terrible events that overtook Cambodia, such as: ""After what the Khmer Rouge have been through, I don't think they'll be exactly affectionate toward Westerners."" (spoken by a US embassy official) and: ""Maybe we underestimated the anger that $7 billion in bombing would unleash."" (Sydney Schanberg.)During the U.S. war in Vietnam, Cambodia was embroiled in a bloody civil war between the communist Khmer Rouge, backed by China and North Vietnam, and Cambodian government forces backed by the U.S. From 1969-73, the U.S. military covertly carpet-bombed eastern Cambodia in an attempt to disrupt North Vietnamese operations and defend the government against the Khmer Rouge, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Cambodian citizens. For a country which at the time had a population of about 6 million, the losses were enormously devastating. Amongst the Cambodian populace, resentment grew against the U.S. and what was perceived as the American ""puppet government"" in Phnom Penh. The Khmer Rouge represented resistance to the U.S. and consequently, as bombs continued to fall, Cambodian citizens flocked to join them.Sydney Schanberg, who was a New York Times reporter and renowned for his experience in Cambodia at the time, said the Khmer Rouge "" would point at the bombs falling from B-52s as something they had to oppose if they were going to have freedom. And it became a recruiting tool until they grew to a fierce, indefatigable guerrilla army."" Eventually, the Khmer Rouge were able to overwhelm the government forces and establish control over Cambodia, leading to Pol Pot's ""agrarian revolution"", the killing fields, the torture centres and the loss of some 2 million Cambodian lives.In his memoirs, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has denied that the U.S. is at all responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge.But bitterly recounted descriptions of the bombings by survivors of the Khmer Rouge terror demonstrate that there is little to separate the U.S. bombings and Khmer Rouge brutality in the minds of Cambodian survivors. Who better to determine accountability than those who most directly suffered? It is impossible to say for certain, but such personal accounts are a powerful condemnation of the bombings and evidence that the U.S. government at the time was significantly responsible for what occurred thereafter.It is impossible to know for sure whether the bombing of Cambodia from 1969-73 led directly or indirectly, to massive suffering and the deaths of a full one-third of Cambodia's population at the time. But worse is the dysfunction caused by that tragedy which continues to profoundly affect Cambodian society to this day. I have been to Cambodia several times in recent years, and it was a very rare occurrence when I met anyone over 40 years of age.If you missed the Killing Fields when it was first released, or you were too young - or yet to be born - go search it out and watch a piece of truly horrifying history within living memory.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Human Emotion in a world of Horror,"Seeing the film again some 20 years after its premiere, its harrowing realism, its intense and gut-wrenching scenes of violence and desperation, its incredible suspense and riveting tale of survival is as powerful and heartbreaking today-- perhaps even more so. We can only compare the experiences of the Cambodian nation and people with all the subsequent horror stories--whether in Rwanda or Bosnia or Iraq. The film has, at its core, an amazing story to tell. But notice how so many of the scenes are filled with images of all of the innocents caught up in the unfolding horror story. There are so many close-ups of the ""extras""--their faces filled with sorrow, or disbelief--or blankly staring out like masks of good and evil. The final closeup photos of young and old-- innocents caught up in the awesome and incomprehensible history of a tortured land are absolutely haunting. You sit through the movie and keep asking yourself--why, why, why does such cruelty exist on this earth. I recently visited Cambodia, and the breath-taking beauty of its culture and cultural history, the warmth and friendliness of its people makes the events of the late 20th century almost impossible to believe. And yet the events occurred.The film is emotionally overwhelming--and what gets the viewer through the harrowing scenes are those scenes of basic human decency. As there are endless scenes of violence in the film, there are equally as many scenes of human kindness and compassion--scenes of the love of family members, of the dedication of the doctors helping those who are almost beyond help, of the desperate concern of all of Dith Pran's colleagues vainly trying to help him and of the heartfelt friendship of Dith Pran and Sydney Schanberg. Maybe basic human decency and those emotions of love and compassion is what is helping Cambodia recover, and will help all of the desperate people in this world caught up in war and conflict to eventually recover.

"The most well made film I have ever seen, also the most disturbing.","The Killing Fields is a very well made film, and very well acted, with a message far more deep than any war film. This film is breathtaking epic that can't be missed.The Killing Fields, is not just an ordinary war film, for it is not about war, it is about people, this film has almost no characters that are ""Good Guys"" instead, most of the characters are manifested as ""Bad Guys"", it is also about society and the pointlessness of mindless violence.The Killing Fields also has incredible music that always manages to perfectly express the mood of the scene. Possibly the best thing about the film is the ending, it manages to, with almost no words express the entire message of the film.The Killing Fields is an un miss able movie that manages to characterize people, not war, as most wars films do, in fact it characterizes people so well that it becomes apparent that people love war, but it doesn't have to be that way.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Otherwise great film held back by political baggage,"Just about all the other comments on this movie are on the money.  Great script, great cinematography, emotionally powerful, great acting, etc.And yet...I just can not enjoy it as much as I should because of the anti-American premise that is the centerpiece of the story.  The filmmakers essentially blame the Cambodia genocide on America!  As if America was directing Pol Pot in his massacre of two million of his people!  I can not BELIEVE this film totally neglected to explain who the Khmer Rouge were, why they did what they did, and what they were trying to accomplish.  Of course, the American involvement in Vietnam and Cambodia is expounded upon and criticized in great detail, but they don't even mention Pol Pot, not once!  That tells you all you need to know right there; the film is more interested in giving America yet another black eye than telling the story of the Cambodian people.  What should have been a vivid illustration and condemnation of the communist butchers America was FIGHTING AGAINST in southeast Asia (which is what I thought it was when I rented it), instead falls back on the tired liberal line of ""blame America first"".There is a REASON ""Schindler's List"" will always be remembered before this movie.  That movie had nothing to do with the politics and confusion of war and international policy; all it wanted to do was tell a story about the perseverance of people during the lowest period of human history.  Sadly, I can not say the same for ""Killing Fields"".",,Anonymous,History

After visiting Cambodia, the S21 prison museum and the Killing Fields outside the capital city, it became more important for me to see this movie. This film is consistent with the stories I heard from so many Cambodians. The images in the film are also consistent with the personal narratives that I read in such the book, the Children of Cambodias's Killing Fields. For example, the total evacuation of the capital is shown. Random assassinations and the general brutality of the Khumer Rouge are brought to light. Life in communal forced work camps that existed throughout the country are also portrayed in the film. The movie reminded me of ""The Year of Living Dangerously,"" especially the evacuation of Westerners Phnom Penh (similar to the evacuation of Saigon) and the desperate attempts of the locals to get out at the last minute.

Why doesn't the left ever blame the actual criminals?,"This could have been an excellent movie but it is ruined by looking at the genocide from the perspective of an anti American NYT journalist. He is a very selfish character and just like leftists today, won't acknowledge the root cause of the atrocities committed.
The directing is not that great as there are many scenes that I was removed from the picture and remembered I'm watching actors. The cinematography was the best part of the film. They should have only told the story of Pran and his trek to survival. There isn't even a mention of Pol Pot or the details of what was really going on. Everything was simplified to focus on a annoying NYT reporter. All of the dialogue of Khmer Rouge is unknown since there are no subtitles. What a shame.",,Anonymous,History
great movie,"In my opinion, ""the killing fields"" was a great movie and is probably one of my favorite war movies. It's not the normal war movie with a bunch of soldiers shooting it up and killing the enemy like what ""full metal jacket"" and other movies like it portray. Instead, ""the killing fields"" shows more of the consequences that war has on the innocent people of the country. This movie was also good because it was very informative. The civil war of Cambodia isn't the most talked about war in history and this one shows first hand the brutality and horror Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge brought upon the people of Cambodia. The story line between Sydney and his friend Dith Pron is vivid and moving, and helps give a clear example of what it was like to live in Cambodia at that time. To me, this movie was very good and i highly recommend watching it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Cambodia, bloody fields of death","This great Salvadorian type movie for me was one cinematic experience, as I was two months shy of my fifteenth birthday. I had seen it with my folks. I opted to see Beverley Hills Cop, my Mum opted for Places In The Heart. Dad opted for this. He won, and I'm glad he did. I had overheard an old woman saying ""Fancy letting a kid like that into a film like this"". All I can say, is I'm glad I was, as this film opened my eyes to the realities and horror of war. Although more a political film, than a war movie, The Killing Fields has some stark and confronting images, one I never got out of my head, was that blood being swept off the top of that staircase like rubbish. The Killing Fields is a biographical account of two tight journalists, one who's really experienced war, up close, a first hand witness to the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge. Unfortunately this journo, Dith Pran ( wonderfully played by the ""much left us too soon actor"" Haing S 'Ngor who really puts real life into the role- Oscar naturel) becomes a hostage, but manages to escape, another haunting scene has him wading quietly through a canal of skulls. It really becomes a vital want for audience through gruelling suspense to see this guy get back with his journalist mate. We really fear for him. The film has a surprise cast, none more than Graham Kennedy, while Waterston still, I believe, did his best work here in the lead as Pran's hot shot journo mate, while unearthed here too, was the great John Malcovich, and obscure star, then, Julian Sands, completing the chain of journo's.

This movie isn't good without a thorough cambodian history lesson,"Now, first off ill confess that i require 2 senses to watch a movie (sight and sound). This movie's music was just horrible, it didn't exist in most parts where there should have at least been some type of chasm. The parts that actually did have music just sounded awful and ill-placed. For example when phran is walking along the lake and you see the massive amount of skeletons all over, there isn't any noticeable music playing for a little while. Then all of a sudden they start playing some scary music like he never actually saw the skeletons until after walking around for 5 minutes. There was another part where a helicopter was flying around and they played some horrific sound that didn't even seem like music at first, but apparently it was.The other issue about this movie is they did a terrible job of outlining the plot. They used a lot more filler then they needed to and it ultimately droned out the plot of the story. This movie could have easily been an hour or 1.5 hours long.One more thing about this movie is you never fully understood what was going on in the scenes. For example in the beginning of the movie when phran and sydney are captured? and sydney is all complaining about how he needs to go so he tries to leave then a guy puts a gun to his head and he goes back. Alright, that makes sense, so phran and sydney aren't going anywhere but wait... the next day?? Sydney just walks out and it is no big deal.Then near the end of the movie Phran starts crawling around in a pond like an alligator and none of the khmer rouge are supposed to see him apparently. So he ""escapes"" his prison camp and walks around for a while. but wait, almost the next scene later he's back in prison camp? and talking to the supposed leader of the prison camp? then a while later he leaves the prison camp again and he walks around in the same area so you think hey he's just out on a stroll. However he finally ends up in thailand after this stroll....If you have no idea about the background history of any movie you watch (me) then this is a terrible movie. If you're a cambodian history buff or even Vietnam war buff then you'd probably like this movie. overall i'd say this movie is a catastrophic failure but people seem to like it and i don't wanna ruffle anyone's feathers.",,Anonymous,History

Astounding devastation,"""The Killing Fields"" (1984): Winner of 3 Academy Awards, starring Sam Waterston, Haing S. Ngor, Craig T. Nelson, John Malkovich. This is the true story of Cambodia's collapse during and after America's war in Viet Nam, when the Khmer Rouge began the Holocaust against their own citizens. Centered on real life characters, we join a writer and photographer from the New York Times, lead by their Cambodian interpreter/life saver. The story is amazing, frightening, very graphic, sad, disgusting, and joyous. We see the Best and the Worst of human behavior. The scoring is overdone (Mike Oldfield of ""Tubular Bells"" fame), and too abstract & detached from the grittiness of the scenes).

Vivid imagery, as mentioned in other reviews, is quite memorable.The only quibble I have is the music in the first half. I don't know if it's traditional Cambodian music, but it contrasted quite harshly with the imagery, and almost overpowered it. The other music in the first half was very dated - it felt like 1984.

"A gripping and saddening film, despite its numerousflaws","This film has many strengths. And a few weaknesses. Its powerful true story is one of the most haunting of the twentieth century, the systematic torture and genocide of 2 million people from the Cambodian population of 7 million during 1975-79 by a radical communist regime, the Khmer Rouge (""Red Cambodia""). The film depicts, with near perfect accuracy, the psychopathic guerillas who menacingly enslave and eradicate their countrymen while slapping and screaming. The graphic display of bloody bodies which litter the streets and fields, while very upsetting, adds to the authentic depiction of the Cambodian Massacre. A viewer is so powerfully convinced by this elegant presentation that he can actually picture himself there, in the heat of terror. No wonder The Killing Fields won an Oscar for best cinematography! As for the actors, I am among the minority of viewers who was not impressed by the main players. Sam Waterson portrayed the brash Sydney Schanberg with an annoyingly pompous attitude. John Malkovitch, though critically acclaimed for his role as Al Rockoff, didnt really add more than a few minutes of amusement. Julian Sands, who is a fine actor and probably the best of the Caucasian actors in this film, was too despondent to give a really inspiring performance, but that was the tone of the film, so he really isn't to blame. Haing Ngor, a real life Cambodian survivor, deserved his best supporting actor oscar for such a focused portrayal of Dith Pran, but even he came across as bland at times. Some of the Southeast Asian actors, while unknown to the western world (and probably the eastern world too) were so authentic and powerful that one wonders if they were really Khmer soldiers and peasants in real life. The scene where Phat, an educated landowner turned Khmer Rouge revolutionary, explains to Dith Pran how he sacrificed everything for the Khmer Rouge, only to be distrusted by them to the point where his life is in danger, was one of the most brilliant in the film. Another amazing scene was during the first hour of the film, when the American Embassy in Phnom Penh is evacuated by US Marine helicopters to Mike Oldfield's very bizzare (though appropriate) musical theme.I object to the left wing political views of this film. Repeated references were made to the US bombings of Cambodia and Vietnam, and President Nixon is even shown giving an address on the ""Nixon doctrine,"" as if the US was to blame for the Cambodian Massacre. It was not. America made some serious policy errors when intervening in the Vietnam and Cambodian wars, but they had nothing to do with the radical communist principles which have killed over 100 million in Europe and Asia during the past 80 years. And even more insulting, Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge chief who led the slaughter of his own people is never even mentioned in this film. Sydney Schanberg, when asked in the film by reporters if he and other journalists were to blame for underestimating the brutality of the Khmer Rouge, answers ""maybe what we underestimated was the paranoia that 7 billion dollars worth of bombs could cause"" another shift in blame from Pol Pot and his murderous communist regime. And finally, the last major flaw in this film was the cheesy ending, where Sydney and Pran are reunited to John Lennon's song ""Imagine."" Many critics have denounced that as a significant mistake by Roland Joffe. However, I did enjoy this film and hope that viewers who havent seen it yet but read this take heed, and try to see the facts through the mild distortions.",,Anonymous,History
lacks unity,"I see that most reviews describe this movie as amazing, etc. but I was actually pretty disappointed by it.  For one, it was too long.  My other criticism is that it lacks unity, somewhat like Full Metal Jacket but even more so.  It touched on many important and interesting topics (the friendship and quest for Pran, the ""year zero"" program, the hypocrisy of war, the hardships of journalism, etc. , the list is long) but  ended up skimming the surface of each. As a result, this movie is under-developed. It could have been made into more than one movie; Pran's experience in the labor camp, for example, could / should have been made into a movie of its own.On the other hand, ""The Killing Fields"" should be given credit for coming before all the great war movies we all refer to now (Platoon, Full Metal Jacket...) and most likely influencing them.  It should also be given credit because so few movies actually refer to Cambodia.  Everyone is so interested in Vietnam and WWII that Cambodia is very often left behind. The acting was great (although I'm not sure about the Oscar... opposite John Malkovich? No-one should win opposite John Malkovich!) but the music got on my nerves for the most part.Overall, the fact that the movie was so chopped up and that it went everywhere (and that it was long) didn't really do it for me.

Not even a young Malkovich could save this one....,"Two problems I have with this movie. Number one, it was very hard to follow. One of the main characters does not speak very good English and I had the TV cranked because he spoke so softly.

It simply could have been cut by at least an hour. There was no action to keep you interested, and in my opinion the only thing that kept me interested was the fact that it's a true story. I liken this movie to Hotel Rwanda which I really liked, but at least it was clear what was going on in that film and there was plenty of action to keep me interested.Not sure how this won so many awards. Maybe I'm missing something because the film is over 20 years old by now. Simply put, I found this movie completely average. No better way to explain it than that.",,Anonymous,History
The Killing Fields,"After watching the movie, ""The Killing Fields"", it really gives you a sense of relief that we are fortunate to be living as privileged as we are. The director Roland Joffe, creates a tremendous portrayal of the suffering that went on during the war in Cambodia. He also tries to convey the Khmer Rouge in a terrible way to get the point across of how awful they really treated everyone. The main characters give a great performance as they play the parts of reporters during the war. It is great to see this because not only did they provide a reporters view on things, but they came to self realization when they experienced the horrors of war themselves. The only flaw that I felt was in the movie is the idea of how people would look in the wrong direction and get killed, but Pran would runaway, get caught disobeying and would never get punished. Obviously it is a good thing but it is just a little unrealistic I thought. I definitely think you should see the movie and the great job everyone involved did to piece it together to let the audience feel the experience.",,Anonymous,History
Review for The Killing Fields,"The Cambodian genocide that took place during the rule of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970's is considered to be one of the worst genocides in modern world history. The film, The Killing Fields, takes its name of those who have died due to disease, starvation, and violence upon innocent civilians from the restrictive policies of the Khmer Rouge, numbering from 1.8 to 2.3 million, in which the land of Cambodia became their corpses. The Killing Fields is an important and eye-opening portrayal of a significant period of world history in Asia. The film is based on the true stories of New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg, and Cambodian journalist, Dith Pran. Both undergo the events of the genocide themselves throughout this historic film.The director of this movie does not hold back in showing the events leading to the genocide, which started in 1973 with an accidental bombing of a town by American planes that killed hundreds. Along towards the end of the film, Sydney is in New York, trying to find any sign of Pran's whereabouts, for he was recently enslaved in a forced labor camp under Khmer Rogue rule. If the film had focused entirely on presenting the historical events, the film would be too overwhelmingly depressing to view. It shouldn't be viewed as a historical drama but as a reminder that such atrocities exist and still happens in our world today. By simply ignoring them, those atrocities will never go away.Despite the horror of this inhumanity, this movie is not widely taught or discussed within schools in America. As an Emerson student, it is profoundly important to know of this historical tragedy because the characters in this event have risked their lives to use the art of media to communicate what is going on in the country of Cambodia. It was a duty to themselves that they were proud to accomplish. Many people aren't aware of such events in the world unless it is being passed on through the arts such as movies like this, or even through mass media such as newspapers, radio, TV news, etc. As a student, it is our duties to spread the word of what goes on in this world as a message because every little matter that happens to one community can have the powerful, domino affect to impact everyone else.",,Anonymous,History

They are either in a peaceful embassy or held captive by the Cambodian army. Sydney escapes by switching a French passport while Dith's passport picture turns gray and has no choice but to be turned over to the Cambodian army. Dith ends up in a concentration camp run by child soldiers while Sydney is winning an award for his literary works for his time in Cambodia. Dith eventually escapes with the help of one of the camp leaders he meets during his first escape. With a map and money secretly given to him, he escapes to a hospital camp where he is rescued by Sydney.The quality of the film was extremely poor. A lot of the time the movie was in a different language without subtitles. This movie was about history and started off with no background of what was going on. I understood it was a war in Cambodia but I thought it was between Cambodia and the United States by how the beginning of the movie interpreted things. The main characters were in danger one second than randomly they were in a peaceful embassy. How could one go from about to being killed to a peaceful serene environment? The use of animals during this film seemed to be very cruel, I don't know if it was a special effect when the cow was cut open on its neck but it seemed to be real. Also the faux bombing and intentional startling of animals seemed to be unnecessary.I think this movie is not an accurate depiction of the Cambodian civil war, with that said I cannot say it is important for an Emerson student to see this film. The movie is sad and what happened during that period is horrible. History is a very important thing to learn so it is important for an Emerson student to know what happened during this time.

A brief paragraph on the film. No spoilers,"The film is a historical window that is thankfully not marred by the Hollywood perception of action, where the scenes are saturated with gore and explosions. Roland Joffé captures the real violence in every single one of his scenes to the point where the viewer actually feels inside the movie, hidden in a crate or behind a wall watching the massacre that's happening outside. The music, or the lack of it, is also very appropriate. Mike Oldfield managed to successfully pair the music and the wild track in order to convey emotion or achieve a higher sense of reality depending on the scene. The Killing Fields definitely deserved the three Academy Awards, eight BAFTA Awards, and other 15 accolades from different cinematography societies that included various nominations for best supporting actor to Haing S.

Great illustration of the tragedy in Cambodia,"""The Killing Fields"" was a great illustration of most of the violent happenings committed by the Khmer Rouge. The story was very intriguing to see the difference in the cultures that existed in Cambodia. I also think that his movie was very good because unlike other ""war"" movies, this film focused more on the effects of the conflict on the people of the country. The relationship between Sydnee and Dith Pran was very moving because of how close they were to each other.

"Includes a brief synopsis, my personal opinion, and why it is important to me as an Emerson College student.","""The Killing Fields"" won three Oscars and 23 other awards. Deserving of these honors, the film created a vivid picture of the horrific tragedies that occurred in Cambodia in the 1970's. The plot revolves around an American journalist for the New York Times, Sydney Schanberg, who tries to bring to light the tragic killings that were occurring in Cambodia. Working alongside Schanberg was his close friend Dith Pran, a Cambodian journalist and translator. The movie adapts the historical events of how the Khmer Rouge, the ruling communist party of Cambodia at the time, massacred thousands of people in an attempt at social engineering. While press corps were sanitizing the story, Schanberg and Pran continuously endangered their lives to expose the gruesome reality of what was happening to the innocent people of Cambodia. Eventually Schanberg is able to return to the U.S, while Pran is forced to stay in Cambodia and be of service to the violent Khmer Rouge. Yet after many attempts and failed efforts, Pran survives and escapes the communists' influence, and the story ends with the reunion of Pran and Schanberg.""The Killing Fields"" gives a detailed dramatization of the cruel genocide that occurred in Cambodia. Although the truths of these events were eventually documented, it did not receive the full attention that it deserved. This film appeals to the audience's emotions and further advocates for the awareness of what happened to Cambodia in the years 1975 through 1979. Therefore, I commend the staff that worked so hard to promote the awareness of these occurrences. Considering that Emerson College is a school that is concentrated on ""film, theater, journalism, marketing, communication, writing, literature, and publishing,"" it is very important for students to know about this historical tragedy. This film shows how important forms of communications can be in times of political turmoil and heartbreaking violence. Through forms of media, and other forms of expression, people can help bring to light and possibly shorten the length in time of which events like this occur.",,Anonymous,History
The Killing Fields,"Some countries had conflicts at a certain time back in the history which everybody should get lessons out of it in order not to repeat or do the same things. The genocide in Cambodia, in my point of view, is one of those moments.The film, The Killing Fields, explicitly explains what happened in Cambodia by strong visual scenes and acting. Back in history, in Cambodia the soldiers wanted to change the regime from Khmer Republic to Democratic Cambodia. They attacked the civilians, they killed innocent citizens, they destroyed families, homes, streets and many other things. As watching the film, we -the audience- see all these events from the point of view of two journalists, one from Cambodia, Dith Pran, and one from America, Sydney Schanberg.I think the film is well developed. The film makers used strong visual scenes which are not either too negative or too optimistic. It eventually convinced the audience about the historical accuracy. All the acting is excellently presented which smoothly takes the audience right into the topic. I think it gives all the emotions which the producers were aiming to give.Finally, I believe everybody should watch this movie in order to learn more about world history and have a diverse background.",,Anonymous,History

A Spell-Bounding Account.,"The Vietnam War was a very trying time for Americans and citizens of Southeast Asia. What most people—like myself—didn't know is that the war and its Communist beliefs spilt over into Cambodia. The Killings Fields (1984) was an Academy Award-winning movie that showed the strife that Cambodians endured during the reign of the Khmer Rouge and how two journalists documented it. The movie begins in 1973 with the arrival of American journalist, Sydney Schanberg, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. He and his partner/translator, a Cambodian journalist named Dith Pran, set out to cover the ongoing civil war between the current Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge, a Communist regime that is beginning to take over. They risk their lives numerous times, including an attempt to visit Neak Leung, a town that is accidentally bombed by American forces. When the Khmer Rouge eventually takes full power in 1975, Pran is taken to work at a concentration camp as a field worker and Schanberg evacuates to America. Schanberg then begins a successful personal campaign to locate Pran. The movie ends with Schanberg and Pran reunited and Schanberg is awarded for his coverage of Cambodia. The Killing Fields is an incredible movie that should be viewed by all generations to come, for it shows how inhumane people are in this world and how there are some people dedicated to exploiting them. I believe that this movie relates to students at Emerson College because we are known for breaking boundaries and being very accepting of people from all backgrounds. Watching The Killing Fields would help to become further aware of the atrocities committed against humanity and how we can try to prevent them.",,Anonymous,History
"Striking, Frightening, Emotional and an extreme masterpiece!!! : )","This realistic movie portraying life in Cambodia during the invasion of the Khymer Rouge is a masterpiece that will keep you extremely interested right until the very end of the movie. Based in 1975, on a true story in 'Cambodia' about 'Sydney Schanberg', who was a photographer for 'The New York Times', and his interpreter 'Dith Pran', this adaption with its strong violence and realistic atmosphere will stun you and seriously make you think about the mistakes that we are making in this world through wars and violence. The first time that I had watched this movie, I just couldn't stop thinking about it and what it meant to me. It just has so much meaning in it. The cast in this movie performed so well and so real like, that it makes you think that the cast are the actual real people that are portrayed in the movie.I truly recommend anybody to watch this movie, because it will change your state of mind forever. I personally give this fantastic film a great score of 10/10.",,Anonymous,History
The Killing Fields.,"In the movie ""The Killing Fields"" the main point of the movie was the next to mass genocide of the Cambodian people. This movie confronted many different views of the horrible events that happened there. They had a view of some one this only affected emotionally which was the reporter Sydney. They had the view of a member of the Khmer Rouge soldier, who was killed. Then finally the overall view of Dith Pran, whom this whole entire series of events affected him the most. In the end I would recommend this movie for any one who likes history, and still wants to be entertained. This movie has not only a strong emotional value, but a extremely intense intellectual value. In the previewing of this movie I learned things about the Cambodian genocide I had never known before.",,Anonymous,History
