Jake La Motta was a man who was a lot like the fictional Citizen Kane...,"... in that he lost everything he ever had by age 40, although Kane didn't die broke by any means. An athlete expects to lose their prowess over time, but Jake lost everything else too. He did have a pretty good second act, partially and ironically because of this film, and even managed to live to age 95 and not die alone. That's an unexpected outcome when you first see him at age 42.It's really interesting how this film is set up. You first see LaMotta (Robert De Niro) at age 42 in 1964 - bloated, working in a dive of a nightclub, practicing the third-rate act that keeps him fed and off the streets. His name and the year are shown in print. Then immediately you switch to LaMotta in 1941, in the ring, at age 19. Granted, Robert De Niro at age 36 when he made this does NOT look anything close to a teenager, but then there has to be some dramatic license.This first fight shown in 1941 tells you what you need to know about the kind of world Jake inhabits. There are the violent punches of the fight followed by a decision against Jake with which the audience strongly disagrees. Fans throw things - everything from popcorn to chairs. Fights break out. A woman is trampled in the chaos. And then the organist tries to calm things down by playing the Star Spangled Banner. The audience does not come to attention.So you've seen the end and the beginning of the story. It's fascinating and grabs one's attention, and even though you can look up and see how the actual Jake LaMotta's life went in those 23 years, the movie gives you all of the intimate scenes telling you the how. Jake craves love, food, recognition - he has a tremendous appetite for all of these things but he's also tremendously lacking in confidence and self control and strikes out violently as a result. It really is a fascinating portrait.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not My Favorite Scorsese,"An emotionally self-destructive boxer (Robert DeNiro) and his journey through life, as the violence and temper that leads him to the top in the ring, destroys his life outside it.I do not want to be the one to say bad things about this film, because it is not a bad film. But most of it just did not resonate with me. The story is good, the acting is good, I love the use of the black and white cinematography at a time when color was far more dominant. But I cannot say this is one of the greatest movies ever made.IMDb, AFI, Entertainment Weekly, ESPN and everyone else has this ranked so near the top of their list (IMDB actually only puts it in the top 100, which seems more fair). I am lost... it is a great movie, yes, but one of the greatest? No, it just is not true. DeNiro has done better, Pesci has done better, Scorsese has done better...",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bovine Pugilist & Paranoid Misogynist...,"There's very little to like about the character portrayed here by Robert De Niro, other than to acknowledge that he took advantage of one of the few things he was good at i.e. thumping anyone who enraged him regardless of whether they were in the boxing ring or not.The power of the movie comes from De Niro under the direction of Martin Scorsese, providing a wholly convincing performance of the furious, bitter, bovine pugilist with serious psychological issues. It is one of the truly great performances of that decade, perhaps of all time, nailing the establishment of a character it's genuinely difficult to have any empathy or sympathy with. If you dig deeper, you will not be surprised to find a serial misogynist who married seven times and who beat all of his wives. If this is your type of hero you might like to reconsider how you got there. If De Nero, Scorsese and cinema are your heroes, not too many will disagree with that.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Essential masterpiece; powerful De Niro; simply one of the best films of all time.,"""Raging Bull"" isn't the average, stereotypical underdog boxing movie, because it isn't really about boxing at all. Like most great movies, its focus is much deeper. It came out in 1980, earned Robert De Niro a Best Actor Academy Award, and was marked down as another solid triumph by director Martin Scorsese, whose previous 1976 outing with De Niro earned them both critical acclaim (and for De Niro, an Oscar nomination, although he would actually earn an Oscar for ""Raging Bull"" four years later).It dwindled in production hell for quite some time, with Scorsese's drug use halting production and only the duo's strong willpower that kept the project moving ahead. It was after De Niro read boxer Jake LaMotta's memoirs that he knew he wanted to make the film, so Scorsese and De Niro turned to Paul Schrader for a script. Schrader, who had previously written ""Taxi Driver"" (1976), agreed, and wrote the screenplay for them. The rest is history.""Raging Bull"" has often been regarded as the greatest film of the 80s. To be honest, I'm not so sure about that, since various genres offer different feelings and emotions (comparing this to a comedy might seem rather silly). But to say it is one of the most powerful films of all time would be no gross overstatement -- it is superb film-making at its finest.De Niro gained 60 pounds to play LaMotta, which was an all-time record at the time (later beaten by Vincent D'Onofrio, who gained 70 pounds for Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket""). His physical transformation is on-par with any great screen makeover, especially the most recent, ranging from Willem Dafoe in ""Shadow of the Vampire"" to Charlize Theron in ""Monster."" In addition, co-star Joe Pesci also lost weight for his role of Joey, LaMotta's short, eccentric brother. The greatest scene in the film is when LaMotta accuses his brother of having an affair with his wife. The tension is raw, the dialogue amazing, and the overall intensity electrifying.The film is most often compared to ""Rocky,"" more than any other, apparently because they both concern a certain level of boxing. As much as I absolutely adore ""Rocky,"" ""Raging Bull"" is a deeper, more realistic film. But whereas ""Raging Bull"" is raw, ""Rocky"" is inspiring, and that is one of the reasons I do not think these two very different motion pictures deserve comparison, for the simple fact that they are entirely separate from one another. The only connecting thread is the apparently central theme of boxing, which is used as a theme in ""Rocky,"" and a backdrop in ""Raging Bull."" They're entirely different motion pictures -- one uplifting, the other somewhat depressing -- and the people who try to decide which is better need to seriously re-evaluate their reasons for doing so. They both succeed splendidly well at what they are trying to do, and that's all I have to say about their so-called connection.De Niro, who could justifiably be called the greatest actor of all time, is at the top of his game here. In ""Taxi Driver"" he displayed a top-notch performance. He wasn't just playing Travis Bickle -- he was Travis Bickle. And here he is Jake LaMotta, the infamous boxer known for his abusive life style and somewhat paranoid delusions during his reign as world middleweight boxing champion, 1949 - 1951. Throughout the film, he beats his wife (played expertly and convincingly by the 19-year-old Cathy Moriarty), convinced that she is cheating on him, and that is more or less what the film is truly about. The boxing is just what he does for a living, and could be considered as a way to release some of his deeper, harbored anger.LaMotta has a close relationship with Joey, his brother, and their interaction is often what elevates the film above others of its genre. The dialogue is great, close to the perfection of Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction,"" rich in that rapid-fire filthy language and brutal insults. Pesci, who was on the verge of quitting showbiz at the time of pre-production, was spotted by De Niro in a cheap B-movie named ""The Death Collector"" (1975), a.k.a. ""Family Business,"" a truly horrid film that nevertheless showcased an early sign of things to come for Pesci. De Niro wanted him for the movie and his premonition was either very lucky or very wise -- this is one of the best performances of Pesci's entire career.Scorsese shot the film in muted black and white, portraying a certain era of depression and misery. To make the blood show up on screen during the occasional fight scenes, Scorsese used Hershey's Syrup -- which is an interesting tidbit of trivia for any aspiring film-making planning on filming a violent movie in black and white. But how often does that happen?This is certainly one of the most intense films Scorsese has directed, and one of the most important of his career. Along with ""Taxi Driver,"" it is an iconic motion picture that will stand the test of time for years and years to come.Scorsese and De Niro's partnership over the years has resulted in some of the most influential and utterly amazing motion pictures of all time: ""Mean Streets,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""The King of Comedy,"" ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" come to mind almost instantly. But perhaps the one single title that will be remembered as their most daring effort is ""Raging Bull,"" a motion picture so utterly exhilarating that it defies description. It is simply a masterpiece for the mind and senses, leaving you knocked out cold after its brutal one-two punch. If I had to assemble a list of required viewing, this would be up there towards the top.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
It doesn't get much better than this,"Easily one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. I have watched it at least ten times, and it only gets better and better with each viewing. Martin Scorsese is absolutely the greatest filmmaker of the last quarter century, and this film is his best. The story of how boxer Jake LaMotta watched his career and marriage crumble under the weight of his violent temper and deep-rooted misogyny is told with no punches pulled (excuse the bad pun), as Deniro (in what may be his best performance) and Scorsese unflinchingly explore what drove this man over the edge, and what ultimately may have pulled him back. The boxing scenes easily rank with the most brutal and violent moments ever put on film, shot in stark, unadorned black and white and utilizing unlikely sounds including shattering windows and animal cries to great effect. Thelma Schoonmaker's jarring, discordant editing in these scenes also deserves special mention. The scenes of domestic violence are not for the faint of heart, but there is really no other way to tell this story. If there is a more perfect exploration of why as men we act the way we do, then I'd love to see it, because this movie made me re-evaluate my life. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Scorsese masterpiece!,"Raging Bull is one of Martin Scorsese's best films and with out a doubt the best film of the 80's. It follows the career of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta as his career progresses but his emotional problems worsen.The most notable feature in Raging Bull is the colour. All but the home Video footage is shot in black and white. This was a huge risk on Scorsase's part but it defiantly pays off, the film wouldn't feel the same had it been done in colour.Throughout the entire film acting is simply impeccable. De Niro and Pesci are both stunning. The script is amazing, you really feel like you understand every character, none of their actions seem out of character no matter how outrageous they may be.Scorsese's directing is stunning. He really is a very talented director and in Raging Bull it shows. The fight scenes are famous for their brutal realism and it's easy to see why. He puts you right in the ring with the fighters and you cant help but admire their technical brilliance. However, the most stunning aspect of all is Thelma Schoonmaker's editing. Its some of the best editing I've ever seen especially during the fight scenes where it's positively breathtaking.No matter what happens you always find yourself sympathising with La Motta, even during his most outrageous moments. Not only is Raging Bull the greatest film to come out of the 80's but is one of the greatest this century that's highly underrated and defiantly worth owning.10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"one of the most powerful movies, ever!","From the story of a one time middle weight champion of the world and his apparent necessity for internal conflict and self destruction, America's greatest director in the history of cinema has carved a masterpiece of a feature, teaming up with the greatest actor of his generation in order to establish what will no doubt go down in history as one of the most powerful films of all time. ""Raging Bull"", directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert deNiro in the brilliant performance that ensured him a well deserved Academy Award, is a raw feature film that will have you stunned at its conclusion and leave you reeling in your theatre, couch or bed until the final credit has finished rolling off the screen.The film, adapted from another source, revolves around the rise and fall of Jake LaMotta (deNiro), an ambitious middle weight fighter who has struggled for years along with his manager brother (an unforgettable Joe Pesci) to get a shot at the title for the middle weight champion of the world. Frustrated with himself and the life that he's had to lead, LaMotta presents the complex mind of a self destructive man who's inhumanity and self-destructive nature push him away from all the people in the world that love him and ultimately transform him from a prize fighter into an overweight sleaze with nothing but the clothes on his back. From the flawless and gripping boxing scenes to the raw yet accurate portrayal of his abusive habits towards both his brother and wife, ""Raging Bull"" succeeds on absolutely every level.DeNiro's performance in the film is unquestionably his finest piece of work in his own personal career, if not throughout the history of cinema altogether. Completely believable as a boxer, he furthermore went on a diet to put on 60 pounds for his scenes situated in the latter half of the film when he has hit rock bottom which is testament to both his dedication and his unparalleled skill of establishing a believable character. Joe Pesci is absolutely brilliant as his portrayal of Jake's brother, Joey LaMotta, and considering the fact that was one of his first feature films in the spotlight, he completely delivers a character who loves his brother unquestionably but who also has internal struggles regarding his own nature and his methods of dealing with his brother. I fell in love with Joe Pesci due to his performance here, and he is clearly one of the more talented and gifted actors within Hollywood.Scorsese is also in top form, and you can feel his presence, his brilliance and his uncompromising dedication to showing you the real life and times of Jake LaMotta in every single piece of footage presented to you on the screen. Martin Scorsese illustrates the reason why he is considered by many to be cinema's greatest film director of all time as he takes you on a journey of Jake LaMotta's personal and public existence. Scorsese doesn't leave anything out, and his brilliance obviously lies within the fact that he can illustrate everything about a character in the simplest of scenes to make you empathise but simultaneously make you comprehend the various fundamental layers of such a despicable character in cinema history. And on top of that, he can make you like the character and hate the character at the exact same time - a brilliance unprecedented throughout Hollywood and surely testament to Scorsese's superiority to directors such as Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood who, despite having tremendous talent, cannot realistically present characters to the extent that Scorsese can.Further supporting cast members, Cathy Moriarty and Frank Vincent deliver completely credible characters with Moriarty well deserving of her Oscar Nomination for her performance as Vickie. The editing was completely flawless and top notch throughout the entire feature with Scorsese's other partner - Thelma Schoonmaker - bringing Scorsese's incredible vision to life once more without a single complaint in the world. Brilliant cinematography ensured a visually compelling piece of work, exemplified further by an Oscar Nod towards this element of the picture also.All in all, this is arguably the finest achievement from the Scorsese-DeNiro partnership, and it delivers everything that you would predict from our beloved Martin Scorsese. Love, deceit, hate, an underlying theme of violence, some of the best acting ever put on film as well as some of the most brutal and compelling sequences of boxing you'll ever see: all are shown with flamboyance and an honest brutality that we've come to accept as the trademark of Martin Scorsese in this poignant tale of one man's annihilation of self. And who is the only director who could realistically bring this to life? We all know the answer.Well done, Mr Scorsese. Regardless of what the pretentious fools responsible for the decisions that the Academy makes, the people are fully aware of who the best director in town is.""Raging Bull"" is flawless and perfect. 10 out of 10, all the way.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Raging Bull,"Sorry but I was really unimpressed with this tale of the life of legendary boxer Jake La Motta. It's based on his own book, so it can be relied upon to be authentic, but somehow this Martin Scorsese effort just fell flat for me. The usual mix of Robert De Niro (La Motta) with probably the least versatile actor I have ever seen on screen, Joe Pesci, as his brother Joey; Cathy Moriarty as his wife Vickie and an ensemble of Italian American co-stars just reminded me of a very much weaker ""Midnight Cowboy"" (1969). Sure, that's not about boxing - but I'm not too sure how much this is about it, either. There is precious little by way of ring action - though what there is is excellently and intensively photographed - for the most part it is more of a soap opera, backed up with loads of expletives and a bit of domestic violence that seems to have come to epitomise the attitudes this New York community have for their womenfolk. There is the usual gangland, fight-fixing, shenanigans but somehow it all comes across as remarkably sterile. I don't really rate De Niro as an actor. Like Pesci, he only really seems to have one gear; one style and it all usually involves him playing well to his own roots, armed with a ripe vocabulary and lots of angry tantrums. At times it is shot like a television movie; the black and white imagery is just too clean and pristine. It seems to be trying for a look that places it contemporaneously in the late 1940s, but instead, for me anyway, it came across more as a film out of it's time. I am certain that I am in the minority here; it played to a very full cinema the other night and received applause at the end, but I am afraid I just cannot see what all the fuss is about.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The most important ""boxing-movie"" of all times","Jake La Motta's story is no doubt the best movie about boxing of all times together with Robert Wise's The Set-Up. Besides the legendary performance of Robert De Niro, there are many things in this film that will remain in my heart forever: the splendid black & white, the contrast between the slow moving scenes and the frenetic ones, the choice of the music and the sense of loss which entangles the whole movie. De Niro faces another ""born loser"" role (after Travis Bickle, John Rubin, Johnny Boy) and strikes again; Martin Scorsese is the most poetic director of the last 30 years.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Easy to Admire, Difficult to Love","The routine use of black-and-white film to make movies seems to have ended in the mid-sixties, probably killed off by the advent of colour television. Since then black-and-white has been used very sparingly; even Polanski's `Chinatown', obviously conceived as homage to the films noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, was shot in colour.`Raging Bull'- a biography of the boxer Jake La Motta who for a time held the world middleweight championship- is one of the few exceptions. The use of black-and-white seems to have been inspired by the fact that the film depicts real-life events that occurred in the forties and fifties. Scorsese has tried to capture the look of both the films and the newsreels of that period. This is remarkably effective for the boxing scenes, which have a raw, brutal power and graphically depict the aggressive nature of the sport. The other remarkable thing about the film is the performance of Robert de Niro, for which he won a well-deserved Best Actor Academy Award. De Niro actually learned to box for the film, and did all the boxing scenes himself without using a stunt double, but his portrayal of La Motta's private life is equally effective.Some boxers- Henry Cooper comes to mind- are hard-hitting inside the ring but gentlemanly and restrained outside. La Motta, as portrayed in this film, did not fall into this category. De Niro portrays him as a man with a very short fuse, seething with anger and violence. Unlike his great rival Sugar Ray Robinson, an elegant practitioner of the art of boxing, La Motta tries to overpower his rivals with brute force rather than relying on skill. His aggression is not something confined to the ring, but rather an inherent part of his personality, and comes out in his dealings with others. He treats his beautiful wife Vicki particularly badly, frequently (and irrationally) suspecting her of infidelity and subjecting her to both verbal and physical abuse. Besides De Niro's dominating performance, there are also very good contributions from Cathy Moriarty as Vicki and from Joe Pesci as La Motta's loyal brother Joey, another frequent target of abuse despite his loyalty.For me, this is a very good film, yet one that falls just short of the classic status that some have claimed for it. At times it is enthralling to watch, but at others, particularly in the first half, it seems to lack structure, as La Motta takes on a series of opponents without the significance of these fights ever becoming clear. More could have been made of the gambling-inspired corruption that infested the sport at this period and which may well have contributed to La Motta's sense of frustration- at one time it is made clear to him that his getting a chance to fight for the world title depends upon his taking a dive in a non-title fight. The main weakness, however, is a sense of emptiness at its centre, resulting from the lack of a character who can engage our sympathies. As I said, it is De Niro's performance that dominates the film, but for all his fine acting, even he cannot make us sympathise with a drunken, self-pitying, paranoid, violent wife-beater. As a character study of an unpleasant character it is excellent, but it can go no further than that. I cannot agree that this is the greatest film of the eighties; indeed, for me it was not even the greatest sporting film of the eighties. (I preferred both `Chariots of Fire' and `Eight Men Out'). It is an easy film to admire, but a difficult one to love. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
It really is harder to Stay At the Top than to Reach the Top; just because Life has No Justice.,"Whoever is dissatisfied by Raging Bull, I'm sure they watched it with expectations of watching a sports movie, like Rocky. Despite the AFI chose Raging Bull as the #1 sports movie of all time, you can't expect to see the most breathtaking boxing match nor to witness the best crochet of boxing history. Raging Bull can only be classified as a drama/biography. Director Scorsese chose to go with black&white cinematography only to keep the young viewers away from this masterpiece of art. It's not fair to compare Rocky with Raging Bull. Rocky was a populist movie mostly for young viewers, and Raging Bull is a cinematic masterpiece. From a wide point of view, for instance, if you look at one of the Michelangelo's paintings; at first you see a nude woman, if you look longer and deeper you realize that her nudity expresses some thought, if you look continuously and give a life to it in your imagination you discover that the women are not just their bodies. Accordingly, like it is not enough looking once to a painting to understand what opinion does it defend; it is not reasonable and not fair to watch Raging Bull so as to see a sports movie. Also it is not reasonable to see Raging Bull only once. Raging Bull is one movie that, every time you watch it you get a better taste, every time you watch it you discover something new.Raging Bull taught us that even if you are the best at some skill, even if you are the best of all; you need to create witnesses, admirers and supporters of your skill. It's the only way to reach the top. Moreover, it is harder to stay at the top than to reach the top. Not because someone better than you can defeat you, it's just because of the need to be accepted on every authority; like the Council of Judges, the Media and the Admiration of People. Director Scorsese draws benefit from the hypocrisy of fame. He empowers Raging Bull to make people ask to their conscience if the popular values that people choose can really cherish their values.In Raging Bull, Jake La Motta was the best boxer of all, but people didn't like him. He was disrespectful, he was uncivilized, he was very ugly, he was arrogant, he was irritable and he didn't care; 'cause he believed himself. Despite the fact that he is the best, everybody disliked him. Soon, he was left alone; and in a very short time he lost everything he possessed. When he opened his eyes back to life, he found himself in prison. The scene that he is punching and butting the wall facing him is one of the most heart rending memorable scenes of the whole cinema history.At the end, he finally throws in the towel of believing himself, he loses his faith and becomes to learn what he never wanted to learn: The Fame. He starts running his own business at a night club under his name, working as a stand-up comedian at the stage. People laugh at him for the jokes he made out of his memories, the jokes paraphrasing the bitter facts of life; including the very famous joke of the British King Richard-III which he said in the year 1485 just before dying: ""A horse, a horse... My kingdom for a horse!"". There we understand truly: For every joke there lies a share of a fact underneath.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not really deserving of a top 250 place,"This is an interesting biopic and I can't fault the acting, directing or cinematography but Jake La Motta is too unlikeable and one-dimensional to be entertaining.

Scorcese robbed,"Well, I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in my entire life, but there it is.I realize that this film lost to ""Ordinary People,"" a film I love. I am not an idiot - I know that Martin Scorcese is a great, very gifted artist who puts powerful images on the screen. I agree that he has been cheated out of the Academy Award many times, which makes one realize they don't count for much.For DeNiro, this stands as one of the greatest performances of all time. DeNiro is one of a handful of American actors who has earned his place at the top - he's there with Brando, Pacino, and Newman. ""Raging Bull"" helped put him there. As far as the rest of the acting, Cathy Moriarity epitomizes the '40s blond and a Bronx woman, and Joe Pesci is perfect as LaMotta's brother.Scorcese presents here the turbulent life of Jake Lamotta with all its brutality, sparing us nothing in his fights, his anger against his wives, his brother, no one. His obsessive nature, his jealousy, his - well, hey, his rage - does not make him a likable character. LaMotta himself was disturbed by how he came off on screen, but then had the honesty to admit that he was a bastard.Scorcese creates the Bronx and the bloody horror of the fight ring in a way no one else ever has. The first shot of the lone boxer in the ring is stunning, as is the real LaMotta's own practicing of a speech in a dressing room. Everything about this film evinces the aura of a special era, especially the color home movies - a brilliant touch.The only problem I had with the film was that it was boring and unwatchable. I finally got so sick of all the screaming and yelling and watching this unlikeable, obnoxious character that I turned the set off. I thought if he tortured his wife one more time asking her if she slept with his brother, I was going to put my fist through the set.This is the age-old question - you know something is great art but it doesn't speak to you. You like something that's very well done but a little less artistic better - does this means you are one of the masses for whom mediocrity has become your idea of what's good? I don't know. I like to think I can appreciate a beautifully made film. But I think what I can appreciate more than that are complicated characters I understand on some level - or want to understand, real emotions, real heartache - probably more than magnificent film-making. When there is both, it's magic. For me, ""Raging Bull"" was not one of those times. ""Godfather I,"" ""Godfather II,"" yes.I really hate writing these comments.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Impressive From A Filmmaking Standpoint But Lacking Flavour In Narration,"Bringing the life story of one of the roughest brawlers to ever step into the boxing ring, Raging Bull finds director Martin Scorsese & actor Robert De Niro teaming up once again to deliver yet another quality work but just like their other collaborations, it left me cold & indifferent to whatever it had in store and while I respect the legacy of this sports drama, I'm no fan of it.Raging Bull chronicles the life of Jake LaMotta, a middleweight boxer whose rage, jealously & bouts of violent outbursts helps propel him to the top of the division but his inability to keep those vicious tendencies in check outside the arena leads him on a path of self-destruction, as he destroys his relationships with his wife & family over the years and wounds up all alone in his later life.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film is incredibly faithful to its source material and recreates the events with accuracy. Shot in black & white, which gives the picture a timeless quality, it illustrates the good, bad & ugly side of LaMotta with finesse and his arc is undeniably compelling. But he also comes off as an insufferable persona whose problems are of his own making which makes his downward journey all the more deserving.What also affects the experience is that the story remains a monotonous ride for the entirety of its runtime. There is no escalation whatsoever whether we are witnessing LaMotta's boxing bouts or personal life. It's just a similar set of events repeated time n again for 125 minutes and that's not enough to keep the interest alive. It's brutal & violent in the ring but it fails to deliver the desired emotional impact because we are just not invested in his journey.However, from a filmmaking standpoint, Raging Bull is an outstanding piece of work. The staging of events, the era-appropriate set pieces, the boxing choreography, the controlled camerawork, all of it exhibit an exactness that's quite commendable. And as for the performances, Robert De Niro leads the show from the front and delivers a smashing showcase as Jake LaMotta, and he is brilliantly supported by Joe Pesci & Cathy Moriarty who play his brother & wife respectively.On an overall scale, Raging Bull is impressive in its craftsmanship but the narration is lacking in flavour and becomes repetitive after a while. Scorsese's direction & De Niro's commitment to his role certainly stand out but the longer it goes on, the more wearisome it becomes. Painting a faithful portrait of a character with no redeeming characteristics, Raging Bull is significant from a filmmaking viewpoint but there isn't much to gain by investing in someone who refuses to learn from his own mistakes.",,Anonymous,Biography
As perfect as perfect can be.,Raging bull is my favorite film.

The fight scenes are the most brutal that I have ever seen on film even though theres only like 12 minutes of them and the editing is simply brilliant.

There is a reason why they are referred to as the greatest....,"From my understanding, before this film was made, Martin Scorsese, arguably America's greatest filmmaker, was at the end of his rope. He was about to call it quits. His good friend, arguably America's greatest film actor, Robert De Niro, approached him with a book he had read. The title of the book was Raging Bull. After some coaxing, Robert finally convinced his friend to do the film, and it resulted in a MASTERPIECE!!!!!""Raging Bull"" is the story of former boxing middleweight champion Jake La Motta, and his penchant for self-destruction. La Motta is not in the least a nice guy. He is well, a jerk, who eventually drives any and everyone who has ever cared about him out of his life. He evolved from a lean, trim boxer to an overweight loser who owns a night club.This film currently ranks on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies at #24, and for very good reason. It contains arguably THE GREATEST acting performance in the history of cinema, by arguably the greatest actor in the history of cinema, directed by arguably the greatest director in the history of cinema. But together, nothing needs to be argued, they are the greatest tag team in the history of cinema. Robert De Niro is flawless, superb, excellent, amazing, any positive adjective is warranted by his performance. There is a reason why they call him the greatest actor. This is it. (also ""Taxi Driver"") Naturally, Scorsese's direction is flawless, and Thelma Schoonmaker's editing will pretty much speak for itself. The black-and-white(or tinted monochrome) was an ingenious touch, similar to William Friedkin's gunshot at the very end of ""The French Connection"". It is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen, if it were a woman I could only beg to drink its bathwater. Joe Pesci is excellent as Jake's brother Joey, as is Cathy Moriarty as Jake's long suffering wife. It is sad when you realize that De Niro will never act that great again, but you find solace in the fact that he once did. He is maybe my favorite actor, Scorsese maybe my favorite director, and I only hope to have a millionth of the impact they've had on film. Far superior to ""Rocky"", even though Rocky is very good and contains maybe the most inspirational theme song ever.This film was criminally robbed of 1980's Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards, by ""Ordinary People"", another one of those dysfunctional family drama's. The Academy has since lost a huge amount of credibility, but I find solace in the fact that they honored De Niro with an award for Best Actor, in a performance that warrants two of them and makes me want to shine his shoes.The film gets nothing less than a 10. It was voted the film of the 1980's decade. I agree wholeheartedly.Scorsese and De Niro forever.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brutal and Honest,"Since John Wayne and John Ford stopped making films, the greatest director/actor combination of the last 35 years is in my mind Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro.In Raging Bull these two guys are within their element. An added dimension to Scorsese's direction and DeNiro's portrayal is that these are the people they know and grew up with. Raging Bull invokes a world of the past that isn't always pleasant, but is brutal and honest.Jake LaMotta as middleweight champion of the world 1949-1951 may have had the hardest chin in boxing. He was a good puncher, but he had a marvelous ability to not only take a punch, but roll with it so it did less damage than thought. He fooled many an opponent like that and set them up for the kill.Large parts of the boxing establishment was controlled by organized crime back in his days, the fathers of the people you'd later see DeNiro play in Goodfellas. You had to play ball with them or you went nowhere in the fight game. Jake compromised himself by agreeing to throw a fight to someone named Billy Fox in order to get a title shot at the middleweight crown. It seared his very soul in doing that.One thing that wasn't covered in Raging Bull was the drama behind the title fight itself with Marcel Cerdan the man who LaMotta took the crown from. Cerdan was a national French hero, resistance fighter, lover of Edith Piaf and possessor of a murderous punch who had never been knocked out and only had sustained three losses in his career, two by disqualification. He was quite a brawler himself.Cerdan broke his elbow in the first round and for 10 rounds literally held LaMotta off with one hand. When he failed to answer the bell for the 11th round, LaMotta got the title on a TKO. He was immediately promised a rematch and was on his way to the USA for that rematch when he was killed in a plane crash in the Azores. His death set off a national period of mourning in France.LaMotta later admitted throwing the Fox fight to Congressional investigators and that with the win over the injured Cerdan cast a pall on his career and reputation. Sad because it was something he couldn't help. Jake the Bronx Bull certainly did have reason to rage.DeNiro is something special. Watching this film you really think you are peeking into a heavenly newsreel highlights and lowlights of the life and career of Jake LaMotta. This film should be seen back to back with Somebody Up There Likes Me, the Rocky Graziano story that Paul Newman brought to the screen. Covers roughly the same era with the same quality.Joe Pesci as DeNiro's manager/brother and Frank Vincent as the neighborhood wise guy would work together again and well with DeNiro and Scorsese. Cathy Moriarty gets her first notice as Jake's second wife Vicky who became a celebrity in her own right after Jake's boxing career was over.Raging Bull is one of the finest boxing films ever done by a master director assembling a perfect cast to tell the tale of a bygone era.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Like a train wreck you just can't stop watching...,"Wow. This is an incredibly unpleasant film about a particularly unpleasant man. However, as the main character (boxer Jake LaMotta) is SO unpleasant and awful, the film is hard to stop watching--like some sort of train wreck that lasts 129 minutes! Now I am NOT saying the film isn't well made--it's very well crafted and there a lot of things to admire about it....but the characters (particularly Jake) are so awful that you just marvel at them.The film is the life story of Jake LaMotta and it covers from his early days as a professional boxer in 1941 through his early post-boxing years. However, there are many things that make it quite different from films like ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" and ""Rocky""--and not just the bubbling hostility of Jake outside the ring. In addition, those around him are incredibly harsh and unpleasant. It's funny, but the mobsters around him are NICER than the LaMottas (Jake and his almost as vicious brother, Joey) and you see them as the gentlemen in the film! Also, unlike these other boxer films, this one shows the brutality in the ring to a degree only approximated in one other film--Kirk Douglas' ""Champion""--though ""Raging Bull"" manages to go a few steps further in the brutality department. A few of the boxing scenes, in particular, are amazingly graphic--with broken noses and squirting blood galore. Now I know I might sound crazy saying this, but this Martin Scorsese film is probably one of the best indictments AGAINST boxing because it IS so bloody and brutal. I'd place it among films like ""Requium For a Heavyweight"" and ""The Harder They Fall"" as the best in anti-boxing films! So let's talk about the technical aspects of the film. When it comes to the boxing sequences, this is an amazing film. As I said above, the brutality of the scenes is stomach-turning. And, instead of quickly filming the matches, the director chose to choreograph them so maximize the emotional impact--with loud thuds, great lighting and amazing effects to simulate the gallons of blood spilled in the fights. My only complaint about the fights is that the boxers simply threw too many punches. No boxing match (even the lightweight ones) has THAT much punching in rapid succession. If they did, they'd never go more than three rounds, as the fighters would collapse from exhaustion! But, this exaggeration did make the scenes more intense, so I saw it as a case of artistic license. As for making the film in black & white, I think this also worked well.The acting was pretty amazing. A lot has been said about Robert DiNero's commitment to the role--and how he deliberately ballooned up 60 pounds to play the retired LaMotta. In addition, the intense physical training he underwent to become the character was amazing. You have to admire his willingness to give his all for the part! When I looked for pictures of Jake, Joey and Mrs. LaMotta, I was also amazed that the actors (DiNero, Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty) really did look a lot like the actual people they portrayed--a nice touch. Overall, an exceptional film in most every way, though it's NOT a film for everyone. The unpleasantness of the film make it something that many simply don't want to endure--and I can certainly understand this--it is bloody and vicious throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Just An ""Okay"" Scorsese Movie","RAGING BULL (3 outta 5 stars) You know, I gotta say it... I don't think this is one of Martin Scorsese's best. I mean, the movie is fine... it's well shot and the story is fine and the performances are good... but it just doesn't work for me like other Scorsese classics. There are some classic scenes in here... but the movie as a whole just doesn't sustain itself for over 2 hours. Robert DeNiro portrays real-life boxer Jake LaMotta and apparently gained something like 60 pounds to portray him in his declining years. Sure, he plays the character and his foibles for all they're worth... but the movie doesn't really give us any reason to care about the man. He constantly mistreats the people close to him... his brother, his wife, his girlfriend... after a while it just seems to be the same thing over and over. Certain scenes do stand out... and the fights are visually impressive... but I can watch Scorsese's best movies over and over and never feel bored. I can't say that about this particular film. But, hey, I think Scorsese's best movie is ""After Hours""... so what do I know?",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Raging Bull: 7/10,"Is there anything worse than the overrated classic? I think not, and one movie that falls into that category is Raging Bull. Almost universally praised by both audiences and critics alike, it's one of those true ""classics"". But is it really? To me, it's just another ""good movie"": one that if it were released today, I wouldn't feel as bad giving it this review that's lower than most others. Alas, I'll get tons of backlash for this review.Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro, in a weight-gaining role only outshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio in Full Metal Jacket) is a boxer at the top of his game. He's the middleweight world champion, he recently got married to a beautiful woman (Cathy Moriarty). However, he's not very stable emotionally, and throughout the course of his life, starts to break down. Joe Pesci pops in and out randomly as Jake's manager/brother Joey. But in this movie, he's not funny like a clown.I found Raging Bull to be a very interesting movie. It's a biopic about someone I hadn't even heard of before I heard of this movie. It successfully shows the whole life of someone, not just portions of it, like others do. It gets down deep into the characters, especially Jake, and shows what affects each of the three main characters and why they do what they do. Most movies could learn from this one.However, I didn't really ""feel"" anything while watching it. Jake was an interesting chracter, but I didn't feel along with him. When various events occured, I wasn't affected in the way I should have been. I think Martin Scorsese really made a superficial film here. He makes an impressive film to look at, especially in the black and white, and the acting of everyone is great, but underneath the surface, there's nothing really there. But I hope I haven't dissuaded you from seeing Raging Bull. It is a very good movie, and one that you can't go through life without seeing.My rating: 7/10Rated R for violence and language.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The bull raging against his greatest foe: himself.,"Raging Bull didn't win the Academy Award for the best film, neither did Scorsese won for the best director, but time has judged otherwise.
Raging Bull is the saga of jealousy, sexual insecurity, hyper-masculinity and the manifestations of all these on a man who could have been a lot more than what he ended up being.
Shooting the entire film in black and white, Scorsese and Chapman have added a sense of authenticity to the movie timeline. This movie isn't about boxing, but about deeper conflicts which drive Jake LaMotta (played by De Niro) in his bouts. The fight scenes, well, they are never just about fights; they are where LaMotta confesses, punches, answers and channels all of him.
Terrific performances by the leads, particularly De Niro and Joe Pesci.

"Made with talent, dedication and charisma--attributes most of the characters on-screen lack...","It took four screenwriters to adapt boxing champion Jake La Motta's autobiography for the screen; however, this black-and-white portrait (with color inserts) from director Martin Scorsese is so full of mongrels and curs, and is so foul-mouthed and flagrantly unappealing, that after awhile I didn't care about La Motta or his family. The film has been beautifully-shot by cinematographer Michael Chapman, utilizing every visual and visceral trick in the cinema manual, and Robert De Niro deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for his amazing, high-wire performance in the lead--even putting on the extra weight for Jake's latter-day scenes. But the movie is mired in sordidness, and Scorsese clearly relishes rubbing our faces in the dirty laundry. The filmmaker's artistry is undeniably vast, yet he fails to lift his picture up on an emotional level and, very soon, one feels like a boxer in the ring, being pummeled. Thelma Schoonmaker also won an Oscar for her editing, which is amazing in the boxing sequences but, later, when Jake is retired and tries his hand at being a lounge lizard, the scenes are allowed to drag on to an inevitable finish.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't believe the hype,"I don't write reviews on IMDb very often, but this particular movie baffles me. How is this in the IMDb Top 250? The only positives I have are that it's well shot and does an excellent job portraying what it's like to be in the same room as a group of people with nothing good to say about each other. The acting is solid all around but nothing groundbreaking. Joe Pesci played Joe Pesci. I didn't find Robert Deniro's performance that amazing; yes he gained 60 pounds to play the retired LaMotta, but besides a lot of yelling, nothing about this universally lauded performance stood out to me. Speaking of yelling, about 70% of the movie is comprised of angry people yelling at each other. I guess all the characters are supposed to be unhappy, but that doesn't mean they all have to be unlikable. There's no reason to care about any of the characters since we hardly get to know them. Maybe the fact that a more relatable side of the characters is never displayed is part of what the film is going for thematically, but the presentation could have been a lot better. For these reasons, I found Raging Bull mostly boring and somewhat exhausting to sit through. I've at least liked every other Martin Scorsese film I've seen, but this one left me unsatisfied and with a sour taste in my mouth.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Classic examination of masculinity,"The story of boxer Jake La Motta from his rising star in the 1940's through to his own downfall and his eventual living on the cabaret circuit in the present day.Scorsese and De Niro  nobody needs say any more.  Whether it be media satire (King of Comedy), small time thugs (Mean Streets) or real gangsta s**t (Goodfellas), the two rarely miss.  This was one of their best to date (and probably for ever).  The story is fascinating in itself but as an examination of masculinity it excels.  The film allows us to watch a man who goes along with all the things he thinks make him a man  even when those characteristics and habits begin to destroy everything he has  his marriage, his realtionships and his career.  Combine this with the gripping boxing tale of ups and downs and you have a film that never outstays it's welcome.Scorsese is on top form  the use of black and white any have been a quality issue, but he uses it well.  The fight scenes are other worldly  exaggerated to the extent that it is breathtaking and more shocking than previous boxing scenes in other movies. My favourite effect is the sound editing in the fights where silence and calm seem to descend just before key moments..amazing.  The relationship stuff is also gripping and Scorsese handles he human cost just as well as he shows us the physical beatings.De Niro is amazing  the method stuff alone is great, but his whole performance is intense.  Similarly Moriaty, Pesci and Frank Vincent are excellent  however they all stand in De Niro's shadow.Overall  an excellent film on so many levels, as a story, as a examination of masculinity, as a sports film, as a lesson in direction and editing..this excels in so many ways  may it never drop out of the top ten from the twentieth century!",,Anonymous,Biography

Raging Bull (1980): The rise and fall of Destructive Boxing Sensation,"""Raging Bull"" clearly ranks as one of the better films of all-time due to it's compelling story of the rise but yet human tragedy downfall at the end. At it's time when done in 1980 the cinematography was fabulous the film's black and white take was a neat and nice concept. Plus the Martin Scorsese does a fine job with the directing as his theme of character study and development into downfall is perfectly done. One could say ""Raging Bull"" is about boxing, but it's really about how boxing for one particular boxer shaped and affected his life in positive and ultimately demising ways. Being cautious to call this a sports drama, boxing does play an integral role in the movie without question. It simply goes to show the deeper human stories behind some of the world's greatest athletes and how it's not simply all about hard work and overcoming the odds. There are more themes in the world of sports than just that. It doesn't have to come down to who is going to triumph in the end. In ""Raging Bull,"" you couldn't care less if he wins or loses, you just want to see how it affects the rest of life of DeNiro. Robert DeNiro gives a tough and fired up performance as former real life and ex boxer middleweight Jake LaMotta, the film showcases Jake's life and career from the early 1940's till his washed up downfall as a low rent club owning stand up comedian in the early 1960's. The scenes are memorable not just the boxing ones but, the scenes of rage and blow ups from the LaMotta character. Joe Pesci gives a strong performance as LaMotta's brother Joey, he always gives encouragement and advice in an aggressive and upbeat manner, really one of the better supporting roles ever done by him. This movie is a great character study of rage, anger, and obsession just wanting to make your dream happen, but it proves many times that a downfall in the end happens can be sad and tragic. Overall good work from all involved especially Scorsese and DeNiro with a great supporting turn from Joe Pesci. What I liked most about the movie was the depiction of a person who did not hit the deserving note in life even though he carried enormous talent just because of the work ethics he carried. Definitely among Scorsese's best and still don't understand why it did not won an Oscar and losing to Ordinary people is beyond my imagination.My Rating - 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Raging Bull,"This biopic about real life boxer Jake La Motta who is portrayed by Robert De Niro. The movie directed by, you guessed it, Martin Scorsese. The movie starts out with the greatest opening credits sequence of all time, it immediately sets you up for the mood of the movie, introducing you to the atmosphere set in black and white, the music, and Jake La Motta. He may not be speaking but just by the mannerisms you get the vibe of a cold heated, violent man, and in all honesty... he is a cold hearten violent man, you see this throughout the movie in another one of the greatest movie performances of all time again from De Niro. The other major characters are Joey and Vickie La Motta. Both performances are good but Joe Pesci is amazing as Joey the brother to boxer Jake La Motta. Joey and Jake whenever they're on screen together it's very interesting to watch. The way the two actors talk is like they're actually brothers, whether they're bickering or just talking it always feels natural. The movie's script is one of it's many high points. It's very well written that flows great despite needing to cover so many years of events. The movie's soundtrack is also a high point. A great thing that this movie was able to do was the ability to convey many emotions, the tension in the ring, the depressing aspect later in La Motta's life, and a (what I find) heartwarming scene when the audience is shown home movies of Jake La Motta, his wife and kids. The movie remains interesting because your able to witness the violent depressing life of a violent depressing man. Your able to see what to most would be something minor as a big deal in his world (for example when his wife says hi to other men at a restaurant). The boxing scenes are a highlight in the movie, most people may say there unrealistic but I don't care about it's realism, the fights are visually something great, very bloody and brutal also. In the final 15 minutes of the film you see Jake's life once he's retired boxing. Robert De Niro actually gained 60 pounds for those parts of the movie. But those final 15 minutes are actually quite sad, your able to see that his relationships have all fallen apart, his wife divorced him, has custody of his kids, and his brother wants no part of him. But yet he is at peace with himself as the biblical quote at the end explains.Raging Bull is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. Boasting one of the greatest performances ever, a marvelous sense of directing, great soundtrack, great script. All of this makes this movie a 9.6 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Gorgeous, meaningful, slightly flawed","I think maybe this is the first Scorsese that resonated with me. Gangster and crime.... It's dramatic, but it's not deep, and really, I just do not care. This, though, is far more universal and has far more purpose and intentionality across the craft that went into this. From the choice to shoot in black and white to the cinematography to the sound design, to the acting-all of it is in service to depicting a British man unable to divorce himself from his insecurities and inherent, broken, brutal nature.But that's also why it's not perfect, but almost so: it presents a man who forces you to look at yourself like a mirror, yes, but it doesn't do the work to show why he is that way, either. We come into his life when the trauma cycle is already fully in-gear. He's already a Raging Bull, and we can only glean why that might be through his actions. It's actually kind of baffling why any information about the character's past isn't offered. There's some degree of second hand accounts and interpretations from his brother in small amounts of dialogue, but you can bet money the brothers were probably abused at home, and that's where it started. You just never actually know that.That being said, it is meant to be solipsistic. The camera lens often only gives insight into what Jake is thinking. Typically, it's jealousy at interactions with women, or else his need to be punished and punish others in the ring. It's so close to being a complete character study. It just elides probably the most important aspect of it: personal history. Maybe that's so men watching can find themselves there no matter what? I don't know. But if you want it to be about a man and you want it to be comprehensive, it feels like a fairly sizeable omission and mistake.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A mediocre film,"I really don't get how this movie got such a high score. I am a huge fan of Scorsese and De Niro, but this movie is definitely not the best sports movie.

I mean don't they know that there's a thing called ""defence"". I know that boxing isn't what this movie is about, but it's still a pretty big part of it, and it surely does add to the believability.And the thing that this movie is supposed to be about-didn't work for me either. Why would I feel sorry for a guy who destroys himself? He has a title-he throws it away. Has a brother who loves him-destroys that relationship. Has a loving wife-he beats her up and drives her to divorce. Yea he has a nice side, but how can you feel sorry for a person who slaps around his wife for no reason?

One off the top 10 best movies ever,"I feel that Raging Bull is underrated by the public they are clearly not getting it where as other Scorsese movies like Goodfellas and The Departed are higher rated then they should be, now don't get me wrong I think Goodfellas is one the top 100 movies ever made and The Departed is a classic but out of all the movies that are higher rated then Raging Bull only about 3 or 4 are regarded as being better, some of you may be thinking what Im saying is I prefer Raging Bull to these movies no no no that is not what Im saying because Pulp Fiction is my second favorite movie ever but it is way too high it should be around the 80 mark in the top 250. So let me start by saying the cast are all great I think the two best though are De Niro and Pesci, it is worth mentioning that De Niros performance I saw one magazine rank the 11th greatest off all time, the film is a film about boxing but I feel it is so much more then that it is really about jealousy and it shows it in a way that is way ahead of any other film that has jealousy in. The Boxing scenes are far better shot then any other film it just looks wonderful, I like Rocky but this is the champion of all boxing movies in fact even though I don't like to call it a sport movie if you do call it that it is the best sports movie ever. a lot more great things could be said about this film or you could just watch it and see how great it is yourself and watch it more then once it gets better the more you watch it.

Most overrated performance in film.,"De Niro got heaps of praise for his performance in Raging Bull.  I'll admit it is gutsy.   But so what.   He gained weight, he lost weight.  He acted like a total slimeball.   So what?   The movie fails completely to explain why anyone would care about Jake LaMotta.   Indeed, nothing about DeNiro's character is attractive.   He fails to show any redeeming qualities in LaMotta, which ultimately makes the movie unbelievable.   The supporting performances, especially from Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty are far greater.

Nothing short of brilliant,"There is just one word that can describe every aspect of this movie: BRILLIANT.The acting for one: Robert De Niro delivers his best performance about the tormented boxer Jake LaMotta constantly struggling with the money and the fame his boxing gives him. But mostly he is tormented by himself. The sheer fact that DeNiro was willing to gain 20 kilos for this role instead of using a prostetic is absolutely amazing. The commitment this man has to roles he loves. Joe Pesci displays his usual brilliance in the hot-headed Italian guy role. The supporting cast is nothing short of brilliant also. Cathy Moriarty is very believable as the wife who is bullied around the clock by LaMotta because of his insecurities. I can of course try to praise everybody here personally, but that would take up too much space.The other tremendous star of this movie is the editing. Thelma Schoonmaker has done a brilliant job of combining different speeds of film footage and everything. Martin Scorsese is totally in his element surrounded by the people he loves to work with the most: screenwriters Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin are at their best.Photography was beautiful in its glorious B&W with a few patches of color.

Not Scorsese's best,"Don't get me wrong: RAGING BULL is a strong movie, featuring some great technical expertise and top-notch direction from the reliable Martin Scorsese. It also happens to feature a pair of excellent performances from Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. But something in the film leaves you cold, cold enough for me to place this far behind the likes of TAXI DRIVER, GOODFELLAS and CASINO.The problem with the film is the script, I think, which fails to make much headway with Jake LaMotta's character. Yes, the film is all about a portrayal of a man who turns out to be a monster, but there's not much of a character arc. LaMotta stays the same from beginning to end, but the film as a whole lacks the grandiose nature of something like SCARFACE, which told a similar story but in a much more dramatic and cinematic way. In contrast, RAGING BULL is cold and a bit depressing.There's still much to like here, though, and inevitably De Niro's performance stands head and shoulders above all else. De Niro undertakes a dramatic physical transformation for the role years before Christian Bale made it trendy to do so, and he's absolutely electric. But, again, he's played characters that are much more interesting in other films. I just didn't think much about LaMotta despite the interest of the warts 'n' all scripting. Trust Scorsese to get another fine performance from Pesci, though, the first of three stunning acting performances from the actor/director combo.On a final note, RAGING BULL comes recommended thanks to THOSE fight scenes. In contrast to the rough 'n' tough bouts of the ROCKY franchise, these are extremely violent and yet also extremely artistic; probably the best filmed of all sports sequences in a movie. I just wish that Scorsese hadn't gone for black-and-white, though, as I think the movie would have been more effective in colour so you could see every drop of blood. It reminds me of Tarantino's hand being forced into making the huge set-piece massacre in KILL BILL VOL. 1 black-and-white.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

In fact, Mr. La Motta seems to have been a violent, abusive man.During the film, Mr. La Motta, beats on opponents in the boxing ring, beats on his wife, beats on strangers, beats on his own brother, and beats on cement walls.Jake La Motta isn't the only violent member of the family. Jakes brother Joey(Joe Pesci) commits an extremely brutal assault against a stranger just for talking with his brothers wife.

Not about boxing but about rage and,"Robert Deniro as Jake La Motta in Raging bull is a boxer who's violence in the ring spills out into his home life.   This not a boxing movie per se but a character study of a near pshcotic pugilist.  THis guy is just overflowing with testosterone and has a severly unbalanced mental state.  Any thing that gets in his way he promptly smashes.  Raging bull is a study of male rage which knows no bounds.  Jake La Motta has a massive inferiority complex which drives him to the heights of brutality. IN the ring, Jake is the pride of his neighborhood. Outside the ring however he hurts his family and friends.  He wants to maintain control over his wife and does so through bullying and phsical abuse.  He realizes she is the better person and feels she must be having an affair whenever he is away. His performance in the ring takes away from his sex life with her.  HE cannot lose control of the things he feels he has a right to.  In the end who loses everything; his wife his brother's support, and his status as a boxer.  WIth age his violent passions subdued in part by his great weight he becomes a mere shadow of his former self. In closing this is a brilliant picture that should have swept the 1980 academy awards.

Boxing Biography,"""Raging Bull"" is a dark, and disturbing close up study of middle-weight boxer Jake ""The Bull"" LaMotta.First up, do not try to make any comparisons with ""Rocky"".  The films, while from a similar era, are far too different to compare.  Whereas ""Rocky"" is, ultimately, a feel-good flick, ""Raging Bull"" is a biography full of violence and self-destruction.Two things in particular that make this film stand out are firstly the fight scenes themselves.  The close-up camera angles, combined with the incredible use of sound editing really enables the audience to ""feel"" every single punch as LaMotta gives himself over to a pummelling.Secondly, this may well be Robert DeNiro's finest hour.  DeNiro is so personal in his style and so exact in his representation of real-life, that you sometimes feel almost embarrassed to be watching him, during some of the more disturbing scenes (those that take place outside of the ring).""Raging Bull"" is a phenom, and alongside ""Taxi Driver"", ""GoodFellas"", ""Casino"" and ""Gangs Of New York"", undoubtedly one of Scorsese's finest works.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Experience Unmatched in Film,"What makes Raging Bull so good is that it is a biographical movie that avoids the trap of hero worship. Martin Scorsese made a movie that is about a boxer, but it's not about boxing; rather, it's about the person. He obviously cared quite a bit about telling the story of Jake LaMotta, and the end result is a superb movie.Of course, it doesn't hurt that Robert DeNiro gives one of the finest acting performances I've ever seen. Every time I watch it, I am amazed by how well he defines his character and how he becomes him in every way. Even minor scenes, like the first conversation he has with his brother, are so perfectly acted (by all parties) that it's a futile effort to stop watching the movie. In many ways, it is much like George C. Scott's portrayal of General Patton... DeNiro simply becomes his character and doesn't let up.Everything about this movie is amazing. The supporting actors (Pesci, Moriarity, Vincent, etc.) are all superb and give extra layers of humanity to the picture (Pesci's performance here was even better than his in Goodfellas, in my opinion). The black & white photography is rich and interesting. The movie unwinds at a perfect pace and stays interesting throughout. The boxing scenes are true works of art. The power behind each fight is well-represented, and Scorsese does a superb job of showing exactly what is going on in LaMotta's mind every time he fights. Most movies would be happy to have one memorable scene that sticks with the viewer. Raging Bull has more than a dozen.It's impossible to watch this film without feeling sad at the end. Still, every time I watch it I am in awe of how good it is. It's all too easy to sympathize with the characters (in spite of their flaws), and it's all too easy to be drawn into the storytelling and the uniqueness of the boxing sequences. Martin Scorsese is a master of film, and Raging Bull showcases it perfectly.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
My favorite movie might be your most hated! Its that polarizing to audiences. You'll love it or hate it simply put.,"Martin Scorsese's first Oscar win for director should have come way back in 1980 for this unflinching, violent, brutal, depressing, self-destructive movie that is unlike any other movie he made before or since. Its nothing like any of them. This is his masterpiece. I think the acting is superior, the black & white makes it stand out and fits the time period perfectly, the main title and end credits music is beautiful and melancholy just like this movie, the timing is right on, the realism is absolutely stunning. And lastly the dedication. There is no Robert DeNiro in this movie, he's 100% Jake LaMotta. A well earned Oscar. Martin Scorsese poured his heart out for this film, he'll tell you himself in archived interviews. This along with Taxi Driver are a reflection of a dark period in the director's personal life.You might dislike it because its true what you've heard about the main character. He's not very likeable nor someone to aspire to be. He does despicable things and is not very respectful. This is the main reason for the ones that didn't care for it and justifiably so. It does illicit that reaction. It also feels somewhat long. But if you appreciate film making at its finest especially as an art form and are a fan of the Scorsese/DeNiro collaborations this movie is a must watch. Its relevant still to this day. And its just fun to watch Scorsese this young in his career at the apex of his brilliance. One of a kind!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Brilliant movie, with 1 of the top 5 performances ever by DeNiro","Hard to sum up in words, but much easier than summing up in hand signals Robert DeNiro + Martin Scorsese + Great Story + Brilliant Script = One of the best movies ever.""Raging Bull"" tells the true story of Jake La Motta, an early 1900's boxer who went from champion to bum. The story begins with his rise in the boxing world, where his talent is obvious but equally is his womanizing, anger and paranoia. As he rises to champion, things go well for Jake, but when problems arise his character flaws bring about his downfall.A must see for true movie lovers. An outstanding performance by DeNiro, even better than his effort in ""Analyse This"", who famously put on over 70lb for the role for La Motta's later years. Also great performances by Joe Pesci, in his breakthrough role before ""Home Alone"", and Cathy Moriarty. Outstanding directing by Scorsese, who created the most realistic boxing scenes up until that time, with the black and white effect really adding to the movie. One of the great Hollywood movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Abravise Characters But It Draws Me Back,"Here's a gritty, film noir-type story of real-life former boxing champion Jake LaMotta, a film that has features some memorable aspects to it.Perhaps most memorable is the physical transformation of lead actor Robert De Niro, who gained somewhere around 50 pounds to play LaMotta at the end of this film. I hope he enjoyed all the food and drink it must have taken to put on that weight!The story moves well with few, if any, lulls and each fight scene is fairly credible although a little too brief. I'd like to have seen more boxing but it's better than having to sit through the overdone action as we saw in the ""Rocky"" pictures. The black-and-white photography is excellent in here. I wish more modern-day films were done in black-and-white.Usually the Hollywood actresses are a lot better looking than the real-life people they portray but that's not the case here with LaMotta's wife, Vicki. Cathy Moriarity doesn't hold a candle to the real ""Vicki,"" who was a knockout, a voluptuous woman feature several times in Playboy magazine. Also, early on in the film Moriarity is supposed to be 15 years old but she looks closer to 35!Typical of a Martin Scorcese film, too, is the excessive profanity, which certainly dominates this film. Perhaps LaMotta was this crude in real life but between De Niro and his brother, played by Joe Pesci, it's a very foul-mouthed, loud and abrasive family. If you can stand that constant profane assault on your ears, it's still a very watchable movie until the last 20 minutes where LaMotta is pictured as a pathetic clown, getting tossed in jail, resorting to stupid jokes and just uncomfortably sloppy behavior that is not fun to watch.Despite all the unpleasant parts of this story, I found this to be one of those films that kept getting better with multiple viewings. Hard to figure, but, Scorcese must have done a few things very well for me to keep coming back. The photography alone, is one thing that keeps drawing me back.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Even if you don't care about sports this film has something to offer.,"This film unlike most sport films is not motivational, instead it's more like a warning of what not to do. It's a life story about a very promising boxer who with his hot temper and terrible choices ruined his career and personal life. While not the most interesting thing on the world, it definitely has some cool moments.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Incredible,"This movie is undoubtedly Martin Scorcese's and Robert De Niro's best work together and is in my opinion one of the greatest movies ever made. It's perfect in every way. The boxing scenes are violent and real and Scorcese makes you really feel like youre there. The black and white was a perfect touch in achieving the nitty-gritty feel of the film. But Raging Bull's real triumph isn't the boxing scenes or Jake La Motta's path to the middleweight world championship, but the portrayal of La Motta's character and his path to ruin.Robert De Niro as Jake La Motta was one of the greatest acting jobs of all time. I can honestly say that I can never once tell that he isn't actually living that life and is in front of a camera. In the film, Jake La Motta is definitely a messed up dude, and it his self- destructive nature that is Raging Bull's main focus. Ultimately, La Motta crumbled into a divorced, fat criminal and a mere shadow of the troubled but brave man he used to be. Almost equalling de Niro are Joe Pesci as La Motta's brother and Cathy Moriarty as Jake's wife. The dialogue between the two brothers flows well and is quite often hilarious. All in all, a magnificent acting performance, and De Niro's oscar for best actor was well deserved.The only complaint I have about this movie is at the end when Robert De Niro quotes Marlon Brando from On The Waterfront. Even though Brando's words fit La Motta's situation extremely well, I wish Raging Bull hadn't used an excerpt from a different movie and had spoken for itself. But, aside from that, this movie is perfect in pretty much every way.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great performance, not so great movie","I have seen Raging Bull a few times, and I must admit, I see what people admire in this movie.  The cinematography, editing (especially of the boxing scenes) and performances were flawless.  Especially De Niro's.  He deserved that Oscar.Despite all that, I did not like this movie.  I have had this trouble with a number of Scorsese movies; I appreciate the skill that Mr. Scorsese has, but simply cannot get myself emotionally involved in his characters.  This movie is supposed to be a tragedy, but how can it be tragic if we do not sympathize with the main character.  De Niro's jail scened, where he hits rock bottom while raining blows on the wall and shouting ""No! No! No!"" should have been heartbreaking.  But it just wasn't.  Out of all the characters in the movie, LaMotta was the only one I didn't like.Most people say that this movie was robbed of Best Picture by Ordinary People, but I believe that movie is much more emotionally involving, much more real, and much more enlightening.  De Niro deserved his Oscar, but so did Ordinary People.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ostentatiously pretentious with a one-dimensional central character,"Certainly a contender for the most overrated film ever made. I like some of Martin Scorsese's work, but I have never understood the near hysterical reactions elicited by critics and his die-hard fans over his contributions to cinema which, much like Steven Spielberg, range from wonderful to embarrassing. To them, every Scorsese film is ""brilliant."" However, despite the reassurances of various critical associations and hero-worshipping fans all too willing to declare this the greatest film made in the last 30 years, most viewers may well wonder what all of the hoopla is about. The film is a biography of boxer Jake LaMotta and documents his volatile, tempestuous nature both in the boxing ring and in his personal life. There is no doubt that Robert DeNiro hurls himself heart and soul into this role, but much of the accolades heaped onto his work center on the arduous physical labors he endured to get himself into fighting shape for LaMotta at his prime and then make himself fat to depict LaMotta having gone to seed. One must admire his dedication, but it was hardly the first time an actor had gone to such efforts  people quickly forget the weight gains of actresses such as Elizabeth Taylor for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf or Lynn Redgrave in Georgy Girl more than a decade prior to DeNiro in Raging Bull. Ironically, other than the physical, there is nothing to recommend LaMotta as a character around whom a movie should be centered. He greets every obstacle in his life, either person or event, by trying to batter it into bloody submission. There is no range to him and he is most certainly not a charismatic person. I certainly would not wish to spend more than a few moments in his presence much less the duration of this film, which ultimately depicts LaMotta as little more than a not especially intelligent, violent pugilist. The profane dialog is anything but memorable and the people who surround LaMotta are little more than ciphers. The film is brutal and often hard to watch, more so because of its pretense rather than brutality. Scorsese films the whole thing in stark black and white and choreographs some of the boxing footage with mournful classical music. All of these touches seem to indicate a serious subject of near biblical importance  but that subject most definitely is not seen on screen in the guise of LaMotta. Joe Pesci pretty much contributes his stock Joe Pesci performance as Jake's brother. The film's biggest attempt at humor comes at the expense of Cathy Moriarty, a whiskey-voiced actress who resembles a 30-year-old vamp but who the film initially tries to pass off as a virginal 15-year-old(!). To her credit, she gets past that initial hurdle and makes Vickie LaMotta the only sympathetic character in the film. Raging Bull is by no stretch a bad film, but it is a criminally overrated one done in by ostentatious pretentiousness and an unsympathetic central character who (no matter how amazing the actor's physical transformation) is nothing more than a one-dimensional thug.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a Beautiful piece of Filmmaking,"If I had to sum up this film in one word it would be ""Breathtaking"". Right from the beginning I knew that this was one of those rare movies that immediately go in everyone's top ten lists. This film is spellbinding. The direction was flawless. The Cinematography was sublime, but the thing that stood out to me the most in this film to me was Robert De Niro's performance as Jake La Motta. In my opinion, it is the most flawless, breathtaking performance in cinema history. It truly is the best acting performance ever filmed. Supporting roles such as Joe Pesci as Joey La Motta and Cathy Moriarty as Vickie La Motta are also brilliant. Overall, the film will stand out in movie history and Robert De Niro's performance will be talked about for years to come. It will always be my favorite film and will never fail to take my breath away.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Devastating and brilliant,"Raging Bull is a savage, unrelenting, and unforgiving film.  It would simply be too depressing if it were not for two small, subtle hints (a quote from the Bible flashed on the screen, and Jake LaMotta's name in the credits) that the real-world LaMotta himself has come to recognize his failings. As it is, Raging Bull must certainly be counted as one of the ten or twenty greatest American films of the century.The scene where Jake pries the rhinestones from his champion's belt, only to have a pawnbroker tell him that the stones (and now the belt) are worthless, is probably the most depressing scene from any movie I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Raging Bull Review,"Raging Bull is the movie adaptation of the famous boxer Jake La Motta's memoir titled Raging Bull: My Story (1980). Starring as Jake La Motta, the Raging Bull, is Robert De Niro, with Joe Pesci as his brother Joey, Cathy Moriarty as his second wife Vickie La Motta, and Frank Vincent as Salvy, the wiseguy friend of Joey.Raging Bull is a fast paced movie of which its plot is easily identifiable as a focus on the life of famous boxer Jake La Motta. This movie was set in urban New York City and chronicles the personal and boxing life of Jake La Motta from the 1940's thru 1964. The complexities of Jake La Motta's real life character served as the theme for Raging Bull. In the movie, Jake La Motta was a driven man of Italian descent with strong family values, a desire to stay away from the criminal element, an excellent boxer, and stubborn man. Jake came to learn that no matter how great of a boxer he was, his success was limited by forces other than his abilities and his boxing opponents. The same forces that limited his boxing achievements also impacted his personal life.In the movie there was a clear parallel between Jake's boxing life and his personal life. Jake's brother Joey served as the link between the two parallels. Further, Joey served as the impetus of Jake's success on each of the parallels. True to the plot's focus on Jake La Motta the boxer, Jake fought Joey throughout the movie even though Joey fought to help his brother succeed both personally and professionally. Confrontation served as a motif of which was repeated throughout the movie. This was demonstrated in Jake's fight with the ever elusive opponents of paranoia and jealousy.Notable, director Scorsese implemented an excellent technique that emphasized the importance of the relationship between Jake and Joey which involved Jake recounting a scene from the movie On the Waterfront between two brothers. And like Marlon Brando's character in On the Waterfront, Jake thought he could have done better. Scorsese did well with his control of lighting throughout the movie. There was never too much light in the movie even for the outdoor scenes. This was Scorsese very artfully controlling the mood of the audience.Raging Bull is a title that very accurately describes Jake LaMotta's character. Special emphases being on rage which envelopes Jake's personal life and his professional life.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"One of De Niro's best, but...","I actually saw this film because of its reference in an episode of ""Celebrity Deathmatch""; I had heard of it before, but, not knowing a thing about real fighting, figured I wouldn't have a clue of what was going on. Though I'm glad I did see the film, my initial thoughts were dead on.Watching this movie, I was never really sure why everything was going on, or sometimes even what was going on.  Granted, I still know very little about the real Jake La Motta, but since this is a film appealing to a broad audience, shouldn't such loose ends should be tied up? I got the basics of the ups and downs in La Motta's life, but the details are what makes the basics so interesting, and I just didn't get a lot of the details.  On a lesser note, the sudden switches to color for the home movie segments are also unnecessary, although it did at least tell me that those parts were in a different time, lest I be even more confused.Whether or not I got all the plot, the acting was simply incredible.  The intensity, focus, and eventual breakdown De Niro shows as La Motta are amazing, and the lengths he went to in weight differences and learning to box for the part show an admirable dedication to acting.  The other La Motta's show equal intensity and anger, and most of the other characters also show above-average acting, although it's not as apparent because De Niro is so magnificent.My father told me that this wasn't so much a movie as it was a showcase for Robert De Niro's acting.  While I have to disagree on it not being much of a movie, I will agree, since I still can't decipher all the plot's fine details, that the main reason to see the film is without a doubt De Niro's acting, which is, again, simply amazing.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A superb masterpiece,I think Raging Bull is one of the best films ever made. Martin Scorsese is my favorite director and this is him at his best. It is shot in black and white to emphasize the 40's and fifties. This is a quality that makes it unique as well as it's main song taken from an italian opera. It's about a middleweight champion Jake La Motta who has skill but has many problems aside from worrying about taking a dive or not . I don't want to give the movie away but it is extraordinary and one of my favorites.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Lots of style, but little substance","Scorsese is at his best when he's not taking himself too seriously. King of Comedy and Goodfellas are fantastic films because there's an upbeat element of humour in them. But Raging Bull (like Taxi Driver) is the story of a destructive nobody. True, De Niro and Pesci give fantastic performances. But I think the film's reputation has been falsely enhanced by the legend surrounding De Niro's performance. At the end of the film I was left wondering what had persuaded Scorsese to make a movie about LaMotta in the first place. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I flatter myself I know something about movies, but...","Okay, let me explain where I'm coming from.  I'm a movie fan.  I mean a really big movie buff.  My favorite directors are Chaplin, Keaton, Kubrick, Fellini, Tarkovksy, Malick, Wilder, Kurosawa, Welles, Reed, Lean, Bergman, Gilliam, Coen, Vidor, Ford, Benigni, and Cocteau, to name a few.  But I had never gotten around to even seeing a movie by Scorsese, although I'd heard great things about him.  You can imagine how excited I was to see that Raging Bull was number 2 on the Sight and Sound director's poll, and ranked the best movie of the 80s.  I was gung ho.  I was hoping to add Scorsese to my list of favorites.  But then, I actually saw Raging Bull.  I cannot for the life of me understand the glowing praise about this movie.  Is it a bad movie?  No.  It's just nothing special.  Scorsese's technique is, if anything, showy.  De Niro and Pesci are wonderful actors, there's no denying that.  But the movie as a whole just isn't particularly good.  I can find nothing about this movie that would bring it even close to the accolades it has been given.  Believe me, I wanted to like this movie.  I thought it would be great and then some; equal to the Searchers or 2001, from the praise it got; but it was uninteresting.  It was like the type of movie arthouse theaters show that is competently made but lifeless and boring, like Shine.  I'm sorry.  Call me an idiot.  I did not like this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Robert DeNiro's best!,"After this film, still ongoing in doubt which film is the masterpiece by Martin Scorsese. Well, I do not know, but ""Raging Bull"" is definitely one of them.The movie is not for everyone, because the story is very complex and unlike anything ever done, and a clean writing and direction that shape from start to finish! The story serves as a biography hasty, but goes deeper than that. The film tells the story of the career of the fighter Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) and the rise of his career, and while his life. To the poor living fighter with a nagging wife being sponsored by the youngest brother; his tremendous winning streak; to his fall into depression.The film follows, as I said before, like a biography but more exploits man. The rise in his life, and the consequences that it has brought to him. The steering black and white that Martin Scorsese uses is fantastic, giving those who watch the film to feel in place of Jake inside and outside the ring. Leaving it to those who attend feel the claustrophobia and fatigue that Jake faces during fights, and also during times of his family life.The entire cast is terrific, Cathy Moriarty (Vickie La Motta) formidable and charming; Joe Pesci (Joey) excellent as always, Robert De Niro ..... IT'S JUST SIMPLY PERFECT, embodies her character in the greatest possible perfection delivering his best performance till today!

"As a drama, it is very good, but as a sport movie, it fails","Raging Bull is a real stylish drama and it has Robert De Niro, but it looks like Martin Scorsese's gangster movies rather than a sport, boxing movie. This is why it was a big disappointment to me. Therefore, the hype (the greatest boxing film ever made, much better than Rocky series) is just a hype, not true. This is not a sport movie and I know that Martin Scorsese said that he hates sport movies, so he passes over boxing scenes quickly (the boxing scenes are too short) thus there is not enough material on boxing in the movie. Scorsese cannot create his own boxing movie, instead he does what he wants to do, he does what he is good at, a crime drama (that also recalls his other gangster movies as said) Therefore, Raging Bull is not the story of a boxer, instead it is like the story of a mafia boss who has some troubles while trying to rise. I think that there is a polarization among people. According to the first group, Rocky series are unrivaled, especially the first one is great, according to the other group, Rocky is nothing in comparison with Raging Bull, it is better by far as a sport film. Raging Bull is a very good drama, but it fails as a sport movie. By the way, personally I prefer Rocky (especially the first movie, the third movie and the fourth movie) A critic says that Rocky is a thickheaded boxer who does not add anything to the movie, he just fights. He does not have to be smart and when it comes to Raging Bull, they say boxing scenes were great, especially camera usage and editing. No, this is not true, a hype! And by the way, according to some, Raging Bull is Rocky of intellectual people. I don't know why I feel like this, but it seems that yes it is. Scorsese's direction, carefully planned great black and white cinematography and Robert De Niro with one of the most realistic make up makes Raging Bull a must see, but as a sport film it is very disappointing. As for the boxing scenes, if you look for great boxing scenes (except for Rocky), I recommend you the opening scene of John Woo's Broken Arrow.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great character study and filmmaking knockout,"Raging Bull is a great representation of the intense, character-driven dramas of De Niro and Scorsese. We see Lamotta's dreams and aggression in the ring, but also his ultimate failure to balance that aggression in day to day life. It masquerades as a more traditional sports movie, and deserves to be praised in those scenes, as the matches were extremely well edited. The real angle of the movie is revealed more gradually: it's really a film about jealousy and fear of sexual inadequacy, and how that self-doubt manifests into lashing out at others, particularly his wife. Moriarty is fantastic as a confident, poised young woman who grows to love and then fear her unstable husband. De Niro and Pesci are both fantastic, and their brotherly relationship is completely convincing. The ending is tragic, as it is painful but fitting to see him in the Florida jail asking why. It doesn't feel groundbreaking now, but that's because of the vast influence it had in the intensity of sports dramas and the classic rise and fall biopic story.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Excellent performance from Robert De Niro, but the movie was good but not great","Many critics argue that Raging Bull is one of Robert De Niro's and Martin Scorsese's greatest movies of all time. I slightly disagree. While Raging Bull is a good movie, I don't think it is a masterpiece compared to other Robert De Niro/Martin Scorsese calibrations such as Taxi Driver (1976), Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995). It can be unpleasant to watch at times, and the film does a good job portraying Jake LaMotta as an unsympathetic character who's self destructive behaviour costs him his boxing career, his marriage to Vickie LaMotta (Cathy Moriarty), and almost his relationship with his brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) who is also his manager.I won't dispute the fact that Robert De Niro's performance as Jake La Motta is one of his best performances that earned him a well deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Robert De Niro has always been a powerhouse actor, as shown in such movies as The Godfather Part II (1974), Taxi Driver (1976), Awakenings (1990), Goodfellas (1990), Cape Fear (1991), Casino (1995) and Heat (1995). Hats off to Robert De Niro for giving it his all to prepare for the role of Jake LaMotta. Robert De Niro went through extensive physical training in which he went through 1000 rounds of sparring, and jumped into the ring for three genuine boxing matches, winning two and losing one. The real Jake LaMotta was said to be very impressed with Robert De Niro's preparation for the role. Robert De Niro also gained 60 pounds (30 kg) to play the older Jake LaMotta. Joe Pesci is excellent Joey LaMotta, who is Jake's brother and manager, as well as often the voice of reason for Jake. Cathy Moriarty as Jake's abused and tormented wife Vickie LaMotta who is often on the receiving end of Jake's violent temper.I don't consider Raging Bull to be one of Martin Scorsese's best movies, although I still think that he is a quality director who has directed many excellent movies in his career including Taxi Driver (1976), Goodfellas (1990), Cape Fear (1991), Casino (1995), The Departed (2006), and The Wolf of Wall Street (2013).If anything I considered Raging Bull to be more of a routine but depressing and bleak boxing movie. Raging Bull is a good movie, but I don't consider it to be a masterpiece, it is definitely worth watching to see Robert De Niro's best performance.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best Fight Scenes Hands Down!!,"There are movies that try to be works of art and then every once in a while there are movies that are art. This movie proves that films are just as important as something hanging on the wall. Scorsese brilliantly captures the life of boxer Jake LaMotta like few people that have been brought to life on screen. Robert DeNiro gives one of the best performances in film history. He plays LaMotta like a concert violinist in front of a sold out audience. DeNiro combined with Joe Pesci as LaMotta's younger brother and trainer Joey are a perfect combination. The cinematography just rips you to shreds and leaves you gasping for air. I never have seen a movie display raw emotion better than Raging Bull. After viewing this movie more than ten times the scenes inside the ring stand out more and more. They make Rocky's fight scenes look like your watching a cartoon. If you watch closely you can truly experience what the fighters are going through. The speed of the jabs, the pounding each fighter takes, the animalistic emotion that they draw upon. Scorsese  includes so many jarring sound and visual effects in the fight scenes that make it so real you can smell the damn thing. And the blood. If this thing was ever colorized it might be the bloodiest movie ever. But it is not over used and misrepresented. It is needed to displayed the true violence that can exist in a boxing ring. Raging Bull is more than just about boxing. It covers spousal jealousy and abuse and it also shows the breakdown that they can cause in a person leading to self destruction. There are so many great shots that it almost becomes ridiculous. One of the best is the one with DeNiro on the ropes in a Christ like image with Sugar Ray Robinson just starring him down ready to crucify DeNiro with his fists. Unbelievable scene. Cathy Moriarty does a great job as LaMotta's wife Vicky and young Frank Vincent has the role as Salvy. Vincent and Pesci really go at it in one scene that leads to a funny shot when they are asked by the local mob boss to make up and be friends. Vincent would go on to be a main stay in most of Scorsese's movies. This movie displays so vividly how LaMotta's violent insides leaked over into his personal life and lead to his destruction. DeNiro rightfully deserved the Academy Award for this role. This is the first time he is asked to gain a large amount of weight as he also did in the 'Untouchables'. And, from reading interviews on how he gains the weight it doesn't sound as easy as you think for someone not used to being in that condition.

Not my favourite boxing film,"""Raging bull"" is a film with a huge status. There are a lot of reasons for that. The dedication of Robert de Niro to his role, gaining a lot of weigth in order to play the aging Jake LaMotta.The boxing scenes filmed in slow motion and using tiny vials with blood and sweat.Nevertheless ""Raging bull"" did not make a lasting impression on me, and that is not because I don't like the boxing film genre. I do like for example ""Body and soul"" (1947, Robert Rossen) and ""Rocco and his brothers"" (1960, Luchino Visconti) and even my guilty pleasure ""The happiest day in the life of Olli Maki (2016, Juho Kuosmanen).The point is I think that I can't indentify myself with Jake LaMotta the way I can with for example Olli Maki. In a more general way my appreciation of the films of Martin Scorsese falls short of their reputation, and I know he is a great director. I do love him however as a connoisseur of films. His documentaries about American (1995) and Italian (1999) movies are unsurpassed.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mediocre,"I've never much liked Robert DeNiro and, despite promise shown in ""The King of Comedy"" (1982), Martin Scorsese did not impress me as first-rate until ""The Aviator"" (2004), followed by ""Shutter Island"" (2010) and ""Silence"" (2016). The huge disadvantage here is trying to tell the true story of a living person, Jake LaMotta. As portrayed herein, LaMotta was an extremely ignorant, extremely obnoxious, extremely ugly person. Robert DeNiro gained 60 pounds to portray LaMotta in late middle age: an Oscar-worthy effort. I can't understand why this is considered a great fight picture, since much of it consists of offering a resume that can be easily obtained by scanning a Wikipedia article in much, much less than the 129 minutes this movie requires. Unlike much better boxing stories, like ""Champion,"" ""Fat City,"" ""The Set-Up,"" or ""The Champ,"" there's nothing and no one to root for, which would disappoint the most committed fan of ""the sweet science."" I suspect much of it has to do with the politics of film criticism: DeNiro and Scorsese are ""in with the In Crowd.""",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Story of a Brother, Husband, Boxer,  Comedian and Human Being","I've been wanting to watch 'Raging Bull' for a long time. Finally 'got the collector's edition DVD and watched it. Now I can see why people call it one of the best movies. Yes, I absolutely loved it but it's one of those films that makes you think (long after the credits have rolled) and when you think about it you understand it better and appreciate it more.The screenplay is tight, concise and balanced. There's been some very skillfully wonderful editing. Nothing is loud or over the top or irrelevant to the main plot. Cinematography deserves mention as the camera movements are fantastic and very effective. Lighting and sound effect deserve mention too (as its a black and white movie and must have been one of the hardest tasks to achieve, while the sound is very well balanced).'Raging Bull' tells the story of the infamous Jake La Motta (played excellently by the one and only Robert de Niro). Its classification as a boxing movie is totally erroneous because the film is just too much more for it to be labelled as such. And by giving such a label one would be ignoring it's brilliance. Yes, boxing is a part of Jake's life (it's what he does for a living) and that's how it's portrayed. It hardly had any significant resemblance to other Boxing movies like Rocky etc. The film is more about his relationship with his brother and wife, his ups and down in his professional life ie, his rise and fall to and from fame.'Raging Bull' belongs to Robert de Niro but Joe Pesci (as the brother and manager) and Cathy Moriarty (as the wife) are equally effective in their smaller roles. The relationship between the brothers was very moving and one can't help but feel bad for La Motta when he tries to reach out to his brother in one of the final scenes. Moriarty gives a very subtle performance of the tolerant wife.Even though we see La Motta as this mean hateful jerk, we see his vulnerable side and feel sympathy. Maybe that's also why his wife Vickie stood by him through all these years. It's also interesting to see that he wasn't physically abusive to his previous wife but towards Vickie he was quite violent. His brother too tries to protect him and his family (although he has his share of flaws) but in the end when La Motta's paranoia takes over things go from sour to very bad. We just see how human these characters are and at times we hate them, we like them and we feel sorry for them.Martin Scorsese deserves special mention for putting this beautiful piece of work on the glass canvas. He obviously has a very compelling way to tell the story. It is without any doubt one of his finest works and it has stood the test of time (one of the greatest achievements for a director I suppose).",,Anonymous,Biography
THAT was entertainment.,"Through all his incarnations, De Niro has come through 100% each time on. However, he WAS Jake LaMotta in ""Raging bull"".  I mean he absolutely killed himself to play this role.  He went from his usual 150lbs. to to 212lbs. But his performance is was makes this movie so good.Jake LaMotta is a boxer who wants his shot at the title but has never had it.  So after winning about six fights in a row, all fighters are afraid to fight him and so his brother Joey (Joe Pesci) decides to take matters into his own hands and makes a deal behind his brother's back to help him get a shot at the title.  He makes his brother fight an up-and-comer called Janiro.After his rather easy victory against Janiro, Jake finally gets a shot at the title which he wins.  But after his fight, he seems to forget everything about his all his work-out and years of hard-work it took him to win the title and begins eating like there's no tomorrow.  He then has problems with his brother and after two other fights, he quits boxing.  We then see what De Niro looks like when he weighs 212lbs.All through the movie, De Niro is right on in the role of  LaMotta and took home a very well-deserved Oscar for best actor. But he is supported by a terrific cast including, Joe Pesci as his trainer-brother and Cathy Moriarty as his wife.  It's one of Scorsese's best and has got to be seen by any movie-buff.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The greatest boxing film ever made.,"People speak very highly of Rocky and other boxing films. This is truly the best of all boxing films. All others are cheap imitations. Cinderella Man, Rocky, Million Dollar Baby, and Ali are not as good as this film. It is magnificently shot- EXCELLENT CINEMATOGRAPHY- the score works wonderfully with the story- the rise and fall of boxing star Jake LaMotta. I am convinced that Robert DeNiro delivers one of the greatest acting performances of movie history. He is literally up there with Marlon Brando and rightfully received the Best Actor Oscar of 1980. I am shocked that Raging Bull did not receive Best Picture. Maybe for its time, the language and sexual dialogue was not too appreciated. Don't let this deter you from seeing the movie. Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro work very well together and this is Martin Scorsese's greatest film. Taxi Driver, Gangs of New York or GoodFellas could not top this film.

Quite possibly the best film of the 80's.,"Raging Bull is one of the most shattering dramatic films ever brought to the screen.  Shot in stark black and white, this is Scorsese's masterpiece.  A most unflattering biographical portrait of boxer Jake LaMotta, made that much more shocking knowing that he contributed to the making of the film himself.  Poetic, human, deeply penetrating; Robert DeNiro gives the performance of his career as the Italian from the Bronx with a ferocious temper inside and out of the ring.  There are certain transcendant moments in Raging Bull, where events onscreen overpowered me and ceased to be merely part of a movie.  Sad, unsettling scenes where it is almost embarassing to watch.  As if we as viewers are invading on something too intimate to be exploited.  Masterful filmmaking and a powerhouse script make this one of my TEN BEST FILMS OF ALL TIME.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Contender,"Generally touted as the greatest boxing movie ever made (presumably by those unfamiliar with 'The Set-Up'), more time has now passed since 'Raging Bull' was made than when it was set when Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci required make-up to make them look older rather than younger.Predictably for a film by Scorsese much more time is devoted to LaMotta's thuggery and domestic violence than his prowess in the ring and there are plenty of four-letter words.The film film gets better as De Niro gets heavier and became something of a cause celebre as an early retro use of black & white - only the main title and home movies being in colour - which provovoked from Ann Billson the observation ""Just be thankful the blood isn't in colour"".",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
one of the finest films by Martin Scorsese,"Raging Bull is a movie directed by the great Martin Scorsese and stars Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta, a boxer who eventually rises to the top but his life outside of boxing is... well destroyed because his jealousy and anger is affecting the people around him. To start things off Robert De Niro does a superb job and was amazing in the film, Joe Pesci is fantastic in this film too and so did Cathy Moriarty. Jake LaMotta is a complex character, he has a lot of flaws and the movie does not shy away from that. He takes things the wrong way almost all of the time and he gets angry a lot because of it hence the title. Unlike Rocky this is not really a movie about inspiring someone, this movie is a look behind the curtain on a boxer who has a lot of problems. The little things like the the title in the beginning being red symbolizing rage and anger don't get enough credit. The scenes where Jake is slapping Vicky because he took something that happened the wrong way or when Joey was reaching his breaking point because he is getting sick of Jake are my favorite scenes in the movie because it shows a good look into reality and are emotional. He may have been a prizefighter in the ring but in real life he is not. The movie presents it's real fights outside the ring, the fights that break Jake down as a person and that's what I love about this movie. And when I think back at this movie I don't think about the boxing I think about everything outside of it but that's not to say the boxing in this movie is good because it sure is, boxing is just a way to release is anger and it is not really a central part of the movie. Overall it is a very well edited, raw, great movie with fantastic performances and this is a must watch for movie fans",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jake La Motta - the man who was his own worst enemy,"Raging Bull is a biographical film telling the story of the Bronx Bull/Raging Bull Jake La Motta. The film showcases his boxing career from the early 1940's through to his eventual retirement in the mid 1950's.It's been some time since I watched Raging Bull (over 10 years ago) and on my first watch I thought it was an OK film. Watching it again I found that it slightly improved on a second viewing, but it's still far from perfect.One thing that I couldn't help but notice when watching this film is that it has a really bizarre question and answer style narrative; whereby one character will ask another a question and the other person will answer said question. It's not really a major problem in the context of the film, but it's just a little unusual and strange.One thing that is patently obvious from a very early stage is that Jake isn't the most likeable of individuals (and that's putting things mildly). He showcases paranoia, insecurity, controlling behaviour, aggression etc. Whilst this makes his journey an interesting one and as a character study again Jake is an interesting character, but after a while the film starts to become an assault on the senses particularly when one starts to feel that there's no light at the end of the tunnel. If you look at most character studies there feels like there's some kind of character arc (where the character may start out bad, but learns from said behaviour, adapts and becomes a better person; Alfie is a good example). Here there is no such thing and even Jake's final monologue in the mirror (whilst being quite a nice example of self-reflection) still felt that despite his appalling behaviour La Motta still wasn't entirely taking responsibility for his actions. Although this may accurately reflect La Motta's actual behaviour at the times it does make the film a pretty gruelling viewing experience from time to time.Looking at some of the positives then this film is certainly excellent from a technical point of view; the acting from Robert De Niro is exemplary and I feel as though he did deserve the Oscar win (not to mention the hard work he put in both getting in to shape and gaining all the weight to portray La Motta in his later years). Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci were both great in supporting roles. The editing, the black and white cinematography and the boxing camera work and fight choreography were also first rate.The final portions of the film (after Jake has retired) are particularly painful to watch where we get to see Jake embarrass himself through ill-judged attempts at comedy and his appetite for the ladies which gets him in further trouble; you can just see him continue to slide down this slippery rope till he can effectively he could sink no further.I appreciate Raging Bull for what it tried to do (enjoy is probably the wrong word to use) and as I said it's very well-made and an interesting character study, but the idea that La Motta is bad from start to finish doesn't always make it a particularly pleasant viewing experience.Worth seeing once (if nothing else for De Niro's superb performance), but I've now watched it twice and that's more than enough for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A compelling study of an unlikeable man,"There are quite a few films that I could mention where the lead characters are wholly unlikeable and because they have no audience appeal, the film suffers greatly. Raging Bull is NOT one of those films. Robert De Nero puts in one of the best performances of his career as middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta. And LaMotta is not a nice chappie at all. Arrogant, rude, abusive, paranoid and obsessive are just some of the more complementary words I can think of to describe him. Yet extraordinarily this enhances rather than detracts from the film. Rather than hating him we feel deeply sorry for him because he was a man who had everything and then lost it through his own selfishness and personal insecurity. Director Scorsese's camera work is brilliant, with the boxing scenes some of the most vivid (not to mention graphic) ever filmed, all impeccably edited by Thelma Schoonmaker. The performances are all superb: Pesci as LaMotta's brother and Moriarty as his wife but especially De Nero as the self-destructive LaMotta himself. Raging Bull is the first Scorsese film that I have seen to date. On this basis I shall be seeing many more.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Must-see for wannabe toughs!,"The life of Jake LaMotta is filmed in sort of a documentary style based on his autobiography. The film has some specific features. It was shot in black&white, and in addition, to portray older years of Jake, Robert De Niro had to put on about 30 kg. It has also some very nice tunes, one of which reminded me of ""Over the Rainbow"".However, the subject matter is the downside of the film. It involves how Jake's vicious character and paranoid thoughts affected his life. I kept asking myself ""Why would I be interested in his life?"". Although the acting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci is top-notch, I couldn't feel for anybody in the film. It appeals more to wannabe toughs.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Raging, marvelously raging, one of the best, if not...","Raging Bull - a movie about a man with bad problems.What kind of problems... Well a lot. I was disturbed when I watched this, this beautiful cinematic experience. The opening, the distance, De Niro dancing in the ring with a leopard robe, black and white, ohh.... The best cinematography, it is something very VERY beautiful. Words can't express how far my love for this movie has gone and is going. I will give it a second watch...With all that said, I think you'll know just how much I like Raging Bull. So, Raging Bull is about Jake LaMotta, the most mentally complex protagonist ever. A man who is number #1 in boxing, he is in his eyes at the top of the world. While he is at the top of the world, everything he does and stands for outside the ring get's completely mauled.My most interesting analysis is Jake's psychology. Does he suffer from some mental dis- order? Or is this man seriously just like this naturally? His name is so accurate, he truly is a bull. A raging one. He does so many things that I think are just crazy. His sexual jealousy, his anger, every inch of detail he looks at, what the hell is wrong with him? I hated him, and that is a good thing. This character of Jake is the most mental wise evil protagonist I have seen so far. This movie had some psychological thriller in it. And what can I say about the black and white cinematography? I loved it so much! It made the movie even darker. This movie is a masterpiece you need to watch, the best movie that has boxing in it, and just all around one of the smartest movies I have ever watched.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Robert De Niro at his best,"I had heard that Raging bull was a good boxing movie but, only decided to watch it recently. I thought the fact that Raging bull is in black and while made it better.I did not even realize that the actor playing Jake La Mota was Robert De Niro. He looked so different at the beginning of the movie. His transformation though tout the movie was amazing to me. Towards the end of the movie Robert De Niro lookes like Robert De Niro. Joe pesci also did a good acting as Jake La Motta''s brother.I was not interested in how Jake did as a boxer. I was more interested in the relationship between him and his wife and women. Maybe I was not that interested in Jake's boxing because I am not a boxing fan.When I watched major league I was happy that the Indians won the pennant. I am more of a baseball fan.Raging bull was well worth the two hours of watch time. I am glad I watched it. If you are a Robert De Niro fan I think you will like it also.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truly Amazing,"Raging Bull is one of those films that nobody really wanted to make and no companies really wanted to fund but, when they finally do get made it's that gritty grubby atmosphere in their pre-production stages that often pull the films to glorious highs and fantastic praise.Perhaps my favourite American film alongside The Godfather Part 2, Raging Bull triumphs on all levels.  The great Oscar winning performance from De Niro is truly a classic performance alongside brilliant supporting roles Pesci and Moriarty.It took alot of guts on Scorsese's part to shoot the film in all black and white (except for one tiny scene) but i'm very glad he did as it increases the atmosphere ten times and gives the film a some personal and intimate feel most notably in the fight scenes.The fight scenes are filmed masterfully using large clean boxing rings for the early fights when La Motta is up and coming and full of energy and then changing to smaller, grubby rings alongside hazy effects over the scene to show La Motta downfall and the loss of his ability in the later fights.Overall Raging Bull is praticulary faultless and is deserving of viewing and purchasing by anyone that is even a little bit interested in film.10/10",,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent right up to the end,"Raging Bull was the first of the Scorsese/De Niro partnership that I watched and it was well worth my time. A powerful, emotional, beautifully crafted biographical tale of a boxer with an overly-aggressive temperament and an anger management problem, it took me to a high cliff peak and essentially just dropped me by the end.Up to the two hour mark and Jake La Motta's final fight, this film is one of the greatest and most powerful I've ever seen, but for me the ending didn't quite stick because it came as quite an anticlimax to what was basically such a climactic story. The character of Jake La Motta is artfully constructed and De Niro's performance defies definition and yet the film as a whole left me feeling unfulfilled because the emotion that was so paramount up to that point became quite slow and stagnant; as a biography it works well, but not brilliantly.That's not to detract anything at all from this exceptional classic, that was merely how I felt after watching the film. Scorsese really shows his true class and quality in this film, he is such a master craftsman and manages to extract one of the most memorable anti-hero performances of all time from De Niro while Joe Pesci also does a fine job as Joey.I really wanted to enjoy this film and I really wanted it to be better but the way I see it, it could either have been made longer to extract all of the story from the final half hour, or have cut out the last half hour altogether because overall, it just seemed almost completely irrelevant in the way it was made. ****1/2 / *****",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A different kind of 'boxing movie'; sombre yet vivid and ferocious.,"'Raging Bull (1980)' differs from most 'boxing movies' in a few ways, most of all how it charts a career instead of the build-up to a single, make-or-break bout and places its emphasis on the tumultuous home-life of the man wearing the gloves as opposed to his time in the ring. Indeed, the boxing sequences - which are vivid, vicious and ferociously energetic - make for less than ten minutes of this picture's screen-time. Though much of its focus is on the jealous, controlling and generally abusive side of Jake La Motta, the eponymous raging bull, the flick doesn't actually delve all that deep into his character, even though it does a good job of portraying him for who he was - or who the filmmakers saw him to be, at least. In this way, we get a character study done from afar, almost like we're a fly on the wall and given the backstage access our protagonist was so keen to keep journalists from getting. We aren't told anything about the stone-faced protagonist but rather shown it and allowed to make up our own minds, which is a common thread through Scorsese's work. The piece is sometimes slow, but never boring, and usually entertaining. It is also quite sombre, in the end. It is wonderfully constructed and well-conceived, easily becoming one of the best in its sub-genre, and its boxing sequences (refreshingly shot from inside the ring) are some of the best in cinema. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Well made, hard to watch","Though certainly not for everyone, in part including myself, Raging Bull is a well crafted, well acted film about the most annoying, obnoxious, abusive and arrogant man ever to have roamed this Earth.The basic problem with this movie is certainly not the way it is was made but the aspect of entertainment. This due to the rather flat and repetitive storyline. It is anything but a feel-good movie and you will find that the greater part of the negative reviews this movie has gotten, revolve around this issue.It is true; LaMotta is unbearable to watch, his actions: despicable. Yet the fact that it is so perfectly shot and acted out makes that the point of this movie comes greatly across. It is of course a side of men, we rather not see and I found myself frequently trying to strangle LaMotta in my mind.On a more negative side, I found the movie to be plodding at times and since the drama around LaMotta was quite one-dimensional, I would have rather seen this movie go more into the boxing and the training aspect (like Rocky did). The way it emphasized on the drama, made the boxing secondary and made it add little to the story.Incredibly well made but painful to watch.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not too great,"I'll sum the whole movie up for you: 75% of the movie is wife beating and screaming. 25% is boxing reenactments. Jake lamotta isn't a hero, but more of a villain. I couldn't really connect with his character, because whenever he got a chance to talk, he screamed at everyone. Boxing didn't seem to be a big part of his life either, there were never any scenes where he was struggling with his career, or boxing was affecting his life in any way. You might as well make a movie documentary on joey buttafuco. This movie wasn't any good in my opinion. And when I hoped that he would come to his senses, he doesn't.

Fantastic Character Study,"Raging Bull is a film that works on nearly every level. Martin Scorsese's direction perfectly captures the time period of the film as well as the emotional and physical intensity of Jake LaMotta's story. The screenplay by Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin is gritty but honest and beautiful. These elements combined with the phenomenal (and believable) performances of Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and the rest of the amazing cast make Raging Bull a must-see. This could have been a by-the-numbers, generic sports movie, but Scorsese and the writers instead crafted a complex portrait of a deeply troubled man. At certain points in the film, LaMotta seems despicable and completely unlikeable but at other points is sweet and charming. He is portrayed as a real human being and not just a caricature. The boxing matches are brutal and intense, but the more intimate scenes are emotionally draining as well. This is largely due to Scorsese's stylistic choices, such as the edgy black and white color palate and the home video-style transition sequences. Everything in this film is intentional and aids the story; no time is waisted. By analyzing Jake LaMotta throughout not only his boxing career but later on in his life as well, Raging Bull becomes a fascinating, intelligent, and emotional character study more than it is a straight up boxing movie. It takes a while to get into and drags in a few places. Also, some of the supporting performances are spotty and some characters are underdeveloped.

The Best Film Of My Lifetime,"Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" is without a doubt the most engaging and remarkable films I have ever seen.From its opening credits as DeNiro (as LaMotta) dances, throwing jabs, in slo-mo, we're drawn into this richly textured story.Seen from only LaMotta's point of view, the film is tough on the soul. We've all known someone like LaMotta.  A man, who seemingly has all the luck in the world, yet has many demons that he can't fight off, in or out of the ring.As the film opens, LaMotta is in a marriage that is going nowhere fast and he feels trapped and unhappy.  Upon his introduction to Vicki (executed to perfection by Cathy Moriarty) his look on life changes.  His budding boxing career is beginning to take off, yet out of the ring, as he views his young wife from a distance, she floats in slo-mo and gazes by hungry men don't go unseen by LaMotta.  This only further fuels his jealousy.The rest of the film is like this, a slow decent into LaMotta's own private hell, and then salvation.Enough good things can't be said about the richly textured story that Scorsese and his co-writer Paul Schrader created from Jake LaMotta's autobiography of the same title.

Scorcese's Personal Masterpiece- a Must See,"Probably the most deeply affecting film I have ever seen, Raging Bull towers as a masterpiece of cinema. Scorcese's personally urgent portrait of a man in need of redemption, it is the most powerful film I have ever seen. Watchable multiple times, Raging Bull contains astonishing scenes of pure, unbridled emotional truth; as well as intense, raw fight scenes.It is the tragic story of Jake LaMotta, a boxer who in the ring was never knocked down. He experienced little but downfall in his personal life, as his paranoid torment and sexual inadequacy drove him to alienate everyone that he had loved.At home he was paralyzed by suspicions of his young wife, Vicky, cheating on him. In the ring he punishes her and himself by dealing out and receiving incredible amounts of pain as his payment for a deeply sinful nature.Scorcese's work ranks with the greatest portraits of tortured artists (by that I mean both LaMotta, and Scorcese at the time) in this film which was made by Scorcese because of how strongly he related to the fundamental male need to torture himself over his lack of understanding towards women.In Mean Streets and Taxi Driver, Scorcese's hero's guilt led them to hold their fists over flames, testing the fires of Hell. In Raging Bull, Scorcese sends Jake LaMotts into a pounding, animalistic, physical Hell on earth every time he steps into the brutal, unforgiving ring.Scorcese's choice choice to film in crisp black and white gives the film an authentic but surreal tone that brings it closer to real life than most movies. It is beautifully shot, and the black and white elevates it to a timeless, mythic place in the viewers mind.Robert Deniro's performance as Jake LaMotta can never be matched or compared. It leaves the realm of performance and instead is an embodiment. Famously gaining sixty pounds for the tragically extraordinary final moments, Deniro finds moments of unbelievable power and uncompromising truth in a man flawed not because he is evil; but so uncontrollably, paralyzingly human. It ranks alongside Charlize Theron's performance in Monster as the number one piece of acting in the history of cinema.Failing miserably at the box office (Raging Bulls filming budget was 18 million, compared to its box office take of 0 million), and unloved by critics who felt that it was an ugly story about ugly people, Raging Bull was not a financial success story. Instead it was discovered over the years as the art that it was and is now considered one of the best films of all time.Any honest person who watches this film will find a riveting, emotionally draining film about what it means to be human. One of very, very few films that I found lived up to all of its expectations and beyond. It occupies a powerful place in my mind, and in the history of film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Throw in some brutal fight scenes and a melancholy score and you've got a dark portrait of one mean s.o.b.Again, it's not really a boxing movie, and that's not a criticism. I think the best scenes happen outside of the ring, where Joe Pesci stands as De Niro's equal and the two really electrify the movie. And as wickedly as those title bouts are filmed, the most harrowing scene is just LaMotta in a jail cell. Scorsese just holds that shot interminably, never offering relief with a cut. I just think that's remarkable that, in a movie with so much blood and bone-hitting sound effects, such an unassuming scene packs the biggest punch.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Classic Among Classics. Martin Scorsese's masterpiece.,"""Raging Bull""I watched this a couple days ago, but as I said, I enjoy letting the greatness sink in when I find a diamond in the rough. Just ""No Country for Old Men"" is the Coen brothers crown jewel, this is Martin Scorsese's crown jewel. This is Martin Scorsese's masterpiece in my opinion. There is nothing better that he has done. THE SCORE! The right music can really light up a film and bring it to life. Robert De Niro's character of Jake La Motta and his rage intertwined with a beautiful classical symphony is put together with such ease and draws you in, and it makes you wonder. He plays the black and white off so sincerely. The lighting every time they stepped into the ring, everything really popped. The smoke that was caught in the air that appeared to be intentionally grainy. Everything. Robert De Niro giving one of the most well deserved best actor academy award winning performances ever to be witnessed on screen. And Joe Pesci, I apologize once again. I underestimated you and had a skewed vision of what you were like as an actor that was created from ""Home Alone""; you too, truly are talented. Their chemistry was great. The way that Cathy Moriarty put her lips together to make them seem so small and cute. It's not even really about boxing, it's more about Jake La Motta and what a terrible person he was and how sad his life became. This is not a movie of redemption. Beautiful. Marvelous. Classic. Genius. Genuine.""You never got me down, Ray. You never got me down.""10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Powerful And Unforgettable Masterpiece From Martin Scorsese And Robert De Niro","Raging Bull is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,powerful and unforgettable Masterpiece of cinema that combines amazing direction,powerful acting,beautiful music and stunning photography. All of those elements make Raging Bull Martin Scorsese,Robert De Niro and Film making at their best.Based on the book of the same name and set from the 1940s to the 1960s,Raging Bull tells the true story of Jake LaMotta(Robert De Niro),a middleweight Boxer who is successful and rising to the top in the Boxing ring and wants to become the middleweight champion of the world. While Jake is doing well in the ring his personal life and troubled relationships with his wife Vicki(Cathy Moriarty)and brother Joey(Joe Pesci)lead to Jake's rise and fall in and out of the ring.Released in 1980,Raging Bull despite being a modest Box Office success and receiving eight Academy Award nominations and winning two for best actor(Robert De Niro)and Best editing(Thelma Shoonmaker)received mixed reviews from critics because the violence and language and lost the Oscars for Best Picture and Director to Robert Redford's Ordinary People which is a fine film in it's own right. But overtime Raging Bull is now seen as a masterpiece and not only one of the greatest films ever made but also the greatest film of the 1980s. Right from it's terrific opening credits and first scene,Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull is a brilliant and powerful masterpiece on so many levels from the acting,direction and everything else is one the main reasons I love cinema so much. The movie is a great combination biopic,sports drama and art film giving viewers a movie that is both beautiful and ugly as well as brutal and harsh at the same time. Raging Bull was one of the last if not the last great film that came from the New Hollywood era that lasted from the late 60s into the 1970s even though the movie was released in 1980. The Black and White photography by Michael Chapman is fantastic,visually stunning and truly adds to the film giving the movie an accurate and stylish look to the 1940s and 50s as well the scenes inside and out of the Boxing ring. Chapman also uses smoke and lighting to great effect not giving the movie an incredible atmosphere but reflecting the characters state of mind. What also makes Raging Bull an outstanding film is the editing by Scorsese veteran Thelma Schoonmaker. The editing by Schoonmaker is sensational because we get freeze frames,fast cuts which give the movie a great pace and quickness that was ahead of it's time and holds up years later. The Boxing scenes in Raging Bull are thrilling,amazing and some of the bloodiest and most graphic Boxing scenes ever caught on film and directed with terrific skill,detail with Actions and sound effects and when every punch is thrown you not only hear the punches you feel them as well and there is devastating impact with each of the fight scenes. What I also love about each of the Boxing scenes is that all of them have a different tone and style with Scorsese mixing realism and exaggeration. The violence in Raging Bull is shocking and at times horrific and will disturb viewers but the violence fits with the movie's tone and spirit. Although the movie has Boxing the movie is more about the man Jake LaMotta than his profession. The portrayal of Jake LaMotta will obviously divide viewers when they watch the film because on one hand we feel sorry for Jake and some of the things he has to endure but on the other hand viewers will dislike Jake because of his abuse to his wife and self-destructive ways bringing his brutality outside of the ring. We also see Jake brought down by his own insecurities and paranoia which makes his rise and fall much more tragic. One of the reasons Raging Bull is amazing because it's not really a Boxing but more of a character study. The ending of Raging Bull is amazing and memorable because it gives Jake LaMotta a new beginning that is optimistic and positive. Will you feel differently about Jake LaMotta at the end? The movie greatly asks viewers that question and makes viewers answer the question themselves. A terrific and unforgettable ending.The cast is amazing. Robert De Niro is excellent in one of finest acting performances in film history and gives his greatest performance as Jake LaMotta,with De Niro bringing emotion,intensity and anger to his Oscar winning role role. Cathy Moriarty is terrific,beautiful and sexy and Vicki LaMotta,Jake's second wife and holds her own against De Niro and Pesci. Joe Pesci is brilliant and fiery as Joey LaMotta,Jake's younger brother and has great scenes with De Niro. Frank Vincent is wonderful as Salvy,Joey's friend. Nicolas Colasanto is outstanding as Tommy Como,a Mob Boss that wants to help Jake. Mario Gallo(Mario),Theresa Saldana(Lenore)and Lori Anne Flax(Irma)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Scorsese is brilliant,powerful and some of best directing in movie history,with Scorsese using zooms,wide,high and low angle shots,a great tracking shot,close ups and use of slow motion while doing an amazing with the Boxing scenes. Outstanding direction,Scorsese.The classic music by Pietro Mascagni is beautiful,mesmerizing and memorable and fits with the images and tone of the movie. Great music.In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Robert De Niro or movies in general,I highly suggest you see Raging Bull,an excellent,brilliant and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that deserves to be in every movie lover's collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mesmerizing film,"Great direction by the best director alive. Outstanding black and white cinematography, acting,and editing. The best boxing scenes ever filmed. I love the way Scorsese emphasizes that violence and sex are equivalent for Jake. Scorsese shows this in the scene where Jake pours ice water on penis to suppress sex drive just before a fight. After the fight, Scorsese shows a prolonged closeup of Jake's fist in a bucket of ice water. Therefore equating Jakes fist and his penis. Scorsese also cuts from scenes of Jake and his wife (usually romantic in nature) to scenes of him boxing,continually emphasizing that sex and violence are equivalent forms of release to Jake. A cinematic masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Craft VS Content,"Raging Bull is a portrait of boxer Jake LaMotta, and is often hailed as the greatest film of the 80s. Tellingly, it is most commonly revered by people who have a certain knowledge of or interest in the craft of filmmaking. What could possibly be wrong with that?Martin Scorsese is the most enduring New Hollywood director after Steven Spielberg, and, unlike the latter, managed to more often than not succeed commercially without giving in to audience tastes and expectations, hence the higher level of respect he receives from critical circles. His earlier work in particular was a perfect combination of raw, powerful storytelling with an encyclopedic knowledge of filmmaking technique, and in Robert De Niro and Paul Schrader he found worthy, reliable collaborators with the talent to create these rage-infused films. It is strange to consider that this particular project was not one he originally wanted to make.Robert De Niro nursed a fascination with La Motta and threw years of energy into convincing both Schrader and Scorsese to make a film about him, often to the confusion of those around him. During one story meeting, a studio exec asked the dream team why they wanted to make a film lionizing this ""cockroach"". That is perhaps the heart of the divisive issue.Raging Bull is a masterpiece of direction, one of the most alluringly shot films you will ever see, and contains some of the best performances ever committed to celluloid. But, expert character study that it is, it is that of a truly repugnant individual, whom it does indeed lionize beyond reason, and upon whom it forces an awkward and undeserved absolution (""I once was blind but now I see""?), the result of a, at the time, personally burnt-out Scorsese forcing his own Christian sense of renewal onto an incompatible character.Raging Bull is, and should be, mandatory viewing for anyone interested in filmmaking or performance. However, it is more ""important"" than enjoyable, almost more significant for its technical virtues and the bygone creative era it represents, easy to admire but very hard to love. Its points of contention are the same that feed such heated debate around other classics, most notoriously 2001 A Space Odyssey, worlds apart yet similar in that it succeeds as a work of art while failing as a story and piece of entertainment. Love it or hate it for what it has to say, there is beauty and artistry in how it says it.To film historians and a majority of critics, Raging Bull ended 80s cinema by opening it, saying all there was to say. But to me, its fellow black-and-white best picture nominee that year (also containing the resounding cry ""I am not an animal"") is a more affecting, more enduring statement about human nature than Raging Bull turned out to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Raging Bull,"This film tells the true story of boxing icon Jake La Motta, a sometimes paranoid, hard-headed fighter from the 40s. De Niro's work in this is just sublime, he gives us 2 hours of rock-solid method acting, and the way that he and Pesci feed off each other on the screen is a landmark of not only cinema, but enterteinment in general. They are perfect together. And we should be grateful to have gotten to see these two incredible actors work together for so long.The supporting cast is also spot-on, and combined with Scorsese's meticulous directing, they all shine in their own way.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I like Cathy Moriarty in here also,, Joe Pesci is you're basic tough guy you just have to have in a movie like this,, the movie is about a boxing champ Jake laMotta from the 1950's I believe . lot's of good stock boxing footage, but most of the movie revolves around Jake's personal life, and how throughout the movie his life slowly starts to disintegrate around him,, he especially treats his wife like crap, it's really hard to feel any sympathy towards the character after you see just what happens to his wife in several of the scenes.. I also love the entire length of the movie being shot in black and white,, I don't' know why it was done that way but I like it,, another Scorcese DeNiro, success,, it's a sad story,, but very good .",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The finest example of Scorsese's brilliance,"A marvel of a movie; a spot-on analysis of one man's aggression and insecurity; an eternal cinematic treasure: Martin's Scorsese's 1980 black-and-white biopic of a middleweight boxing legend is stark, striking, and nothing short of brilliant. Raging Bull is by far the premium product of the Scorsese/De Niro tandem and one of the finest films ever made.The film chronicles the rise and fall of Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), a middleweight boxing legend during the 1940s and '50s, whose bouts with Sugar Ray Robinson (Johnny Barnes) put him at both the top and bottom of his game. Throughout the picture, LaMotta is depicted as a man of accessible rage and disheartening jealousy, and it is his wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) and brother Joey (Joe Pesci) who stir these emotions. The boxing ring merely serves as an arena for LaMotta to unleash his anger without remorse.Scorsese's choice to shoot Raging Bull in black-and-white (except for a few home-movie sequences) perfectly complements the gritty storyline. Scorsese's decision to make his boxers' blood look inky black versus bright red is alone a testament to his sensational style. His direction here is absolutely superb. In fact, the final bout between Sugar Ray and LaMotta, that closes with, ""You never got me down Ray. You never got me down."" and a shot of the blood soaked rope, is my favorite sequence by any director, in any film, in any genre. It is a crying shame that Scorsese did not win the Oscar for best director in 1980 and even worse that Raging Bull did not win Best Picture.On the upside, De Niro did take home the gold for best actor. His performance is single-handedly the greatest male acting I have ever encountered. De Niro's work here is near equivalent to a master course in theater. From his chiseled animalistic form in the ring, to his overweight pitiable figure who quotes Marlon Brando from On the Waterfront at the film's close, De Niro is at his best and his performance promises to wow the dreariest of viewers.In addition, Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci dish out phenomenal performances. Cathy, at age 19, pulls off Vickie as both a 15 year-old girl and an aging distressed wife, while Joe Pesci plays Joey with the same demeanor he later applied to his Academy Award winning role in Scorsese's Goodfellas.Finding faultless direction and flawless all-around acting occurring in concert is truly an unconditional indulgence. Raging Bull represents cinematic excellence; it is a heat-seeking missile of a movie. It is an unavoidable knockout that will eventually cross your path, and when it does, you will not only feel its impact, but you will also come to appreciate how utterly perfect and unmerciful movies can be.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Brilliant cinematic achievement, but falls short.","Raging Bull is at the same time a brilliant movie and a disappointment. People are correct when they say that DeNiro's performance as La Motta ranks as one of the greatest of all time, but great acting does not necessarily equate to a great movie, and the weak script ultimately overshadows both DeNiro's performance and Scorsese's directing to result in a movie that falls short of it's potential.Scorsese tries with all his might to hold the movie together with arguably his best directorial performance. It has all the classical aspects of a Scorsese film: beautiful editing, superb camera work, great score, stunning visual sequences. But as mentioned, the real standout is DeNiro's acting. The rage and passion that La Motta shows towards every aspect of his life flow effortlessly from DeNiro, and as a viewer you are unable to separate the actor from his role, which is a sign of a great performance.Unfortunately the subject material was just to vast to fit into a 2-hr movie. Huge parts of La Motta's life fly by in montage sequences; new phases in his life last a few minutes before they are uprooted to further the plot, and what began as a character study ends up in a race to sum up his entire career. In the end the movie seems to be a collection of snapshots of La Motta's life and career, with a few short scenes thrown in to try to depict La Motta as more than just a paranoid masochist. But these scenes are few and insignificant when compared to the vast majority that illustrate his explosive violence and rage, and the resulting one-dimensional character, coupled with an event oriented plot, leaves the viewer unable to fully relate to or sympathize with La Motta. Even if certain scenes were to invoke emotion, time flies by so fast that the viewer is left little time to fully process where the story is headed.Overall I feel as though these shortcomings are direct results of trying to create a movie around an autobiographical novel. When the director is constrained to tell the truth, there is very little leeway to modify the script as might be necessary to improve the enjoyment of the viewer. I think unfortunately is boils down to the fact that as presented, La Motta's life is just not as magnificent or as entertaining as some of the more recent movies that tackle this similar ""rise and demise"" plot structure, and so the movie fails to entertain to its fullest capacity. It's neither a straight character study, nor is it an overly compelling story, and so it remains unable to satisfy the viewer in either way.Despite these pitfalls with the plot, Raging Bull still rises above the average film by its gorgeous directing and brilliant acting, and when viewed from this angle, remains a must-watch movie for any fan of the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Disappointing,"Maybe if I saw this before Casino and Goodfellas, I would have liked this more, but it sucked in comparison to those two. Apart from Joe Pesci, I thought this movie was damn near unbearable. DeNiro did a great job acting, but it was wasted on this boring character and horrendous plot! DeNiro said all of two things to Vicki and supposedly she wasn't a girl you ""F and leave"" but DeNiro did it with two phrases. He took a dive and got the championship and self destructed for no apparant reason. Why was this interesting? The story itself wasn't interesting and the movie didn't enhance the true story at all. Cathy Moriarty was attractive and nothing more. The rest of the characters other than the La Motta brothers added nothing and were drab and blah. Goodfellas and Casino had a better plot and the characters had more depth and overall were much better movies. Except for ""I heard things"" and Joe Pesci, I want the 2 hrs of my life back.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Outstanding!,"Raging Bull is routinely called the best film of the 80's, and many people call it the greatest film of all time. It certainly deserves those accolades and more. It ranks solidly in my all time top ten and is one of the most painful character studies in movie history.Raging Bull is about a boxer but it is not a boxing movie. In fact, I would be surprised if the fight scenes make up more than 15 minutes of the entire film. They are so brutal and so well done, they seem longer.Director Martin Scorsese has one of the most impressive C.V.s of any director, and I believe him to be the greatest filmmaker ever. Raging Bull is a work or directorial genius, but the film is primarily Robert DeNiro's triumph. It garnered him a well-deserved 2nd Oscar for this portrayal of a vicious, dislikable near-sociopath with an insane jealous streak and countless personal demons.In the movies best scene, DeNiro's Jake La Motta takes an absolute pummeling from Sugar Ray Robinson - he appears to be beaten nearly to death. But La Motta is still able to feel victorious, in a smug, insane sort of way as he staggers away, barely able to talk, grins at Robinson and says ""You never knocked me down, Ray."" This scene, for me, sums up the film. You see the best of the directing, editing, acting and special effects, combined with direct insight into La Motta's character. It is truly unforgettable. (This is another editing masterpiece by Thelma Schoonmaker, who also did Goodfellas and most of Scorsese's important work).Is this Scorsese's best film? IMHO, no, it ranks just behind Goodfellas. But it is still a great film - one of the best ever made.  This is an honest, raw and violent film, not for the faint of heart or seekers of fluffy endings. **** out of ****.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The greatest movie I have ever seen.,"First of all this movie is not about boxing. It is about a fighter. Someone who has no good qualities what so ever. He fights constantly with the people around him and also uses his anger in the ring. The women he meets is the only thing in his life that brings him happiness ( notice in the montage sequence with the music playing the shots through the home video recorder of his family and wife are the only scenes in color which are disturbed with pictures of his fights in black in white witch represent his character clashing with family). Also, the film is about how the choices you make as a young person can drastically effect the rest of your life. Robert De Niro's performance is the most painfully realistc piece of acting I have ever seen. Martin Sorsesse's directing is also the finest in the history of cinema. Also, Thelma Schoobaker's film editing is the most meticulouse and brilliant ever. Joe Pesci, for the first time gives a fully rounded performance as Jake La Matta's younger brother. This film has a lot of heart and has more about life in it than any other. Jake La Matta is a terrible person who, by the end of his destructive life, when he is a fat bum working as a stande up comedian in skanky lounges, then and only then does he understand what it means to be human, of course by then he is a lonley sad man.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A talented yet emotionally self-destructive boxer's life outside of the ring is destroying any chance that he has to be truly successful.,"Right from the start, he's fighting. Fighting in the ring, fighting with the judges, and most of all, fighting with himself. After the first match that we see him in, we see that Jake La Motta is just as much of a fighter with his gloves off as he is with them on, possibly even more so. His home life is very troublesome; with a marriage where every interaction results in an argument, and a brother/manager who only patronizes him even more, being a great boxer is not what he thought. With every winning decision, his life out from under the stadium lights becomes worse. He meets an 18-year-old girl, and her personality is, shall we say, flirtatious in a bad way. It doesn't take long for his jealousy and covetousness of his young wife soon becomes a major distraction, and as the middleweight title gets closer, so does his demise. Considered by most as one of the best sports movies of all time (alongside Field of Dreams, Rudy, Remember the Titans, and Hoosiers), Raging Bull is a great film not only about boxing, but also about a man who is a boxer. One major difference between this film and fellow boxing classic Rocky is that the movie shows more about life outside of the ropes than it does inside. With the total screen-time of actual bouts at roughly 15 minutes, the sport is simply the background to the story of La Motta. What this movie truly is about is a man who is unstable in his everyday life, and he struggles to keep himself from ruining his own career. In this film, Robert De Niro delivers one of the best performances not only of his career, but also possibly of all time. Famously gaining 60 lbs. to play the last part of this character's story, De Niro's performance as the real-life boxer La Motta brought the very intense story to the big- screen. As one of his two Oscar-winning performances, De Niro turned in everything he had, and came home with the deserved recognition. In addition to the Best Actor, Raging Bull also was nominated for Picture, Sound, Supporting Actor for Pesci, Supporting Actress for Moriarty, Director, Sound, Cinematography, and Film Editing, winning the last one. I personally thought that the sound, cinematography, and directing were definitely worthy of their Academy recognition. This film came 4 years after director Martin Scorsese's successful film Taxi Driver, which also featured De Niro. Like Taxi Driver, this film also incorporates the social ineptness of a man, and how this difficulty has an effect on the people around him. At some point between after 1976, Martin Scorsese had become severely addicted to cocaine, and an excessive dosage one day left him in a hospital room. While visiting his great friend, Robert De Niro brought up the idea of making a film based on a book that he had recently read about an old boxer. Though at first hesitant, Scorsese delved into the story of La Motta, and he made this classic as a result. Now I must remind you, this is a rated R movie, and it is deservedly so. As one may expect, the boxing sequences are pretty brutal, with blood and pain visibly flowing throughout. Outside of the ring, both Jake and Joey La Motta engage in many heated arguments, and the language within these scenes is R-worthy in itself. Though nothing is shown, Jake's wife Vicki is very ""friendly"" with people, and we hear about it in pretty specific detail. With these warnings listed, I still fully promote this film. This is truly a classic film, and if you are able to endure the violence and language, Raging Bull is a must-see for anyone interested in cinematic history. This is definitely a film that requires one's attention. It is not a movie that necessarily keeps the viewer on the edge of his/her seat, and it is more about the story. The pacing is slow at times, and it can lull for a small amount of time. I definitely loved this film, and I wholly recommend this film.www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Intense Rage ....,"Scorsese has a talent for making movies depicting ""blue-collar"" rage - and this is one of those movies. It's a very good movie, but I'm not sure what I got out of it.Basically, the movie is about the tumultuous emotional life of 1940s middle-weight boxer Jake LaMotta. The movie roughly covers the last 10 years of his boxing career to his early retirement years.Though it is based on a famous boxer, it is not really a boxing movie. This movie is about the internal fury burning within the boxer and how it affected his immediate family members.The performances are outstanding: De Niro (LaMotta) and Pesci (his brother) played their roles with visible intensity. Moriarty, (his wife) also did a great job, though her role was a little more one-dimensional.I'm not sure what I got out of this movie after watching it. Yes, it's intense and well-acted and the plot is engaging - but I don't feel I would have missed anything by not seeing it. Maybe one had to see it when it came out in 1980.In any case, if your a fan of Scorsese or any of the actors, definitely watch this. For everyone else, it's got all the right elements of a good movie, but not as much to think about or marvel at as in other Scorsese films.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

I finally got to see this one.,"Jake La Motta, his violent temper wins him matches in the ring, but destroys his life outside of it. The film chronicles his life from rise to fame, to the destruction of it all.Martin Scorsese is my favourite director, so some of my friends considered it a sin for me to have not seen this one until now. Some people here would even say the same thing. The film is highly regarded as one of the best films of the 80's, some people will even go further and say one of the best films of all time. I, not so much.Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I did not love Raging Bull. In fact, I was completely indifferent to it for the entire first half. The film finally managed to grab my interest for the latter part of his career/life. To me, the most interesting parts were after his boxing career, when he was a fat rude jerk.I can't fault Scorsese, because the film is expertly crafted from start to finish. The clever choice to shoot it in Black and White was a right one and the dedication that DeNiro put into the character is amazing. What Deniro did with the character and this role actors can only dream of today. Only one person I can think of today goes to the extreme lengths that DeNiro did for this role and that's Christian Bale.DeNiro really does shine in the film, while Pesci plays his usual self, this time a little less psycho. He's calm cool and collected and it's nice to see these two together in something fresh and new (for me anyway). Cathy Moriarty is beautiful and puts up with all the crap and physical abuse that is given to her by the abusive and womanizing LaMotta.I wanted to love it, and I think that's where the big trouble lies. The film didn't do much for me, like I said earlier it didn't really grab me until half way through, and by then I was really bored. Maybe the LaMotta story doesn't interest me enough to care. No where near my favourite Scorsese film, or even my Scorsese/DeNiro pairing. It's far from the worst though as well.Let the hate begin.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Well made, but dull","It would be wrong to say this film is rubbish, it certainly isn't, but it's important to remember that a films purpose is to entertain, inform or move you in some way.  Unfortunately this film is devoid of all three.Like a number of films it's technically well made, the acting is fine, but the story and the characters are exceedingly uninteresting.  People say that DeNiro's performance is amazing, well, I don't know how you can say that. His character comes across as selfish paranoid psycho, with absolutely no morals and no redeeming qualities.  Yet we know he has married twice, so there must have be something people liked about him.  Unfortunately the film is too heavy on the negative side, no balance is shown to Jake's character, so the believability and ultimately the interest in the film disappears.In fact this is rather typical of Scorsese, a very overrated Writer/Director.  I liked Taxi Driver and GoodFellas, but most of his films are actually very poor (Casino, Gangs of NY, Cape Fear).Forgettable and uninteresting, yet technically well made film.4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Classic.,"How did this film only win two Oscars? (Deserved ones at that!) It is easily won of the best films in the 80's and with hindsight everyone gives this classic the recognition it deserves. I do not know much about boxing but I can understand from Raging Bull the brutality of life in the ring and how it effects people, like Jake LaMotta in their normal lifestyle. My all time favourite actor, Robert De Niro, masterfully portrays LaMotta as a determined character whose aggression and brutality that he he feels in the sport transcends into his life. In the final monologue he is almost a fallen hero as he wonderfully conveys his life in a passioned soliloquy. Scorsese uses classic film-making techniques, in depth, almost psychological, characterisation and sudden bursts of conflict, retribution and remorse to make the film very human indeed. Ultimately this is character driven drama at its finest and more this helps the film to flow excellently through the contrasts of LaMotta's domestic violence with his professional violence, which as brutal as it is, is not played for hatred but questions morality and on a deeper levels strives to be sympathetic. What also helps the relationship of the characters is the improvising, especially between DeNiro and Pesci. They argue and fight with great conviction and DeNiro especially is very believable (probably due to the amount of time he pent with LaMotta!)Raging Bull is a masterpiece of direction and acting and a great film overall. The violence is very believable and realistic, amazing for a low budget film, and the beautiful black and white cinematography gives it extra, effective depth and a nostalgic sheen. It is a film that has everything and this is shown through the life of a influential if brutal man. Riveting, immaculate and emotional, this is a must see, especially for anyone who enjoys the work of Robert DeNiro and Martin Scorsese.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nothing comes close,"Powerful, emotional, gripping and horrifying. A modern Greek tragedy. Scorsese's adaptation of La Motta's rollercoaster of a life shows a mans capacity to self destruct when he has no control over his anger and selfishness, leading him to lose the people he loves and relies on. La Motta's fights in the ring symbolize the fights he's facing in his own mind everyday. The ring is his judgement and showcases his true feeling, sometimes showing pure ferocity and aggression to his opponent and beating him until he is unrecognizable, and other times being on the ropes being the one taking the beating, but never letting himself go down, showing his stubbornness and disregard for his actions. De Niro's tour de force performance as the troubled man is by far his greatest, and Scorsese's incredible storytelling is at its best here. This is a film that will rock you to your core, and change the way you see consequences in your life and that of others.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Oddly Rousing Chronicle of the 'Bronx-Bull'!,"Unequivocally unsentimental in every respect, Raging Bull offers a searing character study of boxer Jake La Motta (known as the Raging Bull). Despite being the story of a middle-weight boxer, the movie refuses to be pigeonholed as merely a 'boxing' movie. It reigns as poesy of spectacle and presents a disconcerting vision of a beastly character, who dished out savagery in the ring and also at home, yet rose in his day to be idolized to a certain extent by our pop culture.Robert De Niro stars as Jake LaMotta, the Bronx-based boxer whose public bouts and private demons Raging Bull chronicles with bruising acuity, without judgment or sympathy. It delves even deeper into the psyche, exploring the destructive life in whimsical detail. Taking us through the highlight reel of LaMotta's life from the early 1940s through the mid-1960s, the film details how the Bronx bruiser boxed his way to professional stardom then lost everything to debilitating paranoia only to find his life in shambles, eventually descending into self-loathing and loneliness. It is a mesmerizing exploration of the mind of an emotionally disconnected man; as likely to crush those he loved as much as his opposition in the ring. It's impossible to resist following such a talented born loser on his inevitable trip into oblivion, though it's not fun. Watching his downfall from champion to pitiful stand-up comedian and club owner is no more enjoyable than it sounds, yet it is immensely rewarding.One of the triumphs of Martin Scorsese's direction comes from how fascinating Jake remains despite his conspicuous inner rage and crippling sense of sexual insecurity. These inner struggles dovetail with La Motta's performance in the ring, and the film's artful, seemingly improvisatory construction serves to juxtapose these two worlds: the intimate, naturalistic domestic world and the smoky, expressionistic world of the boxing ring. The most obvious basis for the film's claim to greatness lies in Scorsese's devastating critique of the basic codes of masculinity and finally in Robert De Niro's performance, through which that critique is made flesh. De Niro's colossal act (astounding not in the least for his now famous weight gain) firmly holds the film together, virtually hypnotizing the viewer with intensity, pathos, and even innocence. The true power of De Niro's performance rests in his ability to crawl his way into this lug's twisted psyche and air out his personal demons for all to see.It will be impossible to look away from your screens, much like a real boxing match. And for that, Raging Bull remains a profoundly treasured experience: bold and bloody, yet oddly stirring. What eventually pours out on the screen is pure cinema, and pure Scorsese!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scorsese's Masterpiece!,"The best movie of the '80's, director Martin Scorsese pulled off what no one else would have attempted: the unsympathetic story of perhaps the most unsympathetic character in all of American cinema, Jake La Motta.  Starring Robert De Niro, ""Raging Bull"" is not a boxing movie in the vein of ""Rocky"".  There is plenty of boxing in it, some of the best boxing scenes ever put onto celluloid, and the movie does follow his rise as a professional boxer.  However, all of that is a backdrop for Jake's real story, his fall as a human being. The closer Jake gets to his goal of winning the Middleweight Championship, the closer he is to destroying his own life.  And once he achieves his goal, all of the energy and passion that went into fighting in the ring he turns to fighting out of the ring and he does just that, destroys his life.  Shot in beautiful Black & White and co-staring Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty, ""Raging Bull"" is Martin Scorsese's masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Incredible,"Engaging, beautifully crafted biography of middle weight boxer Jake LaMotta. The cinematography employs monochrome instead of colour, a great idea because it perfectly mirrors LaMotta's dark persona. LaMotta is depicted here as a confused and paranoid pugilist, the film chronicles his career all the way to the championship belt. DeNiro is so convincing as LaMotta, that I ask myself sometimes if the personality he assumed for Raging Bull was how he must have once been himself. Another amazing thing DeNiro's sheer determination to accurately portray LaMotta in his post-boxing days by adding on fifty pounds! Let's not forget, he trained hard just to achieve the envious physique of LaMotta IN his boxing days! Joe Pesci is perfectly suited to the role of LaMotta's brother and manager, Joey, a quick talking, foul-mouthed but defensive and loyal sibling (and perhaps the only person that is allowed to critcise Jake and get away with it). Cathy Moriarty excels as Vicki LaMotta, Jake's supportive, strong and tolerant wife.The movie is a classic example of near flawless film-making. Not only is the acting first rate, but the script, cinematography, direction and editing is also of the highest calibre. The screenplay is based on LaMotta's autobiography and of course that gives the dialogue a realistic and true to life feel. Elegant black and white enhances the already brilliant cinematography throughout the film, characterised by picturesque, static camera shots, sharply juxtaposed with the vibrant and kinetic camera work of the fight scenes. The quick, crisp editing to the boxing matches help accentuate the hectic, haphazard ambience of a real duel. Scorsese expertly creates some very tense moments throughout the film, such as the 'You're telling me all these answers Joey, but none of them are the right answer' bit and his use of slow motion at certain moments help convey LaMotta's interpretation of events, such as Vicki giving a normal, everyday goodbye kiss to a departing visitor, a sight that makes Jake immediately think that Vicki may be seeing that person behind his back.Raging Bull's greatest virtue of all is that it is never boring. Even when watching it again, you'll not come across one boring scene. But than again this only came about because of the sheer talent and skill invested in the acting, direction etc. There are very few films that are first class in all aspects of production. Raging Bull is one of these.",,Anonymous,Biography
Beautifully done. The rise and fall of a destructive human champ.,"""Raging Bull"" clearly ranks as one of the better films of all-time due to it's compelling story of the rise but yet human tragedy downfall at the end. At it's time when done in 1980 the cinematography was fabulous the film's black and white take was a neat and nice concept. Plus the master Martin Scorsese does a fine job with the directing as his theme of character study and development into downfall is perfectly done. Robert DeNiro gives a tough and fired up performance as former real life and ex boxer middleweight Jake LaMotta, the film showcases Jake's life and career from the early 1940's till his washed up downfall as a low rent club owning stand up comedian in the early 1960's. The scenes are memorable not just the boxing ones but, the scenes of rage and blow ups from the LaMotta character and the viewer can see just how the impact and scandal of the mob impacted boxing in the early days. Joe Pesci gives a strong performance as LaMotta's brother Joey he always gives encouragement and advice in an aggressive and upbeat manner, really one of the better supporting roles I've seen done in film nice work Mr. Pesci. This film really is a great character study of rage, anger, and obsession just wanting to make your dream happen, but it proves many times that a downfall in the end happens it can be sad and tragic. Overall good work from all involved especially Scorsese and DeNiro with a great supporting turn from Pesci.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A psychological drama with strong punches.,"Intense shots of a sublime technical aspect manage to captivate with more than enough the feeling and the psychological context of this fantastic drama that with strong blows to the liver shows us the crude life of a boxer from its beginnings to its end.Raging Bull is another of Scorsese's great works, one that, obviously, does not lack the technical and masterful genius of his shots. Beautiful, sincere and direct, the quality of the angles allow to appreciate with great intrigue the psychology of the protagonist. By showing the film in black and white, it manages to capture a different, dark and raw atmosphere through the presentation of a violent and paranoid story.With the fantastic performances should not say much, each actor manages to deliver their lines and emotions with a unique touch, showing human and defective in front of the cameras. The film can be considered a magnificent work of psychological study, where the main quality is found in the character and the perspective we have of him. Although it has a somewhat slow progress, with scenes that feel longer than they should be, probably because it is a biographical film, this does not present a direct objective, a goal or motivation, which makes the structure of the film feel slightly like a documentary.Raging Bull is a strong Drama, which is introduced to us with very interesting personalities that let us analyze them with a great passion. That's the reason why I considered it a high quality psychological drama.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I like the movie, but don't love the movie.","I agree that the boxing scenes are wildly over the top exciting. I think the recreation of time from the 40s to the 60s are precise and so are the camera angles. I do not think the story is as good. Some of the pacing drags when Jake LaMotta is with his lover. The scene when they were playing golf was boring and some of the last act when he no longer boxes and has moments with his family were boring. It doesn't really have an ending either. The strongest parts were the boxing scenes, but the other parts were uneven. I do like most of it. I also like many of the scenes with Jake and Joey his brother.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A magesterial film,"A truly magesterial film, only underlining the fact that Scorsese is truly the greatest director in cinema at present, and that De Niro is the greatest actor of his generation. An outstanding performance by him as the fighter Jake LaMotta gained him a deserved Oscar and lord only knows why the film itself did not clear up at the Academy Awards that year.It's hard to imagine a film about boxing could be so beautiful, but from the opening sequence and the splendid music that accompanies it, you know the film is something special.My favourite film of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Seems somewhat indecisive,"RAGING BULL is less a sports film than a study of physical and psychological violence, privilege, entitlement and abuse.It's interesting to see the work of a matured filmmaker headed for GOODFELLAS while the Sturm und Drang of MEAN STREETS still shines through. At the same time, it feels like Scorsese is a tad lost. He tries to go for something else but doesn't quite know how to get there without the Mafia. In the context of his filmography, Scorsese seems somewhat indecisive.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Grossly overrated film about a horrible man,"I can't understand the huge amount of praise heaped on this film, which isn't even mediocre.It's in black and white, which reduces its impact.At the beginning, he's married - then his wife disappears without explanation and is never mentioned - then he pursues a young girl.The protagonist is a repulsive man whom it's impossible for anyone other than sociopaths to like or admire. The audience is supposed to root for and side with the protagonist in a sports film - you can't do that for this horrible man who beats his wife and family.There are many of Robert De Niro's films which I like a lot - but I hate this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scorsese's best is an undeniably flawless masterpiece,"Extraordinarily compelling masterpiece is the greatest sports film ever made, and certainly one of the greatest films made on the face of this earth. The acting (especially by DeNiro, who won the richly deserved Best Actor Oscar), the cinematography (this was filmed in black and white) the Oscar winning editing, Scorsese's brilliant direction (huge Oscar snub, he clearly directed Raging Bull so much better than Robert Redford directed Ordinary People that year) and the realistic boxing scenes. Not one shot in this film has one error in characterization or period detail. The film was nominated for 8 Oscars- it should have won all- but only won 2 Oscars, Best Actor (Robert De Niro) and best Film Editing (Thelma Schoonmaker)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Masterfully acted and directed, but a tiny bit overrated.","Before I get attacked, let me just explain why I feel RAGING BULL may be a little, tiny, slight bit overrated. We're talking about a film that numerous critics have named the best of the 1980s. Now the 80s were a pretty weak time for film, and RAGING BULL is a beautiful motion picture, but the very best? It's up there with FULL METAL JACKET, MILLER'S CROSSING, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, THE SHINING, FERRIS BUELLER, DAS BOOT, etc, as a great 80s movie, but I've never been convinced that this film lives up to the hype. I dare say that Scorsese's own TAXI DRIVER and GOODFELLAS are even more impressive. But I'm harping too much on reputation and expectation. DeNiro, Pesci, and Moriarity are outstanding, and Scorsese's direction is exhilarating. Furthermore, the cinematography is gorgeous, the music is unforgettable, and the boxing scenes are staged perfectly. Try to go in without expectation, and you'll be impressed.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
In My Top 3,"Like I said, this film is in my top 3 films ever made, along with The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction. I think that it is debatably De Niro's best performance ever (but is he better in taxi driver?), and it was first line up of De Niro, Pesci and Scorsese, one of the best cinematic trios ever. So, enough has been said for me to make even the most cynical people out there believe me that the acting in this is absolutely top quality. The directing is incredible. The stylish black and white makes this stand out among other movies and really gives some strong ground as to when this story was set. The fight scenes are among the best scenes in cinematic history, and the most brutal. Just be warned, this film is not for children. The violence in emotionally intense and the language is foul (yet appropriate and accurate.). Having said that, anyone from fourteen to fifteen should be okay with this.So if you don't believe me that this is one of the best films ever, at least acknowledge that it is easily the best film of the eighties, which is some achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A classic film - phenomenal acting,Film was shot in black and white but it didn't matter while watching the move. The story of a boxer who deals with life based on his own instincts but realises his follies as age catches up with his life. Brilliant direction with display of the scenes sequence in a very good manner. Editing of the movie is sparkling. Acting of Di Nero and Pesci is phenomenal. Di Nero's acting and appearance would take anyone's breath away. Such a dedicated performance. He has given all his best efforts in the most effective way which has given full color to the movie. His acting has made other areas of film excel. If you have not watched this movie don't hesitate to watch it. I am sure you will relish watching the performance of direction and acting by the film stars. A great movie.,,Anonymous,Biography
A Unique look at the destructive nature of jealousy,"Raging bull is film that plays from to its strengths, with a strong lead, and very stylistic choices in shots and more obviously, color palate.The film lies heavily on the award-winning performance of Robert De Niro as he portrays boxer Jake LaMotta, in a role fueled by jealousy primarily focused on sexual inadequacies, he sees in all interactions. However, this sometimes makes the film hard to watch as some instances of this within the film are hard to enjoy due to the very uncomfortable emotions they swell up with in its viewers. Other strengths are the framing of certain shots within the film, evident in some of LaMotta's boxing matches, which insures that no matter how many fights the film shows they never get tiring to watch. The film easily follows it decade spanning tale never missing a beat as to why each character's emotional circumstances.All in all, its solid film, with its only failing occurring in my eyes with the uncomfortable nature of the story. And the sometimes hard to watch scenes of our protagonist perpetually making the wrong decisions due to his character's jealous mind. So, in other words the films greatest strength is at times its greatest weakness.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The film Raging Bull came out in 1980. This film is based on a once,"The film Raging Bull came out in 1980. This film is based on a once poplar book. The film starred; Robert De Niro as the main character Jake La Motta, Cathy Moriarty as Vickie La Motta and Joe Pesci as Joey ( Jakes older brother). This film shows deep relationships that Jake has with his wife, family and himself. Jake La Motta is a boxer whom never seems happy with his life. Jake La Motta is an extremely jealous and controlling person. He could be considered as border line bipolar. Throughout this movie La Motta proves that he cannot have a trusting relationship even with people he loves the most. In the beginning, Jake is married to a woman that he does not get along with. Later, he meets a young woman named Vickie. Jake and Vickie get married, and eventually have three children. Jake wins almost every fight, yet he is left always wanting more. Jakes brother Joey sets up fight with an up and coming boxer that Jakes wife said was good looking. Although La Motta wins this match his life is falling apart. Jakes is paranoid and his life soon starts to spiral out of control. Ultimately he ends up losing what he loves the most, his brother, wife and children. Even though this movie is about boxing, prior knowledge of boxing and the time period is not required to understand the theme. My understanding of the theme is about a man who is consistently struggling with himself to find happiness. Jake La Motta never truly finds happiness in his life. In one scene Jake is talking to his brother Joey about his hands being too small. Jake thought that if his hands were bigger he could fight the heavy weight champ and really be happy. After Jake meets Vicki his second wife, he still is not happy. He is winning left and right but is still missing something in his life. Jake starts to feel like his wife is having feelings for someone else. Jake being the jealous person he is lets this feeling consume him. He accused his brother of having an affair with his wife Vickie. Jake beats Joey up and they do not speak for many years. I believe this film is about trying to find happiness and completing one's life: something Jake La Motta was unable to do.Another film with the same theme as Raging Bull is The Pursuit of Happiness. Although the plots are completely different, the theme of finding happiness in a compromising situation is the same in both films. Two techniques that help communicate the theme are costume/makeup design and movement within the film. Raging Bull has many scenes where makeup is a needed. This film did a good job in making the injuries look real. Without the use of the special costumes and makeup effects the film would not have a dramatic feel. The theme of this movie can be tie in with many situations. Not only is this movie entertaining, it is able to teach a valuable lesson that many can relate too.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Robert De Niro serves up a knockout,"Raging Bull is a magical documentary turned into a film. The film highlights the life of the famous boxer Jake La Motta played by the great Robert De Niro. The movie goes far beyond La Motta's path of greatness in the ring but also into his own personal bouts.The movie is about a prize fighter Jake La Motta's rise to middleweight boxing title. La Motta's epic battles with Sugar Ray Robinson are only part of this award winning film. The movie also encompasses Jake's personal battles with his own jealousy issues revolving around his wife Vickie La Motta played by Cathy Moriaty. Through out Jake's rise and fall, his brother accompanies him and manager Joey La Motta played by Joe Pesci. The brother's relationship becomes strained when Jake's constant struggles of jealousy cause him to battle his own brother. Jake's goes from the top to rock bottom because his own self-destruction gives him his only knockout.Martin Scorsese creates a beautiful black and white film, which will stand the test of time. The lighting used in the film gives an authentic feel to the entire movie. The actors were Academy Award winning, led by Robert De Niro the cast worked masterfully together. De Niro set the bar as an actor in this movie. It is clear that De Niro truly lived as Jake La Motta during this film, not only can you see his perfection in his lines, you also see him work his craft with his own body. De Niro had to fluctuate his weight several times throughout the film just to give the authentic feel of a boxer's life and behind the scene struggles. This movie is more than a boxing film; it is visually stunning with the simplicity of black and white you feel like your ringside.I believe the movie storyline was good but not great, while I was fascinated with the great acting I still found myself being unconnected to the characters. I was continually let down by Jake's character and felt little to no sympathy when he hit rock bottom. Although an autobiography has to stay true to its storyline, it can and should create characters the viewer can relate to. Scorsese does a great job working with what he had; the contrast between black and white along with home movies in color gave a realistic feel to the movie. Aside from my lack of connection with the characters this movie was still a knockout.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

An exciting and beautiful film.,"I went out to Blockbusters last night and decided to check out Raging Bull after hearing a good review from a friend. After seeing it for the second time, I was quite impressed. The first time I watched it, I felt as if it wasn't worth all the hype it's been given and it seemed to have started in an odd way for me, a way I didn't like. I didn't really know what was happening on screen... so much, that I started it over about thirty minutes into the movie in an attempt to catch everything. The whole Vickie at the pool scene really seemed to throw me off for some reason, heh.However, this morning, I woke up and decided to give it another chance. I realized a lot more this time around and really got into the overall style of the film that seemed to be missing the first time around. De Niro was, of course, excellent... but what really seemed to stand out for me was Pesci's performance as Jake La Motta's brother, Joey. He played the role very well, I thought... almost as if he knew the guy. I also felt that Frank Vincent did a fine job as Salvy.Moving on to what it's all about, Raging Bull takes you into the the real story of boxer Jake La Motta and the problems he not only faced in the ring, but outside of it as well. Including some of the greatest boxing sequences I've seen in motion pictures, Scorsese shows once again what a good film is all about. Certainly one of my favorites, I can't wait to pick up the DVD to own for myself.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
That's Entertainment,"One of the reasons that makes this movie great that it includes three big names : Martin Scorsese , Paul Schrader , and Robert De Niro . This triplet did together another great movie which was ( Taxi Driver ) in 1976 . For a start , Martin Scorsese who didn't win the Oscar for this piece of art ( as usual ) did a great job by using special effects like close - ups and slow motion techniques in the boxing ring that made us feel as we're there watching , and sometimes boxing . The use of black and white in shooting the movie gave the film its documentary-like to the 40's.De Niro's role as this mad - destructive - full of pride boxer who could've been something big was truly amazing, and is considered to be one of the greatest roles ever played in the history of cinema , besides Marlon Brando's role in the Godfather and F. Murray Abraham's role in Amadeus .Raging Bull was nominated for 8 Academy Awards and only won for best Actor and best Editing . But the Oscars aren't the things that makes a movie great , it's the way people think of it that does . In this movie , victory becomes loss , and the feelings of anger, sarcasm, sadness, pain and regret combines together to form this unforgettable cinematic experience . Truly , That's entertainment .",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Over-rated ..........and misjudged,"I cant understand why ""movie critics"" and ""movie buffs"" find this so perfect. The movie is made realistically (and very well) outside the boxing ring, but inside the ring ? Oh come on !! The fight scenes are the ""theater of the absurd"". Real boxing is NOTHING like this. Its a science --a craft--not a street fight. This is typical Scorsese....over-cooking the violent scenes once again. Its really quite sad----because the film is pretty good. However, people tend to over rate Robert De Niros performance. I think its because he gallantly gained 60lbs. (27 kg) in weight to play the horrible Jake Lamotta (a guy with LOADS of personality defects) in his post boxing career. Putting that weight on was heroic----but forget that and judge his acting. Its nowhere near the heights he reached in Taxi Driver. (Still his finest hour). Martin Scorsese showed great promise in the 1970s--but he has since been disappointing. (Apart from Goodfellas). Scorsese has never made a 10 / 10 movie. He is a flawed movie director......good.......but certainly not very good , and nowhere near great. Its a great shame really-----""he could have been a contender"" !!",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Extreme nosebleed,"This is the greatest boxing movie ever. All the people I show this to who swore by Rocky, ended up thinking Rocky was a joke. Easily the most brutal fight scenes ever filmed. Three of my favorite actors DeNiro, Pesci, and Vincent hook up for the first time under Scorsese's brilliant directing. Robert DeNiro's weight gain for the late scenes in the film remain as a testament to his acting and performing ability. DeNiro does such an acting job in this that he makes me do something I never thought possible, he makes me hate Robert DeNiro. The ""hit me again"" scene is classic.

Quite ingenious.,"The only thing I would bother calling a flaw is the rather unnecessary shots randomly scattered throughout (the men fighting in the opening fight, the closeup of a teacup handle, etc.) but this can easily be looked past. This is the only time Scorsese has perfectly structured a rise and fall story. It has a beginning, middle and end yet leaves parts to the imagination. It doesn't focus too much on one era (Goodfellas in the rise, Casino in the fall), yet it never feels like it cuts anything short. De Niro is simply dynamic. He covers such a range of emotions and hits everything perfectly. The ""You *bleeped* my wife!"" and the jail scenes are two of the best I've ever witnessed. I should also mention that this is the only time I haven't wanted to stab Joe Pesci in the head. He became too full of himself and type-cast in his later years, but in this he is just perfect. Moriarty is also heartbreaking and seductive. The score is flawless. It has a very elegant and nostalgic feel to it, which Scorsese crafted to a tee. The cinematography is some of the best ever, with the scenes flawlessly shot and put together.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The De niro/Scorsese relationship and the robbery of Scorsese.,"This film heightens the dynamic and strength of the De niro/Scorsese relationship. As both men were on the brink of an emotional abyss like la motta and both De niro/Scorsese put their efforts into the film and in the end result created a masterpiece. With it's amazing screenplay by Schrader, Scorsese's direction and the relationship between De niro and Joe Pesci made for a cinematic masterpiece despite the contempt the audience has for la motta and poor box office sales when released in 1980. This film will be remembered for the scenes between Jake la motta and his brother which let us delve into the mind of a emotionally self destructive man. As for regards acting this film will be remembered for the transformation of De niro, with his belief in method acting and earing the right to play a character, transformed himself to the physicality of a real middle weight boxer enabling him to fight in actual boxing matches. De niro, then adds on 60 pounds to play Jake la motta later in life. Due to the transformations, this earned De niro the best actor award and confirmed him as one of the greatest actors of all time. However this film will be most remembered for the theft from Scorsese as the greatest thief of all time Robert Redford stole the Best Director award off Scorsese in broad daylight for his film ordinary people. Whether this is the greatest De Niro/Scorsese film will be debated for generations to come... so i leave with, which is better Taxi Driver or Raging Bull?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Robert De Niro, Scorcese and Joe Pesci's dedicated efforts went in vain because of wrong choice of story. Yukkk..","RagingBull (1980) :
Brief Review -Robert De Niro, Scorcese and Joe Pesci's dedicated efforts went in vain because of wrong choice of story. Yukk... I mean Raging Bull was such a disgusting script to choose. This sports drama is centralised on the boxer Jake LaMotta who is an Animal. He's careless, he's short tempered, he's womaniser, he's obsessive and his sexual jealousy is always at it's peak. How come he expected his wife to be happy with him? I mean he's spending time with many women outside and then doubting his wife, come on. How the hell his wife even had to endure him for so long? The same applies to his brother who always cared for him actually. This wasn't a right choice of a story at all. One could never expect such a wrong and loser man to be your protagonist. You know he's crazy, he's doing all bad things therefore his fate was sealed long time ago no matter if he's a great boxer. Even in boxing he made several debacles which i couldn't really understand why? Robert De Niro's dedication and transformation for this film is absolutely class. He won the deserving Oscar but the real surprise package was Joe Pesco in his brother's role. Like i said the negative writing and wrong guy's biography never hold my interest for a moment so despite good efforts of technical team i couldn't like the film. Martin Scorsese did a great job as a director but his choice of the story was a complete disaster. There were so many legends in boxing and some other sports too, he could have easily picked up any guy's story who did something good in his life for his country, for his family. The result of initial release of this film tells a lot about how people totally rejected the film, thank god. I don't how some jerks made this film to have a reputation by now cause this film doesn't deserve it at all. I feel like wasting two hours of my life in which i could have watched an inspirational story of a legend rather than this raging animal's story.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Raging Film,"Martin Scorsese is a wonderful director and although he has had the occasional bad film such as Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore or Gangs of New York but has also had many amazing films such as this Ragin Bull which may actually be his best slightly above such masterpieces as Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, and Casino. Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances as Jake La Motta. He is phenomenal and deserved his Best Actor Oscar, although he has been better in both Taxi Driver and The Godfather Part 2. But the best performances are in the supporting categories by Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty, Moriarty in particular is wonderful. She gives one of the best performances in film history and blows everyone else out of the water.

The boxing scenes are wonderfully shot and are possibly the best boxing scenes ever shot. Raging Bull is without a doubt one of the best films ever made. You must see it!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent film-making in every aspect,"I went into this movie, having heard good things about it but not knowing what would entail, thinking I was going to watch a Rocky film with perhaps a little more class. When it ended, I sat through the credits, just thinking, almost scarred by LaMotta's life. It was a journey, pure and simple. There was no climactic ending, but the fist thrusts at the end hurt me, and pretty much summarised the film itself. He just couldn't escape the rage and passion of the ring. I became so attatched to the character, and related to his every characteristic. A ""real life"" character played to the best possible effect by DeNiro. The directing and editing, too, keeps the story moving fluently and with a unique style, some effects in the ring actually reflecting the mood and atmosphere of a real fight perfectly. The Black and whiteness is indeed a brave step taken by, in my opinion, a brave and most worthy director. It emphasises the gritty, dry, and realistic approach to the lives of these brilliantly acted characters. The fight scenes could have been coreographed more realistically, but hey, this is film world. A few characters fade, leaving empty spaces to be filled, but the film moves on swiftly. Some may argue that the film could have been a bit shorter, but every minute worth of plot in there is vital to the overall impression of our main character. Everything collapses in the man's life, and we go from scene to scene feeling loss after loss after such emphatic highs. Great emotional impact helped by wonderfully emotional acting. I can identify with the realism of the character after the recent evidence of Frank Bruno's downfall, leading him into a mental hospital. It's the love of the game and the thrill of the fight that drive these characters out of moral society. Anyway, enough, this film strikes all the right chords, and rightly should be acclaimed as one of the top few films of the 80s for it's originality and character development.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scorsese Greatest,The greatest achievement in a career of great achievements by the great modern director Martin Scorsese.A stark portrait of out of control masculinity.  Gorgeously shot in black and white.  Beautifully written.Robert Deniro gives my all time favorite performance.  He never gives a reason to sympathize with Jake but still brings a measure of grace to him.My #3 film of all time.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
definitely see this one,"Plain and simple, `Raging Bull' is an awesome movie.  Being black and white definitely makes the movie ten times better.  The couple scenes where the movie changes to color flow so smoothly from black and white to color you barely notice it.  There were some cool views in the ring where you look up on Jake and the other fighter's faces.  Also there was a lot of cameras flashing and clicking all the time.  I felt that it was just messy and bloody enough without overdoing it.The movie is a great film about a man's dreams and hopes, and how he is simply a human.  Jake's pride is eventually what drives everyone he cared about away from him.  Definitely watch this one.  De Niro is absolutely awesome and his acting was superb.  If I had more than two thumbs I would give it numerous thumbs up, but since I only have two:  Two thumbs up.",,Anonymous,Biography
The power of jealousy,"This movie shows us the power of jealousy. It shows us how it can ruin our own lives, and the lives of the ones we love. The film delivers on this potent theme through a combination of skillful direction, acting, and cinematography.As far as the writing, I found it to be quite good as well. My only regret was that the character of the boxer's wife was not developed very well.All in all, I highly advise this film to those who enjoy dramas and sports movies and epics. These are not genres I generally enjoy, but if they were, I would give this movie something like 7 or 8 stars rather than 6. I can see plenty of reasons why this would be seen as a classic in the eyes of many, but it's just not my type of film (I prefer sci-fi, action, comedy, thrillers, etc.) for reasons of personal taste. It's definitely worth a watch, though.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Watch and feel the pain.,"Raging Bull is much more than another boxing film. Robert De Niro, starring as Jake La Motta, battles life inside and outside of the ring. His desire to be the middleweight champion and his self-destructive behavior prove to be the perfect storm. While his brother Joey, played by Joe Pesci, and wife Vickie, played by Cathy Moriarty try desperately to keep Jake La Motta on the straight and narrow, he is determined to allow his paranoia and temper ruin his life.The theme of Raging Bull is much more than the story of a fighter but rather the conflicts this boxer battles in and out of the ring. While he is ultimately successful in winning the belt, he loses his wife, children, brother and even his freedom post-retirement in Miami. The same man, who beat Sugar Ray Robinson and many other top boxers, couldn't beat his internal rage. After losing everything and everyone, La Motta ends up alone, in his nightclub, mocked by his own audience.La Motta's temper is revealed with his first wife when she couldn't cook his steak properly. He explodes in violence causing time with the first wife to begin to count down. Brother Joey seems to be hooked up with some gangster types, and Jake reveals his desire to remain independent. He yells at Joey telling him not to bring the mob down near the gym again. The mobsters represented by Tommy Como, played by Nicholas Colasanto, and Salvy,played by Frank Vincent try desperately to bring La Motta into their organization.Joey shows his loyalty to his brother Jake, when Joey observes Tommy spending time with Jake's second wife, Vickie. Joey breaks up a Tommy Como party and beats up Salvy. While Tommy makes Salvy and Joey shake hands and make up, Jake remains an independent man. Finally, La Motta wins the middleweight championship belt. As he ages, he defends the belt successfully until his selfishness, jealousy and temper watch him give up the belt to Sugar Ray.Boxing was good for La Motta who in retirement brags of his beautiful wife, three children and beautiful home in Miami. However, he isn't done yet. His battles outside the ring continue as he opens his nightclub. His drinking,smoking and otherwise poor lifestyle finds him in jail for committing statutory rape with a fourteen year old girl.Director Martin Scorsese has another winner in this 1980 sports biography. Scorsese has partnered with De Niro before in award winning Goodfellows, Taxi Driver and Casino. We see other characters such as Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent add to the award winning casts.Watch and feel the pain as Cinematographer Michael Chapman zooms in on the faces of the boxers as wounds are created and the bodily fluids fly across the ropes and into the crowd. Chapman does a great job of showing conflict in the ring. Then the conflict continues as La Motta slams the door at the end of the skinny, long hallway after yet another fight with his wife.The fights in the ring will keep you on the edge of your seat; however it is the fights outside the ring which will keep you guessing as to the outcome of this great fighter.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Raging Bull (1980) **1/2,"I found this highly worshiped film to be very rough going at first because this real-life story of the very unlikeable boxer Jake La Motta was largely uneventful for a good long hour or more. In that time, La Motta bounces around from one mediocre boxing match to the next. He likes to yell a lot. Years zip by without meaning. He worries about getting fat. He meets Cathy Moriarty. I kept asking myself what was supposed to be so ""terrific"" about this picture, and why wasn't anything interesting occurring? But I finally (and I do mean ""finally"") began to become somewhat sucked in somewhere around the 75-90 minute mark, and then what I witnessed was good, solid drama. Robert De Niro was exceptional and Joe Pesci was well cast as his brother. Some good acting and a real feel for the era of the '40s and '50s. Not a ""great film"" in my estimation by any means, and quite overrated when considered by the majority to be such ... but a ""pretty good"" one by the time the last bell was rung. **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Boring....Over-rated!!,"I fail to understand why so many people consider this to be such a good movie.  I was bored stiff with it from the very start.  Martin Scorsese should send me a check to cover the time I wasted watching it (okay, he can deduct about 15 minutes because I fell asleep toward the end, just couldn't stay awake).  A more accurate name for it would be ""Raging Bull-S***""I am not really sure what Scorsese was trying to say with this picture, but if he wanted me to feel that Jake La Motta was an interesting or worthwhile human being, he failed dismally.  About all I got was that La Motta was a complete waste of oxygen.  If that was his point, okay, but I think I could have conveyed that in about 15 min and then gone on with my life.The truly sad part about this movie is how much talent (DeNiro, Pesci, and Scorsese himself) was wasted to create it.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Masterpiece,"One of the greatest films ever produced. A masterpiece. This movie assured Scorsese the status of being one of the single most important American artists in the history of cinema. This film is heavily influenced by the French Nouvelle Vague. Some cuts and shots are lifted from Truffaut's 'Jules et Jim' and Godard's 'A Bout de Souffle'. But Scorsese's own highly authentic voice assures the audience of a very unique viewing experience. It's almost unmeasurable how many filmmakers were directly influence by this film and his other work. I remember meeting Scorsese in Knokke-Le-Zoute in '68 when he won the Festival Award for his short 'The Big Shave'. He said half-jokingly that his filmwork would only ever be fully appreciated in Europe because he is so inspired by the European directors of the fifties and the sixties and shares their sensibilities. Unfortunately this predicament has been true. Martin Scorsese has been denied an Oscar his entire career but has won, since Knokke-Le-Zoute, every major award in Europe. The Academy should better hurry up and make up for their mistake! Give Marty that statue. And then give him another one! He's the best you've got!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful Stuff,"When looking at the real Jake La Motta and watching De Niro portray him in the movie it's hard to believe that he is the real person.   On the DVD I was shocked to even see that La Motta was still alive but he came across as a very humorous person that enjoyed life.   I know he is a comedian and his job is to be humorous but he didn't seem like the La Motta we know in Raging Bull.  It was funny also when the documentary starts because its cuts to him and he says `When I came out of the theatre after seeing Raging Bull I felt depressed and I asked my Ex wife Vicky was I really like that, and she said no you were worse'.  To think that he couldn't get any worse than he was in the movie.   Raging Bull told the story not like the rise and fall of Jake La Motta but more the fall and fall of him.  Of course winning his heavy weight title was great but Scorsese looks more at his relationships with the people that love him like his brother Joey played Joe Pesci and his wife Vicky played by Cathy Moriaty.The physical abuse which is given out in this film is more than you're usual take and it tells it so well.  It's nothing like Rocky or any other boxing Biopic as it shows the human side to a boxer not the just the fighting side. It dwells in well with it's plots and has the greatest fighting scenes ever devised on film and without it being to bloody either as Scorsese shot it very artistically.This is the movie that Scorsese deserved to win Best Director out of all his nominations and it is also the most powerful film I have ever seen.",,Anonymous,Biography
Another one of Scorsese's finest,"What can I say about Raging Bull that hasn't been said already? I can safely say that Raging Bull is one of Scorsese's best. It is very hard-hitting and perhaps not for all, but it is for me one of the best sports films out there. The photography is gorgeous and so skillful yet claustrophobic and the score adds to the atmosphere. Once again, Scorsese's direction is superb, while the writing is top-drawer, the pace is spot on and the storytelling is ceaselessly compelling with brutal yet spectacular fight sequences. The acting is perfect from all, Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriaty are very, very good. But Robert DeNiro is just mesmerising as Jake, really he is. Overall, just wonderful and one of the best from a great director and actor. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Poetic Masterpiece for the Ages,"Martin Scorsese' ""Raging Bull"" stands as one of the greatest films of all time. Its the greatest work of Martin Scorsese' career and Robert De Niro's greatest acting performance. This film stands atop my all time list. Robert De Niro's performance is also the best and most authentic acting performance I have ever seen. What a transformation it is to watch him become middleweight boxer Jake La Matta in this true story of more than just boxing. It's a film of one mans decent into misery and loss. The film will stand the test of time because it's realness and its captivating look is purely mesmerizing, astonishing, and jaw dropping.Right from the start we are punched in the face as Jake La Matta is eating dinner. The ordinary dinner scene turns into a husband and wife fight like nothing you have ever seen. All over an over cooked stake that isn't ready for eating. Right from the start we see that Jake La Matta is a tormented and troubled man with serious issues ranging from paranoia to insanity to inadequacy to emotional instability to reckless abandon to raging anger. La Matta is a complex character that is brought to us in a riveting performance from one of films all time greats. Throughout the film we see La Matta battle his inner demons as he's always in a 12 round bout with himself. His emotional pain is relentless and his physical pain pails in comparison. He's always trying to prove himself, not to anyone around him, but his own demons and inner pains. His brother Joey (Joe Pesci) tries to manage Jake to a title shot, but that is nearly impossible thanks to Jake's relentless and constant problems that he causes. In a highly memorable ""Hit Me"" scene following the dinner fight; Joey is ordered, then demanded, to punch his brother in the face by Jake himself. Joey after some talking into, starts beating on Jakes face until his cuts- from his previous fight- start to bleed and crack open. What is the purpose Joey asks. Jake responds with a smile and a playful pinch on the cheek. Right from the start we see that Jake has no purpose. All he has is pain. It would hurt too much to stop it so he takes it.As Jake climbs up the boxing ranks his tormented life and his inner demons start to take a toll on not only him but everyone around him. His life style mirrors his fighting style. Jake La Matta' fighting style is just like his personality. There's no technique or any strategy given to him by his corner. He uses outside forces to take out his opponent inside the ring and the inside forces take out the people outside the ring that he loves. He is relationship impaired and knows of no way to deal with women(or with anybody for that matter).Some of Scorsese' greatest moments come during the boxing scenes. We hear the cringing cat cries and exploding light bulbs and we feel the brutality even though we may not even understand what we're hearing. In a fight with the ""good-looking"" Janrio, Jake is a large imposing animal taking out all his frustrations on the face of Janrio. He makes him ugly and pierces a hole right through his wife (Cathy Moriarty) who called Janiro ""good-looking."" Then as his career starts to unfold due to his misery and paranoia. He looses the belt, then he looses himself.After Jake retires from boxing a weight has been lifted off his shoulders- but physically a weight has been added. Now he doesn't have any responsibilities and he no longer has to worry about his weight, which fluctuates in the film and by films end; De Niro gains 60 pounds. Without any worries or responsibilities, La Matta is still incapable of being happy. He looses everything that he has ever fought for and in a brutally emotional scene at the end of the film where La Matta finds himself in jail; we actually sympathize for his character. We wish he did right, but he never does. Something appeals to us, maybe we see some good in him even though it never shows through. Maybe we want some good in him because it never shows through. Maybe we see how troubled he is and we just want to see some happiness in his life. The dark scene is shot in perfection and Jake takes his past regrets out on his jail cell's cement wall. Jake lets out a fury of punches and head butts, but not even this bull has a punchers chance in hell. After his cries of ""Why! Why! Why!"" go unanswered. All he has is his 10X10 Miami jail cell to sit and stew in. Completely in the dark, Scorsese' final touches bring us into the cell as Jake breaks down emotionally. We see no remorse as he doesn't see himself as the bad guy that everyone says he is. He believes he's just a troubled man not wanting to hurt anyone. The worst part of it all is: He doesn't think he has hurt anyone; when all we see is that's all he's ever done- is hurt the ones he loves. There are no apologies. He has no acknowledgment of anything he's ever done being wrong, which is truly heartbreaking, because it looks as though he will never change. A brutally honest portrait of an animal.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Fighting demons, not boxers","I don't know what took me so long to see this movie, but I jumped at the chance last night. I know it was nominated for a slew of awards, but that is not why I tuned in.It was Joe Pesci's fourth film and he really shows the tough guy that he was to later develop in movies like Goodfellas and casino. His performance in trying to control his out of control brother was amazing.Now, of course, Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta was also impressive. To see someone with so little self esteem that he was beset by constant doubt is sad. he was an amazing fighter, but never happy as he dealt with his demons.Antone wanting to see outstanding acting directing technical work in a great story needs to see this film.

Not as grand as they say,"Well Raging bull is a movie that drags and after a while picks up and then drags on till it ends, this movie to me does not leave up to the classic rating it gets.It tells the story of Jake LaMotta an Italian American Boxer; it is based on his (LaMotta) book Raging Bull: My Story. Robert De Niro portrays LaMotta a sadistic and jealous individual.De Niro came across the story during the shooting of God father II, he showed it to Scorsese hoping he would make the movie, but Scorsese turned it down and after nearly dying from a drug overdose, Scorsese agreed to make the film for De Niro's sake, not only to save his own life but also to save what remained of his career.After the script was made, both Scorsese and De Niro spent two and a half weeks on the island of Saint Martin, extensively re-building the content of the film changing what needed to be changed and adding what was missing.The film was then made with a plot that shows how LaMotta rose to the top with the aid of his manager, and then due to his anger issues and jealous rage threw it all away and fell back to point zero.The photography was nice; shooting in black and white didn't stop the movie from passing across its message. The movie helped launched Joe Pesci's career as the acting in the movie by all that were involved is an A+.Locations used in the movie, well the set that was used will make you think you were in the 50s, as the set were well designed. Cinematography in the ring during the fights is something I did enjoy, as the camera got all angles and the blood flying too was well worked into it.The other sad thing about this movie other than the length is the fight choreography, you can see at times that the punches were not landing and they were faked.This is one of the eight movies that De Niro and Scorsese made together and not one of their best as Goodfellas still remain their best.Not to put a damper on the mood here, but to me Raging Bull is a nice watch once and that is that.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
career zenith for De Niro & Scorsese,"Jake LaMotta is a middleweight boxing pro. Inside the ring he's an unbridled sociopath. Outside it, he's a very, very typical and unremarkable product of his age. He's an emotionally weak, testosterone-crazed loud-mouthed roughneck, as conservative and bourgeois as they come. He's terribly paranoid about people, and has a knack for alienating his friends and peers. He's also intensely chauvinistic, seeing women as no more than f**k toys and domestic chattels. His extreme paranoia about other people's motives, his basic unsociability, his lack of self-awareness coupled with his intense jealousy for his beautiful wife inevitably destroy him. At the end, he is thrown onto the garbage heap of civilization.People say that Raging Bull is the ""we'll make our point so obvious that there's no way you can miss it"" type of film. In a way this is true, because there is no ambiguity about it. It is equally true that the director is so aware of his intentions, so clear about the material he is handling, and at the same time has so much command over his craft that his film succeeds in communicating with almost anyone who watches it. Raging Bull is Scorsese and De Niro at their peaks, individually as well as in collaboration.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Brutal, honest, a mesmerizing film","Raging Bull is a film that is not easy to watch.  It is brutal, it is honest and it is a completely mesmerizing film.  The boxing scenes alone are enough to make you cringe.  The sights and sounds that Scorsese employs to bring you to the feral level of boxers is amazing.  Sound of wild animals bring you into the brutality of the sport.  The sequence in which Jake beats his opponent so hard that the poor fool just collapses is amazing.  The crowning achievement is the final fight of Jake's career.  When Sugar Ray Robinson raises his arm, Scorsese lets everything fly.  We see Jake stagger against the ropes, we see the blood, we hear the punches, and we see the horror wash across Viki LaMotta's face.  But that's all the boxing scenes, what is at the heart of the film is Jake's relationship with his brother Joey, and Jake's insecurities in life.  He is not the most sympathetic person.  He is violent, suspicious and stubborn.  Through DeNiro's amazing performance we see LaMotta as a complex and tragic figure.  The scene in the Florida jail cell toward the end of the film is powerful.  Jake starts pounding the wall and shouts ""Why?""  In that one scene we see a man finally coming to grips with his life, and his demons.",,Anonymous,Biography
I've Heard Things..I've Heard Things...,"""Raging Bull"" is routinely named one of the greatest films of all time. ""Scorsese was robbed! This is his best film! This should've been Best Picture of 1980!"" are the typical battle cries. Watching the film now, it emerges as one of those films I respect wholeheartedly as a Scorsese fan, and more importantly, as a film buff. It's not on my favorite films of all time list, and as far as Scorsese goes, I enjoyed ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Departed"" far more. Still, it is an uncompromising example of film as art.First, we have the usually bombastic Scorsese, beautifully subdued here from the classical music to the graceful camera movements to the haunting black and white photography. Second, we have Robert DeNiro as boxer Jake LaMotta giving the performance of his career that rightfully won him the Oscar. Thirdly we have all that we come to expect from a Scorsese film: iconic shots (like the pan to the blood dripping from the ropes), quotable dialog (""I've heard things. I've heard things""), and his rich archetypes (DeNiro and Pesci in their love/hate relationship as brothers, and a raspy and sassy Cathy Moriarity in the objectified wife-as-whore role). The fight scenes are the most artistically satisfying of any boxing film that has come before or since.Finally, it contains something only in which a rabid movie buff can find joy. It contains the link between two of my favorite directors: Martin Scorsese and David Lynch. As Joe Pesci watches one of the fights on TV, Pabst Blue Ribbon appears as the corporate sponsor. Later, in a scene where DeNiro is being interviewed at his Florida home, a Tony Bennet version of ""Blue Velvet"" can be heard playing in the background. The movie gods shined down on us six years later when David Lynch made his classic thriller ""Blue Velvet,"" which, in no small coincidence, featured prominently, Pabst Blue Ribbon as the favorite drink of Dennis Hopper's psychotic Frank Booth.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Your mother's an animal ya son of a b*tch!""","Everyone loves holds dear the classic era of cinema; the heyday of the Western, the innocence of the screwball comedy and the mystique of film noir. While these genres have lived on in contemporary movies, the 1960s were the arrival of films with a profound boldness. Discretion was tossed to the wind and subtly was thrown to the wind. This advent of risqué film making was the beginning of a new era, marked predominately by unrestricted sexuality and violence. This has continued on to this day, but certain periods were peaks in these categories. On one end of the stick is a cult horror film like The Evil Dead (Sam Raimi, 1981), which is infamous for its over-the-top gore. Other films, such as Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull (1980) struck viewers with heart pounding realistic violence. Its approach to on-screen violence, acting and cinematography all come together to make the definition of a gritty film making.The film of old used specific techniques to cement their themes and emotions, and while these varied the mood in specific genres was ever consistent. Pre-sixties horror was that of Them! (Gordon Douglas, 1954), but at the sunset of the fifties, films such as Psycho (Alfred Hitchcock, 1960) began to bend the rules. Of course, the production code which had regulated just what films could show had been done away with. This was the genesis of the new wave era.Robert De Niro plays the role of the titular character, boxing legend Jake La Motta excellently, but he took method acting to an unprecedented level. De Niro underwent vigorous physical training, much of it with Jake La Motta himself, but that was only the first course. Not just physical strain put on him; he also gained a whole sixty pounds for the post-boxing years portion of the film. Impersonation acting grew vastly from the New Wave era, where actors are not held by contract to play niche roles. It allows true versatility to take hold.The mise en scene of the film is quite ironic. Film noir was the beginning of Hollywood exposing the darker nature of what went on behind the closed doors of even the most serene family. This film itself is a period piece, and the home of La Motta is very similar to the ideal 40s and 50s suburbs. There is even a cross overlooking the couple's mattress. Despite this, the violence of the character's nature stains into every facet of his life. In that bedroom, with the religious symbol watching it all, the man deals harsh blows to his wife (played by Cathy Moriarty-Gentile). The scene is only one of many that can be hard to watch for squeamish viewers, many critics themselves initially were polarized by the amount of brutality in the film.The cinematography by Michael Chapman, and without a doubt the editing of Thelma Schnoonmaker is also a real highlight of the film. Note the fight between La Motta and Marcel Cerdan. There is rapid cross-cutting in a series of short takes to give the action a very intense feel. A Dutch angle is used to create distortion as our character takes a brief interlude before re-entering the fray. The whole scene illustrates the chaos of a single fight.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Extremely Moving Film About Much More Than Boxing,"2 hours of husband-wife-brother drama with a little boxing sprinkled in isn't my type of movie, but the emotional impact left on audiences is undeniable.Raging Bull isn't actually about boxing, but watching Jake LaMotta in the ring belongs in the same tier as Rocky, Creed, Ali, and The Fighter. The movie is about Jake's family life with his short temper. I don't even know how to explain the mood you get while watching Raging Bull. The music perfectly amplified the scenes to the desired effect and the lack of color took it to another level. As I stated earlier, drama isn't my thing.

Misunderstood masterpiece.,"Martin Scorsese is on record as saying that he has not yet made a truly great film, something up to the standard of The Searchers, Citizen Kane, Eight and a Half, The Leopard, or The Red Shoes. Perhaps he's right. However, he can boast of at least one film that comes awfully close to that olympian standard, Raging Bull. When Scorsese made Raging Bull, he was seriously thinking of it as a terminal work. He was going to end his career in Hollywood, move to Italy, and make documentaries about the lives of the saints. For better or worse,He chose not to. Still, retirement WAS seriously on his mind, and because of that, Scorsese poured all his thoughts, all his feelings, all of his knowledge of cinema into this, one of the most troubling- and unforgettable films- ever made. I believe that I have seen Raging Bull nearly a dozen times, and I see new meanings and surprising nuances in it every time. Here I can offer only a few comments, both of which are paradoxical. The first is that Raging Bull is a very violent film about love; the second is that it succeeds in portraying Jake Lamotta because it is just as much about Marty Scorsese as it is about Jake LaMotta. There are  five love stories in Raging Bull. The first is the story of Joey Lamottas love for his dull-witted, stubborn, hot-tempered , 'crazy ' brother. The second is Vicky Lamottas equally passionate love for her brutish, insanely jealous husband.The third is the story of Jakes love of himself, which begins as a brutish, jealous, self-loathing, profoundly selfish love, and slowly and in a halting, confused way, becomes a very different self appraisal, the recognition that he is not an ANIMAL, but a man. The Fourth love is that of Marty Scorsese himself, both for the film medium  and for the characters in his best films. The fifth may sound crazy, but I think it is present throughout the film. It is the love of God.It would take a lot more space than I have here, but  I would assert that Raging Bull DOES NOT portray a world in which God is absent; God even loves someone as brutish, as short-sighted, as vulgar and as morally obtuse as Jake. Indeed , Scorsese has even claimed that Jake comes close to God without realizing it. My second claim is that Raging Bull is autobiographical. But, in a sense, almost all of Scorsese's films are, whether directly or indirectly. For me , Raging Bull is autobiographical in that Marty is, to a large extent, reflecting himself in Jake. Scorsese, the ""gangster-priest' is confessing his sins and exorcising his demons. In this way, he is inviting all of his viewers to undertake a similar act of self examination, confession, and exorcism. This is one ( but not the only one) of the reasons that Raging Bull ends with a quote from Johns Gospel and a dedication to Haig Manoogian, who taught Marty how to look into himself and see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great take on totality for a character,"The movie is strong on its vivid screenplay and the acting by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. The screenplay is so vivid on the depiction of Jake LaMotta's behavior. The story goes on quite slow in my opinion and it looked like it didn't put enough time for the boxing scenes. the fights on the boxing scenes seemed to unrealistic for me. The sound effects sounded like something from a sixties movie. But it's quite good to include the famous element of Italian American culture of ties to the mafia. De Niro's acting is just truly superb. His facial expressions are nicely fitting just as what he did in ""The King of Comedy"" for comparison. He went total for this by gaining weight to make his suitable look for the older version of LaMotta.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another reason why you should love De Niro and Scorsese,"""The thing ain't the ring, it's the play. So give me a... stage where this bull here can rage and though I could fight I'd much rather recite... that's entertainment.""In 1976 Martin Scorsese teamed up with Robert De Niro and screenwriter Paul Schrader to deliver what in my opinion is one of his best films: Taxi Driver. That year that complex character study lost out on the Oscar to Stallone's Rocky. So what does Scorsese do next? He directs a real boxing movie with another memorable and complex character played by Robert De Niro making Rocky look like a cartoon character. Don't get me wrong, I loved Rocky, but Jake La Motta is a character that feels much more authentic. He's deeply flawed and unpleasant to be around with, but his violent temper is what made him such a successful boxer on the ring. It was actually Robert De Niro who approached Scorsese to make this film based on Jake La Motta's autobiographical book and despite hesitating to make a sports movie at first, he ended up directing what is considered by many to be the best boxing film of all time. The boxing scenes are violent and bloody, but what was most surprising for me was the way in which De Niro captured the rage and paranoia of his character off the ring. La Motta isn't a very sympathetic character and his anger and jealous outbursts led him to his ultimate downfall, but somehow there is still something redeeming about him and De Niro captured that essence perfectly in this Award winning performance. It's much more a character study than a boxing film, but Scorsese also explores Jake La Motta's bond with his brother Joey turning this into a sibling relationship study as well. Jake tries to channel his rage through boxing, but ultimately it defeats him outside of the ring destroying the relationships he has formed. Near the end there is a nice nod to Brando's On the Waterfront, which was a perfect touch by Scorsese who seems to always be in control of his craft and at the same time honoring other famous films. Raging Bull is an artistic film dealing with a difficult subject matter but it still is considered by many as the best film from the 80's. It's a near masterpiece in my opinion with another outstanding lead performance by De Niro, who was without a doubt the best actor at that time.Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) is the raging bull who during the 40's dominated every rival inside the ring. No one could take hits like he did and despite losing a couple fights he took pride in the fact that he never went down. Jake's brother, Joey (Joe Pesci) is his sparring partner and at the same time he manages his fights so they have a very close relationship. Joey has a few connections with the mob, but Jake refuses to deal with them and wants to get a chance at the title on his own. Joey also introduces him to a fifteen year old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty), whom he later marries. As the years go by, Jake defeats his opponents but the title shot keeps eluding him since he refuses to work with the mob despite Joey's connection with Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). While Jake's professional boxing career begins to take off, his personal life takes a blow when he allows his jealousy and paranoia to take over as he fears his wife is seeing other men. Despite channeling his rage in the ring, he also takes it out in his home on his wife and brother. What at first served as his inspiration for becoming a boxing champion escalated so much that it also became his downfall and ruin. Raging Bull centers on Jake's self destructive boxing journey and it is a very complex and emotional one. In the midst of it all there is still a redemptive quality to this antihero and he accepts his punishment through personal beatings in the ring.I don't know if Scorsese would be around making movies today if it weren't for Raging Bull. Just like his lead character Jake, Scorsese was dealing with some personal demons of his own struggling with drug addiction. De Niro convinced him to make this film and somehow he channeled his addictions through his direction. Jake unsuccessfully channeled his rage in the ring, but Marty found redemption for both of them thanks to Raging Bull. The black and white cinematography is gorgeous and the performances were powerful. De Niro gives another physically demanding performance after his work in Taxi Driver and he once again is very impressive. Joe Pesci is also wonderful as he will later become a recurring actor in other Scorsese films. The chemistry between both actors in this film is really strong and they shine together on screen. The boxing scenes were really raw and violent. They are hard to watch at times, and an extreme close up of dripping blood from the rope in the ring really captured the violence that Scorsese was trying to transmit. Raging Bull is a fascinating film which explores the mind of a very emotionally disturbed man who we wouldn't want to be around with, but somehow Scorsese draws us into his mind and he absorbs us.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I haven't finished watching, but...","It's not a bad movie. It's actually pretty great. No movie has portrayed boxing the way this one has, however (and a big one, as you can see from my rating) it's not for everyone. Black and white, some still shots, an occasional color gives the movie charm, but it's slow paced, seems to be leading to nowhere. That's why I couldn't bring myself to finish it. Watched an hour or so, but watching the mediocre acting and not so great dialogue, weird actions from characters, I was a bit dissapointed. But I hope my review doesn't hold you back from watching the movie. You should see at least an hour of. Or maybe even finish.

Depressing and mostly non-entertaining,"I saw this at the Bardovan Opera House, in Poughkeepsie, NY, this past weekend (February 2007). I guess this is considered a great film by a lot of people, but I didn't enjoy watching a waste of human life for 2 hours. There were no characters of any redeeming value in the entire film! These people were a bunch of morally bankrupt lowlifes! And I sincerely doubt that anyone used the F-word in the 1940s as much as was featured in this film. What is it about so many movie makers that makes them think inclusion of the F-word somehow improves it? (just like so many standup comics of today) And the whole B&W thing! Just because color film is the norm doesn't mean making a movie in B&W somehow moves it out of the ""movie"" category and into the ""film"" category. The pretentiousness of Hollywood really makes me sick sometimes! I will take ""Rocky"" (just about any one of the series) over this movie any day of the week.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hard-hitting in its brutality,"Martin Scorsese tends to have a masterpiece every decade and for the 80s, it's Raging Bull. Scorsese crafts some of the most iconic shots and sequences ever put to film in this epic boxing drama. The style of the film is wholly unique and still has not been topped. Robert DeNiro gives another one of the best performances of the century and completely becomes the tragic Jake LaMotta. His story is fascinating, yet difficult to watch. Raging Bull is an all-time classic and one you shouldn't miss.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A flawless masterpiece,"One of my alltime favorite films, Raging Bull is a stunning examination of brutality and one man's descent into decadence and immorality. Much more than a boxing film, it's a documentation of what makes us human, and the potential of it's destruction. Simply put, Robert DeNiro gives the performance of a lifetime. He is absolutely magnificent as Jake LaMotta, a true bull of a man in and out of the ring. His sheer presence is overpowering, but he is competently underscored by an impressive supporting cast, especially Pesci as his tormented brother and Moriarty as his abused wife. The boxing sequences are as real as it gets, unflinchingly brutal and almost poignant. Behind all the ugliness of Raging Bull, though, lies beauty. The actions of LaMotta hardly evoke pity, but the film is so poetic and incredibly filmed that the movie is never so stark and perverse as to be unwatchable. Bringing it all together is the masterful direction of Martin Scorsese, who is brilliant as always. I could talk forever about Raging Bull, but it has to be viewed to be fully appreciated. For that matter, see it more than once, it gets better with each viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Scorsese Film About A Lot More Than Just Boxing,"I'm no boxing fan so I can't honestly say that I was dying to see this movie until I learned that Scorsese himself is not a boxing fan but he wanted to tell this story so this intrigued me even more and after always hearing about the massive praise for Robert De Niro performance I have to say I was very impressed. I'm gonna start out by saying the cliché thing when talking about this movie, Robert De Niro is absolutely incredible in this film it's in my opinion the greatest performance he's ever given, through De Niros performance when see La Motta gradually becoming his title of being a ""Raging Bull"" and was a truly terrifying presence. The boxing scenes in this film are so real, Scorsese did such a good job directed this film he put you right in their to the point where you could feel the power of every punch and move made. Joe Pesci was so fantastic in this film he seemed like a real scumbag but was never over the top at his chemistry with De Niro was completely on point. La Mottas character arc was handled perfectly, you understood just how much of his humanity he was losing both physically and mentally to the point where you actually start to pity him while still fearing him at certain points. Now one of the most common things to find in a Scorsese film is a female love interest that comes to hate the protagonist and this film has this but works for this film as it added to character arc of La Motta and gave room for Cathy Moriarty to give such a great and damaged performance in this film. However if I am completely honest I don't quite like this film as much as everyone else does, I do have one of two minor issues with this film for one, I didn't think making this film Black and White really added anything to this film and at times was just distracting and I think that the portion of the film that focuses LaMottas success in the ring is to short, the film montages over his major successes and does subtract some What from the intensity of the final fight. However I do think that the last act of this film was very effective as it got away from the boxing and focused on the characters aftermath of his time in the ring and we go from despising LaMotta to as I said sympathising with him and I truly thought that De Niro pulled it of perfectly.Raging Bull is a fantastic film, I don't quite think it's a masterpiece but it's got an incredible Robert De Niro performance, really intense and personal boxing matches and a perfect way of giving insight into its title character and giving him a complexity that makes him a better character.86%/A-",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Might not be his best but this is my favorite Scorsese film.,"I often struggle to connect with Scorsese's work on an emotional level. I find his films curiously intellectualized and given his interest in watching men destroy themselves I just don't get a lot from them. This fine film is an exception. Some of it is the genre-boxing film-is one of my favorite genres and Scorsese's direction is classical and restrained (most of the time) that makes the film feel like a traditional Hollywood film. The black and white really helps with this; swearing aside this feels like a 40's film. Indeed, re-watching it the other day it struck me as a more realistic version of a Requiem for a Heavyweight; it has the same somber fatalism to the proceedings.Now it does have the Scorsese flourishes and the boxing scenes themselves are quite brutal. But overall I think this is my favorite film by Scorsese because of its classic influences. It is Scorsese at his least inventive but also his best.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scorsese transports you body and soul to another world.,"I've never seen a boxing film that I could ever consider forcing myself to endure again. I've suffered James Cagney's worst film, WINNER TAKE ALL (1932). I've tortured myself watching Lew Ayres in the utterly atrocious IRON MAN (1931). I've poked red hot needles into my eyes to keep me awake through Chester Morris' excruciatingly boring performance in KING FOR A NIGHT (1933). Doug Fairbanks in THE LIFE OF JIMMY DOLAN (1933) was ok but that hardly sets ones world alight.OK, there are possibly more modern examples of the genre but I clearly am not a fan of boxing films. So why is someone like me who thinks 1937's a bit modern reviewing RAGING BULL? Because it's one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.This has possibly is the greatest example of cinematography in the history of cinema. Although the boxing scenes are the most brutal and hideous images imaginable which are totally mesmeric, it's the scenes of everyday life which are utterly awe inspiring. This is a true work of art. The characters Scorsese creates to inhabit his savage world give this a rare authenticity, a voyeuristic glimpse into a fascinating reality which few of us would ever want to experience. De Niro's character is however so hideous that watching this is not an enjoyable experience but an experience so engrossing that you'll want to stand up and applaud at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A Masculine Messy, Bloody, Mirror","Initially, this film did not resonate. I wasn't sure what Lamotta was supposed to mean to me. He was hard to relate to. Yet something I live by when it comes to just about anything is that you should always try something twice. So I did.Raging Bull is one of my favorite American films after several viewings because it truly portrays unbridled masculinity. It's not pretty. It's not morally justifiable. It's just animalistic. The constant drive to wanna be the best, to conquer the competition, to dominate women, all of these things are ugly, but American and masculine. We see a man that never rises, but continues to slowly fall. The fact that he is a good fighter, and that he wins the belt, means nothing because he gets really fat and loses his brothers love. His body and dominance start to leave him as he achieves. The trade-offs and high stakes resonate in waves.One of the most stunning sequences in cinema history for me is when we see Lamotta at arguably his lowest, in prison. The scene evokes true emotion, as we see a man who has never broken, finally break. He realizes what he is. Who he is. And I cry every time. Not because I love Jake Lamotta, but because I understand what it is like to regret something that is in your nature. You're sorry, but you're not. But you are because you were caught.Lamotta cannot understand why people start to turn on him, despite his treatment of them. This is personified in the final scene with Joey. His ego never leaves. The constant need for attention and justification becomes Jake's fight. He can't physically dominate people anymore, so he has to use his fragile ego to manipulate people into laughter at his self deprecation.And so what does it all mean? Is raging bull a technically excellent film? Of course. Is it well directed. Sure. But what it truly is is a mirror. A mirror that men hold up, and see themselves in, like it or not. I certainly did. And that's entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good Lord, how many times must we be forced to watch a long drawn-out scene with De Niro's character screaming, yelling and slapping his wife around to realize he's not very trusting and has a shaky home life? Okay, we get it, enough already!The main thing I want in any movie is to be entertained, but Raging Bull didn't even come close.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
amazing,"I saw this movie when it came out and was amazed by it. But what makes it fascinating for me to see it again these days is that a couple of years later, I got to spend some time with Jake LaMotta, and that certainly affects my viewing of the movie. I met with LaMotta at a small Italian restaurant/bar in Pennsylvania, and my memories of that are 1) the fact that he blew smoke in my face, and everybody's face, constantly; 2) the way the people who ran the place treated him as if he was a god -- I must have heard the word ""Champ"" a hundred times that night; and 3) the fact that LaMotta, for all his bluster, actually was pretty honest about his life and the movie. He didn't duck anything to do with the movie -- he claimed his real life was even more violent and wild, but he might just have been bragging or, pardon the pun, blowing smoke. And, despite the fact that everyone else felt the need to play Ed McMahon all night when ""Champ"" was spitting out his one-liners, I can tell you first-hand that his jokes really, really, really are not in the least bit funny.",,Anonymous,Biography

Masterful directing, cinematography, acting and make no mistake, Robert DeNiros performance as LaMotta is without a doubt the single greatest acting performance in the history of cinema. This is NOT a boxing movie in the style of Rocky but a movie about a boxer who has deep seated sexual insecurities and the consequent rage and jealousy that come with it. This is a true story about Jake LaMottas life. He was the middleweight champion of the world in those days and he was a consultant onset throughout the film in order to create a historically correct record of his life. Brutal to watch at times but no punches were pulled in the creation of this movie. If you're a squeamish, sensitive person then skip this. Stick with your Netflix crap.

"what are emotions men can display without being called ""a fag""? rage. you won't see many movies like this one. absolutely brilliant.","This is a tale about insecurity. control. neediness. Fearing of not being manly enough. Oh yeah: this is a modern movie abut masculine insecurity at total display. which is completely amazing in this piece is that those securities seemed to be what made him winning so much. The rage filled with a bottle because ""men don't cry, men don't show weakness"". There's a scene whehn la motta cries and i believe he's crying not only because what happened but also for not being strong enough for not crying.I'm amazed how this movie is not that shown now a days. It's a classic but i think more people saw taxi driver or goodfellas.a lot of this leads to toxic relationships and domestic violence: the sense of total control of everything and everybody. The sense of being the alpha above all in order to avoid what was really going on inside him. The feeling of dispair, of not being able to to open up, besides his own fists.Jake la motta is probably one of the most insecure guys in the planet. However because he was strong physically he was perceived as strong. Strong men can be insecure. Can be afraid of being making fun by everybody. This movie is about box as much as toy story is about the discovery of america: boxe is the way those inecurities are executed: because if other think you're strong, then you are. More:your work is based on how strong and attractive people think you are.Then we can talk about the actors and de niro is out of the ordinary. It's all known to be one of his best performances and thta's completely true. Moriarty is amazing on her contrived performance, a strong woman who la motta had taken advantage: she was just to young and naive to understand what he was about. But she grows up and matures and he doesn't know what to do with that: she wasn't his virgin fantasy anymore. She wasn't the one he had nothing to lose because she never been with anyone before. Now she could be ale to enjoy other people presence: and how the film makes la motta reacting to this is absolutely intense and mesmerizing.pesci is fabulous too. The dialogues between both men have that perfect rythm and craziness. They were just two guys shouting testosterone at each other. What they believed it was testoterone. Scorsese films this like his life depends on it: and maybe it did. We can feel the rage, the dispair the scary intimacy - the viewer knows anything can happen at any moment: and that sense of a tickling bomb is completely accomplished.the music, the sound, the effects, how scorsese films the fights...but the script is fabulous.

Lower Tier Of Martin Scorsese,A interesting film with some pros and cons. Why cast are on for a brilliant show of acting. Feel the film lacks building the storyline and we can often guess how it will take place why its a story its repetive and feels that it goes no where. Some of the scenes are of slow movement. But the style and the action on drama are very well told some of the strongest parts of the film. Feel more could have been told but purely focus on the anger.

"I've done a lot of bad things in my life Joey, maybe now I'ts coming back to me","(There Are Spoilers) Unlike most professional prize-fighters who keep their aggressions inside of the boxing-ring and outside of it would rather walk away from a fight then participate or provoke one boxer, and later Middleweight Champion,Jake La Matta, Robert Di Niro, was the exact opposite.Brutal rude petty and jealous and combative of anyone who as much as looked at his pretty wife Vickie, Cathy Moriarty, La Matta did more fighting outside the ring then in it. Fighting his way up the ranks to get a shot at the title 20 year-old La Matta is defeated for the first time in his career on September 24, 1941 in Cleveland after he knocked his opponent Jimmy Reeves, Flyod Anderson, out cold. Reeves was saved from being counted out by the bell and was declared the winner which started a full-scale riot in the Cleveland arena.Quickly recovering from his loss La Matta went on to defeat the undefeated Sugar Ray Robinson (Johnny Barnes), who bet La Matta twice before,on February 26, 1943 in a 10 round decision in Detroit, Robinson's home town. Assured that he'd get a shot at the Middleweight Title LaMatta had to wait some six years, and throw a fight to journeyman boxer Billy Fox(Eddie Mustafa Muhammad) in New York on November 11, 1947,to get it.The movie ""Raging Bull"" concentrates more on Jake LaMatta's personal then professional boxing life and we see just what kind of a Neanderthal and brute he was to the people he came in contact with especially his wife Vickie and younger brother Joey, Joe Pesci.Suffering from an inferior complex and afraid that Vickie would leave him for another man, like he left his first wife for Vickie,La Matta constantly beat and berated Vickie to the point of not just slapping her around but catching Vickie flush right in the face with one of his punches that knocked her out.Even Joey wasn't speared from Jake's brutality and suspicions of fooling around with Vickie when he savagely attacked and bet him, right in front of Joey's wife and children. This lead Joey to never talk to Jake again until almost ten years later. La Matta finally got a shot at the title on June 16, 1949 in Detroit and defeated the Middleweight Champ Frenchman Marcel Cerdan, Louis Raftis, when he couldn't answer the bell for the 10th round.Defending his hard won title a year later against fellow Frenchman Laurent Dauthuille (Johnny Turner), Cerdan died in a plane crash before his re-match with La Matta,on September 13, 1950 in NYC Jake was about to lose the fight on points. It's then that he exploded with a fury of punches in the 15th round and knocked out Dauthuille with only 13 seconds left in the fight.For all intents and purposes Jake La Matta's boxing career ended, he official retired in 1954, on February 14, 1951, known in the boxing world as the St. Valentine Day massacre. It's then when he fought and lost his Middleweight crown to his arch-rival Sugar Ray Robinson in a brutal 13 round battle. La Matta bloodied and beaten was still standing on his feet when the fight was stopped by the ring referee.No longer able to box professionally La Matta opened up a nightclub, the Jake La Matta, in Miami Florida but trouble still followed him. La Matta was busted on a vice rap, that landed him in the Dade County Jail. This happened when he allowed a 14 year-old girl Mary Albee, who told LaMatta that she was 21, drink at his club and then introduced her to a number of his friends.The movie ""Raging Bull"" ends in NYC in 1964 with a pudgy and punch-drunk Jake La Matta, alone with everyone that he knew in his hay-day as a boxing champ deserting him, rehearsing his nightclub act which is nothing more then a parody of his life. An amazing Acadamy Award performance by Robert Di Niro as the edgy and uncontrollable Jake La Matta who had to gain some 50 pounds, going from a fighting trim of 165 to over 200 lbs, to make the role of Jake La Matta believable.The film ""Raging Bull"" also made a star out of the 36 year-old Joe Pesci who was about to call it quits on his acting career until Robert Di Niro himself demanded that he play his tragic, and somewhat unusable, brother Joey.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""An Emotional Journey: The Award Winning Raging Bull is More Than a Boxing Film""","Martin Scorsese's iconic film ""The Raging Bull"" was released on December 19, 1980. It narrates the tale of middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta, whose volatile temper and self-destructive actions affect both his professional and personal lives. Robert De Niro won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his legendary role of Jake LaMotte.""Raging Bull"" explores the life of 1940s and 1950s middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta, a gifted but unstable man. The movie follows his battles inside and outside of the ring.The movie's main character is LaMotta, portrayed by well known film actor Robert De Niro. The plot is about a highly competitive man whose personal life has been shaped by violence and insecurity. His bad temper has resulted in problems in his relationships with important people in his life.As the protagonist's career progresses his troubles do as well. He has setbacks including a run of defeats in his boxing career. Towards the end of the movie he faces a hard time with his identity and wants to understand the consequences of his actions.The lack of color highlights the emotional depth of the movie by allowing viewers to focus more on the feelings and facial expressions of the characters.With the use of black and white scenes director Martin Scorsese creates a dark mood that goes well with the film's themes.This cinematic decision helped in keeping with the era of Jake LaMotta's boxing career, the black-and-white color scheme has an reminiscent of vintage movies from the 1940s and 1950s, this helped lend an air of realism.The dramatic intensity of the visual is further enhanced by the potent fusion of great music on the movie's soundtrack. An important key component of the movie is the music which can help improve the narrative and in capturing the emotional terrain of the main character's existence.By bringing light to the athlete's inner issues the movie impacted the sports genre. It cleared the path for later motion pictures that prioritize moral complexity and character development. ""Raging Bull"" is an important piece of cinema history because, all things considered, it is an important movie that revolutionized narrative and artistic approaches to storytelling. This is an experience that a lot of athletes in the real world are facing and it is important to bring awareness to films like this one.

Self-redemption,"""I wanted to push all the way to the very very end and see if I could die. Embracing a way of life to its limit.""Martin ScorseseDuring the making of New York, New York (1977), which turned out to be a box-office failure, the Roman Catholic director, Martin Scorsese, sank into a spiraling abyss of drug addiction. While he was ""embracing a way of life to its limit"", he almost got himself killed after having some ""bad coke"" that caused a massive internal bleeding. Thanks to this wake-up call, he finally kicked off his cocaine addiction with the help of the actor and his close friend, Robert De Niro, with whom he collaborated on all his most notable works. Believing that he would never make another film, Scorsese poured all his energy into making the next film, Raging Bull (1980), which received spectacular success and was voted the greatest film of the 1980s by Britain's Sight & Sound magazine.Raging Bull is a biographic drama film about an emotionally self-destructive boxer fueled by paranoid jealousy and rage, which lead him to the top of the ring while destroy his life outside of it. The film is not only a redemption, which saved Scorsese from his self-destruction but also a landmark where his film style reached its peak: the expressionistic depict of psychological points of view. In his previous hits, Mean Street (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976), Scorsese rendered the protagonists' psychotic perspectives using high contrasts and aggressive use of bold colors. Raging Bull, shot in high contrast black-and-white, vividly carried out the raging, masochistic and insecure mind state of Jake La Motta through the perfect combination of visual and audio effects. From La Motta's point of view, his wife, Vickie is always in slow motion when she is close to other men. Through the exaggerated depiction of an innocent event, La Motta's jealousy is visually represented. During the most riveting boxing scenes, Scorsese utilizes not only the punching sounds but also the bull roars, flashbulbs, water-running, and even squelching watermelon sound effects to externalize the bubbling rage deep within La Motta.Brutal and intense as the movie is, it has a poetic and contemplative opening of La Motta shadowboxing alone in the ring. The background music ""Intermezzo"" from the opera Cavalleria Rusticana orchestrates a tragedy that is about to unfold, while La Motta's movements are full of freedom and even transcendence. Interestingly, the movie also ends with La Motta, now an old, fat and failed comedian, shadowboxing in the dressing room before his show. Perhaps Scorsese is trying to suggest that throughout La Motta's whole life, boxing is the physical way in which this self-destructive soul seeks for spiritual absolution. Perhaps the cinematic classic, Raging Bull, is not only about rage and violence, but more about self-redemption.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Boxing film among the best,"Boxing film among the best. Watching itl nearly a quarter of a century after De Niro won his Oscar cannot be the same experience as watching the movie when it was freshly made. The interesting thing is that regardless of when you watch a movie, there would often be another one that it would make you recall. In my case, it's Sylvia which I saw very recently. The link is the emotion called jealousy. Manifested in two real-life characters of the opposite sex, jealousy just jump out of the screen at you in both movies, although strangely, it isn't the main subject matter of either. Strange it may seems, jealousy serving as an immediate link between two human beings that could not have been more different: Jake La Motta and Sylvia Plath,. In the opening credit, against the background music of Ave Maria (Bach-Gounod's version, I think, but could well be wrong), we see in slow motion a blurred figure (presumably De Niro) in a hood, at a distance, practising by himself on the far left side of the screen, in a boxing ring. Regardless of what it is saying, or not saying, the combination of the mystic visual image and serene music produces an uncanningly haunting effect. Moving right alongon the boxing scenes. Someone once said that boxing is the purest form of head-to-head confrontation/combat. The movie industry is prolific with good boxing scenes. (Even Elvis Presley in Kid Galahad is not that bad). The unique thing about the boxing scenes in Raging Bull (and there are so many of them) is that they are closest to documentary footage than what you'll see anywhere else. In Raging Bull, there is little dramatic consequence to them. As are result, they can be filmed in the purest form. Many have commented that these boxing sequences are brilliant, and maybe that's why.Going to other aspects of the film, I enjoy particularly watching the courtship sequence. The parties involved are not exactly intellectual giants, and both De Niro and Cathy Moriarty portrayed there characters beautifully and, as far as I can surmise, realistically. Coming with the slightly minimalised acting is a sweet innocent that is uncharacteristic of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Modern-day Citizen Kane. It stands the test of time.,"Raging Bull has been raved as the best movie of the 80s and currently ranks number 4 on AFI's list of 100 Greatest Films. I can certainly see why.Raging Bull is a genius piece of cinema. The way the boxing scenes, cinematography and all else was done with simple tricks that make for a great flick. Citizen Kane was perhaps the first movie to use genius camera tricks and filming techniques. Movies with genius filming tricks are equivalent to, or sometimes surpass, heavily computer-generated masterpieces like the new Planet of the Apes movies. It shows that less can be more. It can also symbolize a part in the movie and give a scene deep-meaning. That is why I agree with this being the best movie Martin Scorsese ever directed.Raging Bull tells the story of middleweight boxing legend, Jake LaMotta's rise and fall. He is explosive temper is fuelled by his personal demons of frustration, jealousy, fear and paranoia of his professional and personal lives leads him to the top of the boxing world and destroys his personal life, where he eventually loses everybody that supported him. De Niro was so fantastic and was very deserving of his Oscar. Everybody in the supporting cast was excellent too. This is not a movie about boxing. That is why some people may not like this. If you think of it as a movie about boxing, you will not understand the message or meaning that this movie is trying to convey. Even if you don't think of it as a boxing movie, it may take a few watches to understand the depth. The main theme, which is probably the most important and the movie's main message, is how bad it is when violence consumes one's life: he responds with any kind of situation even remotely negative with the only way he knows how--the monster he becomes in the ring. If you can't figure out the message, you will not think this movie is totally amazing. Once figured out, you will love the movie that much more. Like Citizen Kane or It's a Wonderful Life, the main message is one that is always relevant and comes with a strong impact.4/4",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Boxing B picture gets a big budget makeover.,"Bio pic of controversial and troubled boxer Jake La Motta.Hard to say quite why a La Motta bio-pic should be the ""pet"" project of Martin Scorsese (director) and Robert De Niro (lead), but clearly it was, so a great deal of time and effort was spent over a character the world had not only forgotten about, but only the most ardent sports fans knew about in the first place!While La Motta was clearly a world class boxer (even middleweight World Champion for a short while), he was hardly one of the all-time greats and had a fighting style that involved more bravery than skill. His habit of walking through a jab was almost a lesson in how ""not"" to box!Out of the ring his habit of articulating emotion with his fists, rather than his mouth, was well known, but here he is turned in to a fully formed psychopath to accommodate De Niro's acting abilities.Certainly the young La Motta was a wild criminal and occasional mugger (something that the film makes no reference to - despite being mentioned in his autobiography, the inspiration for this film), but it is hard to believe what we see on film.The film was conceived and written for De Niro to go clean over-the-top and for people that don't know any better to mistake it for great acting.(In this he was successful - as he won the Best Actor Oscar.)De Niro got himself fit and then got himself fat for this film, but so what? Anyone can box for short takes on film, it is boxing for 15 rounds with only 30 second breaks that the public can't do. As regards getting fat for the later scenes - so what again? Has anyone else ever got praise for eating two dinners a day in France?The strange thing about this picture is how much it is like those old B pictures. Not only are we mostly in B&W (colour for a single home movie), but also spend extended periods in medium shot. The fights are announced in subtitles, and then we are in to the boxing clichés that involve point-of-view, the blood, the slow-motion, the ringside cigars, the flashbulbs. Scorsese seems to think that we don't know that boxing is legalised violence and need it pointing out to us then underlined for good measure.The strange thing is that La Motta wasn't (and isn't) a dullard or a patsie, but quite a canny guy who later worked as a second rate comedian (shown in the film) and even after dinner speaker, but here he appears a bit slow, tongue tied and withdrawn. To this day (at 80 plus) he is a machine gun of wisecracks and mini-jokes, yet is portrayed here as a sullen introvert. I can't marry the two images.(Given his involvement in the film and having read the script I cannot see why he would sanction this. Maybe he thought the film was just a piece of passing nonsense and objected - even to the point of talking about legal action - when he realised that this gave him a false image?)It is interesting to note that the scene where De Niro attacks his brother-in-law (in a fit of paranoia) was not rehearsed. Pesci was not told what was going to happen and the surprise on his face is real, not acting!The film effects people because violence is very cinematic and despite all the disclaimers most of us enjoy short bursts of it. The dialogue (by Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin) is good and truthful, but drags after a while. The characters expose their limits early and have only to play them out for the rest of the time.Having seemed doubting and questioning it may surprise you that I like the picture and recommend it. It is very compulsive and has something that you can't put your finger on. Despite being violent and sometimes unpleasant you can't help routing for the guy and hope he can find happiness somehow.Maybe this is because I take my hat of to all boxers, they have bravery, dedication and courage that even twenty million dollar a picture actors envy and want to wear the clothes of.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jerk La Motta,"RAGING BULL concerns the life of former middleweight boxing champ Jake La Motta, who was dubbed ""the Bronx Bull"" due to his dogged toughness. In the ring, he was a dirty fighter with arguably the toughest chin in history, able to take beatings as severe as those he could give, leaning into his opponents and slugging them; outside, he was equally mean, subjecting those close to him to physical and verbal abuse. He fought a memorable six-bout rivalry with the legendary Sugar Ray Robinson (considered the greatest boxer pound-for-pound) and, in a career of 106 fights, was only ever knocked off his feet once (by Danny Nardico), an achievement he was proud of. The 1980 film, directed by Martin Scorsese, paints a forcefully gloomy portrait of La Motta and was based upon an autobiography co-written by Joseph Carter and Peter Savage. It was Scorsese's friend actor Robert De Niro who originally discovered the source material (during production of THE GODFATHER PART II) and became convinced of its cinematic potential. At first, Scorsese's disinterest hindered the collaboration - he was never drawn to boxing, and his asthmatic childhood helped to prevent an enjoyment of sports - until he was finally persuaded by De Niro while hospitalised for a strong cocaine and prescription overdose; the director's substance use worsened during a period of critical and commercial decline in the late seventies. A new understanding emerged: he identified with La Motta's eventual downfall and saw an opportunity of professional and personal redemption.Fundamentally, RAGING BULL is all about the brute that was Jake; he was a powerhouse of a contender but a sullen bastard of a man. The biographical saga pulls no punches in its lacerating morosity and was filmed in monochrome, a creative choice that not only reflects the era and the old televised matches but perfectly complements the bitter atmosphere. It recounts Jake's life as a series of sensational, tabloid-esque flashbacks from the beginnings of his career in 1941 to his rivalry with Robinson, the dive he took for the title and his 1949 win of the belt from Marcel Cerdan, his turbulent marriage to second wife Vickie, his souring relationship with brother-manager Joey, and his decline in the fifties as an obese bar owner and shoddy stand-up comic who got into legal trouble. As the setting jumps from place to place, we get to notice timeline details including those relevant to La Motta, Scorsese and De Niro's shared NYC Italian cultural background: the working class hollering and bickering, scummy Bronx apartment buildings, the social gatherings and colloquialisms, dignified Mafiosi, tobacco-clouded entertainment venues, jazz and pop 78s hissing in the background, the installation of a family TV. For a movie set in this time period, the dialogue is unusually profane and true-to-life, yet it pays homage to the sombre black-and-white pugilist flicks of the era like THE SET-UP and BODY AND SOUL. The operatic tone and familial theatrics are also reminiscent of THE GODFATHER.The script underwent a draft from Mardik Martin, a second from Paul Schrader and an uncredited revision from Scorsese and De Niro. Despite a particular focus on Jake's personal life, many details have been strangely ignored such as his troubled upbringing of reformatory education, his parents, his history of criminal activity, and even what attracted him to prizefighting; the lack of background leaves the origins of his temperament a mystery and doesn't prepare us for the narrative trajectory. Likewise, the many repetitive domestic scenes showing the bullyish slob arguing and browbeating don't delve into his inner torment and motivations. As domineering husband to Vickie, Jake develops a jealousy that worsens his madness - it's the only aspect that is supported with rationale, given her contrasting erotic appeal and his habit of sexual abstinence to retain aggressive professional drive - but what is never covered is why she puts up with him for so long and whether or not his suspicions were actually true. There is nothing else to this elemental savage; he is the embodiment of brutishness, fighting his way through the movie. Another unexplored area is the mob's influence on boxing, a possible contributing factor to the sense of paranoia and isolation. Screenwriting depth has been thrown under the melodrama and production values - there's a lot of shouting actors hammering away at each other and a lot of embellishing cinematography but a lot of shallow, wearisome rage. Heavy-hearted Pietro Mascagni pieces underscore a number of scenes to emphasise the sense of tragedy - in some segments, the film's dramatic bombast produces material that nearly parodies itself.The shift between the feral turmoil of Jake's boxing years and the miserable, hopeless lethargy of the punch-drunk Jake in overweight retirement is jarring, as if the makers abruptly stuck on a mini sequel. By the conclusion, it's clear that Jake's pigheadedness got him where he went but the deterioration of this inarticulate bum is of minuscule benefit to the audience - it may mean something to Scorsese but what are we to learn from this? There might be a certain truth to the notion that those in combat sports are tempted towards callous and self-destructive behaviour, but the movie doesn't investigate what creates these sorts of personalities and leads them to do these things; there's no element of social pathology. The cryptic inclusions of Brando's monologue from ON THE WATERFRONT and a Biblical excerpt try to add a piteous, misfortunate layer to Jake La Motta that is incompatible with the movie's barbarian vision of him; they make no sense in this context. As there is nothing extraordinary or redeemable about the protagonist, the picture ultimately feels like nothing more than a dull parable about succumbing to your inner demons and losing everything, the lowest point in your life.In his tour de force as Jake, De Niro wore a fake battered nose and took it upon himself to not only reach professional fitness standards with training from the real La Motta, but to then lose all the muscle with a whopping sixty-pound weight gain for the post-boxing section. This physical transformation is amazingly verisimilar, but despite all the effort, De Niro only adds surface decoration to this one-note character. The performance nevertheless is the epitome of his well-known dedicated acting approach, remaining the most demanding role of his career, a landmark in Method acting and a reference point for Italian American ""tough guy"" portrayals. As the feisty Joey, the dwarfish Joe Pesci has himself caught in the crossfire - full of advice for Jake and retorts for defence, he brings a little spirit and clarity to this murky picture. His former double act partner Frank Vincent was cast as Salvy the gangster. The voluptuous Cathy Moriarty was discovered at a beauty contest for the part of Vickie; only eighteen, the platinum blonde recalled numerous other media girls of the past, perhaps a cross between Jean Harlow and Lana Turner most of all. Her Vickie is subdued and passive, the urban goddess almost as emblematic as Jake.The boxing sequences reflect La Motta's psyche; the arena is the environment where he can not only be rewarded for the outlet of his anger, but can assert his Neanderthal masculinity and feel a sense of emotional gratification - it's De Niro, in his ruthless display, who evokes these things to us. The action is visceral, pulling us right into the bodies and pain, and captured very close in; the tight shots magnify the pummels to the face and bodily fluids spewing out, and all the quick movements and fast hard blows come out through the rapid-fire editing. The punches squash and crunch (they smashed melons for this) and the crowd cheers and whistles as the Graflexs of ringside photographers snap away, the bulb flashes illuminating the bashing giddiness of it all. This is hell's arena, where the violence holds a mystical connotation; Jake masochistically endures this purgatorial suffering, becoming so battered his blood not only contaminates his cornermen's sponge but splatters the spectators. I suppose pugilism has never looked more artistic than it does here and it's no doubt striking, but as a representation of it, it's a bit facile, accentuating the fury and gore but disregarding technical details and the ups and downs of Jake's career - the defenceless opponents have no variety of style or tactic, and all these hyped-up fights seem no more important than the other.The New Hollywood movement was dwindling during release but the picture left some critics thoroughly impressed, and by the end of the eighties, many deemed it the definitive classic of the decade. Among the eight Oscar nominations, De Niro won his only best actor trophy and Thelma Schoonmaker was awarded with best editing, while Scorsese earned his first nod for best director. RAGING BULL continues to rank highly and has even been judged the greatest sports film ever made, despite it being much more of a biography. I think it's far from the knockout that it's said to be; while it certainly taps into the volcanic disposition of the protagonist and has a captivating, polished execution, the biopic fails to prove anything deep or special about the caveman subject. It's really just a load of pretentious pulp about punishment and brutality, taking itself too seriously for its own good. This bleak, gruelling experience lacks substance, pounding you numb and standing as one of the most overrated films of the past half century.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Greatest Movie Ever Made,"Few sites in cinema are as poetic as the opening shot of Martin Scorcese's dramatic masterpiece. The slowness and grace of Jake La Motta preparing himself for the fight is an excellent juxtaposition for the rest of the movie. It's the calm before the storm. It's Scorcese's way of putting us in a false sense of security, and it works perfectly.However, this is just one of many great things about Raging Bull. The editing, cinematography, art direction and sound all excel like in no other movie. Robert De Niro's career best performance as the tortured boxer stands as one of the best ever committed to film, the script is brutal and realistic, and the direction is unbelievably good. Few films have the same impact on an audience as that as Raging Bull. It could be because Scorcese directs it in such a way that we all respond to it emotionally, but it's more likely that for all that Jake does wrong to his family, we sympathise with him, because we all want to be forgiven for the things we've done wrong.I think this film is perfect in every way a movie needs to be.

BIO-DRAMABased on Jake LaMotta's own personal book directed by Martin Scorsese. It was also known for Robert De Niro gaining 100 pounds for the role. By looking at the film as a whole it's labelled as a performance film than as a movie with a plot since the film is solely about one person and is accurately depicted. We get to see his false assumptions, accusations and cockiness as a professional boxer filmed in black and white but I've only seen this film once since I haven't learned anything more than when I last saw it even though it left a memorable impression about Jake LaMotta the person as a self absorbed a-hole and may have revolutionized how bio drama's are made.

Powerful Reality,"The Raging Bull, released in 1980, is a film that is based on the autobiography book by Jake LaMotta. The film is directed by Martin Scorsese and is written by Joesph Carter and Peter Savage. The film tells the story of the famous middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta, starring Robert De Niro, who succeeded in his career and led the downfall of his personal life through violence and anger issues. Joey, Jake's brother, supports him as his boxing manager. He is played by Joe Pesci. During Jake's early boxing career, he meets a young girl named Vickie, starring Cathy Moriarty, and falls for her.Even though the film is black and white, the actors, particularly Robert De Niro made the film remarkably successful. His acting as well as the effort he put in to become Jake LaMotta both mentally and physically was astonishing. Throughout the movie you can see that De Niro's weight fluctuates with his eating habits and boxing career. For a moment I thought a fat suit was being used but then I realized that it was the real actor's body. This puts a lot of pressure mentally and physically on De Niro and few actors would go to such lengths to emulate their character.While I do not like the main characters, Jake and Joey, I thought the documentary/narrative truthfully spoke of what happened. There was no sugar coating the characters as good people. Clearly anyone can see that Jake is a narcissist who does not really care about anyone unless they benefit him. The dialect and language used in the film was certainly researched and tried to make it as accurate as possible to that era.I still have mixed feelings about the film. I did not root for the main character, and I disliked him very much. I was expecting a movie that I would cheer for the main character. Even though I do not like Jake, this was the reality of this person. I respect and really admire De Niro's effort as becoming Jake LaMotta physically and even mentally. I still liked the movie overall for creating a powerful effect of emotions with topics surrounding violence and misogyny.Overall, I would still recommend this movie even if I do not like the characters. It was a good documentary about a misogynistic abusive boxer. While I did not every feel good from this movie, it also speaks volumes of the struggle's women had to deal with long ago of domestic violence and inequality.In conclusion, I really loved Robert De Niro's performance. Any actor who is so committed to play their character role to the point of gaining and or losing weight in a rigorous diet and exercise regimen, I really respect and admire.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Among Martin Scorcese's best films,"This is such a beautiful movie.  I consider this to be one of Scorcese's best, along with Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and Casino. Robert DeNiro is Jake LaMatta, a prize fighter, who will fight any boxer, and anyone, including his own wife and brother (Cathy Moriaty, Joe Pesci).  He attempts to win all the titles he can, fighting all the boxers he can, all the while he battles his own demons, and quarrels with his brother and wife. The scene in the prison cell is one of the most powerful performances by DeNiro I have ever seen.  All the actors are great, and the camera work is flawless.  And the violent scenes rattles your nerves.  The boxing matches are so realistic, it is almost like a documentary. Actually, the whole movie looks like a documentary.  I will even go as far as saying that this film is way more superior than Rocky, and Scorcese should've won best director, and the film should've won best film.

Another Scorsese masterpiece.,"This movie is just pure cinematic brilliance. It's up there with Scorsese's other masterpieces; ""Goodfellas"" and ""Taxi Driver"".Let's face it people, the story isn't that awfully strong (Supposedly the script took only 2 weeks to write.). But yet the movie is extremely powerful and interesting to watch because of mainly 2 aspects; Scorsese's fantastic, almost poetic directing and the performances by all of the actors.Robert De Niro, Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci give away some impressive acting performances. All three were nominated for an Oscar but only De Niro got to take the statue home with him. Also the fact that he gained an impressive 60 pounds for his role as the 'older' Jake La Motta must have helped him with his win.The movie is filmed in atmospheric black & white. The camera angles are all extremely simple but they work extremely effective. The classical music by Pietro Mascagni also adds to the atmosphere of the movie.The directing and acting truly make this movie memorable and interesting to watch. Even the scene's were nothing is really happening are made with such profession that it's a shear pleasure to watch. The boxing scene's are filmed highly original and with much gore (Ever seen a nose being broken?). I especially like the boxing matches between La Motta and Sugar Ray Robinson.But this movie is way more than just a boxing or sports movie. The drama in the movie is powerful and feels real as well as the emotions. There are some truly impressive, powerful and memorable scene's.It's just simply one of those movie were 'everything feels right' and works well. There is nothing wrong with this piece of cinematic brilliance and this movie proofs that Scorsese was and perhaps still is one of the best directors to have ever lived.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"While I do think this is a 'truly great' movie, I do not think it's 'one of the all-time greatest'.","I understand this movie is not meant to be easy to watch. It deals with such heavy topic's of domestic abuse, corruption, machismo - what it means to 'be a man', jealousy and perhaps most importantly, Rage. I know the brutal violence and abuse given and taken by our anti-hero, Jake LaMotta, is meant, and I think, succeeds in making the audience uncomfterble while also giving us glimpses into our own greed and pettiness and downright selfishness.In that aspect, I think Scorscese and De Niro and also Pesci (who apparantly was little-known before this!) did a brilliant job in making LaMotta look abhorrent whilst also making him look relatable, and despite his near invulnerability in the ring, his complete and utter weakness outside of it, In all of these aspects the movie works.I've seen the movie twice, I want to like it more than Rocky, but entirely subjectively I don't.

Would Hardly Even Call it a Great Movie,"...Let alone one of the greatest movies of all time.It's a biopic on a boxer called Jake LaMotta. I think he was a real person, but I'm not too knowledgeable on boxing lore. He fights Sugar Ray Leonard, who I know was a real boxer, so he must have himself been real.Anyway, apparently he was a rather violent and abrasive person in his personal life, not in the ring, and I think the director is trying to convey that that caused him to lose a lot of friends and family members along the way.This film contains many raw and I imagine controversial scenes of violence, particularly domestic violence, which is not seen in such an elaborate presentation in films very often. Mostly they would just cut away or something. Here the boxing isn't shown very clearly but the domestic violence scenes are, so it was probably shocking for the people who saw it.But that alone doesn't make for a good movie. I think the major problem is that it's a biographical film about this LaMotta fellow, but he's a cartoon. He's extremely dumb and paranoid and his response to everything seems to be to threaten violence or commit acts of violence. It's completely senseless and repetitive. While the main character doesn't have to be sympathetic - and indeed he's not here, as I don't think anyone will feel sorry for the fact that LaMotta went from having a shot at boxing greatness to scoring pity gigs in strip clubs - LaMotta isn't even interesting. He is a caricature of a violent Italian and even seems almost badly written. His violence has little rhyme or reason and you'd have to find justifications outside of the film to make it make sense such as low IQ or schizophrenia.Granted, the message on violence being bad is sound, but isn't that a given? The movie isn't playing with any interesting themes about violence, such as exploring possible justifications for it. It's not even really expressing that violence destroys lives. His career didn't end due to violence, his marriage lasted long, and he makes up with his brother. It's more about stupidity than violence - LaMotta is really a stupid guy.One good thing, though, is that it's one of the few movies that can show violence without glorifying it. As I said, LaMotta isn't a sympathetic character. It's hard to see his behavior as appropriate, justifiable, or admirable. It's almost random and completely inappropriate. Usually when you have a movie that shows a lot of violence, like the Rambo series or Boyz in the Hood, they ostensibly try to portray violence as a bad thing, but there are strong attempts made to justify it in the plot, blowing out a dog whistle to violent people looking for excuses and support for their habits and desires.As it stands, it can be best described as a collection of well-directed scenes of raw domestic violence along with some excellent performances. The star is Pesci, who plays a beleaguered but caring brother trying to keep the peace despite LaMotta's insanity.So why is it considered one of the greatest movies of all time? Because people were surprised at the scenes of domestic violence? Really, who cares. You can get home videos of that online these days if it's so interesting to you - does not make it art. Is it because DeNiro lost and gained copious amounts of fat for the role? So what, there are other actors who do the same, it's not even that uncommon. Maybe it's just some subtle film techniques that only critics and film students would know about.It's a good movie, but I'm not sure i would even call it a great movie, let alone within the top ten movies of all time. Come on.Honourable Mentions: The Great Santini (1979) - Duvall plays an ageing marine who lays his toxic masculinity hard on his family in his biographical or semi-biographical flick.

The Harder They Come...,"Jake LaMotta was an American professional boxer who held the world middleweight title between 1949 and 1951. He was nicknamed ""The Bronx Bull"" for his constant brawling and inside fighting technique. LaMotta often took as much punishment as he dished out but was able to absorb an incredible amount of beating throughout his career. All in all, he lived a turbulent life in and out of the ring. In 1970, Jake LaMotta wrote his autobiography, ""Raging Bull: My Story"".Robert DeNiro was in Sicily 1974 to shoot ""The Godfather Part ll"". In his spare time, he read LaMotta's biography and was deeply fascinated. So, the actor contacted his favorite movie director, Martin Scorsese, and suggested that they film LaMotta's book (with DeNiro himself in the starring role). However, Scorsese flatly refused. He had never been interested in sports, and he certainly had no intention of making a picture about some half-forgotten fighter.Robert DeNiro was not a man to give in that easy, though. Six years later, he finally managed to persuade Scorsese. In the spring of 1979, the two friends began shooting ""Raging Bull"" in Manhattan. Despite the studio's protests, Martin Scorsese had decided to make the movie in black and white. The director also decided to film all the most challenging logistical parts first - the graphic fight scenes. Often captured with a handheld camera inside the boxing ring.To play the bloated Jake LaMotta later in life, Robert DeNiro insisted on gaining weight rather than using special makeup effects. The entire production was therefore shut down for two months while the actor put on more than 60 pounds (30 kilos). But despite these extraordinary efforts, ""Raging Bull"" was not a major success. Not at the box office and certainly not among critics. In recent years, however, the film has been appropriately re-evaluated. It is now considered one of the most important pictures from the early 1980s.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"One of the Greatest films, and a true story!","Raging Bull is the definitive art film. It is also hauntingly poetic. It really isn't a movie about boxing as much as about a man with psychological and sexual complexities that he takes out on in the ring. It is a case study on the male masculinity.

This is one of the few pictures that ever made me cry because many of those emotions of fear, anger, frustration, and rage I feel all the time and can relate to the material. I agree it is the best film of the 1980's and is included in my top 10 favorite films of all time. Kudos to De Niro and Pesci who work together as a great team. This movie is way better than Rocky because it is deeper and more complex. A Great job well done!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great performances of De Niro, Moriarty and Pesci","Although the movie was great, Taxi Driver still tops as my favorite Scorsese movie. Raging Bull is a movie that really shines through in its own light. Impressing performances by De Niro and Pesci but I was mostly blown away by Moriarty who only was 19 years old at that time. She did an absolute wonderful performance here that somewhat people forget to pay tribute to.Schoonmaker and Chapman did excellent work with the editing and photography. This movie is really worth discovering if you like old Martin Scorsese movies.Personally I am not at all big on Scorseses latest work (WoWS and Silence) but his old work is golden and defines him as an excellent director.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"That was a bird, it's dead now !!!!","There has been a consistent complaint against Martin Scorsese regarding the fact that the protagonists in most of his films are horrible people and Scorsese makes us watch these horrible people do horrible things and so it is very difficult to find anything likable about them. While I agree that many of Scorsese's protagonists are questionable individuals, but Scorsese doesn't just use them and make them do reprehensible acts on screen just for the shock factor. He has always attempted to deeply study these characters. He explores the environment surrounding his characters and in a way he seeks to find the source and the reasons behind the behaviours and natures of his characters. His protagonists aren't always likable, but they are pretty much always interesting and multi-layered.Raging Bull starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty is a biopic based on the life of famed boxing legend Jake Lamotta. The main character is certainly not an individual that you would like to spend too much time with. He is a misogynist, he is massively insecure, he is violent and regularly assaults his wife throughout the film. The boxing ring and the fights are used as a dramatic theme to show and reveal what Lamotta is thinking and what he is going through emotionally. The boxing ring also acts as a means for Jake to legally vent his frustration and all his accumulated anger. Jake Lamotta, in the film at least, is the result of the environment that he grew up in. It is hinted from time to time that maybe he had to spend his childhood in the midst of extensive poverty, which probably has made him as hard and as abrasive as he is shown to be. He has always aimed for the stars and wanted to achieve his goals without anyone else's help. This is a reason why he always refrains from taking the assistance of the mafia, just to glorify his independence. He views everything as a goal or a trophy. The house that he has bought for his father is a trophy to him and a symbol of self assurance that he is a big shot. His car is a trophy which he uses to woo his then would be wife Vickie. But this uncontrolled materialistic mindset gives birth to a massive sense of misogyny. When he meets his future wife Vickie, he only sees her superficial features like her figure, her legs, her cheekbones, etc. So in a way he sees her only as a human trophy and like everything he has achieved before, he makes it his mission to win her. But once he gets her, he never makes an effort to get close to her emotionally. Another thing that is so apparent about the character of Lamotta is his insecurity. After his marriage, this insecurity of his constantly makes him suspicious about his wife's supposed infidelity which slowly drives him mad. These insecurities lead to volcanic eruptions of rage throughout the film, and the ironic thing about it is that the rage that initially made him a world renowned boxer in the ring also destroys his personal life. The eccentric and violent life he leads ultimately also makes it difficult for him to maintain his performances in the boxing ring.Apart from Jake Lamotta and Vickie, another brilliantly interesting character is that of Joey played by Joe Pesci. His back and forth dialogue with De Niro is absolutely fascinating. The two brothers clearly need each other and really love each other, but the underlying anger between the two brothers is also apparent.The direction by Martin Scorsese is another character in the film effectively. He makes us completely engaged in the plight of this character. The direction is so intense, that you can't help but feel drained out. You feel the punches, you feel the knockouts and you can't help but feel connected with Lamotta even if you hate him. The fight scenes are some of the most intense scenes I have ever seen. The cinematography is awe inspiring. The film is in black and white and it looks beautiful. I think Scorsese made the film in black and white as a means to recapture the essence of the films in the 1940s and 1950s which are the decades portrayed in the movie.Last but by no means least,I have to talk about the editing. Scorsese's long time collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker edits this film with a passion. The editing during the boxing scenes is just awe- inspiring. The zoom-ins, the slow motions, the tracking shots are all perfect.As soon as the opening credits come on the screen with Lamotta jumping around and practicing his punches in the background in slow motion, I knew this was going to be a masterpiece. Interestingly while we look at Lamotta in slow motion in the opening credits sequence, throughout the film Scorsese shows us many things in slow motion from Lamotta's point of view which reveal what his mind is preoccupied with at that precise moment which range from lust, jealousy and rage.Raging Bull is a masterpiece made by an auteur in his signature intense style. Jake Lamotta is not your regular hero. He is flawed and imperfect. But Scorsese's rich character study makes him iconic due to his imperfections in the movie and the film ends with a monologue sequence that is absolutely heartbreaking.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Best Movie of the Post-Classical Era,"When reviewing american films from the past twenty to thirty years there is no doubt that Raging Bull is a standout amongst standouts.  It is a film that encompasses every embodiment of motion picture art. The film is fueled with unbelievably dazzling editing (the best possibly ever!) and uncomprimizing performances (the same can be said) and unblinkingly focused direction by Martin Scorsese, who is undeniably the best american director working today. Raging Bull is the best movie made in quite sometime (especially since its release in 1980), and there are very few movies that can begin to scatch the surface of what it totally reveals. This film is definately not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great Acting, No Emotional Pull","De Niro was great, and the classic Italian relationship and dialogue between him and Pesci was great as well. However beyond that, this movie just did not do it for me. There was some significance to the character as we got to see someone with extreme insecurity, and OCD, but the story just had no emotional pull at all, and for a movie being made in 1980, it just came off way older than it needed to be. I wasn't a fan of the black n white in this one and I found the score to be a compilation of similar violin notes. The directing I did not find incredible but there were a couple of shots that were nice. I would say the movie was well structured as there were some thru lines, surprises, and a good ending.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Raging Bull is the greatest!!!`,"Raging Bull is what you get when you combine great acting, superb directing, subliminal camera work and editing, and superior writing.  It is hands down the best film ever made.  Frankly, I think it should be rated #1 out of 250! It is clearly the best of Scorsese's films (and he has made MANY great films).  All the actors were superb - Pesci as Joey, Cathy Moriarty as Vickie, Nicholas Colosanto (a.k.a. ""Coach"" from Cheers) as Tommy Como, and even Frank Vincent as Salvy.  And DeNiro - 'nuff said.  I mean, DeNiro is always great, but he was especially awesome in Raging Bull.  Who else would go to such lengths as to purposefully gain 50 lbs.  If I didn't know better, I'd say that DeNiro stole LaMotta's soul.... At any rate, this movie is to die for.  You cannot call yourself a film buff if you haven't seen this movie.  I'd give it six stars (out of five!). Buy it, rent it, steal it, kill for it, do anything to see it!!!",,Anonymous,Biography
Perfection!,"Raging Bull is hands-down my favorite movie of 1980. It is also the best boxing movie ever made, and it is a movie that will forever be remembered by American audiences. Martin Scorsese's film tells the true story of the unhinged boxer, Jake LaMotta (who passed away last year at the ripe old age of 95). He was a boxer who punched hard, harder, and hardest, and he went all out in the boxing ring. Outside of the ring, he was a vulnerable man especially when it came to women. He believed women to be precious virgins for his own making, and only he can take away their virginity. The movie really went deep with his character, and I love how the movie is not afraid to throw punches.This was Martin Scorsese's big passion project. After the disappointment of his 1977 feature, New York, New York, he fell into a state of depression and that triggered his drug use which almost killed him. Fortunately, this movie took him away from those dark times. He was reluctant to make this movie at first because he does not like sports. With the help of Robert De Niro, Scorsese was convinced to make the movie. He made it clear that this was his movie and he was going to make it his way. We are glad he did, because this movie ended up being an all-time great that will forever be studied in film school.Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro) is a boxer known for obliterating his opponents in the boxing ring. Outside of the boxing ring, he treats his family and friends like garbage. He is a ticking time bomb, ready to destroy the people who love him. What could be the reasons? Is it because he is constantly jealous or paranoid? Is it because his women are cheating on him? Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin brings the true story of this very violent man to life with their hard-hitting screenplay.In addition to Scorsese, this is Robert De Niro's movie. In a career spanning nearly half a century, this is his role you will remember him by. His convincing portrayal of Jake LaMotta is one of the best acting performances ever, and it earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. I also loved his commitment to the role. He famously stopped production for several months so he can go on a binge-eating tour of Europe to increase his weight necessary for the role. Joe Pesci who played LaMotta's brother Joey was also great. Pesci actually gave up on acting prior to this role, but De Niro convinced him to play this role. I am glad because this also ranks as Pesci's finest performance to date.Another component I value about the movie is the look and the editing process of the film. The film is made in black and white and it adds realism to the movie. Scorsese also changed the way boxing movies were made. He was the first director to film the fight scenes inside the ring. That allowed us to see the emotions of the fighters. It also gave us a very brutal, unflinching view of the fights. Scorsese isn't afraid to show blood. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing ranks at one of the all-time's best. You won't find a better-edited film anywhere else.Raging Bull is one of those films that you will dissect in film school. There are layers upon layers to the film, and one could spend years trying to understand it. As much as I enjoy watching Ordinary People and its theme of PTSD, this is the film that ultimately should have won best picture. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro crafted one of those rare films that could be defined as perfect.My Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scorsese's heart and soul rolled into one film,"When you have an already top-notch director (like Martin Scorsese) who wants to put it all into one film because it may be his very last, you have a classic, which has been made with the director's heart and soul. Because of Scorsese's fatal drug addiction, he didn't expect much more and he didn't expect to get back on track. While making Raging Bull while he suffered from the addictions, he was more than on track and he was more than on top of the game. Scorsese put on a master work as he skillfully developed enough will and strength to make Raging Bull, in the top 100 here at IMDb. This is a crown jewel, which really reminds me of Scarface (mainly because of the swearing) however, this was more meaningful than Scarface. You can't have everything when you're worried about everything. Raging Bull teaches us how easily we fall into the snares we originally set up for ourselves and how easily we fall prey to our own disasters. Scorsese has put on a lot of great films over the years and I'm looking for many more to follow from his directing. Raging Bull, I would have to say, was his best film yet if you take into account all the factors. Keep in mind, Scorsese was in a different mindset. Everyone is when thy're on drugs and I'm sure he couldn't function as well as someone he wasn't on drugs but we saw perfection from Raging Bull. We see Scorsese was also determined to prove something, to overcome the insurmountable odds that were stacked against him. However, people function better when backed into the corner. Regardless, this is still a great film, whether it be Scorsese's greatest of all time or not and we can still appreciate it regardless of how it was directed and made on.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Relentless and vivid and touching,"Raging Bull (1980)A serious, black and white look at the complicated truth of Italian American middleweight boxer, Jake La Motta. It's a boxing movie, for sure, and the boxing scenes are riveting and offputting in their violence, but it's purposeful violence, and part of the bigger picture.The real story is the rise and fall, if you can call it that, of a man. He happened to have a gift for boxing, but it could be anyone with talent who faces a corrupt world and once, just once, weakens. There are other stories that have parallels to this, certainly, from Body and Soul (1947) to Rocky (1976). And of course The Wrestler (2008) has a different sport but same fall from glory. All of these films are excellent in their own ways, and Raging Bull keeps up with the best of them. Certainly Robert De Niro, as La Motta, is astonishing in his range, covering a couple decades and gaining some serious weight toward the end, and Joe Pesci backs him up beautifully.The filming in any Martin Scorsese movie is significant, and director of photography Michael Chapman keeps the dramatic light and clean use of focus (and lack of focus) in great balance. The sound is complex and interesting (both with added sounds and intrinsic ones). But most of all the story itself, with a vivid believability, is what grips you. I'm not really comfortable with boxing (I guess people can do what they want in that regard), and so a movie about boxing that gets as rough as this one does has me cringing sometimes, even more than with most Tarantino hyper-violence. But that's part of the point. A relentless, engrossing work.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Well-made, traditional biopic about jealous, common bully and bore","Crisp period cinematography in black and white effectively transports you back to 1940s New York City with its jazzy joints, kitchen table discussions, and large enclaves of Italian-Americans. The fourth teaming of director Martin Scorsese and actor Robert De Niro sees them venturing into the biography genre for a look at the life and times of former middleweight boxing champ Jake LaMotta. With the B&W cinematography and lack of original music, Scorsese's goal was clearly for LaMotta's story to come off as raw and gritty, while at the same time differentiating his film from the prizefighter subgenre's traditional rags-to-riches arc used notably in recent successes such as Rocky and The Champ. Despite these stylistic choices, Raging Bull is nevertheless a highly traditional biopic, but the direction is economical and the story at times engaging. The Scorsese/Schrader partnership was still able to flesh out and shoot crisp dialogue at this point. Not ingenious, not snappy, but it had a naturalness to it. And it elevated and was elevated by Scorsese's two main chummies, De Niro as LaMotta and Joe Pesci as LaMotta's brother Joey. So far, so good. But as the film progresses, its main impediment becomes more and more apparent: Jake LaMotta is a rather dull character and his story never becomes anything special. He's a jealous, common bully and bore with no discernable characteristics outside of his antics in the ring. And so when the movie finally ends, you're just as happy to be rid of him as his wife Vickie ultimately was.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Incredible acting,"""Raging Bull"" is a masterpiece of filmmaking. It is entertaining, but to me, it is more of a technical movie than an entertaining movie.The acting is undescribable. Some terrific performances are featured in this film, especially Robert De Niro's performance, which is the stuff of legends. It was probably one of the most predictable Academy Awards ever that year, because Robert De Niro just blew everyone else away. Joe Pesci brings us another amazing performance. Martin Scorsese's directing is near perfect, and we are treated to great black and white cinematography. Basically everything about this movie had ""OSCAR"" stamped on its forehead.Although ""Raging Bull"" is, in a technical sense, one of the greatest movies ever made, it fails to entertain on all levels. There are many moments in the movie that are incredibly entertaining, however, there are some moments where it just seems to be too slow-paced. I am usually all for slow-paced movies, as it helps to build up the plot and the characters, but I feel that ""Raging Bull"" could have been cut short 15 or 20 minutes and it would have been more entertaining, and still just as great when it comes to all the technical aspects.Sum-up: If you are looking for some of the best acting you will ever see, look no further than ""Raging Bull.""

A symbolic masterpiece,"Though Raging Bull was based on a real-life story, like a true auteur, Scorsese shaped this film and made it his own through symbolism. The title signifies an uncontrollable rage inside the ring, which spills over into LaMotta's personal life, alienating those closest to him. The boxing arena only serves as a background for in-depth character development. The real engine that drives the movie is his jealous obsession with his wife, and fear of her sexuality. The use of fog, fluids, and LaMotta's refusal to fall in the ring expose his character, and his ultimate downfall.Scorsese introduces the fog motif in the very first shot of the film. The viewer has an objective perspective of the fog that surrounds LaMotta in his career and in his mind. When LaMotta is in the ring, the crowds are obliterated, and the only sign of them is when flashbulbs go off. When he is in the sauna sweating off the necessary four pounds, he is again surrounded by fog. The fog associated with his boxing career symbolically and visually establishes LaMotta as a very isolated individual, who does not have a grasp on reality or relate to people well. He leads an egocentric life based on his own thoughts and suspicions. His judgment becomes clouded by his paranoid fears that his wife is sleeping with other men, until he eventually believes that his brother has slept with her. In the last fight scene when he loses his middleweight title, the crowd is no longer clouded. When the judges and his wife are splattered with LaMotta's blood, the camera is in very sharp focus. This scene is followed very quickly with LaMotta's retirement as an overweight loser, the loss of his wife and children and his jail time. The fog has similarly cleared in his mind as he realizes his mistakes. He screams, `Why? Why? Why?' in his jail cell, and later apologizes to his brother, admitting that he was a bum. Scorsese links the end if the film to the beginning as LaMotta smokes a cigar and self-induced fog covers his face. He knows his downfall was his own doing.The use of fluids also links LaMotta's experience in the boxing ring to his fear of his wife's sexuality. Close ups of sweat pouring off his face emphasizes physical exertions as a substitute for sexual relations, as Vickie constantly complains that he is too busy fighting to have sex with her. The first time he sees Vickie in the pool, she is linked to a large body of pure water. After their first sexual encounter, he calms himself down with ice water. Gradually, the fluid symbol begins to transform. After he loses his first fight with Sugar Ray, the water in the bucket, with a close up of his fist, signifies his increasing anger and rage. About that time, he starts to suspect Vickie of having sex with other men. The water squeezed on him in between rounds no longer purifies him physically or symbolically, because he is becoming mentally disturbed. The water sponged on him in his last fight with Sugar Ray, at the beginning of his decline, is red from blood. He is tainted by his obsession, as is his wife when she is sprayed with his blood. Scorsese again links the elder LaMotta with his youthful boxing self by having him drink water before he goes out to recite. He is symbolically pure now that he knows his past mistakes.To LaMotta, the true sign of a man is his ability to remain standing. Scorsese consistently shows weakness lying or sitting down, and strength, power and control standing up. LaMotta stands to have his brother Joey punch him in the face. He refuses to fall when the mob tells him he has to take a fall. He knocks Sugar Ray down twice, and prides himself even after he loses the middleweight crown that Ray never knocked him down. However, while he sits in between the rounds, his brother/manager yells at him. When he sits down after the lost match with Sugar Ray, he cries, showing his weakness. He is sitting when he hangs up the phone on his brother without apologizing, and when he is in the jail cell at the time of his ultimate downfall, having lost his title and his belt in order to post bail. This pattern of domination and control only while standing extends outside of the ring to LaMotta's relationship with Vickie. He stands behind his wife, pulling her hair or slapping her. He dominates her with violence the way he would in the ring, but he is powerless on his back or sitting, demonstrating his fear of sexuality. He has to stand up to regain some control after their first encounter laying on his back, saying `What are you doing to me?' He knows that she has the real control. The first time LaMotta sees Vickie, she towers over him on the other side of the fence. She dwarfs him sitting on his lap. Scorsese shoots her going up stairs or in extreme close ups and LaMotta farther away so he seems smaller than she does. Since he feels so inferior, he resorts to violence to feel that he has control over her. Because he refused to fall in the ring, LaMotta was bound to fall outside of the ring. Fall he did, and he became a sad, pathetic, broke, lonely, overweight man.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Although he could fight, he'd much rather recite... that's entertainment","Don't be misled into thinking that Raging Bull is simply a film about boxing, à-la Rocky. It does indeed focus on the life of a boxer, but there is so much more to it then that. Rather than simply being a sports story of redemption, or something of the like, Raging Bull is one of the most startling and powerful portraits of stunted machismo ever captured on film. De Niro, following up on other such personas of tough guy losers, gives arguably his strongest performance here as Jake La Motta, who slowly but surely tore down everything he had managed to accumulate around him, including a marriage, relationships with all those close to him, and his hard won boxing career. De Niro is clearly the center of attention here, and he lives up to his reputation with wonderful flair, his performance is one of the most deserving of his Oscar in history.But don't go thinking this is a one man show, although De Niro's electrifying performance is easily the highlight of the movie, once again, there's so much more to it then that. For one thing, the technical genius of director Martin Scorsese, whose bold decision to shoot the film in black and white paid off immensely, giving the film a stark, bold look, almost like an old photograph, lost in the depths of time. It's really a shame more movies aren't shot in black and white these days, in today's colour saturated world, the occasional flash devoid of colour can come as quite the relief.The legendary fight scenes are also incredible, with Scorsese determined to get his cameras directly in the middle of the action, instead of simply watching from a distance. We as an audience genuinely seem to feel every bone jarring punch, which really helps us sympathize with La Motta, rather than creating an antagonist out of the character. In fact, one of the most praiseworthy aspects of the film is Scorsese's ability to maintain a completely balanced view of the character, never taking sides to present him as a hero or a villain - a flawed lead in all cases. Even at times of spousal abuse and such, when we are genuinely meant to hate the character, we still realize exactly what in La Motta's troubled psyche is making him do such a thing, and still, somehow manage to empathize with the character.Although the film really does belong to De Niro, he is ably supported by numerous similarly phenomenal supporting performances. Joe Pesci gives a terrific performance as La Motta's brother who also falls prey to Jake's increasing paranoia and aggression. The scene between Jake and Joey with Jake continually challenging his brother to hit him as hard as he can is one of the most powerful in the movie. Cathy Moriarty is also memorable as La Motta's 15 year old trophy girlfriend, who, even though at one point being the one person he could trust, also finds herself pushed away by the boxer's growing distrust of everyone. These two fantastic performances provide excellent backup for the incredible De Niro.All in all, it seems fair to say Raging Bull is one of the most powerful and well made films in film history - with Martin Scorsese establishing himself as a master director, and Robert De Niro giving an astonishingly affecting performance, perhaps the strongest of his career, driving the stunted machismo mood of the film home.

The best boxing movie EVER!!,"Jake La Motta's life is told through Martin Scorsese's boxing masterpiece. Coming off De Niro and Scorsese's brilliant Taxi Driver, Raging Bull is possibly the best boxing movie ever made. Yes, it is better than Rocky! While Rocky had considerable flare and was a very good movie overall, it can't hold up to the brilliant portrayal of La Motta and his rise to fame. Raging Bull puts both of the (more than solid) new films Million Dollar Baby and Cinderella Man to shame. These movies (including Rocky) may depict boxing more realistically but then again that's part of the beauty of Raging Bull - it's rough and unpolished...making it that much more realistic overall. Joe Pesci is the perfect counterpart to De Niro - taking considerable burdens off De Niro and letting him craft La Motta in a way not seen in today's movies. How De Niro managed to transform himself as much as he did in this movie is a mystery to me, but it is further proof of his brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scorsese's Anti-Rocky.,"Considered by many as Scorsese's finest film and even as one of the greatest films of all time, this autobiography of the pugilist Jake LaMotta (played by De Niro with utmost intensity) was not about his fights inside the ring but inside his paranoid, inarticulate, and jealous mind. After a disappointing turn in their last film together that almost ended the director's life, the one-two punch duo of star and director returned in the screen with force and bravura, earning Scorsese his first Oscar nomination for Best Director and De Niro his second Oscar win.One of the many reasons this film worked is because the themes that Scorsese had dealt with in his more personal films are present here, blending his style with a brilliant black-and-white photography from Michael Chapman, and Schoonmaker's Oscar winning work in the editing room.""Raging Bull"" is the anti-Rocky, although Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff who both produced the uplifting boxing saga re-united here, in a bleak high contrast black-and-white film about a former contender who ends up as a bloated washed-up nightclub owner.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Raging Bull: A Raw Portrait of Redemption,"""Raging Bull"" charts the checkered life of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta, whose steely determination in the ring intersects with his complicated personal life. The film follows LaMotta's rise to fame and his subsequent struggles with jealousy, anger, and self-destruction, ultimately delving into themes of masculinity and redemption. In addition to capturing the brutality of boxing, Scorsese's direction masterfully captures the emotional ups and downs of LaMotta. The film's brutal reality is enhanced by Michael Chapman's black-and-white photography, which further heightens the tense mood. A masterpiece of a performance, De Niro faithfully reenacts LaMotta's journey through abrupt weight shifts. The film's editing, particularly in the boxing sequences, is superb; it puts the audience right in the thick of the mayhem and thrill of the sport. Especially for the many competition and training clips in the movie, they reminded me of the passion I had when I learned boxing and watched boxing matches, and also aroused my resonance with the struggle and hardship. The movie does, however, occasionally drag on since it concentrates more on the character development than on extended action sequences.""Raging Bull"" is a profound character study that explores the intricacies of the human psyche rather than merely being a sports film. Many competitive or sports-related movies often use delicate characterizations to show the protagonist's spirit of striving for progress and never giving up. This is also the part that can most impress the audience. Watching the performances is highly recommended, especially De Niro's. This movie is definitely worth seeing for people who appreciate a profound and emotional narrative technique, even though the film's weighty subjects may not be for everyone. ""Raging Bull"" is a timeless work that has lasting force. It is not just an intriguing biographical picture but also a profound investigation of inner battle and salvation, thanks to excellent performances and outstanding art direction. This movie is a must-see for anybody who is curious about the subtleties of filmmaking or the complexity of the human experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"an unflinching portrait, superlative in every way","There are boxing movies, and then there's the film that may well prove to be director Martin Scorsese's masterpiece; a tough call, given the level of excellence throughout his career. It may or may not be, as many critics have claimed, the best Hollywood feature of the 1980s(actually, it was released in the last year of the 1970s), but the visceral impact of the film is undeniable. Some people may (understandably) not see many virtues in a biography of middleweight champ Jake LaMotta, a man so filled with violence and jealousy that he tormented everyone, including himself, both in and out of the ring. But through Scorsese's fluid direction and Robert De Niro's intense (almost frightening) performance a portrait emerges of a beast who, beneath the rage, is at least halfway human, if never entirely sympathetic. It may not be a pretty picture (despite the stunning black and white photography and Oscar winning editing), but it's certainly a powerful one. Surprisingly, De Niro himself wrote the (uncredited) final, decisive draft of what, before, was a trouble-prone (for obvious reasons) screenplay.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"One of De Niro's Most Powerful Performances,","Raging Bull is a great movie with a really well developed storyline and a terrific cast. The movie is mostly a great watch because of Robert De Niro's absolutely outstanding performance, he owns this character from start to finish, delivering an honest, sincere and real role that makes it very clear why he is one of the most successful actors of all time. I honestly don't think it comes near to be being Martin Scorsese's best film, it is very character driven, more so than the majority of his films are, which is fine but it isn't entirely exciting the whole way through, delivering little of the violence I've come to expect from Scorsese. Stunning performances and a superb script, I would recommend Raging Bull to anyone looking for a good sports drama.A boxer with a huge temper begins to isolate himself from the people around him.Best Performance: Robert De Niro",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Better than average,"Boy, did this guy have a great relationship with women, he could single handily start the feminist movement.  At least this movie is honest.

My only regret about watching this film is that I've realised that I'm a fool to have not watched it any earlier.,"As a young man, I've always enjoyed a Martin Scorsese picture. Always admiring ""Casino"" and my personal favourite film ""Goodfellas"", however I never actually got round to watching ""Raging Bull"" until today, despite countless recommendations, and believe me I'm glad I finally have.I think that this may be Scorsese's best work, the directing, the script, the acting... everything about it is brilliant. It builds the characters well to the point where even their most ridiculous actions are ones you can believe. He took a massive risk by filming this movie in black and white, however it pays off brilliantly as I don't think it would feel anywhere as real if it was in colour - the touch of having home videos in colour was also a lovely touch. Some of the shots in this piece just left me with a big grin on my face, they are so clever in how they are done.As for the acting, like I mention above, it was amazing. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci did fantastic jobs at their roles and seeing their development throughout the film, both physically and mentally, is quite an experience in itself. De Niro plays LaMotta in such a way that you feel for and against the character, you cheer him on, laugh at his undeniable charisma yet at the same time resent him for what he does to his wife, Vicky, and himself over the years. You can feel hope fade throughout the story and really feel something.If you haven't watched ""Raging Bull"" yet, I advise you do as it's a great piece of cinema. My only regret about watching this film is that I've realised that I'm a fool to have not watched it any earlier.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

What do you do with a bull?  You get him in the ring...,"It seems fairly self-evident to me, but at least one review I've read has tried to write otherwise: This isn't a boxing movie. We see a few fights, but the result that goes into the record books isn't as important as the mental toll taken by the running battles waged outside the ring. What it's implied that boxing meant to Jake La Motta is a release of all the pent up frustration and insecurities that destroy his relationships. Pugilism is a healthy, controlled outlet for his anger, but remove him from that sporting environment and he's as dangerous as a bull would be if it began roaming the streets...It is entirely likely that there are no excuses to explain the development of such a man. Perhaps the best thing to do when you realise you have a time-bomb on your hands is to try to plot the path which will cause least destruction, channeling that force and at least putting it to some kind of purpose. Gaining admiration for such a volatile personality probably wasn't high on the list of priorities going into production. It's a despairing situation to document, but an unflinching and fascinating one at that. This is raw celluloid power, restrained for our study as best as can be done.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

He beats his wife, his brother, he's very dominating over his wife ( I can't believe she stayed so long with a b****rd like that). I was hoping he would loose his matches, that they would finally call the police during the whole film. It just isn't my kind of thing I guess.

"""Raging Bull"" is top-notch film-making","After Martin Scorsese finally won an academy award for directing the Hong Kong remake of ""Infernal Affairs"" called ""The Departed,"" this reviewer decided to watch one of Scorsese's known classics. That title was ""Raging Bull."" Is the movie as good as many people have been calling it? Is it overrated? Read this review and find out.""Raging Bull"" is based off of Jack LaMotta's autobiography called ""Raging Bull: My Story."" This movie focuses on the life and career of boxer Jake LaMotta. Jake's rage and violence made him nearly unstoppable in the boxing ring. Unfortunately, that same anger also drives Jake to beat his wife and his brother Joey and ultimately sends Jake down a self-destructive spiral of paranoia and rage.""Raging Bull"" is an amazing film. Everything about this film just screams classic. Scorsese decision to shoot the film in black and white was genius. It is a shame that it is rare to see a modern day film shot in black and white. Thelma Schoonmaker, who edited many of Scorsese's films, edited this film fabulously, especially during the boxing scenes. What makes the movie so great is that it is not just a boxing movie, like ""Rocky,"" but also a study of humanized flaws created by their own insecurities.The acting in this film is fantastic. The acting is some of the best this reviewer has seen. Of course, everybody will be talking about Robert De Niro's performance, as Jack LaMotta, and it is for good reason. Another solid performance was from Joe Pesci as Jack's brother, and manager, Joey. The most underrated, and surprising, performance was from, only nineteen years of age at the time, Cathy Moriaty as Vicky.Overall, if you want to watch one of the best movies of all time, go check this out. If you are looking for a ""Rocky"" clone, just re-watch ""Rocky"" again. Martin Scorsese definitely was robbed, as far as an academy award, and it is a shame because this is a fantastic film. See this film; you will probably not be disappointed. ""Raging Bull"" is top-notch film-making. ""Raging Bull"" is extremely recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Where you can almost feel the anger of this very angry fighter.,"Discussion – and argument – will no doubt persist about ""so-and-so is the greatest fighter of all time."" Does it make any sense, except perhaps to stimulate conversation, to keep comparing prize fighters? The only certainty, in this context, is this: if you like boxing and want to see one of the best films ever made about the business, then this is for you.Because, not only will you hear one of the best scripts put to film, see some of the finest acting on film and watch scenes from the explosive career of a boxing legend, you'll also see another of Martin Scorsese's expert work as director. If you shy away from truly crude language, however, you probably won't abide the continual use of the F-word and the sexually explicit language between husbands and wives, and particularly that between Jake (Robert de Niro) and Vicky (Cathy Moriaty).It's all in context, though, and realistically portrays the culture of New York of the 1940s and 1950s. Anyway, for today's younger audience, it's no big deal, that's for sure, to hear such language all the time, just about anywhere now.Jake, as many know, was a hard-headed man: hard in the ring, and hard on his women (and men) with whom he dealt. So, yes, there is much domestic violence that serves as a mirror for the violence that continues in the ring; and where Jake can obviously work off a lot of that anger, a dominant aspect throughout the story, together with Jake's insecurities that feed his jealousies. Robert de Niro is probably the only actor at that time who could have performed the role. So, like Casablanca (1942), Citizen Kane (1941), Hud (1963) and a few others, I wouldn't expect anybody to ever attempt a remake of this masterpiece.Mention must be made of Joe Pesci as Jake's brother, Joey, and his manager for much of his boxing career. Joe Pesci is so natural and powerful an actor, I think he is the only one, I think, who can steal a scene from de Niro. For example, have a look at Goodfellas (1990), one of the greatest gangster flicks ever made (from Scorsese, again).Back to The Bull, however...The rest of the supporting cast is without fault. The photography – black and white, my favorite – editing and sound are superb; and the sound track with much classical music is the cherry on top (for me).For an interesting comparison, try Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956) with Paul Newman portraying Rocky Graziano, another middleweight fighter who was a contemporary of Jake LaMotta's. It's almost amazing to me that the two fighters never had a bout together, but they both fought – and lost – against the same man: Sugar Ray Robinson, still the only fighter to win world welter and middle weight titles. Robinson, for the record, is also still regarded as the greatest boxer of all time (so far).Even more interesting is that, according to one online source, Jake LaMotta and Rocky Graziano were boyhood friends and both spent time at the same correctional facility.I recommend Raging Bull as the better, and more gritty movie, but Paul Newman's effort still stands up to scrutiny.May 14, 2011",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Masterpiece; Raging Bull Will Floor You,"Raging Bull is the epitome of a masterpiece on every single imaginable level. I can't do anything other then rave about how brilliant the film is. Martin Scorsese's captures the feel of the 40's and 50's, and directs some of the best boxing films to ever grace the big screen. Robert De Niro is brilliant, Joe Pesci is excellent as the boxer/mentor to Jake Lamotta. The rest of the cast is great. This movie will knock you out of your seat. The intro is probably one of the best beginnings to any film. Incredibly poignant scene of Jake Lamotta gracefully dancing around the ring as big bold letters of Raging Bull appear on the top right of the screen.When it comes to Raging Bull, there really isn't anything bad to say about it. It's a in-depth character study of an intense, aggressive, jealous, sexually frustrated man who causes great pain to those around him. Everything from the script, to what Martin Scorsese turned into a brilliantly, sometimes hauntingly, depiction of a middleweight fighter is done so perfectly. It's no wonder that Raging Bull jumped about 20 spots to land as the 4th greatest American film ever made. It's arguably the best, and it's certainly De Niro, Pesci, and Scorsese at their most magical moment together. 10/10",,Anonymous,Biography

"""I'm not an animal""","Raging Bull, perhaps Martin Scorsese's first fully mature film, sees him taking on a similar task to that of Orson Welles when he made Citizen Kane  that is, to take a very public figure and strip away the layers of myth, hype and stereotyping to reveal the human being. In this case, Scorsese set himself the great challenge of creating something poignant and lyrical out of the harsh and violent life of a professional boxer.As with Citizen Kane (and Lawrence of Arabia, and many other great biopics), Scorsese begins his story with the end result  what La Motta eventually became  then resets to the beginning of his career, and eventually coming full circle. It was probably with this picture Scorsese discovered his forte for the biopic or real-life picture. It's not generally acknowledged, but round about half of Scorsese's features after Raging Bull would either be biographies or at least based upon real events and characters. It was this goal of telling an unknown story and revealing the real person that drove these pictures, and it began here with Raging Bull.As I said, the job was particularly difficult here  it's not easy to create a sympathetic portrait of a paranoid, short-tempered, misogynist brute, but Scorsese appears to have managed it, perhaps more through technique than anything else. First of all, this is Scorsese at his most subjective. There are numerous point-of-view shots, but they are not just there to show what a character is looking at. Scorsese uses his own blend of expressionist techniques  slow motion, blocking out parts of the sound track and emphasising others  to show state of mind. A good example is La Motta's predatory ogling of Vicky the first time he lays eyes on her. Many of these techniques he perfected in Taxi Driver, but equally important in his development up to this point is 1977's New York New York, the most overlooked of Scorsese's pictures. In New York New York Scorsese became more adept with the musical elements of his films  you can see that from opening credits, where he slows down De Niro's aggressive posturing to fit the music until it comes to resemble ballet more than boxing. New York New York gave Scorsese more confidence in telling a story that spans several years, and how to make transitions that convey that passage of time.Of course the fight scenes are the heart of Raging Bull, and they are real tour-de-forces of technique. Scorsese's policy of keeping the camera in the ring and thus keeping the audience inside the experience of the fight was probably in part influenced by Hitchcock's silent boxing drama The Ring (1928), but I'm also very much reminded of a very different film, The Red Shoes. The Red Shoes, one of Scorsese's favourite films, features an extended ballet sequence in which the camera is inside the performance on the stage, and it is has that similar effect of putting us in the performers shoes. Having said all that, probably the greatest contributor to the Raging Bull fights was editor Thelma Schoonmaker (who coincidentally later married Red Shoes director Michael Powell), since its that editing  not just of the fighters but split second flashes of spectators, cameras and the bell  that has the most impact here. Schoonmaker rightly won an Oscar for her efforts.As for the actors, well, for my money Robert De Niro is not a great actor, merely a good one. To be honest I think he mostly attracts attention by the lengths he goes to in preparation for a role, learning professional boxing and getting fat on pasta for Raging Bull being perhaps the most extreme example. More interesting here is the discovery of Joe Pesci. He's one of the few really great character actors of modern cinema, and everything a character actor should be. Cathy Moriarty is also very good as Vicky, and it's a mystery to me why she more or less disappeared as a major actor after this.Raging Bull is an impressive film, one of the later landmarks of the biopic genre, as well being the last word on boxing movies (although sadly they went on making Rocky sequels all the same). It also revitalised Scorsese's career and launched those of several previously unknown actors. It's not the most watchable of Scorsese's pictures but is one of his most significant.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

He completely immerses himself into the role and at times you forget your watching an actor playing a part, Robert De Niro IS Jake La Motta. The supporting cast is also very strong especially Joe Pesci in one of his early roles. Scorcese pulls no punches in his depiction of the boxer, he is a loathsome, hateful and selfish man but you can't help but feel a little sorry for him when you see him at the end with his bloated self.

The pinnacle of the DeNiro/Scorsese collaborations.,"Martin Scorsese is the epitome of the modern filmmaker. My idol if you will. The guy puts his all into everything he touches. His energy and attention to detail are rarely matched. And he consistently churns out one solid movie after another, with even his lesser works [(Gangs of New York (2002), Shutter Island (2010)] standing out above almost everything else that comes out in terms of quality. While his movies are consistently solid even if not always perfect, more than a few have stood out as timeless, essential classics that will forever go down in film history. Goodfellas (1990) and Taxi Driver (1976) are widely noted as being arguably the greatest films of their respective decades. His greatest masterpiece, Raging Bull (1984), follows in this tradition. It's the best movie of the 80's.Scorsese brings us the life of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta, one of the least likable protagonists in cinematic history, in a way that makes us fully sympathize with him. That alone is a testament to Scorsese's power as a director, but it's also no coincidence that Scorsese's holy trinity all star Robert DeNiro. Without DeNiro, there'd be no Raging Bull, literally and figuratively. This is a passion project between two friends that went a long way, and that passion shows in every beautifully crafted image. And Robert DeNiro's performance is the stuff of legends, easily one of the top five performances ever caught on film. If LaMotta had been played by anyone else, he most likely would have come off as a soulless thug, not worth caring about. DeNiro plays it differently.Jake LaMotta is a born champion in the boxing ring, with a knack for fiercely annihilating his opponents. He is becoming a true star in the sport. Life should be good. But it isn't, and it never really has been. Jake LaMotta is a completely insecure and self-destructive individual with a brutal temper. His friends and family, though they care about him, are always on their toes and watching what they say around him. His emotional instability causes him to destroy his relationships with everyone close to him. He truly thinks that he loves his wife, Vickie, and she honestly wants to see the good in him. His brother Joey stands by him, isn't afraid of him, and tries to keep him in line while managing his boxing career. But when Jake begins to suspect that Joey and Vickie are having an affair, the rage that leads him to the top in the ring begins to seep into his personal life, worse so than ever before. It may even mean the last straw for the eternally patient Joey.The story works because it explores the soul of a hopeless misanthrope without judging him. You feel like you better understand certain people after experiencing Raging Bull. Jake is as three- dimensional as characters come. Despite his inability to be a good person, his desire to do good is always clear. So is Jake a bad person? More a pathetic one. He's his own worst enemy, and that's why we can't completely fault him. This is what Scorsese and DeNiro clearly understood. The movie doesn't tell you what to think of him, and DeNiro doesn't play it any certain way. Raging Bull simply is LaMotta's life, and DeNiro is LaMotta.Contrary to popular belief, Raging Bull isn't really a ""boxing movie."" The boxing scenes occupy only a few minutes of screen time, and there is no big match to determine the fate of the characters. It's a character movie, and boxing is the only thing that keeps the character going. As far as the fight scenes go however, they are as good as they've ever been done. The black and white cinematography compliments them very well. It emphasizes the splattering blood which appears as black and thick as Hershey's syrup. Also different from other boxing dramas is the lack of crowd participation in the fights. Rather than focus equally on the drama in and out of the ring, Scorsese's camera puts you right in the ring with the fighters. Every punch is felt, and as brief as they are, the scenes leave you feeling bruised. They're as raw as it gets.I could pontificate on this movie's endless list of quality attributes for pages and pages. I'll close by saying that Raging Bull is quite possibly the greatest movie from the greatest living filmmaker. It's cinematic art at it's highest form, a tone poem, a character study, and a biography all flawlessly rolled into one majestic package. Unless you're offended by raw language and uncensored depictions of the uglier side of life, there's essentially nothing to complain about when it comes to Raging Bull. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A more restrained, less full-throated bull than I'd expected","Here, in a nutshell, is why ""Raging Bull"" must renounce its claim to being a great movie: Jake's monologue at the end.  It was lifted word for word from ""On the Waterfront"".  It's not plagiarism: Jake is quoting, and we know he's meant to be quoting, from a movie he's seen, but that's the problem - those quotation marks.  Had they been FAKE quotation marks, had Jake been quoting some non-existent movie, all might have been well.  Had there been NO quotation marks, all might have been well.  (It's not Scorsese's fault if the most fitting words Jake could possibly utter turn out to have already been used back in 1954; if the words fit seamlessly into his movie just as well as into the earlier one, he should simply steal them, and leave the attribution of credit for the fine print at the end.)  The trouble is that when it comes time for a moment of truth ""Raging Bull"" is unable to speak for itself.  Its reach exceeds its grasp - it's as simple as that.There are things IMPRESSIVE about the film, like the brilliantly edited fight sequences, and De Niro's performance.  The extended scene in which Jake suspects his wife of having sex with his brother is electrifying.  But in context these aren't enough to sustain us.  The fight sequences are interludes: over quickly, the outcome obvious from the first second, they're one-sentence summaries of the true dramatic action, which take place outside the ring.  As they should be; but this means that they can't carry the film on their own however brilliant they may be (and they ARE brilliant).  And DeNiro's performance needs something solid to spark off, which neither the story nor the other characters provides.Another problem: it isn't really a black and white film.  It's TINTED monochrome.  (I can think of only one instance of Technicolor monochrome actually working: the afterlife sequences in ""A Matter of Life and Death"". There was no tinting.  I think there's a good reason why tinted monochrome vanished off the face of the Earth in the late 1920s, while films were still being ROUTINELY made in black and white in the 1960s.)  The title was in red, and some home movie sequences were in faded colour.  This half-hearted use of colour just looked weak.  Make up your mind: colour, black and white, or (if you're certain you know what you're doing) a combination of both. Not, for God's sake, a BLEND.I was let down when ""Raging Bull"" turned out to be no more than an above average Scorsese potboiler, with some outstanding elements.  I really wanted it to be the great film so many people say it is.  A cinematic hero of mine, Michael Powell, greatly admired it, and to some degree inspired it.  I wish it were worthy of him.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scorsese and Di Nero's unbeatable one-two punch.,"Robert Di Nero wins his Oscar early and often as Jake Lamotta in Martin Scorcese's bio of the former middleweight boxing champion, Raging Bull. Di Nero pulls no punches as he gives one of the most unsympathetic portrayals of an actual living person ever shown on screen. From the buff middleweight in his prime to a punchy nite club entertainer Di Nero delivers the most brutal male performance in American film since Brando's Stanley Kowalski in Streetcar.La Motta, an up and coming boxer is finding it hard to get a title shot by not paying respect to local mob figures. Possessing a volcanic temper and more than a hint of paranoia he is incapable of settling any matters without his fists. Violent both inside and outside the ring he slowly erodes the loyalty of his wife and manager brother with his paranoid outbursts and physical beatings. Never has a fighter been more deserved of his nick name than this raging bull.Providing a magnificent stage for this uncaged animal, Martin Scorsese is unrelenting in his depiction of La Motta and the ""sweet science"". Moving and jabbing with slow mo and jump cut he vividly conveys the brutality of the sport so graphically that it could make the case for its abolishment. In color it would be unwatchable. In the skillful hands of Scorsese though it becomes blood drenched poetry. From the Cavalara Rusticana serenading of La Motta shadow boxing, tightly edited fight scenes depicting the fury, to his meticulous detail of flesh and fluids Scorsese moves his film along gracefully as well as with force. The tracking shot that follows Jake from his dressing room to the center of the ring for his title fight against Marcel Cerdan is one of his best not only in terms of logistics but also in the story lines eb and flow. It is the moment that La Motta has been waiting for his entire career and Scorsese beautifully allows the audience to be part of his entourage in this crowning moment. Scorsese also skillfully utilizes sound as a smooth transitional device. His use of ambient noise from tenements and the local pool as Jake pursues future wife Vicki counterpoints La Motta's ring roar confidence and momentarily softens him in this toned down arena.Joe Pesci as his manager brother and Cathy Moriarty as wife Vicki both offer splendid support as they hold their own in every scene with Di Nero. Battered but tough in their own way they soldier on as long as they can with the impossible Jake whose biggest fight remains with himself.This is the best of all Scorsese/Di Nero teamings and probably the best work they ever did individually. It is a tough watch that may have you checking yourself for bruises and blood splatter as you leave the theatre but their is no denying its mesmerizing form and brilliant performance. Raging Bull is a winner by unanimous decision.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's not a boxing film!,"Yep, that's right. Raging Bull is not a film about boxing, but a boxer. Fight footage actually takes up very little of the movie. Yet, it casts a huge shadow over boxing movies to this day.Firstly, there's De Niro's truly mesmerising performance. I don't consider Raging Bull to be his best film (that's Goodfellas) but it's certainly his best performance. De Niro excels at playing flawed characters, and La Motta is no exception. Jake may be one of the toughest SOB's around but essentially, he's a very insecure man, always paranoid that his beautiful wife is playing away, trusting no-one. He gives one of his opponents a sound beating because his wife dared to say he was good looking. Not to mention attacking his own brother. Bobby's total immersion in the character is amazing, he IS Jake. And he doesn't try to sugarcoat or gloss over the fact that Jake is... not a great guy. Also, he took the Method acting to another level. Obviously, he wasn't the first actor to bulk up for a role, but he was the first to take it to such extremes. Now you have the likes of Christian Bale constantly gaining and losing weight, but Bobby set the standard. Also, he trained professionally as a fighter. Believe me, boxing training ain't easy. Apparently he got really good, as well. Since then lots of respected thesps - Washington, Day-Lewis, Crowe - have played pugilists and all have trained with professionals. All thanks to De Niro.Scorsese's bravura direction deserves mention, of course. How he consistently got these performances out of De Niro is a wonder. The brutality of the boxing (and many non-boxing) scenes is something else. His decision to shoot in black and white but with modern cinema techniques makes for a very arresting film. Some of the cinematography is just incredible. The opening, the Sugar Ray fight...Marty lost out on the best director Oscar to Robert Redford for Ordinary People that year, which also beat Raging Bull to Best Picture but time has proved which is the better movie.Joe Pesci's finest moment may have been some years off yet (Goodfellas, again!) but he is totally believable as Jake's brother. He is likable and for the most part level-headed, so it's really tough to watch the part where Jake really beats him over a misunderstanding. Equally tough is Jake's lame, but genuine attempt to reconcile. And whatever happened to Cathy Moriarty? She's excellent here.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Classic!,"Well what can I say about this movie!, It is my favorite film and one of the finest ever made. It was voted the best film of the 80's and rightfully so. Everything about this Raging Bull is top drew. From the directing to the actors it lives long in the memory. The film in black n white works well, Robert De Niro gives an awsome and memorable performance as troubled boxer Jake LaMotta and gains 50 pounds along the way to play the older Lamotta and easily deserved the best actor Oscar that year for his work. His acting in this movie is what all great actors should be compared to. There is strong support from Joe Pesci (always good to watch) as Jake's brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty who plays Jake's beautifull long suffering wife Vickie in her film debut, its hard to believe she was just 18 at the time. And what can you say about Martin Scorsese the guy is simply a genius and it is possible that he has directed the best film of 3 decades. Taxi Driver in the 70s, Raging Bull in the 80s and Goodfellas in the 90s. I think Raging Bull is a masterpiece!Mark: 10/10",,Anonymous,Biography
DeNiro Takes It All,"Hitchcock had little respect for actors. I bet he never met Robert DeNiro. This is his magnum opus. Martin Scorsese tells the story of Jake LaMotta, a man who could be a bum and his ability to overcome his lack of talent with gut-wrenching drive to fight his way to the top. In addition to DeNiro's benchmark acting performance, this film has some of the most outstanding cinematography that has ever been seen. The fight scenes are like ballet; for example, using the Air on a G String as the two fighters pummel one another. This is true genius. We get to see the humanity of LaMotta, a complex, somewhat violent man, carefully configured before our eyes. The use of black and white also gives us a sense of the 1940's boxing movies and then steps them up for us. There is a kind of starkness that never detracts from the endgame.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
You talking' to him?,"In one of their many collaborations, Martin Scorsese directed Robert DeNiro in ""Raging Bull"", about self-destructive 1940s boxer Jake LaMotta. The way that DeNiro gets into the role is almost beyond belief. The viewer understands that LaMotta was an angry lunatic, but can't help but sympathize with him. Still, we can see how his jealousy ruined him: if he even saw a man touch his wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty), he would explode, seeing the situation as a threat to his machismo. It's impressive how DeNiro gained all that weight to play the older LaMotta of reduced status. Equally as intense as DeNiro as Joe Pesci as Jake's brother Joey, who had his own problems.All in all, I don't think that anyone can deny that DeNiro deserved Best Actor for this movie. Watching it, you feel like you just got your face pounded in by LaMotta himself. Was this DeNiro's and Scorsese's best collaboration ever? Hard to say, since they had so many great ones. But ""Raging Bull"" is certainly up there. It's an experience that you'll never forget. And believe me, you shouldn't forget it, because this is a great movie.Anyone feel like boxing now?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The film is brutal and brutally honest in equal measure; a terrifically terrifying slice of hard edged drama featuring a number of talents quite arguably at their peak.,"We begin with the titular Raging Bull gearing up before a contest, not one inside of ring but just prior to one of his stage duels in which he takes on the audience telling stories and anecdotes that pull in the crowds and the money. The man is Robert De Niro 's Jake La Motta; it's 1964, and after the brief practising of several lines to himself speaking of how he remembers every hit and every knock down and practically every detail of his in-ring boxing career, we dart back to 1941 to where it all began. With the benefit of hindsight, we're able to recall a number of other characters portrayed by De Niro in other Scorsese films in the form of Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, and the memorable monologues they brought about, before arriving at the conclusion this character we're observing here and now for the first time may very well be as disturbed as the other two in said examples. When La Motta speaks, there's a sense of specificity or intrinsics about the man's verbal confirmation of living his boxing life to the full, and the ability to take in the more minute details of what unravelled in the ring; Martin Scorsese's film eventually coming to resemble an inmost and often distressingly intrinsic study of this man's life from his young adult years to entering old age.Scorsese doesn't doubt as to whether La Motta was a champion, without Scorsese's film one might champion him as a magnificent physical specimen and a champion athlete, but the manner as to which La Motta went about attaining this reputation, it seems and particularly at one point, sees him mercilessly hammer away at an opponent in a manner fuelled by hallucinations; scociopathic tendencies and mass hysteria that his wife, a long suffering Vickie (Moriarty) 'likes' the man he's fighting. But the film is as much a tale of the man outside of the ring as it is a tale of the man inside; how he came to be as aggressive and ruthlessly efficient as he was and how balancing that duality between an on-stage and off-stage persona through his aggression and anger became blurred and difficult to balance out. Raging Bull's immediate opening is a tranquil, beautiful almost, passage of slow motion as La Motta occupies the ring alone to some angelic music; that sense of it being of the picturesque sort and that La Motta truthfully belonged in the ring amidst everything else comes to feel prominent. In and around the scuzzy living of New York in whatever year, as the loitering with the sorts of people La Motta hangs with features more and more, the locale or space of the boxing ring comes to represent a very harmonious and very magnificent zone in which he totally finds his element and makes his name. It is a place of violence and often bloodshed, to La Motta through Scorsese's eyes, it was a small squared zone in which the lead was at one with himself.The film covers his life and times, his friends and foes; his wife and her hardships as well as his brother in Joey (Pesci), a man whom appears to be the only one capable of talking any degree of sense into the lead but additionally someone who has his own problems with violence and misogyny. When Jake first sees his wife to be, she's lounging beside a pool on a warm day under the careful watch of some local organised criminals; the very same ones La Motta had previously had a problem with in a local gym and whom verbally illustrate how they dealt with another man whom himself tried to woo young Vickie. La Motta, being the man he is, steps in regardless and thus instigates a relationship through casual small-talk and sessions of mini-golf.Vickie comes to represent the result of most of Jake's pent up rage, the immense paranoia twinned with gross levels of suspicion constantly threatening to destroy their coming together. At once, I criticised the film previously for not exploring their coming together enough and berated the lack of any substantial material believable enough to force them together. Viewing it again; it seems the film, in all its hostile ugliness, was always more concerned with how it was the lead tore their relationship apart what with his actions than it was ever interested in the stuff that borough them both harmoniously together. It is, however, the two brothers that the film produces some of the more magnificent moments of dialogue and exchange, a telling moment about where Scorsese's chief interests lie in the tale of Jake outside of the ring occurs during an instance in which he kisses his future wife on a date before moving off screen to further embrace. But the camera does not follow as one might expect, instead lingering on the mantle-piece that they were stood in-front of which now occupies the foreground upon which a photo of Joey and Jake together stands. The film here infers that the bond between the two brothers is the strongest of the film, if there is a stone-wall relationship between two people in the film, it is that of Jake and his brother; the reminding it is they whom argue and bicker and squabble like the couple they are.Raging Bull plays, for mostly all of its runtime, a lot like his 1973 film Mean Streets; the core change pushing it off down a very different framework that there happens to be a prize fighting boxer in and amongst the low-lives of which the film centralises on. The film is both peppered and undercut with a really uneasy sense of both hostility and hatred; Scorsese embedding the piece with a seething anger which you feel might just boil over and explode and any moment whereas the result is something highly substantial in a number of fields and most certainly worthy of seeking out.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best movie ever,"Like it says in the summary line, Raging Bull is the best movie ever made. I honestly cannot think of a better looking, better directed, better acted, or more enjoyable movie to watch. The dialogue is top notch, (not as creative as say a Tarantino flick, but about as realistic as I've ever heard in a film), and not only holds your attention, but makes you laugh, cringe, and, (if you're an emotional person), maybe even cry. Directed by Martin Scorsese, it is by far his best film, and ranks him, in my mind, the best director in the industry today, (until he retires that is). I would recommend this movie to anyone, and do quite often, and hope that more people take the time to sit down and take in this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Possibly the best American picture made to date!,"If you have not yet seen this picture, or are considering... Watch this film!

Not to mention Robert De Niro's Oscar winning performance (Without a question too). Every second he is on screen is visceral, also the relationship with Joe Pesci is one of pre-21st century's best partnership.

The greatest of the fight films,"Robert De Niro gives a true tour-de-force in this, Martin Scorsese's operatic adaptation of the story of prizefighter Jake La Motta, based on his book. Shot in glorious black and white, with a terrific editing job by Thelma Schoonmaker,  the film also offers what is considered De Niro's greatest performance in a illustrious career. De Niro plays La Motta with searing realism during his years as a fighter and his days as an overweight (De Niro actually gained roughly 50 lbs. to play La Motta at that point in his life) , third-rate comedian in his own nightclub. Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty give notable performances as Joey an Vickie La Motta, Jake's brother and wife. La Motta's is a story of a man who was a champion at one time, but fell into a self-destructive state, a broken man and a failure. Scorsese's bravura comes though fully as well, telling the story of such a repulsive figure, and still turning in a piece which gives us a feel of Shakespearean tragedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""A man is his own worst enemy"". Brilliant method acting performance by Robert de Niro. Sublime photography by Michael Chapman. Scorsese Classic!","This classic gives me the shivers every time I see it. I just feel mentally exhausted and broken afterwards. In a good way though! However impressive it might be, I dont often watch ""Raging Bull"", because it is such a sad story about the doomed downfall of boxer Jake La Motta. Based on a true story, which makes it even more sad, because we viewers are shown a brilliant boxing talent fall slowly down the drain. The reason why he is doomed is portrayed with such brilliant excellence that ""Raging Bull"" is without a doubt one of the best pictures ever made by director Martin Scorsese.Praise, lots of praise has to be directed towards the terrific black and white photography by Michael Chapman. I dare say, that never before or after, there has been such a mindblowing registration of a boxing match. Michael Chapman made the mold. This photographer went on to film many other classics with his brilliant talent.If one ever wants to experience what method acting truly is, then one should only have to watch Robert de Niro's performance. The man IS a raging bull. His selfdestructive anger makes him a shortlived star and a longtime looser. So sad to see.

"How does such an awful, plot less film get Oscars?","I watched this movie because it was highly recommended and was an award winner, and because I love boxing movies, especially Rocky and Cinderella Man. What a mistake. The only thing I enjoyed about this was the actual boxing scenes, especially the one with Sugar Ray Leonard. The scenes were too short and never showed a whole fight. The story was choppy and hard to follow. And just when you thought the movie should end, it kept dragging on and on and had no defining climax or resolution. Then all of a sudden it just stopped. Very poor film-making in my opinion, and not worthy of any awards. This film was basically plot less. It would be as if you took two arbitrary points in my life and chose to make a movie about the time in between. There's no plot, it builds up to nothing, there is no climax, no final resolution, nothing at all to indicate that the end is coming. The movie just starts, and then it stops later. There's no completion, no story, no sense that it is building up to something. This would be one star if it wasn't for the amazing boxing footage.See my profile for my rating philosophy.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

How Jake LaMotta struggles between his professional aspirations & personal anger is depicted so wonderfully, that one can connect with him with ease.

"Certainly Great, just not perfect","I know, I know. 4 Stars?! I must be on something, right?This is one of the most highly regarded films of one of the most highly regarded directors starring one of the most highly regarded actors in American Cinematic History. Yet, I just find myself unable to take it from the level of a film ""I Really Like (4 Stars)"" to a film ""I Love (5 Stars)""Before I get into what it is I don't really care for in the film, allow me to rave for a few about all of the things that are great in ""Raging Bull"" just to assure you all that I am not slamming the film but do actually enjoy it.First off, De Niro is phenomenal. I personally think this is his best performance though I am not personally well acquainted with his entire body of work and wouldn't argue with anyone that put up ""Taxi Driver"" or ""King of Comedy"" as a counterpoint to my statement. La Motta (Robert De Niro, ""Taxi Driver"") is a complex character who does many terrible things to the women he loves, his brother, and especially, those around him who get on his bad side. I imagine this is a tough balancing act for Scorsese and De Niro to work out together. This guy has to be volatile enough that it doesn't seem out of character for him to act in a reprehensible way but he also has to believable as a man that a young girl could fall head over heels for and also that the audience can get on board with as the anti-hero of a film that is about the tragedy of this brute's life.The next thing that I really loved about this film was the cinematography. A lot has been written about the way that this film broke with common film conventions to get into the ring with the fighters but I would argue that the film does far more than that. The contrast between the more stable, slow paced, out of the ring portions of the film with the fast paced quick cut pounding of the match is key to one of the central motifs of the film: the ring is the heart of Jake La Motta. Outside the ring, he's all show. Inside the ring is where his life is to be found. When he feels the need to punish himself, he takes a beating in the ring. When he feels small and needs to feel big, he pounds the snot out of his opponent. His ultimate worth, in his own eyes, is found in his fighting, which is why it is so defeating to him when he finally leaves the ring behind for good. It's like he lost his heart or reason for living, especially since he has cost himself many of the relationships that people find meaning in once the world passes them by.The theme of this bastion of unhealthy masculinity and what his ways both gain and cost him is the real star of the show. As I watch, I find myself hoping that, despite the feeling I have that he will ultimately self-destruct and cost himself everything, he might find a way to back down from a fight for once, be forgiving to his wife, or not think the worst of his brother and manager, Joey (Joe Pesci, ""Casino"").So what is it about this movie that gives me pause. I'm not quite sure. It might be that you can see the end coming from the beginning and it removes a big portion of the tension for me. Maybe, it's the fact that I don't buy the idea that Vickie La Motta (Cathy Moriarty, ""Analyze That"") is even close to 14 and that seems to remove some of the taboo nature of one of the central relationships of the film. Maybe it's the fact that it wasn't till my second time watching it that I realized that those guys that want La Motta to work with them are the Mob because it was just assumed by everyone that it would be obvious. All I know is that while I like the film a lot, I'm not even a little tempted to buy it and that can only be because something about it was just off for me.Please don't let my personal weirdness deter you, though. The vast majority of cinema fans who watch this movie simply adore it and I have no doubt that, unless by some freak coincidence you have all the exact same strange hangups I do, you will find this movie a more than worthy addition to you film collection.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
DeNiro doesn't come much better than this,"(89%) You can tell that this is a Scorsese film through the sheer number of aggravated physical brawls (and not forgetting the no less aggressive verbal fights) which break out every 10 minutes or so, and that's not including any of actual boxing matches themselves. And that's this film's finest accomplishment in that Jake LaMotta isn't a nice guy (which is putting it lightly), and yet seeing him fail is no less painful or easy to witness. Predominantly this is a brilliantly well made with the black and white cinematography being more than just a gimmick as it fits into the stark tale, DeNiro I don't think has ever been better, and the use of score is some of the best in any movie.

the best film of the 80's,"At first the film made me realize just how violent, domestic violence can be. In a heart stopping scene where Jake (played by De Niro slapped his wife all over the place, Martin Scorsese made me feel that I'm useless, that I could only watch and feel ashamed. Other acts of violence in the film set the entire mood of the film. Anger floats around the whole film and the audience, the unwilling victim. In the end there's a bit of retribution and forgiveness, but it is not clear who would benefit from it. It is a great study of a man's connection with his dark side. Why can't he just walk away from it? Is it a personal choice, or is it really hard to fight it off? One will be transfixed not only by the chaotic scenes and strong dialogue, but also by the most unconventional protagonist I've seen so far in movies released in the 80's: Jake LaMotta.

"The best film ever made,a flawless masterpiece !","What are great films made of, what do they have to contain that makes them so remarkable ? A moving story, great acting, superb camerawork, exceptional sound, cleverly editing, masterful directions ? Raging bull not only contains all these elements, but its groundbreaking in all of them. Its one of the best films ever made, and as with good wine it just gets better with each passing year. What makes this black and white film so damn remarkable?When all the technical aspects of a film are used at its best to serve the initial story it creates a magic that is unexplainable. Each boxing-match is individually coreographed and edited. the camera moves in ways it never did before.  The soundeffects are heartstopping.The story is based on the life of the boxing champion Jake La Motta... the meanest sunofabich ever to have played the main character in a film (at least in the 80's), honestly played by Robet De Niro who took method acting to new hights when he decided to get fit in order to play the boxer, and then gained 30.kg to play the older fatter Jake La Motta. He gives his best performance ever, as he is able to bring out the sympathetic side of this monster.But eventually its the story that moves us... about a boxer whose life consists of fighting, but his biggest fights are the ones fought outside the ring. A man that's filled with so much self destruction that he destroys not only himself but everyone around him, his brother, wife, family.... this film just works in so many layers.

A Classic Film by even today's standards!,"Martin Scorsese, Joe Pesci, and Robert DeNiro: When these guys get together, you know something big is going to happen and this film is a perfect example of great quality. Raging Bull is Jake LaMotta's rise and fall as an athlete to a nightclub performer. I think this is the film that Joe Pesci shows that even little guys can cause the most harm. When DeNiro and Pesci play the La Motta brothers, you believe it because they have such great chemistry with each other. I don't think Pesci was ever intimidated by Scorsese or DeNiro. This film earned DeNiro his second Academy Award and you can see why. Not only is the transformation, physical but emotional and psychological as well. These characters are flawed, human, and believable with great cast of actors. Don't forget Cathy Moriarty who was discovered to play Jake's young second wife. Even at 18, she can play younger and older and believable. His second wife can be beautiful and smart but trapped in a fractured marriage. She deserved her Academy Award Nomination for Best SUpporting Actress because she can handle herself against DeNiro and we see how he fell in love with her. Don't forget Pesci's wife is played Theresa Saldana who does hold her own. This film shows that black and white can still be beautiful film work. Nicholas Colasanto from Cheers is also in the film as well in a small role. Scorsese's best films are with DeNiro and Pesci at least in my opinion. At the end of the film, I wanted to know more about these characters.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

DeNiro goes to extreme length to add to the repulsion scale, and Scorsese makes an impact with beautiful classical scores, and black and white shots which somehow seem to be better than what it would have been like in colour. This is better than Rocky and damn provocative. Even the real Jake LaMotta said DeNiro did a better job at portraying himself than he could do.

Raging Bull is 95% among critics on the Tomato Meter and 93% among voters from the general public.

A Pleasure to Watch,"This is one of the few films worthy of being called a drama. And its probably the most accurate of the ""based on a true story"" genre. Robert DeNiro has yet again proved that he is the finest American actor since Charleton Heston, for he transforms himself into his role (unlike most actors, such as Hoffman, Pacino, and Newman, who merely attempt to imitate) literally becoming the character. It should have won the Oscar for best picture and director, especially since its rivals were so blatantly inferior.For those who didnt live in New York during the 40s, this film provides some fascinating history. And its black and white filming was an ingenious method of conveying the historical context. But it doesnt end there. The late 1970s New York locations were brilliantly chosen, for anyone who watches actual 1940s film footage of New York can see how closely they resemble each other. The scenes in the boxing ring, neighborhood swimming pool, and of course the spacious nightclub were truly fabulous and nostalgic.The supporting cast all deserved to win the oscars they were nominated for. Joe Pesci was outstanding in the ""mad mobster"" role he continued in Goodfellas and Casino, and Cathy Moriarty was riveting as Jake's estranged teenage wife. Nicholas Colasanto (""Coach"" from Cheers) definitly deserved an Oscar for his sharp portrayal of Tommy Como, the benevolent mob boss who gives Jake his title shot.

Cast and crew deliver,"First of all this is a character drama, Robert DeNiro gives his best performance ever. Pesci and Moriarity fit perfectly into their roles as Jake's younger brother and Jake's wife. Without a doubt this is Scorsese's best directorial piece, everything fits perfectly. DeNiro's monologues are a piece of work, the domestic abuse scenes are extremely well done and give you a genuine scare because the way Scorsese does it is original. The fight scenes are better than Rocky and and other boxing movie, quiet scenes about the family quickly and violently erupt into the ring showing powerhouse punches and knockouts with cameras going off and blood and sweat being sprayed in every direction.9/10, DeNiro arguably gives the best performance of the 80's.

A real cinematic knockout; one of the best and one of my favorite films ever,"I'm a fan of Martin Scorsese films, including ""Taxi Driver"", ""Goodfellas"", and ""The Departed"", but ""Raging Bull"" is the best and my favorite of all his movies, as it is a real cinematic knockout, plus it's arguably Robert De Niro's best acting job. It is generally regarded as the best film of the 1980s by most critics. I actually consider it the second best of that decade, behind Sergio Leone's 4-hour long gangster epic ""Once Upon a Time in America"", also starring De Niro in the lead role.The film follows the real-life story of Jake LaMotta (De Niro, in his second Oscar-winning role), an Italian-American middleweight boxer from the Bronx, New York, who makes every effort throughout his career to get a title shot for the middleweight champion of the world. He's psychologically self-destructive and causes the people who cared about him out of his life, including his wife Vicki (Cathy Moriarty, Best Supporting Actress Oscar-nominee) and his manager brother Joey (Joe Pesci, Best Supporting Actor Oscar-nominee), because of having a violent temper and making bad choices. Thus, he threw fights and got connected with the local gangsters, involving Salvy (Frank Vincent) and mob boss Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto, Coach from the really great TV sitcom ""Cheers""). Moreover, Jake accuses and abuses Vicki, because he got the notion that she had affairs with other men, including Joey, Salvy, and Tommy. On top of that, he then gains about 60 pounds and changes from a lean, mean fighting machine to an overweight, washed-up comedian who owns a nightclub.""Raging Bull"" is one of those films that's excellent in every aspect. The screenplay and Scorsese's direction are totally powerful. Plus, the sound effects are amazing and the same goes for the cinematography (shot in black-and-white for almost the entire film). The film provided De Niro the Best Actor Oscar and also won for Best Film Editing. ""Raging Bull"" was nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award, but lost it to ""Ordinary People"" in 1980. Even though ""Ordinary People"" is terrific, I still prefer this film. In addition, Scorsese received his first Best Director Oscar nomination, but Robert Redford won that category over him. While I admire Redford's direction for ""Ordinary People"", I think that Scorsese should've won that Oscar category for this movie.The fact that ""Raging Bull"" isn't in the Top 50 in the Internet Movie Database Top 250, like it used to be about 20 years ago, is a real disappointment. I mean, what kind of world is this today when films like ""Gladiator"", ""Grave of the Fireflies"", ""Interstellar"", and ""The Green Mile"" are all in the Top 50, while this film is currently #148????!!!! I consider that a giant mistake! Or shall I say ""Raging Bull""-sh@t?! Thus, it just shows what most of us already know is that people's tastes in movies are getting worse every minute. Don't get me wrong, I like those five aforementioned movies that are currently in the Top 50, but they're nowhere near as good as this magnum opus!For those who didn't like ""Raging Bull"" should stick to watching trite, cliché romantic comedies and/or lame, stupid, pointless, thoughtless reality TV shows, especially the ones on MTV, VH1, and/or Bravo. For the fans of this movie, it deserves to be back on the Top 50 list in the Internet Movie Database Top 250 and we have to do something to get it there! With ""Raging Bull"" being a raw, brutal, and superb achievement, plus the best film of 1980, the excellence of it shall always be remembered for years to come. Lastly, it's a must-see for everyone who loves and/or is serious about movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The ultimate boxing movie!,"""Raging Bull"" is one of the best boxing films in the 1980s. It deals with an autobiography of the 1940s boxer Jake La Motta(Robert De Niro). Robert De Niro is excellent in it, same with Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty. I am glad they won an Oscar for that movie, same with the director Martin Scorsese. ""Raging Bull"" is my all-time favorite Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese movie without a doubt and is not to be missed at all. Excellent film and performances. I love it!

Maybe Scorsese's Best Film,"Images frozen for posterity are many in the history of motion pictures, but only a few encompass the film's meaning in that image. Rocky Balboa's running up the Philadelphia stairs is one such example.  Then there is Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) gracefully shadowboxing in the ring in slow motion while the sad but proud strains of Mascagni's  ""Cavalleria Rusticana"" is playing on the soundtrack.   Brute more than man, La Motta's barbarism finds its truest expression in the ring.  Here to be less than a man is celebrated not despised.  Here La Motta achieves peace.  Peace that comes only in the ring, however.  La Motta brings chaos and despair to his loved ones outside of it.  ""Raging Bull"" charts Jake La Motta's journey toward finding peace outside of his arena.  It is one of the most honest portrayals of redemption ever produced for the screen.Scorsese teamed up with Paul Schrader, whom he had worked with on the archetypal film ""Taxi Driver,"" to work on the screenplay.  What shows are two storytellers at the top of their craft and Martin Scorsese reaching maturity.The film opens with a paunchy, out-of-shape, La Motta going over his monologue for the evening's performance.  He recites his trademark rhyme ad dictum:  ""So give me a stage where this Bull here can rage/ And though I can fight, I'd much rather recite...That's entertainment!  That's entertainment.""Then we flash backward to a healthy, lean, and hungry La Motta in his quest for the Middleweight Title.  Helping him along is his put-upon brother and manager, Joey (Joe Pesci).  La Motta constantly badgers Joey about his wanting to be a heavyweight and having ""small hands.""  To prove that he truly is a man, La Motta provokes Joey into hitting him.  We see that Jake La Motta is insecure about his masculinity.  What reaffirms it in La Motta's are his boxing and abrasive behavior.One of the most commendable features about the film is the progression of success for La Motta and the regression of his home life.  This escalates when La Motta meets his second wife, Vickie (Cathy Moriarty).  Vickie, as portrayed by Moriarty, is a vision of incredible erotic beauty and this fuels jealousy in La Motta whenever she is around other men.  He loses both his wife and his brother because of his jealousy and insecurity.If this sounds like a depressing movie it most certainly is.  But one of the points the movie makes is that when a person is at their lowest point, understanding comes, and then the potential for change can happen.  That is where the power of the film lies, not in the self-destructive behavior of La Motta, but in the efforts he takes to save himself.I mentioned before that Scorsese reached full maturity here.  That maturity comes by way of the care he places in his filmmaking and storytelling.  To Scorsese's credit he does not mince meat (but then again, when has he?) on his subject's repulsiveness.  La Motta is a lout, a creep, insecure, childish, brutal, cruel, but also tender, vulnerable, and human.I cannot say enough about the hallucinations that make up the boxing scenes. With the film shot almost entirely in black-and-white, the boxing sequences make full effect of the contrast and lighting.  Strange animal noises are heard during the matches, reinforcing the barbaric nature of the contest. When La Motta loses his belt to Sugar Ray Robinson, the Catholicism-drenched Scorsese films it as La Motta's crucifixion.  Robinson raises his fist on high like a passing of judgment.  Finally, La Motta spreads his arms and welcomes the flurry of attacks in surrender, his blood spilling everywhere. After his defeat, La Motta still stands.  ""You didn't knock me down, Ray.""Joe Pesci went on to become a Scorsese staple after his fine portrayal of Joey La Motta.  Joey suffers at the hands of his brother throughout the film, yet he still stands by him until Jake finally snaps.  But the insecurity and jealousy that fester in Jake make their presence known in Joey as well as he repeatedly slams a car door on one of Vickie's prospective adulterers.Cathy Moriarty had her first role as the seductive Vickie.  Blonde and beautiful, shy and alluring, the audience can see why La Motta is drawn to this vision and determined to keep her even at the cost of losing her. Moriarty captures Vickie's impending sense of being a prisoner as she becomes quieter and more subservient as a wife than she ever was as La Motta's flirtatious girlfriend.  She also shows strength as a mother as she fights to regain some semblance of sanity for her children.  It is a heartbreaking performance.De Niro captured the Academy Award for Best Actor as Jake La Motta.  If ever there was a definition for acting in the ""Method,"" De Niro's performance fits the bill.  In his scenes as the retired and gluttonous La Motta, De Niro actually gained 200 pounds.  The only thing prosthetic is his nose.  It is doubtful if an actor will ever go to such pains for a performance again.I'd have to say that this and ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" are the two most personal films of Scorsese.  He even adds a nice coda from the Bible if there is any doubt to its story of redemption.  ""...Whether this man forgave my sins, I know not.  I only know that once I was blind and now I can see.""The bull sees. Raging Bull ****",,Anonymous,Biography

Yet you still find yourself rooting for him. Marvellously played by Robert De Niro has Jake LaMotta. The story from the book of his life is bought to the Big screen by a reluctant Martin Scorsese who did not win the Oscar for this movie. Don't get me wrong this is a hard watch unconventional in the way we know movies to be made black-and-white yet the more you see it. The more you can appreciate how brilliant Scorsese and De Niro were at this point.

Not at all up to my expectations.,"Raging Bull was a complete let down.  The story alone is as old as time. An abusive, over-reacting, over-protective, and over-bearing boxer loses two wives, his children, and his brother.  Not by any sort of tragedy, but his own temper and actions.  DeNiro, of course, was outstanding, and its always nice to see little Joe Pesci beat the precious body fluid out of some poor sap, but LaMotta was no one special to write about (I guess that's why he took it upon himself).  I can't believe one of the most notorized directors of time actually became more notorized because of ""Raging Bull.""",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Such a film cannot be quantified,qualified or completely understood.","Raging Bull has been viewed by countless people as the greatest American film of the 1980s, even of all time. Seeing it again, it is remarkable to see the precisely choreographed fight scenes, the powerful domestic scenes between Jake LaMotta and his wife and the overall arc of a life Scorsese brings to the screen. This is a film not easily forgotten.Without discussing the commonly known backstory and history of how Scorsese and De Niro came to make this film, it is important to discuss what Raging Bull targets in its remarkably moving film making. It all begins and ends with Robert De Niro's performance as LaMotta, a ferocious fighter with animal-like instincts that assisted in the boxing ring, but were deadly to his relationships. The most remarkable aspect of De Niro's acting here is how he is able to perfectly capture the pivotal point between LaMotta being sincere and being a bull. Even in scenes we know something harsh and violent is going to happen, the sheer low tone and calm gesture De Niro speaks in is enough to throw off the audience of the impending conflict. It truly is an unforgettable performance.Able to go face-to-face with De Niro is Joe Pesci as Jake's brother Joey, the brains of the operation and more able to deal with real life, as well as Cathy Moriarty as his blonde bombshell wife Vickie. The fact that she was a mere 19 years old during production enhances her performance even more.What Martin Scorsese is able to suggest not just about LaMotta but also humanity in general in a film some see merely as a sports film on par with Rocky or Bull Durham is unbelievable. This is not a sports movie, rather a careful character study of a man with infinite psychological and personal issues who attempted to approach every part of life as if it was a boxing match. When this didn't work with Vickie or his boxing representatives, he simply lashed out the only way he understood. Some see Jake LaMotta as almost entirely unsympathetic. I think he is even more sympathetic than most because he doesn't understand the sorrow and turmoil he causes. He acts but doesn't think.Scorsese, ever a master of the visual tricks and styles, so carefully photographed the fight scenes that they remain immersible in the viewer's head: this is real boxing compared to what is seen in other films. The fighters are completely covered in blood, sweat and water, while the slow-motion shots of certain characters forever marks their spot in our memories. This is a story told almost entirely from LaMotta's point of view, yet it isn't just his story. This is also Scorsese's, the story of a self-destructive man who alienated all of those around him only to lose that which he cherished. Fortunately for Scorsese, he realized his problems and perhaps making this film allowed him to escape a similar fate to LaMaotta.",,Anonymous,Biography

A landmark in 80's films,"I admit I was never all that interesting in seeing this picture as I was not a fan of the Bronx Bull but I knew it was a masterpiece so I gave it a whirl one night. This film is different from most 80's movies in that it is black and white which is certainly remarkable and quite possibly most ingenious. DeNiro is great, Pesci is great and the movie therefore is great. DeNiro got an Oscar and Pesci should have got an Oscar. I would say the most fascinating thing about Jake LaMotta besides the fact he was one of the greatest boxers of all time is that he was friends with and personally knew several members of Nino Gaggi's uncontrollable DeMeo Street Crew of the Gambino Crime Family featured in the best selling book Murder Machine by Jerry Capeci and Gene Mustain. A great book maybe the best one on Organized Crime ever written. This movie does need to be seen it is powerful.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An astonishing piece of filmmaking,"Certain films transcend their period, their content and their place in cinema history. ""Raging Bull"" is one of those rare films where acting, direction and story combine and enhance in that magic way that reminds you why we even watch films in the first place.Remarkably the subject matter is hardly compelling. Jake LaMotta was a decent middleweight boxer in the WWII era who channelled his immense inner rage into pummelling opponents. This he was good at and his talents took him all the way to a World title belt.However he was also deeply and unoriginally flawed. He was a paranoid, violent wife-beater who caused his first wife to lose their unborn child and learnt nothing from the experience. His eccentricity wasn't of the artistic and potentially charming kind either. He was a vicious bully and this is with the film displaying all of his best qualities!And yet through De Niro's beaten up, perplexed and bone-headed characterisation you almost feel sorry for the sap. He had one good thing going for him and his intransigence threw that all away. Never has achieving your dream been so destructive.This is all set in a moody black & white world of shadows and contrasts, each physical and psychological blow captured in exquisite detail. It's almost horrifying as you're taken into the eye of the storm and still can't help thinking how amazing the film looks as blood drips onto the canvas.I can see why Scorsese had trouble getting the film funded (it's no crowd pleaser) but in the end he made one of his best films (if not the best). Everything is just so spot on. The editing, the changes of pace, the fact that all of the other characters are barely explored because LaMotta was all about LaMotta.For sure ""Raging Bull"" isn't for everyone. But seriously if you consider yourself to be someone who appreciates cinema as art and seeks out films that challenge as well as entertain then you absolutely have to put this movie on your shortlist.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Before Wolf of Wall Street there was Raging Bull,"Don't go into this thinking it's a boxing film, but rather about a man who was a boxer. Scorsese's cinematic biopics, namely The Aviator, Wolf of Wall Street, and this one are so unique because of exactly that. Most biopics are made about big figures such as a singer or a famous historical character and they made a film about the life of those figures. However, Scorsese doesn't go that route, it's as if he carefully chooses and studies a figure with an interesting character and wants to take a cinematic portrayal of that famous person's psychology and bring it to light on the big screen. The screenwriter Paul Schrader (who was also the screenwriter for Taxi Driver) wrote this film with the intention of not focusing too much on fight strategy and boxing, because as we see, the film is a character study of Jake LaMotta. It shows a man who is paralyzed by sexual insecurity, envy, and rage and his fights in the ring are curiously not motivated by tactics or even a desire to triumph but by his fear and rage. I have to admit, I did expect a boxing flick going into this picture but I got something even better.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
What'd I do? What'd I do?,"Raging Bull masquerades as a boxing movie, trying to capitalize on Rocky popularity in 1980. It failed. The fundamental difference between both movies is that we care what happens to Rocky and want him succeed as the underdog, whereas we couldn't care less about what happens to an ungrateful bum called Jake LaMotta. The movie does nothing to bring you closer to LaMotta's character, it actually does the opposite and makes you loathe him. Why should we care what happens to him? Isn't that the point of a movie, to bring you closer to the characters and story?That brings me to the boxing scenes. They are horrible. The blood is the worst I've seen in any movie - it just sprays everywhere like a geyser. Very realistic. We are not told the significance of any of Lamotta's fights, except the one where he's fighting a guy that his wife said was good looking. The boxing is pretty meaningless in the movie, so they should have just left it out. As it is, it was painful to watch.The movie is shown in black and white. Did Scorcese think that we wouldn't be able to tell that it's set in the 40's if it was in color? The effect is that the movie just looks cheap. Couldn't afford color cameras or what?It's also too long. Over 2 hours is a challenge for most to stay awake that long. I kept watching in hopes that the movie would stop sucking, but it never did. It sucked from start to finish.DeNiro is a fine actor and plays his role well, as did Pesci, but even they couldn't do anything to save this sad excuse for a movie. There just isn't anything that draws you into the movie or makes you care about the characters in the slightest. What you end up with is a hollow movie in black and white about some bum that wasted his boxing talent. Big deal.There's no actual ending to the movie either. It just kind of degenerates to the point where Lamotta lands himself in jail, and that's pretty much where it ends. I was half asleep by that point, so maybe there was a point to the movie and I missed it. But I doubt that.After wasting over 2 hours watching this movie, I couldn't help but echo Lamotta's sentiments after he threw a fight:""What'd I do? What'd I do?""2 out of 10. 1 for DeNiro and 1 for Pesci. Both tried their best to save this movie, but couldn't.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Watch A Modern Barbarian Destroy His Life,"(Flash Review)The film follows the early career of rising boxing star Jake LaMotta as he battles middle weight contenders and personal decisions as he strives to get a title shot. While he is working up the ladder, his true persona is illuminated on how controlling, violent and distrustful he is off his wife, brother and pretty much everyone. From scene to scene, he is angry, inquisitive, schmoozing or scheming. This is one of those rise and fall stories that starts with arrogance and ends with humility. While the acting is rich with emotion, the lighting helps give a unique atmosphere to the scenes which are shot in rich black and white. Scorsese uses some creative cinematic moments to accentuate the emotional mood of specific scenes. It appears De Niro gained a bunch of weight from Jake's fighting weight to his post career weight. Don't pass up the Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci trifecta in their early days.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

First of all this movie is beautiful, the black and white really works for the type of story it's telling. De Niro and Joe Pesci produce some of their best work as well, even better than Goodfellas in a lot of ways! The sound effects on the boxing ring jumps to mind when thinking of this movie, how they represent the animalistic nature of the main character and how that plays into a scene towards the end of the film. Can't recommend it enough it's an absolute classic!

"A tour de force in filmmaking, but to watch ""Raging Bull"" in the same way as ""Goodfellas"" might be a mistake","It had been quite a few years since I've seen ""Raging Bull"", and while I've loved it since the first time I watched it, it has never placed at or near the very top of my Scorsese rankings. The reason, I think, is simple: it's not as entertaining as a film like ""Goodfellas"" or maybe even ""The Departed"" and the character of Jake LaMotta, while he's riveting to watch onscreen, is such a barbaric creature devoid of any redemption surviving on apparent fumes of humanity that he is not as likable as another complicated, prone-to-violence man portrayed by Robert De Niro in Travis Bickle.It has become clear to me on my latest re-watch of ""Raging Bull"", which I saw through the incredible Criterion 4K that this is the least fun and humorous of the great films that Scorsese made throughout the seventies through to nineties (excluding ""Kundun"" of course). While this could result easily result in tedium or a feeling of self-importance, under Scorsese's direction and De Niro's gargantuan performance, this is one of the most exhilarating, uncompromising and utterly fascinating character studies that has ever been committed to film.The filmmaking here is jaw dropping, especially in the boxing matches. The slow motion, the noir-ish use of shadows and angles and the sound design give the boxing matches a visceral flair rarely seen in a sport film especially up to this point. The cinematography, editing and overall tempo of the 'action' scenes really highlight how much of a brute LaMotta is in the ring and some of the damage that he does to his opponents borders on cringe-inducing.LaMotta's brute-like behaviour in the ring is matched in his domestic life and there are a number of key relationships here. His brother Joey (Pesci) is his manager and you get a sense of just how much he has changed his personality to accommodate for Jake's animalistic and volatile personality. The relationship and marriage with Vickie (Moriarty) is fascinating and we as the viewer know immediately, without needing to know the real life story between the two, that Vickie is doomed to repeat the same cycle of abuse and oppression as Jake's previous (and current at the beginning of the film) wife and it's fitting that in their first meeting, Vickie is behind a barbed fence and LaMotta is on the outside. Lastly, the relationships Jake has with Tommy (the Mafia boss) and Sal (Vincent) are interesting because he is really not impressed by the power either guy has and makes it especially clear with Sal that he does not respect that lifestyle. For Jake, it's all about the personal journey to get to the middleweight championship and he does not want his story as one of the foremost boxers, of Italian American blood, owing his rise to the top to the Mafia.Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" is one of his more sobering and dark films but what it lacks in straightforward entertainment, it makes up for in complex characterization and rich emotion. It's one of the great exhibitions in filmmaking and the collaboration with De Niro arguably is at its apex here in terms of the artistic contributions of both Scorsese and De Niro. There is no killer soundtrack in this film like there is in ""Goodfellas"" and the film is not ripe with comedy because it is from the warped perspective of its single focal point and that is Jake LaMotta but it becomes apparent to me now that it was a mistake for me to have viewed this as lesser, though great, than both ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Goodfellas"".",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The knockout blow of a lifetime,"The stunning combination of Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro delivers the knockout blow of a lifetime.  After two decades, the film's greatness endures.Filmed in brooding black and white, but with devilishly clever color clips, Raging Bull is the perfect film noir.  DeNiro, whose effect on the film reaches everything from writing to lighting, is the greatest film actor of all time, and this is his greatest hour.  He brings an odd humanity to the most inhumane of all sports.  He is vulnerable, yet stoic, confident, yet deeply self-doubting.  He epitomizes the frailty of even the strongest among us.  A most deserved Oscar can only begin to pay tribute to DeNiro, who collaborated in a rewrite to make the unctuous LaMotta more sympathetic, and then portrayed him with such sympathy and insight that we are constantly reminded that even the most unlikeable of people are still people.Spanning 23 years, at once managing to be epic and intimate, Martin Scorsese's masterpiece is perfect in every way.  Cinematogaphy rivaled only by the likes of Orson Welles or Francis Ford Coppola, who later directed DeNiro in the Godfather trilogy, a score both tragic and majestic, and oh the acting. Even Joe Pesci contributes an Oscar-worthy career performance as the brother of Jake LaMotta (DeNiro).The fact that such films as Shawshank Redemption, Memento, Saving Private Ryan, L.A. Confidential, The Matrix, and Das Boot, all superb films in their own right, and It's a Wonderful Life and Toy Story 2, lightweight fodder at best, are ranked in this site higher than Raging Bull is ludicrous.  Even the finest among them pale by comparison, and when they are two decades old, will be far less remembered, revered, and imitated, than this powerful, and perhaps most important, giant of the modern era.If I could only have ten DVD's for the rest of my life, this would have to be one of them.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

And, I did.""Raging Bull"" is the 1980 biopic of one time middleweight boxing champion, Jake LaMotta - based on his memoirs. It chronicles his rise through the ranks to become the champion, as well as his eventual fall into a life of a stand-up comedian (who wasn't very funny). We watch his tumultuous relationship with his wife, Vicki, and his brother, Joey. Prone to violence and jealousy, LaMotta led a very conflicted life, which contributed to his raging boxing style inside of the ring, earning him his nickname, Raging Bull. Though he could be deadly inside the ring, he was just as dangerous outside of it too.I remember watching an episode of Siskel & Ebert where Ebert declared ""Raging Bull"" to be the best movie of the 80's decade. Although I agree it was a great movie, I don't know if I would put it up on that high of a pedestal. It was fun seeing some familiar faces from ""GoodFellas"", but 10 years younger. As I watched this movie. Joe Pesci was very strong in his role as Jake's brother, Joey - the one man who strived every day to keep Jake balanced and centered. Probably the only man who ever really cared for or loved Jake. Robert De Niro was excellent and well-deserving of his Academy Award for Best Actor. It truly was a memorable performance.I loved this movie. Now that I've finally seen it, I still need to let it soak in a bit, but I am sure I'll watch it again sometime. I highly recommend it.

There are so many good reviews that this is something different.,"In the late 70's I was working in a record store. A friend told me he was going to open his own store renting VHS tapes. When I saw him a year later he was driving a Jaguar. His father left the corporate world and the two ran three or four local movie rental stores until Blockbuster Video came to town. DeNiro and Scorsese are big brand name box office stars in consumer America. I purchased Raging Bull on DVD at a Big Box Store (Many would stream it today via Netflix. I'm a little behind on the technology) along with some Budweiser and Ben & Jerry's. The movie has all the elements we expect: plot and character and setting, rising and falling action, ideas and revelations and reversals, etc etc. The craftsmanship was excellent. A plot summary would be heresy here. It was a first-rate product. I enjoyed watching it, may watch it again (why not?), and am ready to watch another movie tomorrow night because I have the day off work for the 4th of July long weekend holiday (today is July 4, 2013).",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Raging Nonsense,"As it seems, we live in a society, in which it is important enough to portrait the spiritually rather unimportant live of somebody, whose calling it was to knock down other people in a strange kind of activity, that has less to with sports, but much more with aggression. Since movies always portrait the time and the society in which we live and since the movie, that stands here under discussion, belongs to the 250 best rated movies ever, one must assume, that our society is as primitive as the topic of this movie.Doubtless, the acting capacity of Robert De Niro and, most of all, Joe Pesci, is admirable. But, if I am allowed here to try a kind of meta-comment: Somebody wrote, that this film ""will remain in my heart forever: the splendid black & white, the contrast between the slow moving scenes and the frenetic ones, the choice of the music and the sense of loss which entangles the whole movie"". At this point, I can only shake my head, because there are thousands of black and white movies, slow and ""frenetic"" scenes, the choice of music reached its culmination point in Faßbinder's movies, but not in Scorsese's, and the sense of loss is a very prominent motive since the silent movie time. So, all this compliments have absolutely nothing to do with this special movie.Complete loss of common sense is reached at the moment, when this somebody writes: ""Martin Scorsese is the most poetic director of the last 30 years"": What has boxing to do with poetry? Is there nowadays an ""aesthetics of boxing"", perhaps an ""aesthetics of brutality""? And, after all, each movie must have a message, because otherwise, it is neither worth to film a story nor to watch such a movie. The ""Raging Bull"" is a paradigmatic example of a movie without any recognizable message, hence a ""raging nonsense"".",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Raging Bull is a masterpiece.,"Directed by Martin ScorseseStarring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriatry.Written by Jake La Motta, Joseph Carter, Peter Savage, Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin""If you win, you win. If you lose, you still win.""Raging Bull is about 'an emotionally self-destructive boxer's journey through life, as the violence and temper that leads him to the top in the ring, destroys his life outside it.'Martin Scorsese is in his prime with this film. The direction and tone is breathtaking. The editing was great. His quick screen cuts with Thelma Schoonmaker is as brilliant as always. Poetic to the eyes. Cinematography was superb.His camera movements inside and outside of the ring is legendary. The black and white filming only adds to the beauty of the film. Brought class and design to the screen. I've read people complain about the fight scenes not being believable but I believe that was the inflection Scorsese was looking for. It was a mess in the ring. It was careless, unorganized, sloppy and devastating. Jake La Motta was a monster and the choreographed fight scenes spoke for him.The acting in this film was marvelous. What more could be said about Robert De Niro? He was magnificent. An Oscar winning performance. He's brilliant though the character he is portraying was far from it. Jake La Motta is a self-destructing man who is spiraling out of control. He is rude, impatient, paranoid and oh, so violent! Yet at the end of the film, you feel sorrow for such a monster. Joe Pesci is also great. He stands by his brother's side as long as he could. He is abused physically and emotionally in his home and in public. After a while, the audience begins to feel his pain. He is looked at like a clown by his own blood. But at the end, he has the final laugh. Great story telling.The score was fascinating. Scorsese went for a more classical genre in this picture. There's such carnage and menace through the film yet in the background you hear such beautiful music. It left me at a loss for words yet at the end, it worked. It worked like a charm. It brought class to such a brilliant and brutal story.Raging Bull is a masterpiece. I believe to be the best film to come out of the 80's. An unforgettable experience and a must see for every film lover out there!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rocky who?... KO for Scorsese!,"The drama, the fights, the acting! BRILLIANT!! I am waiting for Eastwood's Million Dolar Baby before I declare this as the Best movie about a boxer/boxing ever! The movie chronicles the life of Jake LaMott, a real life boxer. We watch as his career ascends... and descends. No- scratch that his life ascends and descends. The moody black and white that Scorsese used to film this really adds to the feel of things- it is almost a contrast to the events. Not every choice is labeled in black and white, there are fine subtleties that distort your perception... The boxing is raw- hard hitting beautiful. However, the boxing accounts for maybe one third of the events in this film. Just wait until DeNiro gives his epilogue in the end. He recites lines from On the Waterfront. The scene is beautiful... Haunting and it leaves a knot in your stomach...MASTERPIECE.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Simply the Best,"I do not understand 8.4 stars business.

Citizen Kane's use of proportions witht the actors, making John Kane seem large, was good and all, but Raging Bull's cinematography was so beautiful. I could stop a scene in my mind, make a still of the scene, and it would be a well shot photo. The motion of the camera, having it follow the falling boxer's face until it hit the ground, was so good. The story was great. The characters were great.

My rating: 8,"A surprise movie. Movie from the 80's but black and white. Movie made by Scorsese but not bloody. Without complicated and crossed inter-individual connections. With a culmination in the end but emotional one.Raging bull is the naked nerve of trust and the feeling for closeness with the others. When this feeling is not present the result is clear - loneliness, roughness and madness. It is possible when somebody is extremely good in what he does that this guy to be a genius. Even if he is not, he can be at least a master. Living in extremes always build contrasting features of the different.Each up has its down that is giving birth to another up before its down. When there is balance, when the break is hit before the depression and before the peak, when you are not making difference. The way up is slow, stubborn and hard. The way down is fast, teaching and painful.The question of the meaning stands in front everything and everybody. It is clear, spread and bright but not explained. Are we going to explain it now or then or at the end it is all the same. But it is good when we keep an eye on it.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not your typical boxing movie,"This was a film that Robert De Niro wanted to make. Martin Scorsese initially thought the idea of making a boxing picture was an awful one. He hates all sports and had zero interest. But De Niro eventually won him over once Scorsese was able to see beyond the boxing and into the character beyond. Raging Bull is, like all the best sports films, only peripherally about the sport itself and is in reality a character study. And what an atypical man to base a drama around. The script came from Jake La Motta's memoirs. It is uncompromisingly about an unlikable violent man. La Motta was a middleweight boxing champion. Violent in and out of the ring and dangerously paranoid and insecure, he was brutal and animalistic. He actively enjoyed the fact he could take a beating and was very self-destructive – he ultimately went from world champion to sleazy nightclub owner. His story isn't uplifting like most sports dramas. It's harsh and unflinching. There are no typical underdog boxing movie moments or montages in this one.Much has been said about Robert De Niro's turn in the central role. But with very good reason as this truly is an acting tour de force. He famously gained over 50 pounds to play the washed up older La Motta. This determination to take himself from prize-fighter shape to obesity is simply incredible but the natural brilliance of his performance overall is peerless. He is ably supported with a great cast, most notably Joe Pesci as his brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty as his wife Vickie. While Scorsese's bold visual style and typical gritty dramatic forcefulness combine to fantastic effect. The period detail and sumptuous black and white photography seal the deal and ensure that there is a timeless visual quality to Raging Bull too. Surprisingly it didn't do so well at the box office despite critical appreciation and Oscar nominations. It was probably too difficult and out of time for the 80's. But subsequently, it has been regarded by many as one of the best from that decade.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superior Boxing Film,"""Raging Bull"" is the story of middleweight champion Jake LaMotta's rise (to a title) and fall (to oblivion). The story is much more telling than just that of a boxer: it moves into territory of relationships and self-destruction out of ignorance. The cast is simply remarkable: Robert DeNiro is in his best role (he won an Academy Award for Best Actor), Joe Pesci is terrific, and Cathy Moriarity is better than she has ever been. The direction by Martin Scorcese is brilliant. Whether small domestic scenes or brutal action in the ring, every shot is totally captivating and engrossing. The script by Paul Schrader is also exceptional, with excellent character plotting and dialogue. The film's setting also looks great. Everything about the film is executed in an exceptional manner. ""Raging Bull"" (1980, United Artists) comes highly reccomended.",,Anonymous,Biography

A once in a lifetime experience,"What is there left to say about Raging Bull? It is one of the most astonishing films ever to be made and that is mostly because of Robert De Niro's uniqueness. There is nobody like him. He just makes you sit in front of the screen and not move for about 2 hours, because that's how much he can captivate us in each film he makes. Each scene was so pure and (almost) flawless. But, there is another reason, which brings this film to its greatness and that is the one and only, Martin Scorsese. I feel like this is one of his best work and if not, one of the greatest movies ever to be made.
You might think at first that this is a typical boxing movie, but it ain't nothing like that. The De Niro- Scorsese duo made sure of that. They put their hearts in this particular film, because that's what they do. They make you live with the characters they build and once they do that, there is no turning back. You simply fall in love with their work.
Also, the fact that this film is in black&white simply takes the film to a whole new other level. It is beyond beautiful and mesmerizing to watch.

Scorsese is a master of creating stories about broken people,"In my opinion, the film ""Raging Bull"" can be called one of the best biopic films. The film was released long before the general boom of this particular genre. The black and white picture accurately conveys the life of La Motta, and hides all the horrors of the boxers' makeup during those moments of the fights that were included in the film. The fights, by the way, are shown to be very brutal, or Scorsese simply decided to bet on this, saying that everything in the ring is difficult, just like family like and maintaining general sanity in a highly stressful environment. It's a complex movie that does not shy away from showing the dark side of humanity via the protagonist's development.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The fight scenes are so quick a contrast to the slow moving story telling part that they hit you with such a clout.

Nearly a Knockout,"I'm a big fan of the ""Scorsese/De Niro"" flicks.  I loved Mean Streets and Taxi Driver (which is my favourite movie).  So it only made sense that i'd run out to the nearest video store to rent what many call a masterpiece. Raging Bull, an autobiography about the life of Jake La Motta, is a film that wowed me in some parts, but at the end left me wanting more.  The high points in the movie are numerous.  The outstanding direction by Martin Scorsese, as well as the use of black and white film creates a 1 2 combination that brings out the sheer drama, and intensity that is most of the movie.  The absolutely brilliant acting by Robert De Niro is just plain incredible, and a well deserved Oscar winning effort.  And not to be overlooked is the part of Joey, played by Joe Pesci.  Also the choreographed fight scenes are superbly well done.  However the ending, if you ask me, left a lot to be desired, and may have been the result of last minute script changes.  I remember watching the tv in disbelief as the credits began rolling by, this couldnt be the end?  Alas it was, and unfortunately an otherwise powerful movie ends with a very weak denounment.  So with that said, Raging Bull is a great movie, one that should not be overlooked. However if you do see it and end up wanting more, go rent Taxi Driver, the greatest movie released in the last 30 years.",,Anonymous,Biography
Mesmerizing Film,"Great direction by the best director alive. Outstanding black and white cinematography, acting,and editing. The best boxing scenes ever filmed.

After the fight, Scorsese shows a prolonged closeup of Jake's fist in a bucket of ice water. Therefore equating Jakes fist and his penis. Scorsese also cuts from scenes of Jake and his wife (usually romantic in nature) to scenes of him boxing,continually emphasizing that sex and violence are equivalent forms of release to Jake.

The Anti-Rocky.,"Though I prefer Scorsese and Schrader's other collaborations such as The Last Temptation of Christ, and especially Taxi Driver. Raging Bull proves itself to be a contender among their other masterworks, it's certainly flawed, and not my favorite of Scorsese's line up. But the central performances alongside the masterful direction from Scorsese proves that this film isn't just another boxing film.The film's development history is almost as interesting as the film itself, with many problems befalling the set such as Martin's drug use which almost caused his death, him stubbornly refusing to direct a sports film, as, to be fair, he wasn't, and still isn't, all that interested in sports, as well as other problems that I can't remember from the top of my head. But once Scorsese read the story of Jake LaMotta, he described it as having a profound effect on him and thus, he finally decided to take on the film. Scorsese's passion and vigor drives the film, as well as the passion of all of the other crew on board, especially Scorsese's frequent collaborator, star of the film, and close friend Robert De Niro.The character of Jake LaMotta, played excellently by De Niro, is an endlessly complicated one, like many of Scorsese's other protagonists. Though I don't think he quite adds up to De Niro's best character Travis Bickle, the physical transformation of De Niro into LaMotta is one of the most impressive in all of cinema, ranking up there with Heath Ledger's Joker, Daniel Day Lewis' Daniel Plainview, and Jack Nicholson's Jimmy Hoffa, though very much like Nicholson's portrayal of Hoffa, De Niro has an uncanny resemblance to the boxer already to the point where it's almost indistinguishable to tell the two apart. Much like Goodfellas' Henry Hill, LaMotta is not easy to like, in fact he's pretty deplorable throughout the film and Scorsese, as usual, isn't afraid to make us hate him at points. But there's that confidence and gusto that he has that always keeps us coming back to him, even in our constant frustration at his paranoia and tendency to drive people away from him and the fact that he's never fully able to take responsibility for his actions.There's also many other laudable aspects of this film, such as its black and white filtering which gives the film a gritty, neo-noir look that I adore, as well as saying that Joe Pesci might give his best performance that I've ever seen him do. I have an issue with Pesci where, let's face it, he plays the same character in every damn movie that he's in, though in this, I was pleasantly surprised to see a much more restrained, subdued performance from Pesci, who usually plays the street wise loud mouth. He's still a relatively tough guy and foul mouthed, but portrays Jake's brother, who's the calmer, more restrained one of the duo, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that Pesci could play someone else who wasn't the street wise loud mouth, though I do enjoy some of those performances from him, it proves to me that Pesci actually has range as an actor, even if he doesn't show it as often as he could.Unfortunately, the faltering of the movie is in the other, rather mediocre performances, especially of Cathy Moriarty as LaMotta's second wife Vicki, though I don't know if I can really fault the actors too much for that, as the performances from Pesci and De Niro are so magnificent, which I've also seen to be a problem in some of Scorsese's other films, mainly this one and The King of New York, but that's an entirely different conversation. There's also aspects of the pacing that truly bothered me, it felt rushed to me at times and I've always known Scorsese as a director who often takes his time when it comes to pacing, and one who often knows what he's doing when it comes to pacing, but, like with most good films, the good outweighs the bad.Many have lauded Raging Bull as one of Scorsese's seminal works, while I don't know if I can give Raging Bull that. But Scorsese continues to amaze me with his versatility and I can say, with good conscience, that this one is a good Scorsese piece.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

SCORSESE'S MAGNUM OPUS AND DE NIRO'S GREATEST PERFORMANCE,"Martin Scorsese's supreme artistic masterwork is an extraordinarily compelling motion picture of enormous power and rare distinction. A searing biography of middleweight boxing champion Jake La Motta, his rise to glory in the 1940s, his personal battles due to numerous inner demons, and his fall as an obese lounge lizard parody of his former self in the 1950s. Robert De Niro delivers a titanic portrayal that is one of the most astonishing performances ever recorded on film. He completely immersed himself in the ultimate method-acting tour-de-force as a young, lean, muscular Jake LaMotta. He rigorously trained with the real LaMotta mastering his crouched-in close style of boxing to become a completely convincing fighter, then he gain 60 pounds to play the bloated boxer in his later years. I was not surprised when De Niro won his well-deserved Oscar for Best Actor for this legendary performance. The brutal, visceral, no-holds-barred, highly stylized boxing sequences are some the best ever filmed. Showing the devastating blows hitting the bodies of the fighters and blood spraying out of their faces, it captures the intensity of the bouts with considerable force. The unforgettable climactic fight between LaMotta and Sugar Ray Robinson is one of the bloodiest and most gut-wrenching fight scenes ever made. Michael Chapman's stunning black & white cinematography is magnificent. The lighting of the film was made hash and stark to provide an expressionistic look and feel to the savage violence in the ring. Impeccable supporting performances by Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty, Nicholas Colasanto, and Frank Vincent. But it's De Niro's larger-than-life performance that owns this classic film. Scorsese's masterful direction is exhilarating, editor Thelma Schoonmaker won a Oscar for her dazzling work, and the period recreation is flawless. This film connects on primal themes with a brilliant Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader script which is rooted in contrary pulls of ambition, lust and redemption. ""Raging Bull"" has been crowned with so many critical laurels and awards that another word of praise seems hopelessly redundant, let's just say that it puts to shame virtually any American film made since then. Required viewing for anyone who truly loves the cinematic arts. Nominated for 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director: Martin Scorsese, Best Supporting Actor: Joe Pesci, Best Supporting Actress: Cathy Moriaty.

Great but the book is better.,"It's clear that Raging Bull is the greatest boxing movie ever made.The fight scenes are great, the directing is great and so on. But I'm reading and have nearly finished the book Raging Bull and it makes the movie recede in my mind. Don't get me wrong, Scorcese put it together quite nicely, and of course Deniro is intense. The book is better because of the way Lamotta described the fight scenes; the sweat, the noise, the feeling of winning the middle weight championship, and the feeling of going crazy was out standing. I think Scorsese is a visionnary because he shows the cruel world of boxing and what it does to a man and his pride. Plus the chemistry between Pesci and Deniro was electrifying.

This Film Must Not Be Ignored,"Raging Bull is probably Martin Scorsese's second greatest film. It's very emotional and powerful. Sometimes it was a little hard to watch. It's like a nostalgic throwback to the 1940s that only Scorsese can truly tackle, and Robert De Niro gives the performance of his career that won him an Oscar.It's based on the real life story of boxer Jake LaMontte from his golden age to his downfall. He was a very famous but also struggling boxer, that struggles to have support from his love ones from the way he treats them outside the ring. Jake LaMontte and his family have many tantrums throughout the movie, and really makes me wonder what it must've been like living with him. After attacking his own brother played by Joe Pesci, he gets his teeth punched inside the ring. He quits boxing, and through more powerful emotional scenes we truly see a broken down man he's become as he tries his hardest to redeem himself.I think the violence that was in the ring was a metaphor for the violence at home, since he beats up his loved ones at home.It's truly an inspiring movie that sadly didn't win Best Picture.One of Scorsese's greatest pictures if not one of the greatest pictures ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

What I have to really admire is Martin Scorcese's direction in this film for, if nothing else, one simple reason: When I watched this film, I couldn't help thinking that, in spite of it now being 21 years old, this film could be released just as it is in theaters today... and if you didn't know the stars nor hear of this movie, you'd swear it was just made recently. The fact that it was a period piece helps, but I didn't see any trends of film-making that wouldn't hold up today.It's not the most entertaining boxing movie I've ever seen, but then again it's not really a ""boxing movie."" It is film-making at its finest.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Zampanò in modern day life,"Jake La Motta represented the ideal Beast Man of the 20th century. Raging Bull is his story. The story of a man who gains the world but loses his soul. Like (the great) Zampano in La Strada, Scorsese uses La Motta to show the similarity of two men. Raging Bull is in a way a love story between La Motta and the second wife he takes (Very similar to Zampano's purchasing of his second girl). In the end, La Motta loses his youth and his act and once again is left with memories after breaking down from the loss of his true love. Like the repeated song that La Motta says over and over and over again, Zampano has his trick of breaking the medal chain around his chest and having his long winded speech about it. Both stories are equal and amazing. It is America's La Strada!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""I'm the boss! I'm the boss! I'm the boss!""","Who can beat the director/actor tag team of DeNiro and Scorsese? The dynamic duo of the film industry had made a landmark for themselves in the boxing ring in the ever-brilliant docudrama RAGING BULL.DeNiro portrays the real-life Italian boxing champ Jake LaMotta, whose rise to the top conflicted with his family life. Joe Pesci also stars as Jake's hard-nosed brother and manager, who only wanted the best for big brother Jake, but was met by the wrong side of a fist for his troubles. DeNiro's portrayal of Jake is explosive and terrifyinglyconvincing. His grasps with emotional trauma are so reallistic that you can't help but be sympathetic to the fallen hero.

One of the real champs,"The black and white cinematography, believe it or not, gave thismovie a deep sense of freshness and raw energy. The acting byRobert DeNiro is so good.

Scorcese and DeNiro shine light on an ugly story,"Jake LaMotta makes for an ugly character portrayal but when his story is directed in such gloriously clever ways, it makes cinema history. Martin Scorsese's usually over reaching vision delivered an experience that is as vulgar as it is complete. The black and white approach, the slow motion and extraordinary editing techniques, vintage soundtrack and sound effects, the clever lighting and smoke, and the changing of the ring sizes all make this a cine-phile experience to study, appreciate and enjoy. A boxing story? Yes...but a genius approach to it! Robert DiNero as The Bull is one scary portrayal, and one that deserves watching unto itself. There is a very real aspect of this movie that is actually unappealing yet enhancing the reality and further drawing one into this simple, black and white existence.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Spiritual masterpiece,"Raging Bull is arguably Scorsese's most accomplished film in terms of mastery of the craft, although there are other titles that I personally enjoy more. And this is perhaps key to why Raging Bull is problematic to anyone who isn't a film connoisseur. The movie is about brutality. It features a rather unlikable violent person who is abusive to everyone around him. The movie is nonstop in its assault on an audience, such that at the end we feel as if we've just spent a few rounds in the ring with the character ourselves. There is no question that it's an absolute masterpiece of cinema and should be admired as such... but it's not a pleasant picture to watch. Therein lies the rub.

It's All in the Details,"I won't go on and on about the storyline of this movie. What I do want to commend is the level of attention to detail this movie possesses. It starts with people...all sorts of crusty characters populate positions in the boxing underworld of Raging Bull. You can smell the Brylcream.The best moment for these bit players; The workmanlike look on the referee's face as he walks to LaMotta's corner to tell him that Cerdan has retired from the bout and that he is the new champion. Meanwhile, the most dramatic violins play in the background giving the scene drama.The visual details I just love...the in and ever-so-slightly out of focus shot of LaMotta's hand soaking in icewater...rotting wood in the lockeroom of the auditorium...paint which is worn away on the door to the Debonair Social Club...and lots more that I continue to notice every time I watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

I feel that Goodfellas and Taxi Driver are superior to this movie, as good as it is. The film contains some difficult to watch scenes and isn't for everyone.

"It was okay, but not a Keeper.","I've seen this twice. The first time it didn't impress me at all. I hated all of the characters, and why watch a film if you are not pulling for at least 1 person? I saw this in a theater, with good sound and a big screen. This is the best viewing experience that can be had, and usually this sometimes makes the film better than it really is. The setting did not help. I was underwhelmed. It was well made, but that only takes you so far. Platoon and Titanic are well made, but are Garbage. I need more than fancy cinematography and good acting. I need a good story and something to hang my interest in. I found nothing here of interest. I waited 4 years before sitting down to watch this again. This time it was on a big screen TV on VHS, with a good sound system and comfy chairs. I was even less impressed this time. DeNiro was still a jerk. The other characters were no better. It was very well crafted, but hollow inside. This second viewing was an ordeal. Not quite torture, but very difficult to sit through. I would not watch it again.On my scale, with 10 being the Ultimate in Cinema, I would give Raging Bull a 5. It's merely Above Average, and that's being very kind to it. The rating is for the excellent creation of the period and for the black and white cinematography. There's nothing else to see here.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"What makes a man, man?","Success is what all aspire but success is not momentary win in an event or a game. This is the process of making a good family, strong relationships and friends. This is a film centered on the story of a popular boxer who wins at the Championships but loses on his relationships due to his self-destructive attitude and skepticism. This is more of lack of synchrony between the personal and professional life.
The screenplay, the acting and the direction are worth noting. This is not a win or lose situation rather a series of events and misgivings that make or destroy our life. This draws a line between ambition and life.

An athlete with domestic problems?  Crazy,"Raging Bull is a very violent movie, but in a distinctly different way from the modern gorefests we usually associate with the term. There's an undercurrent of anger that runs through the whole thing, and which always threatens to burst out into open violence. As the back of the box tells you, it's this anger that leads to Jake LaMotta's professional success and private ruin. But that seems to give it too much of a purposeful direction -- the violence seems to move in all directions with no rhyme or reason. LaMotta wins and loses fights on the caprices of fate. He beats up his wife for no good reason, and goes about his business as if nothing happened.It's this directionlessness that I found kind of alienating. That may be an intentional choice, but after a while the procession of fights and events becomes a little numbing. Maybe this is why, though I respect Raging Bull, I'm not sure it belongs in the rarefied air of the Best of All Time lists that it usually occupies. Or maybe it's the occasional affectation too many, like the slow-motion opening boxing sequence.But on the whole Raging Bull is a remarkably well-crafted film. Scorcese puts together boxing matches beautifully, and does as good a job with physical interaction. DeNiro is, of course, the main attraction, and he's both riveting to watch and able to quietly capture all of the changes that LaMotta goes through over the course of the film. The supporting cast is pretty damn good too. It may not be the best of all time, but it's still very solid.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Boxing, violence & it's in black & white... Not bad!","I have to admit first of all that I'm not a great fan of boxing, but I know who Jake La Motta was and I'm aware of what he achieved. This biopic tells of his rise to fame, but it also tells of his life out of the ring, about his brother, his wife and how he eventually fell from grace, only to get up again. But more of that later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please take fifteen rounds with Sugar Ray while I write the next paragraph).As we begin, Jake La Motta is already a well known boxer, he is married to his first wife with whom he constantly argues. He is managed by his brother Joey who does his best to get him fights in the hope he'll get a shot at the title. It seems a long time coming but Jake has other things on his mind at the moment. He as seen a girl, Vickie, who has taken his eye. She is blonde and very popular with everyone, including the rich Salvy, another local guy from the Bronx. But Jake is determined and eventually makes her his. They eventually marry, but Jake is always wary of other men, including his brother, around his wife. This streak of jealousy will eventually cost him dearly. Inside the ring, he has no such problems, beating all comers, and beating them so well that nobody wants to fight him. Eventually his chance comes, but there's a catch... And there, I'll have to leave it as the spoiler police would lock me up if I said any more.Shot almost entirely in black and white, this film has the look and feel of one made back in the 1940's to 1950's. This works very well to give the atmosphere of the period in which it is set. A nice, mostly unobtrusive, score also works very well to set the tone of the movie. I thought Robert De Niro was tremendous as Jake La Motta, he gave his all for this part, even putting on a lot of weight for the latter scenes where La Motta becomes a stand-up comedian. Joe Pesci was also excellent as his brother Joey and Cathy Moriarty was good too as the sultry Vickie.This film is seen by many as a modern classic, and I can see why, it is very good I can't deny Scosese's skill. I think the main problem I found with it was that I didn't find it particularly entertaining. It's very melodramatic in places, but it didn't grip me in the way I expected or maybe I'm being too harsh. De Niro is truly excellent too, but a great performance doesn't always make for a great film I'm afraid. If you haven't seen it before then I can definitely recommend it to you for at least one viewing, if just for De Niro. I'll maybe watch it again in a few years and rave about it, but for now, it's very very good but not great.My score: 8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mad Doping Fly,"I was appalled at the low ranking this film got on AFI's and this (IMDb) site's greatest films list.  I watched this movie only a month ago, so my opinion is going to be a bit biased because I can still feel the entire movie.  I have never seen a film like Raging Bull before and chances are that I never will again.  It has been said that this is the greatest movie of the 80s.  I have to agree.  In fact, this movie is one of the best ever, maybe up there at 3 or 4.  This was probably DeNiro's and Pesci's finest hour (not to degrade their later collaborations, in any way).  Scorsese did a brilliant job with bringing this to life.  If it had been in anyone else's hands, it probably would have ended up being mediocre or ""good"" at best. The straight-forward (ie: no attempt at shallow humor, no attempt at political rhetoric, no pseudo-philosophy) dialogue and the use of black and white gave it a very realistic feel.  The pauses in dialogue and the not quite long, but certainly noticable, moments of silence actually seemed normal, or at least suitable, for the setting.  Then again, I am neither a cinematographer or screenwriter.  Basically, I watched this film and I was hooked.  The only way to have any idea about the magnitude of this film's greatness is to watch it.",,Anonymous,Biography
A hard-hitting biopic.,"Raging Bull is a raw and gritty look at the turbulent life of middleweight boxing champion Jake La Motta, a rather reprehensible character whose paranoia and insensitivity drove away those he loved and ultimately left him on the skids and in trouble with the law. Even though it's far from what most would class as a fun film, it's still an unmissable slice of cinema, thanks to powerful performances from an excellent cast, and impeccable direction from Martin Scorsese, who handles both the drama and the brutal fight action with plenty of style.Robert De Niro is not only in tip-top physical form for his role as the world class boxer (at least until he flabs out for the final act), but is also at the top of his game as a thespian, the star fully flexing his acting muscles in a performance that runs the gamut of emotions and which deservedly won him an Oscar. Also making a big impression are Joe Pesci as Jake's brother Joey, a loud-mouthed brawler with ties to the Mafia who is almost as obnoxious as his older sibling, and Cathy Moriarty, as Jake's long-suffering second wife Vickie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A trio at the top of their game,"Beautifully polished, intense and gripping, the biopic tale of Jake La Motta stands firmly as the finest sporting movie ever made. But what separates 'Raging Bull' from others in the genre is the way in which the character is forced to confront his inner demons, as the consequences of an initially heroic, but ultimately self-destructive lifestyle, threaten to take their toll.The partnership struck between Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese is, to this day, the most successful actor-director combination to have prevailed. Similarly, the chemistry between De Niro and Joe Pesci has spread over a number of other top films, whether it be 'Casino' or Goodfellas.' In 'Raging Bull,' however, the trio are found at the top of their game.The decision to shoot the film in black and white adds to the authenticity, making stunning use of imagery in the process - the sight of De Niro bouncing around in a dark, smoke-infested ring, is simply breathtaking, for instance. The structure of the film is also highly impressive, with events ending where they started.The legendary Mohammed Ali may be boxing's biggest name, but his recent biopic, 'Ali,' falls way short of the high standards set by 'Raging Bull.'",,Anonymous,Biography
"He isn't nervous that you did it, he's nervous why you won't admit it","After watching Rocky a few months ago, I doubted that I'd ever see a boxing film that would live up to or surpass its status. It was a trend-starter of a film, that didn't follow a blueprint, but accidentally formed one, that would become carbon-copied and mimicked like Jaws did for shark films. Then along came Raging Bull, a film by the almighty Scorsese. This marks the fifth film of his that I have awarded a perfect score, and the fifth film I've reviewed of his as well.Why do I idolize Scorsese? I find him to be a rare treasure in film. His ability to tackle any story, from a paranoid boxer, to the underground mobsters, to gambling tycoons, to the inter-workings of an Irish gang, to an amazing aviator-turned germaphobe, Scorsese can do it. And make it a work of incorruptible, undeniable art. He is often taken for granted, and not appreciated like he should be. Whether people like to admit it or not, he revolutionized cinema, and will continue to do it for many, many more years.Raging Bull was De Niro's plea to Scorsese to stop using cocaine, and to direct the film he wanted to for years. Scorsese has gone on record saying that De Niro practically saved his life, persuading, if not forcing, him to make the film. Scorsese has stated that Raging Bull was ""kamikaze style filmmaking,"" because originally, he never thought he'd make another film. That all changed when the film was met with acclaim from audiences and critics around the country, and three amazing talents, De Niro, Pesci, and Scorsese, were born.The film follows middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta (De Niro), a violent, insecure man who has become obsessed with not only the sport and art of boxing, but controlling everything in his life. He marries a young women named Vicky (Moriarty), and is coached and assisted greatly by his brother Joe (Pesci). Upon marrying Vicky is when Jake's real insecurity and paranoia unfolds. He is constantly fearing that Vicky is seeing other men behind his back. One day, she comments that the boxer Jake's about to fight is a young, limber, good-looking guy who might get the best of him. Before Jake can even consider the other two facts, he stops and lectures her and asks why she calls him ""good-looking."" When it comes to fighting the guy, Jake assures he'll never be called good-looking by anyone for a long time.Main writer Paul Schrader, who also worked on other Scorsese films such as The Last Temptation of Christ and Taxi Driver, does a brilliant job of giving these characters, not only descriptions and stories, but long, healthy monologues that never become routine or laborious. My personal favorite scene is when both Jake and Joe are discussing personal matters while one is trying to fix the Television. The scene goes on for over four minutes, but the dialog is crisp and nothing shy of gripping. This scene is crucial to the plot because it shows Jake's insecurity consuming him and virtually eating him alive. Who can you trust when everyone looks like an enemy? The film is heavily stylistic as well, probably Scorsese's most to date. If anything should be praised, it's the experimental shots Scorsese uses. There are tracking shots that show depth and space, sometimes distorting it, like during the fight scenes, a delightful and rare coherency to the relentless and bloody combat sequences, that are gritty and brutally realistic, and the high contrast black and white further evokes depression and melancholy emotions to the film.This is a beautifully made film in every sense of the word. It's a deep, involving character study on a character we can't stand to look at sometimes. The third act focuses on where LaMotta's nervousness and insecurity got him in life; an ungrateful, cocky, intolerable, narcissistic brute that feels entitled to anything and everything. Yet again, this is a story from Scorsese about short lived glory. Where a man's inner demons and personal conflicts further bog him down to where he becomes unable to function normally. We've seen it before, but every time we do, it seems as if it is told in a richer, more complex way.With all this talk of style, emotion, characteristics, and backstory, let's not forget about another very important element; the rich performances. De Niro is superb, showing passion, charisma, and dedication - all the traits which have lead him to be called ""one of the greatest actors of all time."" Pesci shows great control whenever he's on screen, also brewing his trademark animalistic behavior that has made him instantly recognizable and the subject of many peoples' praise. But let's not forget some side characters that have, over the years, gotten the cold shoulder. Frank Vincent, one of Scorsese's regulars, plays Sal, one of Joe's local connections with the mob in New York. Vincent has been in both Casino and Goodfellas as a supporting character and has never drummed up acclaim of his own. Here, he is spot on perfection, and somewhat underdeveloped and underutilized.Another performance that hasn't garnered enough fame is Cathy Moriarty as De Niro's wife. She is in a harsh position, like most women in Scorsese's films. She is strong, capable, and commendable in her efforts to break free of never-ending torment and fear caused by her husband.Raging Bull is absolutely extraordinary filmmaking, from a director that was hesitant about creating the film in the first place. I'm sure he never thought the film would amount to much, but it has already earned a spot on the National Film Registry, two Oscars, and a place on AFI's list of best films. I'd say it was a worthy gamble, and a lifesaver on Scorsese's part.Starring: Robert De Niro, Cathy Moriarty, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent. Directed by: Martin Scorsese.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Raging Bull: Scorsese's best AND de niro's best,"What can we say about the movie that already hasn't been said. I always believed that the movie should be better than it's story. Raging Bull had no story, yet it is the best movie ever made. After the first two godfathers, Raging Bull is definitely the best.
De niro, whose career is better than all the other actors, with films like The Godfather Part II, Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, The King Of Comedy, Once Upon A Time In America, Goodfellas, Heat, Casino and recently Joker, and yet Jake La Motta in Raging Bull is his best performance. He even got an Oscar to back my statement. The method acting crossed another height with this movie. De Niro gained 60 pounds(don't know how much that is but sounds and looked heavy) for this role and became a semi professional boxer. So, yeah, this is his best performance.
Martin Scorsese, the best director of all time with movies like, Taxi Driver, The King Of Comedy, Goodfellas, Casino, The Wolf Of Wallstreet, Shutter Island, Cape Fear, The Departed, Mean Streets, The Aviator.....

Excellent Film? Yes. Scorsese's Masterpiece? No.,"I'm resistant to the many claims that ""Raging Bull"" is Scorsese's masterpiece. It's certainly excellent, but I think at least two of Scorsese's films on either side of this one -- ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" -- are better.Robert De Niro is truly impressive as Jake LaMotta, but, as so often happens with these biopics, the character he's given to play isn't all that interesting. Once he establishes that LaMotta was a boorish, abusive lout, the character has nowhere to go, and when I hear people praise De Niro's performance now, I almost always hear them talking about the weight he gained to play the role, not the performance itself. Joe Pesci gives the performance to watch in this film as La Motta's bullied little brother. He brings the film whatever emotional center it has. And Scorsese, who can sometimes do wonders with female characters, doesn't do so here; Cathy Moriarty's put-upon wife is window dressing.What the movie does do well is provide a pitch-perfect illustration of what the American dream is to some people and what they're willing to sacrifice on the way to attaining it, and it does so with sterling black and white cinematography and cracker jack editing from Scorsese's long-time collaborator, Thelma Schoonmaker.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Masterpiece. De Niro is an acting God....simply magnificent.,"Robert De Niro is probably one of the greatest actors ever. In this movie, he solidifies that statement, with gritty realism. Based on Ex-Middlewieght Champion Jake la Motta's life, the film chronicles the rise and fall of his boxing career, as well as his ups and downs in personal life. De Niro has given us one of the most powerful performances ever. He deserved the Oscar he won in 1981. De Niro is also a hard worker. I mean, he would put on weight and wear a fat suit to keep his character real!! An excellent example of acting is when La Motta accuses his brother and manager for sleeping with his wife. The dialog is fantastic, and the energy provided by De Niro is dynamic.I understand that De Niro was helping director Martin Scorcese with drug problems during production. That's called determination. He worked so hard on the film that eventually he got rid of his drug problem. Sure, this has Scorcese-style over it, but not like Taxi Driver (another classic). This movie has a completely different feel over it, it's not feel-good and inspirational like Rocky, but rather, a realistic and tragic downfall that leaves us speechless. The fights scenes are also well filmed and edited.Scorsese shot the film in black and white, beautifully portraying a certain era of misery and depression. The music is also good, whenever I hear the theme from Raging Bull, I get watery-eyed.But of course, De Niro is not the only one whose good in acting. Cathy Moriarty gives a great performance as the abused and misunderstood wife, and Joe Pesci is just superb as La Motta's brother, Joey. Nevertheless, it is De Niro who still makes it to the top.Overall, the film is a fine and iconic example of film-making art and will get better as time passes. It will stand the test of time and will still remain triumphant. Simply put, a excellent movie which will never be forgotten.9.91/10 Delton.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
...Unprecedented,"If I had to describe this movie in one word, that word would be 'striking'.The world is crazy, and for the time being, it's only going to get crazier. When it gets to be too much, I sit in my bed, turn off all external stimuli, and remind myself that I have somehow, some way gotten to live at a place and time where I can watch movies like Raging Bull.I kick myself for not having seen this sooner. It can be argued that Scorsese has made more great films than any other filmmaker, but this is his greatest. It is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. De Niro delivers his best-ever acting job, and the other actors play their parts, but this is Scorsese's vision through and through.It is based off the story of Jake LaMotta, a former middleweight champion boxer famous for his toughness and turbulent life outside the ring, but it does not fall victim to any of the typical fallings of 'true story' movies. There is no crass sentimentalism or pseudo-wisdom. It is filthy, violent, experimental, and operatic.Many of Scorsese's movies are based off real events or people, but none feel as original and dynamic as this film. Had I never heard of LaMotta, I'd be likely to say he was a fictional character made up by Scorsese. Without changing anything about the man's life, Scorsese has made it his own.If a pirate kidnapped you, stuck you on a deserted island that somehow had electricity and a DVD player, and held out every Scorsese movie ever made, asking you to pick one... choose Raging Bull. This is prime Scorsese. No one else would even think of attempting a film like that. Scorsese mends the very boundaries of art to his will.Who other than Scorsese would stop the film midway through to speed ahead five years not by a means of a simple time skip but an elaborate montage contrasting highly stylized boxing action with lighthearted shots of the LaMotta family that are the only colored parts of this film.Yes, the film is in black and white, and it is better for it. Intense films are better in black and white than in color. While I don't agree with those who say film as a whole is better in black and white, the modern black and white films I have see have looked better than almost any color films. The sorts of directors who would consider making a black and white film long after the medium went out of style know when it's appropriate and when it enhances the experience. For reference, see Schindler's List and Memento By the way, I would have loved to see a black and white MM:FR. It would probably be one of my five favorite films of all time.As for this film, it is firmly in my top 50. Maybe it'll even make it into my top 30. It's one of the greatest films of the decade. Note the contrast between the ring scenes and the outside-the-ring scenes. The ring scenes are stylized and electric. They pull out all the tricks in Scorsese's toolbox, and if there's one thing Scorsese is best at, it's drawing from everything done throughout the history of cinema while adding his own tricks, so that toolbox is mighty full. The boxing scenes in Rocky are fun, but they are child's play compared to this. The fights are atemporal. Time slows down and speeds up with the flow of the fight. It's much more like what is happening inside the fighter's mind than what is physically going on in the ring. Also present are the bright flashes of old-fashioned cameras, which Scorsese would once more rely on in The Aviator. Again, LaMotta's mental state during these fights make the bulbs stick out more than they otherwise should have.The outside-the-ring scenes, however, utilize long takes. If it weren't so gritty and profanity-laced, I might be fooled for a couple minutes into thinking I'm watching a Woody Allen movie. When the film snaps back to the ring scenes, it's both startling and exhilarating.As a piece of filmmaking, Raging Bull is unparalled. It's a marvel to watch. This is a film I'd love even if I had to listen to it in an unknown language. It also avoids Scorsese's 'weakness', if you can call it that, which is overemphasizing technical and stylistic marvel over genuine emotion. Here, technical side of the film, as well as the film's lofty, epic ambitions, flow perfectly into its emotional core.This film left me stunned and astonished. Perhaps the word masterpiece is used too often these days. I'm indifferent on the issue. But even if it is, this is one of the films truly worth of that lofty title. In many ways, it is the pinnacle of American filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stunning and Brilliant,"Raging Bull is stunning and it is indeed a masterpiece. It features the best performance ever given in any film and of course I'm talking about the greatest actor film has ever seen Mr. Robert De Niro. I wouldn't call this Scorsese's best work (I consider ""Casino"" to be his best) but it certainly ranks up there among the best. The acting, the story, the cinematography, the score, the directing, and the editing are all top-notch. The minute this film begins you just get so involved with the story and with the characters that can't take your eyes off it for the entire 2 hours and 9 minute running time. Raging Bull is a must see, it isn't boring, it isn't Scorsese and De Niro's worst work (far from it). This film is a stunning, brilliant, breathtaking masterpiece. I won't say anything else about the film because well, the film speaks for itself. See it, and then see it again!Final Grade: 9/10",,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic Film!,"Raging Bull is one of the best movies Martin Scorcese has made. This is also one of the best dramas I have ever seen. I think it deserved more than the two Oscars it won. At least Robert DeNiro got his well-deserved Oscar. Despite this film being about a boxer and that there were boxing scenes in this movie, this movie is not a sports movie.This movie is very much about a guy, Jake La Motta, who is one of the best boxers out there. Despite the unrealistic boxing, this movie shows what kind of character Jake is. It shows how he is emotionally unstable and how he destroys the lives of the ones he loves including his brother and wife.The acting is just out-of-this-world. This is the finest acting performance I have ever seen Robert DeNiro do. Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty deliver very strong performances as well.This movie shows why Martin Scorcese is one of the greatest directors ever in cinema. He proves that by making movies such as this and Taxi Driver.Overall, I really loved this film even though I am not a fan of black and white. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the Greatest ever,"There's a saying that a bad movie never feel short enough and that a great movie never feel long enough. This movie is great and even at 2 hours and 9 minutes it never felt slow. It is about one time middle weight champion Jake LaMotta it is a biography and a character study. We see a man that is a product of his environment, his outlet for what this environment has created and his eventual downfall, possibly because he never truly escaped his environment, and finally, eventual self realization.What we see in this movie is that Jake LaMotta is indeed a product of his environment. He came from a volatile environment one where violence is common. A lot of his problem is faced and handled through violence whether it be dealing with his wives or his brother. From what we know now it is safe to assume he and his equally volatile brother learn this behavior from their father. Jake has an outlet for all this rage, boxing. He's a ferocious fighter who would willingly kill an opponent if given the opportunity. One fighter was treated ferociously because Jake's wife commented on him being good looking. As for the way he treats his wife, Jake treats her as the classic Alpha Male to the extreme. He is possessive and jealous, paranoid to the extent that he always has to know why she talked to certain men and who they were.Jake's environment is also filled with ""wiseguys"" and he tries to distance himself from them, but his brother joey is friendly with them. As a matter of fact so was his wife, Vickie. We would see that even though in his boxing career he tried to stay away from the mob he could not completely and it almost prevented his chance at a championship. In the end even though he never became a 'wiseguy' he acted like one and it would bring about his downfall.Martin Scorcese's direction is crisp and brilliant. He knows when to move the camera to make the film look like it had tremendous kinetic energy and he knows when to just allow the camera to stand still and let the actors act and the story unfold. The script, particularly in the case of Jake, does not divert to other things. Every word spoken by Jake tells you about Jake. And every word spoken by Jake is that of a man who is volatile, unpolished, domineering person, who believes he must have things his way.The acting is superb, Robert DeNiro as Jake is brilliant. We see the volatility. When he paces while angered he seem to be a caged untamed animal looking both to escape and to pounce on whoever is foolish enough to get near him. Joe Pesci is great too. Long has he been seen as just a minor player in the Deniro/Scorcese movies but in truth he is as important a member as the other two. This was Cathy Moriarty's first film and she too was brilliant it is very surprising when you consider that she was twenty at the time.Overall this film truly deserve all the accolades that it has received. It is a great film, brilliantly directed and acted, that shows how his environment shapes a man and how it affects his life and people around him.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A teach for our life,"As Deniro said in the movie first you reach the top of the mountain and the you fall.This man he had everything ,he was a champion he had a divine woman a lovely family .He tried hard to win all this but in the end he acted with no thought and in a moment he lost everything.The story show as that if we are not grateful of what we have then we don't understand the value of what we have.And if we don't know what we have we can loose everything in a moment.Also if we act with anger and with no self-restraint we can harm our self and the people we love.The only way to fix this situation is the forgiveness.If De Niro would ask sorry from his brother who was injured by him ,then his brother would forgive him and he would safe him from his upcoming downfall.This is a good lesson of life especially for our young age.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The perfect film about a man's self destruction.,"This is one of the most beguiling and emotionally upsetting films about a violent man's self destruction i have ever seen.Martin Scorcese's masterpiece is like a violent 'Life' magazine turned three dimensional.The fights that Jake La Motta has in the Boxing Ring with Sugar Ray Robinson are filmed like brutal stormy images in Hell.Robert De Niro would not turn in a performance like this until 1991's Cape Fear. His Jake La Motta is mesmerising from start to finish. Now and again i think about that terrible sequence where La Motta is facing his shadow against a Jail Cell Wall, then starts beating his fists in a rage and screaming 'why' at himself. Lots of people always remember that scene.Plus the moment where La Motta lets himself be beaten to a pulp by Sugar Ray Robinson is the turning point in the whole film. The character's downfall is horrible to watch both mentally and physically but that is the essence and power of this savage and brutal story.Special mention must go to Joe Pesci as La Motta's brother Joey, who does well as the alienated sibling who ends up abandoning Jake because of his terrible assault on him for suspecting an affair with Jake's wife Vicki.See this film. It is a Masterpiece.Ten Out Of Ten",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Raging  Bullshit  Indeed,"First Mean Streets then Taxi Driver then this. Martin Scorsese is defiantly the most overrated director in history and De Niro is just a terrible actor. The Academy awards must have been high on something that year to give De Niro an Oscar for gaining weight. He was supposed to win an Oscar for best 'acting' not for best weight gainer of the year. People who don't see that must need some help. I agree with STAN39520. It should be burned (along with Taxi Driver), and if anybody else directed this or stared in it they would pay no attention to it. So what makes Martin Scorsese great, huh! To me, the only great films hes ever done are 'Cape Fear', 'The Aviator', 'Casino' and the 'The Departed'. I really felt like i was doing a sinful thing watching this piece of crap! One of the greatest films of all time they say, one of the 'worst' films of all time. A boxing film with hardly no boxing in it.I think the only reason why Scorsese made this film is because of Taxi Driver losing to Rocky at 77 academy awards. I bet he said i can do a better boxing film than Rocky. Sorry Marty, Rocky won best picture, this and Taxi Driver didn't. 0/10 Awful",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a Film!,"""Raging Bull"" is easily the greatest Scorsese film, as well as one of the greatest films ever made. It should have nabbed the Oscar for Best Picture.Robert DeNiro stars in his second Academy Award-winning performance as Jake LaMotta, the factual boxer-turned-seedy nightclub owner. The film is really divided into two parts. The first part of the film focuses on LaMotta's rise to the top in the boxing arena. It also serves as an exposition of the characters, introducing us to LaMotta's future wife, played by Cathy Moriarty, as well as his brother Joey, played exceptionally well by Joe Pesci. There's especially a lot of foreshadowing of future conflicts in th story. The fight scenes are brutally realistic, and certain shots serve as perfect showings of the raging bull that was LaMotta. The move to shoot the film in black-and-white was key, being that it makes the film age better and rely on the older, better tricks to be great.The two parts are really separated by a montage of colored home videos showing the growing relationship, marriage, and early parenthood of LaMotta and his stunning young wife.The second part is the place where all hell breaks loose. The bull begins to rage, isolating himself first from his brother and then from his wife, both due to her unhappiness and promiscuous nature. The dialogue in this part of the film is perfect, revealing the characters all to the audience for what they truly are.The acting is the real key to the film. DeNiro gives the best performance of the film, portraying LaMotta in a realistic and effectively brutal manner. Pesci and Moriarty, both of who earned nominations for Supporting Oscars, are superb as supporting players in the stellar plot. The cinematography and costumes also perfectly convey the time and setting of the film, which is set mostly around the time of World War Two. It's a superb film, and one of my all-time favorites.I'd recommend this film to anyone age fifteen or older, male or female. This is due to typical Scorsese pervasive use of the f- word, extreme violence as times, explicit sexual content, and a movingly brutal plot. Still, for people who fit into the above-mentioned category, see this film as soon as you can! Note: (recommendations) If you enjoyed this film, you may also enjoy ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Mean Streets,"" ""Goodfellas,"" and ""The Godfather: Parts 1 & 2.""",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

His highs and lows are so interesting, so confusing and so disturbing. 'Raging Bull' which is widely regarded as a Cult Classic, is a film that carries a lot of respect. Scorsese's direction is, WOW!Coming to the acting department, Robert De Niro ain't known to be a Legend for no reason. His performance is emotional, so emotional it becomes haunted after a while.

Scorsese once again chose to show biography of a boxer Jake La Motta, which is brilliantly portrayed by De Niro, who besides fighting inside the ring fights another battle with his own paranoia. truly an Oscar deserving performance by De Niro. just wondering how can Scorsese missed out Oscar. Joe Pesci also played his part well as La Motta's brother. Film shows various aspects of paranoid behavior in daily life and its effects on lives of different people... even on the lives of people living with paranoid cases.IMO... so far both De Niro's and Scorsese's BEST.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Brilliance...sheer brilliance.,"And that's the best way to sum up this breathtaking film. Not only does Robert De Niro give his absolute best performance of his career, but Scorsese's direction is perhaps the greatest of his storied career as well. This film manages to strike a nerve with the audience and come off as incredibly unique because of not only the films different take on the classic narrative structure, but the gritty black and white add a sense of surrealness to the entire picture, making it seem like a gritty nightmare. The boxing scenes are probably the greatest to ever be photographed, and perhaps the most brutal. Joe Pesci chimes in with HIS best performance of his career as well. However, make no mistake, while this is a brilliant piece of art, it's still not the best boxing film to ever be made; that honor goes to Rocky. I will however say, that this is perhaps the best movie to ever be made ABOUT a boxer.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Boxing Fanatics , watch and learn from this classic","There is such an ambience in this film reminiscent of the great Charlie Chaplin, because what we did not hear from him, we understood through his expression and gestures.

As a boxing fanatic myself I have always wondered about the fall and rise of many boxers knowing that many of them , if not all , are from rags to riches. Dare I warn that this film is not like Rocky at all, so spin your expectations in another direction and let this film get into you, like it did with the heart of the viewer.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Well..... This is a ""film"" that definitely lives up to it's title. It's nothing but a load of bull!","""Raging Bull"" (1980), this ""movie"" is nothing but a rip-off of the ""Rocky"" films. Now, I understand that there are movies out there that follow the same formats in genres. There are other sports films, including boxing films, that I do enjoy. Unfortunately, ""Raging Bull"" is a cheap ""Rocky"" knockoff. Why do people like this ""movie""? This ""film"" has an uninspired and boring story, terrible acting, boring sets/locations and a generic predictable soundtrack. The story, or some sort of resemblance of, is about an aspiring boxer that's struggling with his career and his personal life. Hmmm, I wonder where I saw that before? Oh yeah, the ""Rocky"" films! Aside from the bad cliched underdog story in ""Raging Bull"", this ""film"" is seasoned with predictable scenes, boring dialogue and more! Another stupid thing that they did with this ""movie"" is that they converted it to black and white. Keep in mind, there are a lot of black and white movies and TV shows that I enjoy, but making this ""film"" black and white adds nothing to it. If anything, it just makes it all the more dull and unappealing. That's a good word to describe this ""film"", unappealing! There are some other words I'd prefer to use, but I'm trying to keep my reviews PG rated. I wonder if this ""movie"" would be somewhat better in color? Maybe so, but not by much though. Now for the acting in this ""film"", it's a total joke. All of the actors and actresses give terrible performances. However, the only ones that seem to be putting forth some effort are Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci. I'm starting to get the idea that Martin Scorsese tries to milk as much out of the same actors as he possibly can. That's one of the biggest problems with Martin Scorsese, he's afraid to step out of his comfort zone and try something else. In the film industry, you must not be afraid to take risks. When you take big risks, you get big rewards. All of the sets/locations are dull and give the ""film"" a boring atmosphere. The black and white format just accentuated the boredom as far as the sets/locations are concerned. Finally, the soundtrack is simply generic and predictable, yet not memorable. Bad movies equal bad film soundtracks! The only good thing I can salvage out of this ""film"" is the special effects. Now, there aren't that many of them, but what little there are do work and they still hold up today. Remember, good special effects are no excuse for a horrible movie! ""Raging Bull"" is nothing but a jumbled mess. This ""movie"" was so bad that I almost screamed! Overall, I give this ""film"" a 1 out of 5 star rating which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. I'm starting to consider Martin Scorsese an overrated hack in the film industry. He hardly tries anything different and is afraid to take risks. Maybe that's why most modern movies and TV shows suck. There are film making idiots out there that are inspired by him and think it's okay to make nothing but reboot this and remake that! Luckily, I have some common sense and value the entertainment I watch and make. ""Raging Bull"" is one of Martin Scorsese's worst films, just stay away from it. If you want to watch a boxing film, stick with any of the movies in the ""Rocky"" franchise. Those are, without question, the absolute greatest boxing films/sports films of all-time! ""Raging Bull"" deserves to be rammed into the trash.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pure Scorsese,"This is THE classic Scorsese film. Shot in gritty black and white with some grainy color home movies thrown in for verisimilitude, the film gives us a frightening portrait of Jake La Motta, the sado-masochistic boxer.In telling La Motta's story, Scorsese dramatizes what jealously, suspicion, and petty-mindedness can do to a person. It is a terrible journey of self-sabotage.DeNiro gives the amazing tour-de-force performance that won him an Oscar. It is not a pleasant movie, but it does reveal the tragic flaws in human nature and even offers a slight bit of redemption.",,Anonymous,Biography

A masterpiece,"Watching Raging Bull is a truly exhausting experience. It is undoubtedly the most intense biopic ever committed to celluloid. The misogynistic and mascohistic Jake La Motta is a truly detestable figure, and hence some find it impossible to feel any emotional attachment towards him. Raging Bull is a very difficult film to love, but is easy to appreciate.The delicate details from Scorsese, make the fight scenes impassioned but also wonderfully hyperbolic. Scorsese's ingenious idea of putting smoke under the camera and using Hershey's chocolate for blood make the fight scenes completely incogitable. Thelma Schoonmaker's Oscar winning editing is especially salient in these scenes.In my opinion, De Niro's performance as Jake La Motta is the finest hour of his decorated career. 'Raging Bull' sees De Niro's ultimate immersion into 'The Method'. He gained 60 pounds and trained fervently so he could play Jake La Mota in the best possible way. As many have said before me, there are few moments in cinema that compare to a robed De Niro shadow boxing in slow motion to Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The blood-drenched, wife-beating world of Jake LaMotta.","Oh, you want to know what kind of film this is? This film was directed by a person who had just been on the verge of dying after a drug overdose. That is the kind of film this is.Comparisons between this movie and Rocky are inevitable, but the differences are obvious. This is a much darker, aggressive film: There is nothing emotionally rewarding about it. It is not ""almost too much"". No, it is actually obnoxious.Needless to say, not everyone will like it. It is not an emotionally attractive film, and many will find that they cannot relate to the incredibly violent, deranged character of Jake LaMotta. I would not be surprised if someone gave this movie a 1-star review because of how horrifically, frighteningly off-putting his personality is. In this film, he is both the protagonist and the antagonist.Perception aside, let's look at the real meat of this movie.
The co-screenwriter stated that the issue with this movie was that it ""has been done a hundred times before -- a fighter who has trouble with his brother and his wife and the mob is after him""Yet this is considered one of the greatest movies of all time by many, despite the fact that so many people are turned off by the subject matter. Why?This is, without a doubt, a filmmaker's film. If we take a detailed look at the cinematography, acting, editing, and dialog, you must ask the question: Honestly, Is there any question? It is, truly, some of the best you can expect to find in a movie. The technical skill put into this movie is mindblowing. This is why people like Roger Ebert are so captivated by this movie.It is hard to say that this movie is fantastic because it is incredibly difficult to watch and is, by vote, not entertaining. However, it is a technical masterpiece, and from beginning to end, it is an excellently produced movie.
For most, this is not a fun movie. It is, however, a fun movie to analyze. Not a bad pick if you are looking for a professional movie, but not something you'd watch with family.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perfection with a Fatal Flaw,"It is said that when the Amish women make a quilt they deliberately leave a flaw in it, under the worldview that only God could truly make something perfect.  Fortunately of course, the flaw the Amish women choose to leave is something trivial not fatal.It is this analogy that I think of after viewing Martin Scorsese's RAGING BULL.  The only problem is the flaw that Mr. Scorsese left in was akin to omitting an entire seam.  And the quilt unravels.RAGING BULL is masterfully filmed, masterfully acted, and masterfully written.  It is genius.  But it lacks sympathy for the characters.  The viewers are unable to make an emotional connection with the characters on the screen.  Watching the story (viewing the art) is only half the requisite.  Viewers should be allowed to experience the story (experience the art) via making an emotional connection.This was a fatal flaw.  Interestingly the consequential question we are therefore led to ask is -- was the story of Jake LaMotta worth framing on the screen?  Why or why not?  Very interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A modern classic, full of great detail and cinematography","Raging Bull truly was a great movie.  It is probably the best boxing movie of all time as well as DeNiro's probably best work (maybe Taxi Driver or Godfather II).  What I liked the most about this movie was the cinematography.  Scorcese in my opinion has just about the best cinematography of any director, excluding maybe Stanley Kubrick.  The superb filming is highlighted in the marvelous boxing scenes.  The screen can get blurry at times(intentional) and the camera moves quickly around the ring and whips around each fighter as they jab and punch.  The glorious black and white and eventual color also work out very well.  In the early and middle parts of the film, the movie is in black and white.  The setting and characters all look like they came directly from the forties, where these portions are based.  Even if you're not a boxing fan, you'll still be amazed.  If average fights were filmed the way the fights in the movie were, God knows I'd be watching more often.  And another thing: the pacing was brilliant.  How the very slow and agreeable scenes melded quickly with the fast paced boxing scenes.Overall, it's a great film with great directing, filming, acting, and everything.

No punches pulled. A raw masterpiece.,"It can be debated that this is the best boxing movie of all time. Never the less, Martin Scorsese delivers a masterful story based on Jake LaMotta's book. We get to see the rough, raw and rowdy story of LaMotta's(Robert De Niro)rise to the middleweight championship and his self-destructive exit from the glory and limelight. Great boxing scenes and unabashed emotional acting make this movie the masterpiece it is. De Niro is at the top of his game and probably plays one of his most memorable characters. Cathy Moriarty plays Jake's wife and kudos to Joe Pesci as Joey LaMotta, Jake's brother. Notable support from Nicholas Colasanto and Theresa Sadana.

"Great film, but overrated","I just saw this yesterday.  This is definitely one of De Niro's best performances, possibly better than his work in Taxi Driver and Cape Fear. De Niro deserves a 10/10 for his acting, but the plot seems to lack substance.  There was too much repetition of scenes in the film, and when the second hour begins, I couldn't help but say, ""haven't I seen a similar scene or heard the same line 6 times in the last hour.""  Some may feel that this repetition was essential to build-up the tension, but I think after the first hour, most educated viewers should have already gotten the point. Besides this detail, I thought the film was very good and I give it an 8/10. People should watch this if only to experience the superb job that De Niro and Scorsese have done.  Joe Pesci was very good too, but not as good as his role in the movie Goodfellas.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Awwww tight movie!,"Robert Deniro CAN act after all, granted this is an adult film, however it has a great storyline. Scorsese makes a great directoral debut. Deniro's voice is eerily similar to that of the late Jake Lamotta. The cinematography is stunning. It explores fame in a very human manner while still leaving a lot up to the audience to decide.Whenever these hardcore movies are attempting to tell some story, or portray some character, they face a major dilemma. How on Earth can they justify the amount of *****ing the viewers come to expect and pay for, and at the same time keep the story and the characters believable? Usually, this just does not work.But this does not mean that it never works. There is the odd film here and there in which the writers did find a plot device for justifying or even requiring frequent fornication. In Raging Bull the sex is not really happening, it is dreamt by our heroine (Cathy Moriaty) who is frigid when awake and, er, hedonistic in her dreams. Two psychiatrists observe her dreams using a special dream-watching machine. Needless to say, we join them.Special effects are pretty good for the era as well. The story is engaging and actually makes sense(some films make absolutely no sense). It's a great start of Martin Scorsese's career, and I love it.Unfortunately, Martin Scorsese is a lousy story teller, and so he does not develop this idea much further. Scorsese's strength is style, waggonloads of style, although one can easily blame him for overdoing it in some of his pictures.

De Niro at his best,"after 26 years i have just seen this, supposedly, great movie for the first time and it was just that. not only great, it was fantastic! the black and white filming just adds so much to the whole feeling, it really gets you in the atmosphere.i must admit i never even heard of jake la motta, and this movie actually made me want to learn more about the guy. i was on the net for 2 hours reading up on him after the movie! a troubled character to say the least, but not the least less remarkable. a great fighter with tremendous determination, self esteem and will to succeed. he was no angel, a really hard and troubled character and de niro really did a fabulous job! i never liked him so much, well not at least as much as pacino, but this really made me see why he is not rarely mentioned in the same sentence as the great al pacino.2 thumbs up for this remarkable movie, scorcesse the master-piece maker as always.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"If you like fight movies and Italians you'll like this graphic biography of LaMotta, and I emphasize ""graphic"".","I not only saw RB, but worked on it as a ringside photographer/extra for weeks. It was actually a long, tedious process, but interesting to watch DeNiro work everyday. I was the guy who photographed Sugar Ray after he pulverized LaMotta (DeNiro) in the ring. Was sitting there, waiting for another scene to set up when Martin Scorsese told me to get up and do what he said.Walk over to DeNiro, size him up in the camera, look down at the camera, then back up at him and hit the flash. It was a ""bit"" as they say in the business, one which I NEVER got paid one cent more for doing. As far as the movie goes, it was a vehicle for DeNiro and Scorsese. Just another fight movie to me.

De Niro's performance is better than the film itself,"Raging Bull will always go down as a cinematic classic not so much in my opinion for the film itself but for one of the most amazing acting performances ever seen.De Niro goes from a very fit healthy man to a very fat overweight loser. I doubt an actor has ever gone through so much for a film and this film just shows why the man is the most respected actor in Hollywood. As for the film , im not sure it actually is as good as i could have been but it's great to see Joe Pesci teaming up with Robert De Niro again  .According to the credits at the start of the Film Jake Le Motta actually had a say in the film and if that is so he is a very brave man because he comes across as a nasty piece of work that deserved every thing that came to him. I also think the boxing scenes are very poorly filmed, they are way over the top and as any boxing fan will tell you , boxing matches are nothing like what we see in the film. I would love to have seen this film made on colour because im not sure that the black and white worked as well as they would have liked but i'm sure most people will disagree with that. 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great fighting!,"Just the fight scenes alone make this great! I was just saying how much I loved Rocky II and that it was the best except for Raging Bull in the choreography department. What makes the Raging Bull scenes much better is that they're based on real fights. Like HBO's Tyson movie that just came out, but this one is the best.

Impressive acting and great directing,Raging Bull is definitely a worthy ticket to see. The film was very good and I can believe that it is one of the finest movies ever made. The acting was great. Of course like usual Robert DeNiro puts up an excellent performance and Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci also do a fine job. The fights in the ring were awesome. I like how Jake LaMotta gets a few punches and it looks like he was never even hit. What a great boxer! The dialouge was good and the black and white picture was very neatly picked out. The only negative I have for this film is that it got slow at times and kind of got a tiny bit boring but then it got back up to it's hype again and I still enjoyed it. Highly recommend it.Hedeen's outlook: 8/10 *** B,8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"brutal, intense Scorsese classic","This is a true film classic. It tells the true story of Jake LaMotta, a talented but emotionally unstable and self-destructive boxer. Robert DeNiro (Oscar for Best Actor) gives one of the great acting performances ever, ranking with Henry Fonda in Grapes of Wrath, Denzel Washington as Malcolm X and Gary Cooper in High Noon.Directed by Martin Scorsese, it helped to launch the careers of Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty and Theresa Saldana. It is one of the most intense and electric movies I've ever seen. The fact it was filmed in black and white adds to the film's gritty atmosphere. Raging Bull has been hailed by critics and moviegoers as the best film of the 1980's. Scorsese certainly deserved an Oscar for this one, although he lost out to Robert Redford (Ordinary People). He's the best director out there. Combined with DeNiro, one of the best actors in the world and both at the top of their games, you have a true masterpiece. 10/10",,Anonymous,Biography
Probably the greatest boxing film ever made,"Every time I watch Raging Bull I am more surprised than I was before.  This film is beautifully filmed, acted, directed and written.  Perhaps the pace is kind of slow, but it is a slow kind of movie, and LaMotta was a slow kind of guy.  These people aren't brainsurgeons, they don't speak well (unless rehearsed, which I think might have been a jab at On The Waterfront).This film is simply a joy to watch (well, if you are in the mood, I can easily see this film NOT being fun to watch at, say, a party).Anyway, the rise and fall of Jake LaMotta is not a grand tale, there is very little moral proseletyzing in this film (as there is in many boxing films). The characters are just who they are, warts and all, which is Scorcese's specialty.  This is not his greatest film, but it is a pretty damn fine movie anyway.I would say more, but I think that most of it has been said.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A Dark Look Inside The Primitive ""animal""","Absorbing, extremely popular fight film from a master Director. There is a sharpness to it all and it cuts like a pulsating, powerful jab. The expanded realism is indicative of a film craftsman and it has a personal stamp of authorship that separates the artist at play from those who play at art.The crisp black and white cinematography has a residing effect that is present in the indelible. For these strokes of style (best evident in the riveting ring scenes) this film is a poetic presentation of a very reprehensible person that is a fighting force of nature.Problem is, he can not separate that power from the professional to the personal and is a one dimensional destructive dynamo that causes a hurt whenever he is present. His brother is his fulcrum and when that breaks the fall begins.The film is not an easy watch because the Champ is not an easy fellow to like. In fact, he is a thoroughly unpleasant person. Like so many achievers, he is driven to the top at the expense of his humanity. He is a very ignorant brute as are so many of our successful people. That is sad and so is this movie. You never feel sorry for him but you do feel sorry for the human condition.That is the point. This is not a pretty picture and was never meant to be (one of the many reasons it was filmed in B&W).

Scorsese at his finest,"After watching an almost entire back-catalogue of Scorsese's work I came to the conclusion that 'Raging Bull' is the most impressive i have seen!I studied the film for my university course and it is so full of imagery and his visual style and use of sound are outstanding.Some students turned up their noses at a black and white film, to tell the truth i never even noticed until the family videos!

A great true story the relates to many gladiators of today. This film displays the life of Jake LaMotta and his downfalls while on the top of the boxing world. Sadly this is a common demise among many boxers that have & have not reached the pinnacle of the boxing world. All to realistic is the outside lives of a professional boxer, coming from a home of major dysfunction. Not only does Jake have to endure this; but Jake has to endure this while on his way to the top, but while he is at the top. The realism of this movie to display this unexpected ending. After a high point throughout the film ""what goes up must come down"" and so it does. When thinking of this I would finalize it by saying ""Jake, you should have gotten out while you were on top"".DeNiro and Pesci shows their acting skills that is a sample of what's to come. If you enjoy the wonderful display of acting by this dream cast duo, I would recommend watching ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"". Truly a great film!!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This movie is one of the greatest,"First of all, I'm a huge fan of De Niro and Scorsese. Especially De Niro, but I think the movies with De Niro becomes much better when Scorsese is directing it. Now to the point. When i first saw this movie I didn't think it was something special, but the second time. I really learnt to love it, This movie is so much more than just a boxing movie, its about in a short sentence, Jake LaMotta's life. De Niro potraited and acted Jake LaMotta so good that I got breathless. This movie don't have any flaws. Completely flawless, the directing is so beautiful done and the acting from Cathie Moriarty and especially Joe Pesci is great. This is Joe Pesci's at his best. And De Niro too. 4years earlier De Niro was staring in my favourite movie Taxidriver(best movie of all time) And that roll I think is a little bit better. Now back to Raging bull, The scene with De Niro when he is fighting with Joey(pesci) that acting is so beautifully done. The silence in the room, and the creepy feeling that something have got wrong is so fun to see.Why does this movie so good? Because you can watch it over and over again and still find things you never have seen before. And you don't see that a lot in movies, It's very rare. I really hope Bobby will do another movie with Scorsese. Because they are brilliant. Best boxing movie of all time without a doubt.

"Not just a great boxing movie, a great movie altogether!","Raging Bull is a poetic boxing movie based on Jake La Motta's autobiography. It details his rise to glory and fall from grace during the 40's and 50's. The central character is played superbly by Robert De Niro. In fact, De Niro established his name in legend when he gained an estimated 70 pounds during filming. Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci also perform at their absolute best as the wife and brother, respectively. Moriarty, with her deep, sexy voice, conveys a since of mental toughness that matches De Niro punch for punch. Pesci is his usual maniac self by showing amazing aggression and anger at times. But of course, none of this is possible without Martin Scorsese's direction. This is a true masterpiece, with black-and-white cinematography, an elegant soundtrack, and amazing costumes and props.

Most boxing movies focus on the boxing, showing the main character as a hero and how they get to their inevitable success. Raging Bull on the other hand, while showing La Motta's successful career, doesn't paint him as perfect. Far from it: he is shown warts and all.Scorsese shows quite well that what made La Motta great in the ring made him less great in his personal life. The intensity and brutality that made La Motta such a good fighter made him a less-than-perfect husband and person.Who better then to portray an intense, complicated person than Robert De Niro.

Shallow Characterization,"A character having flaws does not make for a complex character. We need to understand WHY they are flawed, why they are the way they are and how they think. Scorsese presents a character and doesn't say anything about him, there aren't even any messages or themes in the film. Again, he just shows us a still picture. If fact, a character who is entirely composed of flaws with no reason behind them is just a caricature. I also don't see what the fuss is about the performance of the character: he doesn't display any emotions other than ""some level of anger"" aside from a single scene.

BLACK AND BLUE IN BLACK AND WHITE,"It takes an actor, only the rank of Robert De Niro, to perfectly play the role of a violent, mercurial guy, who has no clue whatsoever of what he has to do with his life. Moreover, only an actor like De Niro can play the part of a well toned, energetic boxer, and also fatten himself up at the same time, to play the role of the same well toned energetic pugilist when all he cares about is glutting himself up and being slothful to the point of being indifferent. All the more, it takes a director, the caliber of Scorsese to make De Niro do all of these things.Scorsese is a master of disturbing movies. His movies are subtle, yet disturbing. In `Raging Bull', he has perfectly captured the deranged character of Jack La Motta, and has chosen the perfect person to enact this character. The movie is uncomplicated, but the fights are not. Each moment of La Motta's various fights seems to be crafted diligently and with perfection. The fights are violent, but not gory. But, the blood-spills of the fights, even in black-and-white seem quite distressing. Of course, De Niro acts fantastically, even, and especially during his boxing scenes.The black-and-white look of the movie, enhancing the subfusc nature of it, actually helps one, focus fully on the intensity of the characters, especially since everything else around them seem so livid and wan. As a matter of fact, colors are used symbolically by the artful Scorsese. The majority of the movie is pretty depressing. Hence, the movie is colorless, for the major part of it. However, the movie has a five-odd minute patch, which is shot in color. In fact, the colored' part, is the only positive part of the movie, which actually is a phantasmagoria of shots, showing positive things happening to lives of the Motta brothers.`Raging Bull' is quite a depressing movie; there is no doubt about that. But, it is one of those movies, which is ought to be studied' for its brilliant direction (especially the non-usage of color producing greater effect) and the acting, especially of Robert De Niro, who did seem to actually put a on lot of weight for the movie.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Poor Old Ordinary People,"Raging Bull often turns up at the top of critic's polls as one of the best films of the 80s (and sometimes of all time). Often there is a reference to how it is a vastly superior film to Redford's Ordinary People - which took home the Best Picture Oscar in 1980.  In my view, this is overstated. While Scorsese's virtuoso technique in Raging Bull is up there at the top of cinematic achievement, both the themes explored in the film and LaMotta's life story are not that compelling.  It seems to me that Redford's film is penalized for its deliberate pace and seemingly conventional shot selection. It would have been absurd for him to shoot the film in any other fashion. I feel these two films are of equal effect and value.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Raging Baloney,"I put off watching this movie for a long time, even after I'd seen many other Scorsese flicks. When he's on top, Marty delivers the goods. When he's not, it's a chore to watch. This movie is somewhere in the middle. It has received many accolades, but I didn't care for it.Frankly, I only stuck watching the film all the way through, was for the infamous line 'you f*&( my wife?'. I never saw the scene, I just heard the quote many times over the years.Well, it wasn't worth the wait. The movie was pretty bland. I was hoping for a lot of good fight scenes, but it's not a boxing movie. I was hoping for much drama, but nope, it's all about Jake LaMotta being angry, being a jerk. There's not much range here. And there isn't any original story arc or plot. So much stuff just jumps around, we're basically watching a highlight clip of the guy's life.There's a few gimmicks to boot. Shooting it in black and white was interesting, but doesn't add to or improve the quality of the viewing experience. And DeNiro's wait gain was impressive, but was it really worth it? I'm just glad he was able to drop the pounds after. He did the same weight gain for Untouchables, which was much better as his heavier self was featured in most of the film.This is not a movie that will enlighten you, or change you, or change your opinion of LaMotta, if you even had one. It's just there. I don't get the love for it, it's not outstanding in any way. Perhaps the only true highlight of the film is Joe Pesci's big time breakout performance. He really steals the movie. But he does become a victim of his own success, but playing the same character in every movie after this one.I would only recommend this movie for anyone who is a Scorsese completist and just wants to finish seeing all his flicks.

One of the Most Appropriately Titled Films Ever!!!,"What ""Raging Bull"" is for me stands up right there in the title. I don't dig on boxing and don't really get the whole appeal. Still, however, ""Raging Bull"" nearly uses the boxing as a subtext for the true story within the film, as I had hoped. It's about the psychological and emotional and physical fights that occur outside of the ring for Jake for his entire career. Robert DeNiro kicks some major butt in one of his best roles.

Raw and Powerful...DeNiro is a Beast,"Oh man, I had heard the hype, but nothing can prepare you for this monster of a movie. Let's get right to the point: this movie belongs to the DeNiro. From the opening credits, the audience knows that this guy is going to take us on a roller coaster ride, I mean it is that good. This is not an ordinary boxing movie, nor is it an extraordinary one; it is a character analysis at its best. Although the film's premise involves boxing, the overall thematic idea revolves around the human condition, in this case the self destructive DeNiro. Joe Peschi is also great, but not in a dominating kind of way, as he is primarily there to complement DeNiro; keep him dormant, although that becomes a daunting, if not impossible, task. Scorsese truly manages to capture the essence of the beast in DeNiro, and while I still think Goodfellas is his best film, Raging Bull is hands down the best collaboration between the two of them. This is an epic movie, I cannot stress that enough. No review can do it justice, as one cannot judge perfection. This is easily one of top ten greatest movies ever made, and that is an undeniable fact. Don't expect a subtle movie, because this is intense, in your face, entertainment. Watch the Raging Bull for the greatest performance of all time; watch it for the greatest collaboration of all time; just watch it end of story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

In short it is the story of a boxer and his rise to the top of the championship world as well as his inevitable fall from grace.When I first saw this movie I said ""Ah Robert Dinero and Joe Pessie playing the wise guys again"" and kind of just let the move flow by. I felt bored by it. So my initial thought was ""What's the big deal?"" The second viewing was hard for me as I have a considerable amount of films to watch but I pulled myself back to it and was very pleasantly surprised. Dinero works well with the part that he was given and truly pored himself into the role. Though the actors were not really going outside the box for their acting the intensity was very top notch. The movie ia a long one but you can get engrossed into the storyline. Shot in black and white it lends an element of age to the film that also gives it an extra plus in the art department.On the downside the movie can get away from you and leave you with that bored feeling if you arn't working to pay attention. I also have a hard time watching the anger on the screen that Dinero is so good at.In the end this is a movie that is worth it so long as you make sure to have the energy to go into it. If you work with this film you will definitely not be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
BEST FILM EVER,"This is the best movie of all time, everything is done great in it. The cinematography is amazing, the music is amazing, the lead role is probably the best acting performance of all time. I wish more people would appreciate this movie.I cant believe its 59 on the list of top 250, I can understand not being the best rated of all time ,but it should be in top 20 for sure, maybe even top 10.ITS so good.This movie is the best of Scorsese, he is the most underrated director of all time, never winning an academy award. ( not even for goodfellas, taxi driver or raging bull ). I hope his new film is as good as raging bull, i don't know if thats even possible, but it should get some sort of award, Marty has been skipped so many times. The first minute of raging bull is amazing. The music, the black and white,the slow mo. Greatest Movie Ever",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
DeNiro and Pesci are brilliant in this film,"In Raging Bull,  Robert  DeNiro gives, arguably, the best performance of his career, and Joe Pesci, this being his feature film, gives an amazing performance.  -  Easily, one of the top 25 movies of all time, and in my top 5",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Strong and passionate, knocks others out the ring","Jake Le Motta (De Niro) struggles through his real life whilst being trained hard to get his title shot in the boxing ring.From the wondrous Robert De Niro (The King of Comedy) reflection of Jake Le Motta to Martin Scoursese's (The Aviator) brutally artistic direction this is one fine boxing drama.Will Smith's Oscar nominated role as Muhammad Ali is one of the finest portrayals of a legend ever depicted on the big screen. His charisma and attitude reflects the boxing champion right down to his heart and De Niro betters one of the finest roles here by reflecting on the hard attitude of one of the most cruellest boxers of all time. Oscar Winner De Niro takes the cruel heart of Le Motta and portrays it in such a way that is deeply disturbing and riveting viewing. His attitude to be the best and be trusted is almost heart stopping.Juxtaposed with Joe Pesci (Goodfellas) and the pair create a memorable on screen relationship as brothers. Pesci's unsure character is a true depiction of real life in a portrayal of uncertainty and unwillingness to go against beliefs.In her introductory role Cathy Moriarty is a silent figure in the film, a remarkable debut performance that epitomises that feeling of loneliness and pain, which is a reflection on the film's important narrative.Opening with Jake in the ring preparing himself for a match we see a silent man standing in a foggy ring juxtaposed with a mournful song playing. This atmospheric introduction leads viewers into false pretence as the film is anything but beautiful. This is drama at its most brutal.Reflecting on marriages, rivalry and self pressure Raging Bull justifies its tag and the real life dealings of Le Motta. Never too long, Raging Bull fits so much into the two hours that when reviewing you will always find something new. And why wouldn't you want to review this film? Scoursese's direction here is possibly his finest. The opening scene is justice to that, as is the numerous boxing fights.Hard and gritty Raging Bull is a passionate film that reflects on important real life issues and with its sharp and skillful direction and performances, knocks all other sports films out of the ring.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"a classic, but not for the faint-hearted.","Raging Bull is one of Scorsese's best yet. Though out in 1980, I only just saw it after its recent re-release in London (and elsewhere)- and I can confidently say that it's classic film-making at its height. De Niro plays boxer Jake La Motta, a tormented human being whose own demons always seem to frustrate his life's ambitions of being the champion. The film is unforgiving in its portrayal of intense action and one is not ever allowed to feel sorry for La Motta. Yet it has soft moments too- for example the erotic sensuality of Cathy Moriarty's legs splashing the water in the swimming pool. Scorsese completely exploits the potential of black and white film. Two interesting things to note: first, La Motta himself was a consultant for the film; and second, there is a very interesting line from the bible at the end of the film which tells us a lot about what message Scorsese wants us to come away with. I was fascinated. But don't see it on a date!",,Anonymous,Biography
Incredible Editing,"When I first saw ""Raging Bull"", I had been video editing for about 8 years for WGBH-TV in Boston. Raging Bull not only validated every belief I ever had of what editing should be, but it also opened a ""new door"" for me. It showed me that a good edit pulls you in - not only to the story but makes you part of it. You live in the film and you're that ""fly on the wall,"" taking in all the facts and the nuances. I think one of the greatest actors with nuances has got to be Dinero - I just watch his face and then it's like you know what he's thinking - he's so good! What I learned from this film is to slow down, allow people to really look at what you're trying to show them - Dinero's subtle gestures are not lost in the edit. Don't overpower the viewer with fast cuts or explosive music - sometimes the natural sounds, like the pounding a heartbeat or the raspy breathing as a fighters pulls on ""everything he's got,"" are the most effective. Everything about Raging Bull is so great - the story, the writing, the direction, the camera, but the editing - the editing is inspiring - she allows us to really see what's going on and to hear it. The editor is such an incredible talent!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Absolutely stunning.,"This movie is an absoulute masterpiece, the greatest sports movie ever made. This might just be Scorsese's masterpiece. Raging bull is a sad and shocking true story that's put together brilliantly in this film. DeNiro is in his best role ever in my opinion. He portrays Jake LaMotta absolutely brilliantly and it's one of the greatest performances ever. The cinematography in Raging bull is outdated, especially in the fight scenes and it showcases just how brilliant a director Martin Scorsese is. Raging Bull's story has made a huge impact on me and it's one of my favourite movies ever.LaMotta could beat everyone in the ring. Everyone but himself.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
